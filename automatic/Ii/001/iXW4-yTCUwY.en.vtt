00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.960
 Now I will explain how to deactivate 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.000
 mouse acceleration made us all have 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.590
 come because it's some kind of 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.429
 acceleration in the resistors or in 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.740
 any other side 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.180
 for this I am going to leave you a program that 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.520
 it's called martha moxley cge 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.100
 in the description of the channel once 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.870
 downloaded we would have to leave talca 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.970
 if I'm going to apply it with windows 7 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.580
 because before it was operational but if 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.710
 had 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.510
 28.1 windows 8 would be exactly what 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.000
 same 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.870
 I do not take second 7 here we will see a 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 series of files 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.800
 this is worth the files where he puts the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.070
 125 percent 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.710
 50 200 of scale on the scale at which 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.510
 we have the monitor to know 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 what is we have 'the monitor 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.160
 we are going to start 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.850
 and we have to put in the search engine 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 screen settings 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.019
 we click where it changes the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.239
 screen settings and we have to 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.010
 click again where it increases or 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.729
 reduce the size of the third of others 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.280
 we think here and how I will be boiling my 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 monitor scale is 100% so 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.290
 that I would have to put the file 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 if you had a scale of 125 x 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.280
 you will have to put a scale of 125 and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.320
 so on 150% 50% as said 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.909
 before as a one hundred climb 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.249
 one hundred 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.399
 I would have to put the scale of 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.399
 weather 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.010
 this window will open 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.000
 that you simply take it we have to 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.720
 give run 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.160
 once executed it will install us and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.550
 we will have to restart the computer 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.940
 so this is the boss 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.770
 once started of computer we return to 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.200
 what we have downloaded to the folder 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.860
 marble yes 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.840
 once inside the folder we have to 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.939
 run 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.530
 the file that comes within the point 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.020
 weird that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.020
 that we move record point x 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.660
 and also let us open this little window 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.010
 what does or what is this mentality 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.099
 little window what you are going to tell us 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.170
 we tell ourselves not to show if 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.040
 we have some kind of acceleration or 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.709
 some kind of imperfection 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.010
 trying to get the pixels inside 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.440
 one 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.960
 or any history of that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.060
 It's worth as you are seeing it is not coming 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.900
 all black therefore this means 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.780
 that is not having 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.610
 without knowing that green as in this case is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.250
 exactly the same salty itself 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.760
 comes out green black is exactly the same 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.110
 so you can see how it would be a mistake 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.970
 this you do not have to do this is 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.480
 simply an example for Baleares 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.480
 how serious 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.120
 a goal that again 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.280
 we go to pointer options and in the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.349
 previous chapter explain why 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.410
 we played or why should we play 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.940
 us in the sixth tic and have des 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.240
 mercadal to action 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.050
 of the 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.040
 imagine you are worth yes no 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.550
 here in the sixth tic you will be seeing that 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.920
 all the red is coming out 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.960
 is all he is telling me is that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.790
 is trying to put the pixels inside 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.260
 from one that that district the chapter 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.900
 previous is exactly the same as what 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.730
 that explains with the theme of the spiral 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.790
 by then this is telling me the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.790
 program is activating me that my 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.790
 perception 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.790
 this little eyelash is this reason of moody's 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.989
 if we had now some kind of 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.940
 acceleration would leave us an eyelash 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.120
 American in red 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.120
 d 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.489
 I do not wear this 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.730
 and how it will be boiling this is worth what 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.849
 makes me just activate is that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.180
 against faster new york mouse me the 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.860
 accelerates even more things and I'm 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.569
 moving the mouse and every time I'm 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.950
 moving faster than the mouse time 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.199
 although I am following the same 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.799
 speed the mouse each time it will be 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:22.340
 moving faster 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.340
 under 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.699
 well it 's configured 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.069
 I have been left a little eyelash mother 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.550
 I'm here activated but I think it's a 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.550
 good program 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.550
 because how it activates the deactivated 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.550
 I think they have got caught 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.620
 exactly 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.370
 by then it would be found camps 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.370
 he has secured well 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 for anything is coming to us 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.620
 red and we have followed the steps 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.750
 previous ones that explain it also 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.680
 videos 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.780
 all we have to do is 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.790
 need to note scale monitor it 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.400
 100 125 800 50% and put the file of 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.070
 again we restart the computer again 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.480
 and this would no longer solve it basically 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.940
 is that sometimes there is sometimes 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.990
 file in case it gets caught does not get it 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.090
 well or whatever 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.560
 we entered the computer and it will have us 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.560
 to leave correctly
