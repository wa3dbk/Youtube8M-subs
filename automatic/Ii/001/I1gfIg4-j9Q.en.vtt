a car you want to buy it I said how much

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.550 
a car you want to buy it I said how much
he<00:00:16.920> said<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:17.490> hundred<00:00:17.520> bucks<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.090> said<00:00:18.300> sure

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
he said two hundred bucks I said sure

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.900 
he said two hundred bucks I said sure
I'll<00:00:19.560> buy<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.160> then<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:20.550> know<00:00:20.670> we're<00:00:20.820> there

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
I'll buy it and then we know we're there

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.900 
I'll buy it and then we know we're there
and<00:00:20.970> looked<00:00:21.210> at<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.430> said<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> needed<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
and looked at it and said it needed a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.900 
and looked at it and said it needed a
transmission<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.080> drove<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.800> home<00:00:25.920> couldn't

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
transmission so I drove it home couldn't

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.029 
transmission so I drove it home couldn't
get<00:00:27.119> over<00:00:27.150> second<00:00:27.750> gear<00:00:27.960> otherwise<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> would

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
get over second gear otherwise it would

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.939 
get over second gear otherwise it would
neutral<00:00:29.400> out<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:30.769> basically<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> brought

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
neutral out and then basically I brought

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.290 
neutral out and then basically I brought
it<00:00:32.099> here<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.430> started<00:00:32.700> fixing<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
it here and I started fixing it I

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
it here and I started fixing it I
probably<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.500> used<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.070> engine

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
probably would have just used the engine

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.580 
probably would have just used the engine
but<00:00:35.690> you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:36.930> thing<00:00:37.140> spent<00:00:37.440> its<00:00:37.530> life

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
but you know this thing spent its life

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.610 
but you know this thing spent its life
in<00:00:37.920> Texas<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.840> not<00:00:39.840> rusty<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.469> all

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
in Texas and it's not rusty at all

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
in Texas and it's not rusty at all
underneath<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.370> mean<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:43.050> of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
underneath I mean so it's just kind of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.490 
underneath I mean so it's just kind of
rare<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> find<00:00:44.570> I<00:00:45.570> went<00:00:46.230> through<00:00:46.410> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
drove it up here and transmission we

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.320 
drove it up here and transmission we
know<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.220> it<00:01:11.220> hasn't<00:01:11.369> been<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> Minnesota<00:01:12.119> too

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
know so it hasn't been a Minnesota too

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
know so it hasn't been a Minnesota too
long<00:01:12.540> at<00:01:12.960> least<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> roads<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.640> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
long at least not on the roads and I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
long at least not on the roads and I
knew<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.299> when<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> bought<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.110> it

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
knew that because when I bought it it

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.460 
knew that because when I bought it it
still<00:01:16.619> had<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.799> Texas<00:01:17.189> plates<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.470> he

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
still had the Texas plates on it so he

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.719 
still had the Texas plates on it so he
didn't<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.070> long<00:01:20.280> before<00:01:20.640> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
didn't have it here long before the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.010 
didn't have it here long before the
