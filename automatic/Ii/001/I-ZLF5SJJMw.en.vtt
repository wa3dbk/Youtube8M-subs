some<00:00:41.190> reflectivity<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.480> kind<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
some reflectivity to it as I kind of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.030 
some reflectivity to it as I kind of
spin<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.020> around<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> need<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.920> know

about<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> Signet<00:00:44.640> cue<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
about the Signet cue is that it is the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080 
about the Signet cue is that it is the
replacement<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> profile<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.969> gonna

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
replacement for the profile it's gonna

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
replacement for the profile it's gonna
be<00:00:48.210> even<00:00:48.300> five<00:00:48.690> millimeters<00:00:49.260> longer<00:00:49.710> than<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
be even five millimeters longer than a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.770 
be even five millimeters longer than a
profile<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> longest

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
profile so that is the longest

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.810

is that it's really a really stretched
out<00:01:07.860> rxq<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.299> that<00:01:09.510> more<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> more

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
out rxq so it's that more it's the more

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.380 
out rxq so it's that more it's the more
