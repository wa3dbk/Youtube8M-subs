00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
like so on the parchment paper and I'll

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.700 
like so on the parchment paper and I'll
give<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> little<00:01:08.189> space<00:01:08.520> between<00:01:08.760> each

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
give them a little space between each

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
give them a little space between each
beads<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.220> when<00:01:11.400> they<00:01:11.610> melt<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.750> there

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
beads so that when they melt down there

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.450 
beads so that when they melt down there
they<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.350> enough<00:01:13.530> room<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.890> spread<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
they have enough room to spread out so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.700 
they have enough room to spread out so
I'm<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.990> beads<00:01:16.229> out<00:01:16.439> of

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I'm going to do that the beads out of

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.179 
I'm going to do that the beads out of
the<00:01:16.799> bowl<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.920> flip<00:01:19.920> them

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
the bowl one at a time and flip them

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.480 
the bowl one at a time and flip them
over<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> place<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:21.509> down<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
over and place them down and then I you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
over and place them down and then I you
know<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:23.970> little<00:01:24.119> faster<00:01:24.390> as<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> go

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
know you get a little faster as you go

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.330 
know you get a little faster as you go
so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.530> think<00:01:26.369> I've<00:01:26.729> learned<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:28.189> put<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.120 
so I think I've learned to just put the
beads<00:01:29.610> down<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.350> beads<00:01:31.560> down<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
beads down all the beads down on the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.690 
beads down all the beads down on the
parchment<00:01:32.579> paper<00:01:33.079> and<00:01:34.079> I'll<00:01:34.979> flip<00:01:35.280> them<00:01:35.490> over

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
parchment paper and I'll flip them over

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.490 
parchment paper and I'll flip them over
so<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.600> holes<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.579> facing<00:01:38.579> up

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
so that the little holes are facing up

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.789 
so that the little holes are facing up

all<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> beads<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.759> holes

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
all of the beads with the holes

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.920 
all of the beads with the holes
so<00:02:10.230> they're<00:02:10.410> enter<00:02:10.680> separated<00:02:11.460> enough<00:02:11.970> that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so they're enter separated enough that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.480 
so they're enter separated enough that
when<00:02:13.110> they<00:02:13.290> melt<00:02:13.500> and<00:02:13.710> spread<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:14.190> there<00:02:14.370> be

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
when they melt and spread out there be

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.910 
when they melt and spread out there be
lots<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.850> space<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.480> also<00:02:15.990> left<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.680> space

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
lots of space I also left a little space

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
lots of space I also left a little space
on<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.160> leading<00:02:17.400> edge<00:02:17.640> because<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.210> ones

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
on the leading edge because the ones

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.060 
on the leading edge because the ones
that<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> put<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.380> leading<00:02:19.650> edge<00:02:19.800> on<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
that I put on the leading edge on the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.700 
that I put on the leading edge on the
last<00:02:20.310> batch<00:02:20.640> did<00:02:21.090> not<00:02:21.330> melt<00:02:21.570> down<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.170> well<00:02:22.530> as

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
last batch did not melt down as well as

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.040 
last batch did not melt down as well as
the<00:02:22.860> rest<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.940> pop<00:02:24.210> these<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.540> oven<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the rest so I pop these in the oven and

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.110 
the rest so I pop these in the oven and
ten<00:02:25.260> minutes<00:02:25.440> from<00:02:25.680> now<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.340> should<00:02:26.370> have<00:02:26.820> some

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
ten minutes from now we should have some

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.990 
ten minutes from now we should have some
more<00:02:27.390> one<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.560> we'll<00:02:28.980> see<00:02:29.190> what<00:02:29.310> happens<00:02:29.670> I'm

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
more one so we'll see what happens I'm

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.760 
more one so we'll see what happens I'm
going<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.630> leave<00:02:30.780> those<00:02:30.990> in<00:02:31.260> for<00:02:31.500> ten<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
going to leave those in for ten to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.320 
going to leave those in for ten to
twelve<00:02:32.040> minutes<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.640> we<00:02:32.910> should<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.300> some

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
twelve minutes and we should have some

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.090 
twelve minutes and we should have some
more<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.870> these<00:02:33.990> wonderful<00:02:34.470> Pony<00:02:34.830> beats

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
more of these wonderful Pony beats

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.600 
more of these wonderful Pony beats

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
dots and I actually I'm going to try and

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.380 
dots and I actually I'm going to try and
leave<00:02:44.040> them<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.370> for<00:02:44.610> less<00:02:44.760> time<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> first

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
leave them in for less time the first

leave them in for less time the first
batch<00:02:45.600> was<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.960> for<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.320> under<00:02:46.560> 12<00:02:46.800> minutes

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
batch was in for just under 12 minutes

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920 
batch was in for just under 12 minutes
and<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.520> batch<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.270> pull<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.630> at

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and this batch I'm going to pull out at

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.200 
and this batch I'm going to pull out at
about<00:02:49.590> eight<00:02:49.830> minutes<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> look<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
about eight minutes and have a look and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.310 
about eight minutes and have a look and
because<00:02:51.840> apparently<00:02:53.150> for<00:02:54.150> these<00:02:54.420> pony<00:02:54.990> beads

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
because apparently for these pony beads

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.470 
because apparently for these pony beads
if<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.310> leave<00:02:56.580> them<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.180> shorter

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
if you leave them in for a shorter

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.640 
if you leave them in for a shorter
period<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.810> time<00:02:57.870> they<00:02:58.500> will<00:02:58.710> spread<00:02:59.780> less<00:03:00.780> so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
period of time they will spread less so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.620 
period of time they will spread less so
they'll<00:03:01.800> be<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> little<00:03:02.220> tiny<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:03.390> little

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
they'll be a little tiny a little

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.230 
they'll be a little tiny a little
smaller<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.500> that's<00:03:04.920> what<00:03:05.250> I'm<00:03:05.400> going<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.000> try

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
smaller so that's what I'm going to try

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.880 
smaller so that's what I'm going to try
and<00:03:06.330> do<00:03:06.420> apparently<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.900> perler<00:03:07.260> beats<00:03:07.470> don't

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
and do apparently the perler beats don't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.470 
and do apparently the perler beats don't
work<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.190> way<00:03:08.520> it<00:03:08.670> doesn't<00:03:08.850> matter<00:03:09.090> how<00:03:09.270> long

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
work that way it doesn't matter how long

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.300 
work that way it doesn't matter how long
you<00:03:09.630> leave<00:03:09.780> them<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.380> or<00:03:11.040> what

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
you leave them in for or what

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.890 
you leave them in for or what
temperature<00:03:12.920> apparently<00:03:13.920> those<00:03:14.100> ones<00:03:14.900> they

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
temperature apparently those ones they

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.290 
temperature apparently those ones they
just<00:03:16.170> always<00:03:16.400> melt<00:03:17.400> down<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> same<00:03:18.060> size

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
just always melt down to the same size

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.850 
just always melt down to the same size
so<00:03:18.540> anyway<00:03:18.870> we'll<00:03:19.080> see<00:03:19.110> what<00:03:19.410> happens<00:03:19.710> with

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
so anyway we'll see what happens with

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.700 
so anyway we'll see what happens with
these<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.490> I'll<00:03:21.270> be<00:03:21.300> back<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:22.020> about

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
these and I'll be back in just about

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.620 
these and I'll be back in just about
eight<00:03:22.860> minutes<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.460> they<00:03:23.940> weren't<00:03:24.180> melted

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
eight minutes and they weren't melted

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.360 
eight minutes and they weren't melted
down<00:03:24.780> enough<00:03:25.140> they<00:03:25.380> still<00:03:25.650> had<00:03:25.830> divots<00:03:26.130> in<00:03:26.250> the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
down enough they still had divots in the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.000 
down enough they still had divots in the
top<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.270> left<00:03:27.900> them<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.350> in<00:03:28.590> fact<00:03:28.620> this

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
top so I left them and in fact this

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.930 
top so I left them and in fact this
batch<00:03:29.430> took<00:03:29.850> about<00:03:30.090> 15<00:03:30.690> minutes<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.760> there<00:03:32.760> you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
batch took about 15 minutes so there you

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.640 
batch took about 15 minutes so there you
go<00:03:33.120> it's<00:03:33.420> finished<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.810> let<00:03:33.990> it<00:03:34.080> cool<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.590> then

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
go it's finished I let it cool and then

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.530 
go it's finished I let it cool and then
I'll<00:03:34.920> pop<00:03:35.220> them<00:03:35.460> off<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.910> they<00:03:35.970> actually<00:03:36.120> just

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
I'll pop them off and they actually just

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.380 
I'll pop them off and they actually just
slide<00:03:36.720> off<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.230> parchment<00:03:37.770> paper

beautifully<00:03:40.130> they've<00:03:41.130> probably<00:03:41.340> cooled<00:03:41.910> for

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
beautifully they've probably cooled for

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.720 
beautifully they've probably cooled for
five<00:03:42.390> minutes<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.980> see<00:03:44.190> while<00:03:44.400> they<00:03:44.520> just

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
five minutes and you see while they just

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.780 
five minutes and you see while they just
slip<00:03:45.060> right<00:03:45.090> off<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.720> parchment<00:03:45.960> paper

slip right off the parchment paper

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.190 
slip right off the parchment paper

unlike the craft map that you have to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.470 
unlike the craft map that you have to
