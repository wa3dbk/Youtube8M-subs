it<00:02:17.800> wasn't<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.340> funny<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.760> me<00:02:18.850> but<00:02:19.810> as

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
it wasn't that funny to me but as

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.110 
it wasn't that funny to me but as
someone<00:02:20.860> who's<00:02:21.130> watched<00:02:21.430> Forrest<00:02:21.790> Gump<00:02:21.940> and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
someone who's watched Forrest Gump and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.360 
someone who's watched Forrest Gump and
like<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.330> movie<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.870> would<00:02:23.620> recommend<00:02:24.190> his

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
like the movie I would recommend his

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.949 
like the movie I would recommend his
book<00:02:24.400> there's<00:02:25.390> some<00:02:25.510> things<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.750> don't<00:02:25.810> like

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
book there's some things I don't like

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.229 
book there's some things I don't like
about<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:27.489> reason<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.760> why<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.000> still

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
about it the reason I why I still

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.330 
about it the reason I why I still
recommend<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.470> simply<00:02:29.890> because<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.190> fact

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
recommend it is simply because the fact

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.309 
recommend it is simply because the fact
that<00:02:30.640> it's<00:02:30.970> closure<00:02:31.239> if<00:02:31.569> you<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.170> movie

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
that it's closure if you like the movie

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.840 
that it's closure if you like the movie
and<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.739> want<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> know<00:02:33.100> what<00:02:33.250> happens<00:02:33.580> after

and you want to know what happens after

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.840 
and you want to know what happens after
that<00:02:34.209> you'd<00:02:35.170> want<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.470> read<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> book<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:36.489> love

for me in that it's written exactly how

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.949 
for me in that it's written exactly how
Forrest<00:03:03.100> Gump<00:03:03.310> talks<00:03:03.610> so<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.480> a<00:03:04.600> lot<00:03:04.810> of

he<00:06:23.699> gets<00:06:23.849> a<00:06:24.089> little<00:06:24.270> grumpy<00:06:24.389> I<00:06:24.930> guess<00:06:25.349> like

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:25.469 
he gets a little grumpy I guess like

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.629 
he gets a little grumpy I guess like
curses<00:06:25.770> a<00:06:25.800> little<00:06:26.009> bit<00:06:26.129> it<00:06:26.249> seems<00:06:26.490> out<00:06:26.610> of

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
curses a little bit it seems out of

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.100 
curses a little bit it seems out of
place<00:06:26.729> it<00:06:27.059> doesn't<00:06:27.180> seem<00:06:27.449> like<00:06:27.659> it's<00:06:27.839> part<00:06:28.050> of

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
place it doesn't seem like it's part of

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.499 
place it doesn't seem like it's part of
his<00:06:28.259> character<00:06:28.520> but<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:30.149> know<00:06:30.270> apparently

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509 
his character but you know apparently

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.389 
his character but you know apparently
that's<00:06:31.199> truly<00:06:31.559> who<00:06:31.800> he<00:06:31.949> is<00:06:31.979> it's<00:06:32.369> just

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:32.399 
that's truly who he is it's just

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.519 
that's truly who he is it's just
on-screen<00:06:33.149> we<00:06:33.689> didn't<00:06:33.899> see<00:06:34.080> that<00:06:34.110> in<00:06:34.499> the

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:34.529 
on-screen we didn't see that in the

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:36.170 
on-screen we didn't see that in the
interpretation<00:06:35.129> you<00:06:35.610> know<00:06:35.699> with<00:06:35.819> the<00:06:35.909> movie

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
interpretation you know with the movie

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.260 
interpretation you know with the movie
so<00:06:36.899> that<00:06:36.930> was<00:06:37.139> interesting<00:06:37.729> but<00:06:38.729> besides<00:06:39.180> that

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
so that was interesting but besides that

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.019 
so that was interesting but besides that
I<00:06:39.689> would<00:06:40.409> recommend<00:06:40.770> it<00:06:40.860> like<00:06:41.520> it<00:06:41.639> is<00:06:41.759> a<00:06:41.789> reign

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:42.029 
I would recommend it like it is a reign

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.019 
I would recommend it like it is a reign
a<00:06:42.059> book<00:06:42.360> you<00:06:42.749> know<00:06:42.839> for<00:06:43.020> twenty-two<00:06:43.439> cents<00:06:44.029> but

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.029 
a book you know for twenty-two cents but

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.670 
a book you know for twenty-two cents but
I<00:06:45.149> was<00:06:45.300> very<00:06:45.330> pleased<00:06:45.779> by<00:06:46.080> thumber<00:06:46.289> at<00:06:46.469> the<00:06:46.559> end
