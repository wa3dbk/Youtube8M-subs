00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
fight so that's a really good thing more

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.790 
fight so that's a really good thing more
fighter<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:40.600> good<00:02:40.810> fighter<00:02:41.140> entrances

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
fighter really good fighter entrances

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.330

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
appearances so appearances will be more

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.290 
appearances so appearances will be more
graphics<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.310> know<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> graphics<00:02:54.970> will

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
graphics like you know the graphics will

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.840 
graphics like you know the graphics will
be<00:02:55.660> improved<00:02:56.110> what<00:02:57.100> is<00:02:57.190> basically<00:02:57.580> saying

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850

here<00:02:59.250> yeah<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:03.459> next<00:03:03.640> thing<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:04.030> gameplay

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
here yeah so the next thing is gameplay

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.970 
here yeah so the next thing is gameplay
accessibility<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.410> one<00:03:05.530> gives<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.770> more

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
like strikes but with like really

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.430 
like strikes but with like really
complex<00:03:23.530> buttons<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:24.730> all<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.440> more

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
complex buttons and all that more

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.990 
complex buttons and all that more
complex<00:03:26.860> ground<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.489> from<00:03:27.670> this<00:03:27.820> your

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
complex ground and from this your

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.280 
complex ground and from this your
mechanics<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.750> what<00:03:28.900> I'm<00:03:28.989> reading<00:03:29.140> right

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
mechanics it's what I'm reading right

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.440 
mechanics it's what I'm reading right
here<00:03:29.650> so<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.760> seems<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.090> pretty<00:03:31.299> good

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
here so that seems like a pretty good

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
here so that seems like a pretty good
option<00:03:31.870> for<00:03:32.080> players<00:03:32.680> who<00:03:32.799> want<00:03:32.980> more

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
option for players who want more

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.140 
option for players who want more
challenge<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:34.049> UFC<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:37.290> better<00:03:38.290> roster<00:03:39.150> so

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
challenge in UFC a better roster so

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.370 
challenge in UFC a better roster so
basically<00:03:40.570> there's<00:03:40.840> gonna<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.019> a<00:03:41.049> hundred

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
basically there's gonna be a hundred

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.259 
basically there's gonna be a hundred
fifty<00:03:41.830> UFC<00:03:42.280> fighters<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:42.790> we'll<00:03:42.910> be<00:03:43.030> adding

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269
