00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:09.679
 this is a car that overturns 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.620
 worrying it's a model but that 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.120
 hurts the 2012 auto world 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.580
 obviously you early automobiles 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.160
 but there are also pedestrians who often 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.660
 dream of automobiles then zerotracas 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.190
 pointed at great tech asked 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.070
 builders what he was doing for the 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:31.910
 little pedestrians because I have citroen by 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:34.550
 example the citroen c4 which is precisely 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.170
 profile at the hood and the face 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.760
 before so that if there is a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.460
 shock with a pedestrian 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.320
 this one is projected on the hood and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.510
 cushioned by this one contrary to 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.620
 finish under the wheels of the car this 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.070
 which would actually be a lot more 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 damaging 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:01:20.450
 this is on a test bmw we think about it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:23.320
 connect pedestrians ignore if renault if one 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.570
 hump on the subject new clio iv 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.210
 remains leader in passive safety 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.680
 that in terms of pedestrian protection we have 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.940
 worked especially the front 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.520
 so that was a big job with the 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.830
 design the whole vehicle and dropped by 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.659
 report to clio iii of 4 cm so that's 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.560
 very favorable for shock shin shock 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.090
 hip after the hood and raised him 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.850
 compared to all the elements in the 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.530
 engine compartment to allow the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.090
 deflection of the head and before 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.330
 touching obstacles so what 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.090
 reduces injuries on them on 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.570
 pedestrians after we worked also 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.560
 on the steel beyond the crate so a 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.790
 new high-limit steels 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.290
 elastic which also allows us 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.960
 to have very good references in 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.370
 frontal shock and traditions of security 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.320
 requires 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.150
 volvo innovates for pedestrians with a 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.270
 Attention air bag system that makes the 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.270
 noise 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.810
 the proof in pictures and when we know 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.910
 maybe 185 pedestrians summer 2011 and of 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.980
 12000 were injured we say that this 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 would be nice if american life
