planted<00:00:04.470> about<00:00:04.560> 8<00:00:04.860> acres

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
planted about 8 acres

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.450 
planted about 8 acres
and<00:00:06.240> every<00:00:06.870> once<00:00:07.049> in<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.319> while<00:00:07.500> I'm<00:00:07.859> getting<00:00:08.189> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
and every once in a while I'm getting a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.170 
and every once in a while I'm getting a
skip<00:00:09.860> my

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
skip my

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.670 
skip my
I<00:00:12.300> change<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.110> stuff<00:00:13.380> they're<00:00:13.530> just

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:13.680 
I change this stuff they're just

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.410 
I change this stuff they're just
skipping<00:00:13.980> everything<00:00:14.640> nothing<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.150> working

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
skipping everything nothing is working

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.470 
skipping everything nothing is working
so<00:00:16.320> I've<00:00:17.010> narrowed<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.730> down<00:00:17.790> that<00:00:18.300> that

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
so I've narrowed it down that that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.840 
so I've narrowed it down that that
spring<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.320> there<00:00:19.620> you<00:00:19.860> can<00:00:20.040> see<00:00:20.369> right

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
spring right there you can see right

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.820 
spring right there you can see right
there<00:00:20.990> it

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
there it

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.930 
there it
it's<00:00:23.920> not<00:00:24.130> allowing

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
it's not allowing

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.540 
it's not allowing
enough<00:00:26.180> pressure<00:00:26.570> here<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:28.010> keep<00:00:28.190> it<00:00:28.430> engaged

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
enough pressure here to keep it engaged

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.240 
enough pressure here to keep it engaged
in<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.180> gears<00:00:29.480> that<00:00:29.720> are<00:00:29.779> inside<00:00:30.640> so

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
in the gears that are inside so

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.320 
in the gears that are inside so
I<00:00:33.340> don't<00:00:33.940> know<00:00:34.060> maybe<00:00:34.360> every<00:00:35.970> kind<00:00:36.970> of<00:00:37.120> every

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
I don't know maybe every kind of every

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.360 
I don't know maybe every kind of every
so<00:00:37.600> often<00:00:37.900> it'll<00:00:38.260> skip<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.860> that's<00:00:39.010> not<00:00:39.220> going

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
so often it'll skip and that's not going

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.040 
so often it'll skip and that's not going
to<00:00:39.460> be<00:00:39.610> good<00:00:39.820> because<00:00:39.970> everything<00:00:40.510> shuts<00:00:40.810> off

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
to be good because everything shuts off

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.340 
to be good because everything shuts off
shuts<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.070> corn<00:00:42.370> off<00:00:42.580> that's<00:00:43.090> the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
shuts the corn off that's the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.770 
shuts the corn off that's the
fertilizer<00:00:44.980> off<00:00:45.370> everything<00:00:45.820> just<00:00:46.090> stops

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
fertilizer off everything just stops

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.279 
fertilizer off everything just stops
working<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.219> I'm<00:00:48.640> gonna<00:00:48.879> I'm<00:00:49.870> gonna<00:00:49.930> continue

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
working so I'm gonna I'm gonna continue

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.189 
working so I'm gonna I'm gonna continue
to<00:00:50.469> run<00:00:50.739> because<00:00:50.980> it's<00:00:51.280> Sunday

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.920 

anyway<00:01:11.230> yeah<00:01:11.650> so<00:01:12.400> I<00:01:12.760> got<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.480> do<00:01:13.600> something

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
anyway yeah so I got to do something

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.460 
anyway yeah so I got to do something
with<00:01:14.110> that<00:01:14.350> thing<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:14.890> see<00:01:15.430> if<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:15.610> can<00:01:16.470> expand

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
with that thing and see if I can expand

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.290 
with that thing and see if I can expand
that<00:01:17.620> coil<00:01:17.980> back<00:01:18.310> out<00:01:18.580> again<00:01:18.760> I<00:01:18.940> don't<00:01:19.090> think

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
that coil back out again I don't think

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.510 
that coil back out again I don't think
it<00:01:19.570> turns<00:01:19.900> much<00:01:20.260> but<00:01:21.070> I'm<00:01:21.190> gonna<00:01:21.340> get<00:01:21.490> a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
it turns much but I'm gonna get a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.010 
it turns much but I'm gonna get a
screwdriver<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:22.270> there<00:01:22.360> I'm<00:01:22.480> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.720> twist

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
screwdriver in there I'm going to twist

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.960 
screwdriver in there I'm going to twist
it<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:23.800> that<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:23.980> get<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.220> little<00:01:24.370> more<00:01:24.640> pressure

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
it so that I get a little more pressure

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.860 
it so that I get a little more pressure
on<00:01:25.150> there<00:01:25.570> because<00:01:26.260> it's<00:01:26.410> actually

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
on there because it's actually

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.700 
on there because it's actually
coil<00:01:28.170> back<00:01:28.560> around

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
field and they fenced them off

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.820 
field and they fenced them off
hence<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.640> fence<00:02:43.910> grown<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.140> got<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.530> five

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
hence the fence grown so you got a five

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.339 
hence the fence grown so you got a five
acre<00:02:46.040> field<00:02:46.430> there<00:02:46.760> you<00:02:47.480> got<00:02:47.690> an<00:02:47.840> eight<00:02:47.989> or<00:02:48.019> ten

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
acre field there you got an eight or ten

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.440 
acre field there you got an eight or ten
acre<00:02:48.560> field<00:02:48.860> here<00:02:49.160> or<00:02:49.430> six<00:02:49.760> eight<00:02:49.910> eight<00:02:50.180> acre

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
acre field here or six eight eight acre

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.970 
acre field here or six eight eight acre
field<00:02:50.780> here<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.170> then<00:02:51.290> on<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.530> other<00:02:51.680> side

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
field here and then on the other side

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.890 
field here and then on the other side
you<00:02:52.640> got<00:02:52.760> another<00:02:53.030> one<00:02:53.269> so<00:02:53.540> it's<00:02:53.780> like

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
you got another one so it's like

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.930 
you got another one so it's like
patchwork<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:54.890> real<00:02:55.130> small<00:02:55.519> and<00:02:55.700> tight

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
patchwork in here real small and tight

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.390 
patchwork in here real small and tight
now<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.720> problem<00:02:57.230> is<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.709> take<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:58.100> fence

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
now the problem is if I take that fence

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.199 
now the problem is if I take that fence
row<00:02:58.610> out<00:02:58.959> it's<00:02:59.959> going<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.230> wash<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:01.160> I<00:03:01.970> think

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
row out it's going to wash and I think

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.059 
row out it's going to wash and I think
that's<00:03:02.420> more<00:03:02.630> or<00:03:02.780> less<00:03:02.840> why<00:03:03.230> they<00:03:03.500> actually

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
that's more or less why they actually

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.699 
that's more or less why they actually
fenced<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:04.819> off<00:03:04.970> the<00:03:05.209> way<00:03:05.330> they<00:03:05.510> did<00:03:05.780> because

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
fenced it off the way they did because

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.229 
fenced it off the way they did because
of<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:07.010> type<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.430> soil<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.940> amount<00:03:08.150> of

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
of the type of soil and the amount of

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.970 
of the type of soil and the amount of
water<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.720> runs<00:03:08.900> off<00:03:09.200> these<00:03:09.440> clay<00:03:09.709> based

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
water that runs off these clay based

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.530 
water that runs off these clay based
soil<00:03:10.099> it's<00:03:10.640> not<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:10.940> it's<00:03:11.150> sand

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
soil it's not like it's sand

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.929 
soil it's not like it's sand
this<00:03:12.870> clay<00:03:13.110> based<00:03:13.379> soil<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:14.010> wash<00:03:14.310> away<00:03:14.579> and

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
this clay based soil just wash away and

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.270 
this clay based soil just wash away and
get<00:03:15.209> these<00:03:15.360> huge<00:03:15.540> ruts<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.379> that's<00:03:17.040> another

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
get these huge ruts and that's another

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.759 
get these huge ruts and that's another
reason<00:03:17.519> why<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.790> do<00:03:17.939> a<00:03:18.090> lot<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.329> no-till<00:03:18.780> because

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
reason why I do a lot of no-till because

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.699 
reason why I do a lot of no-till because
you'll<00:03:19.980> end<00:03:20.129> up<00:03:20.310> with<00:03:20.519> rust<00:03:21.590> picking<00:03:22.590> her<00:03:22.650> up

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
you'll end up with rust picking her up

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:23.300 
you'll end up with rust picking her up
