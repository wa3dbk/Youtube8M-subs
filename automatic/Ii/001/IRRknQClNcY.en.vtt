lightweight<00:00:35.700> vehicles<00:00:37.100> today<00:00:38.100> we<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
lightweight vehicles today we have the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.360 
lightweight vehicles today we have the
cubic<00:00:39.570> which<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.590> result<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.190> their

cubic which is the result of their

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.290 
cubic which is the result of their
efforts<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> cubic<00:00:44.250> car<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:45.270> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
efforts and the cubic car is actually a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.779 
efforts and the cubic car is actually a
demonstration<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> technologies<00:00:47.430> we

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
demonstration of all the technologies we

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.930 
demonstration of all the technologies we
have<00:00:47.910> developed<00:00:48.390> over<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> last<00:00:48.989> three<00:00:49.320> years

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940
