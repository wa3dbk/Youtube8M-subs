to start to the lighting actually wait

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.389 
to start to the lighting actually wait
let's<00:00:37.249> see<00:00:37.339> if<00:00:37.429> I<00:00:37.489> guess<00:00:37.639> a<00:00:37.670> little<00:00:37.850> bit<00:00:37.969> there

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
let's see if I guess a little bit there

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.969 
let's see if I guess a little bit there
ok<00:00:40.399> these<00:00:41.149> two<00:00:41.359> cords<00:00:41.690> here<00:00:41.960> are<00:00:42.170> either<00:00:42.679> 8<00:00:42.949> or

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
ok these two cords here are either 8 or

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.539 
ok these two cords here are either 8 or
6<00:00:43.370> pin<00:00:44.289> graphics<00:00:45.289> card<00:00:45.469> power<00:00:45.679> cords<00:00:46.420> they<00:00:47.420> put

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
6 pin graphics card power cords they put

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.160 
6 pin graphics card power cords they put
alright<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:49.760> both<00:00:50.449> these<00:00:50.629> graphics<00:00:50.989> card

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
alright and both these graphics card

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.859 
alright and both these graphics card
actually<00:00:51.379> require<00:00:52.269> 2<00:00:53.269> 6<00:00:53.510> pin<00:00:53.659> connectors<00:00:54.019> so

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
actually require 2 6 pin connectors so

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.430 
actually require 2 6 pin connectors so
you<00:00:56.869> usually<00:00:57.350> if<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.649> buy<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:58.369> new<00:00:59.409> socialising

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
you usually if you buy a new socialising

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.349 
you usually if you buy a new socialising
you<00:01:00.619> buy<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.799> new<00:01:01.039> graphics<00:01:01.429> card<00:01:01.459> comes<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:01.999> 2

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
you buy a new graphics card comes with 2

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.779 
you buy a new graphics card comes with 2
4-pin<00:01:02.899> molex<00:01:02.929> connectors<00:01:04.329> to<00:01:05.329> a<00:01:06.490> standard<00:01:07.490> 6

pin<00:01:07.969> these<00:01:08.719> are<00:01:08.899> really<00:01:09.140> common<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:09.740> they're

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
pin these are really common and they're

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.950 
pin these are really common and they're
really<00:01:10.009> cheap<00:01:10.219> I<00:01:10.430> actually<00:01:11.359> with<00:01:11.570> my<00:01:11.719> power

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
really cheap I actually with my power

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.039 
really cheap I actually with my power
source<00:01:12.200> it<00:01:12.469> is<00:01:12.619> a<00:01:12.649> Rosewell<00:01:13.640> 651<00:01:14.359> I<00:01:14.570> actually

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
source it is a Rosewell 651 I actually

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.440 
source it is a Rosewell 651 I actually
did<00:01:15.409> have<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.829> use<00:01:16.280> these<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.880> didn't<00:01:17.179> have<00:01:17.299> any

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
did have to use these I didn't have any

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.389 
did have to use these I didn't have any
extra<00:01:17.659> ones<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.170> this<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.679> modular<00:01:18.979> power

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
extra ones and this is a modular power

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.359 
extra ones and this is a modular power
source<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.259> do<00:01:21.469> is<00:01:21.649> I'll<00:01:22.039> just<00:01:22.159> toss

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
source and all you do is I'll just toss

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:23.730 
source and all you do is I'll just toss
them<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.609> a<00:01:22.700> real<00:01:22.789> quick<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:23.210> a<00:01:23.270> moment

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
them in a real quick in just a moment

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.929 
them in a real quick in just a moment
ok<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:24.859> this<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.070> how<00:01:25.159> it<00:01:25.280> looks<00:01:25.429> with<00:01:25.640> both<00:01:25.789> up

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
ok and this is how it looks with both up

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.219 
ok and this is how it looks with both up
in<00:01:26.030> there<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.299> didn't<00:01:26.659> connect<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:26.899> power<00:01:27.079> and

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
in there I didn't connect the power and

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.539 
in there I didn't connect the power and
I'm<00:01:27.409> not<00:01:27.560> actually<00:01:27.740> going<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.039> turn<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.219> on<00:01:28.310> but

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
I'm not actually going to turn it on but

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.910 
I'm not actually going to turn it on but
what<00:01:28.700> all<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:29.030> do<00:01:29.149> is<00:01:29.320> once<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.619> gets<00:01:30.770> turned

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
what all you do is once it gets turned

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.099 
what all you do is once it gets turned
on<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.520> video<00:01:31.789> find<00:01:32.119> its<00:01:32.270> own<00:01:32.390> drivers<00:01:32.810> again

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
on in video find its own drivers again

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.349 
on in video find its own drivers again
for<00:01:33.799> both<00:01:33.890> cards<00:01:34.310> or<00:01:34.549> whichever<00:01:34.789> cards<00:01:35.119> new<00:01:35.270> to

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
for both cards or whichever cards new to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.419 
for both cards or whichever cards new to
the<00:01:35.450> system<00:01:35.859> let<00:01:36.859> it<00:01:36.979> do<00:01:37.039> that<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:37.340> the

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
the system let it do that and the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.529 
the system let it do that and the
drivers<00:01:37.820> are<00:01:37.909> kind<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.119> bigger<00:01:38.270> things<00:01:38.359> like

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
drivers are kind of bigger things like

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.499 
drivers are kind of bigger things like
two<00:01:38.780> hundred<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:39.109> eighty<00:01:39.320> something<00:01:39.979> rigs

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
two hundred and eighty something rigs

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.179 
two hundred and eighty something rigs
all<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.570> do<00:01:41.659> is<00:01:41.749> you<00:01:41.840> go<00:01:41.960> into<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.259> settings

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
all you do is you go into the settings

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.569 
all you do is you go into the settings
and<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:44.530> you'll<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.829> set<00:01:46.100> PhysX

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
and you you'll see the set PhysX

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.160 
and you you'll see the set PhysX
configuration<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:47.420> just<00:01:47.719> set<00:01:47.899> whichever

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
configuration and just set whichever

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.389 
configuration and just set whichever
dedicated<00:01:48.649> card<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:48.950> won't<00:01:49.100> apply<00:01:49.310> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
dedicated card you won't apply the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.760 
dedicated card you won't apply the
changes<00:01:49.819> and<00:01:49.850> that's<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.350> I'm<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:51.530> to<00:01:51.590> post
