00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 so after all today I want to tell how 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.670
 knit on the journal if the density and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.400
 the number of rows you do not match then 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 there is a magazine given 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.980
 sample model one thread and needles 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.150
 you have other threads 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.670
 for this knit pattern 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.539
 we erase dry it to us to do 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.189
 necessarily and do the calculation for the magazine 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:40.050
 us knitting density is obtained such 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:42.950
 18 loops and 24 rows in sample 10 by 10 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.950
 centimeters 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.750
 of the journal 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.750
 we got 15 loops and 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:00.719
 20 rows in sample 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:06.540
 10 by 10 centimeters now need 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:11.540
 calculate the coefficient we all have our numbers 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:17.159
 divide by the numbers that this magazine 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:22.799
 we count the ratio of rows 20 to rows 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:27.170
 divide by 24 and we get zero 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.170
 as much as eighty is rebel 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.659
 loops we calculate 15 loops we divide by 18 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.250
 loops get I got 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.860
 it turned out the same mole ratio 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.860
 fighters this loop 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.590
 that is, we have all our density 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:02:01.159
 divide by the density of this magazine further 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.890
 what to do next knit on the magazine we 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.619
 every digit from the magazine is multiplied by our 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:16.060
 coefficient so here it is mom see it 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:22.370
 our example says 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:24.170
 dial ninety-four loops it's in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:33.549
 the magazine has ninety-four loops 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:37.569
 we multiply 94 by 0 8 and we get 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:42.739
 75 barely 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:50.049
 loops round 7 5 loops we need 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:52.959
 recite further said knit 40 rows 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:03:03.549
 we are 40 rows 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:07.120
 multiply by 0 8 and it turns out 30 32 rows 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.120
 faces and two rows 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:21.410
 Now, regarding the reduction of loops in 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:32.970
 floodplain for example, said to reduce in prime 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:35.269
 5 4 and 3 loops every fifth row in each 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.269
 fifth 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:48.349
 so this loop of us will start what we do 5 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.349
 multiply by the coefficient of the rows 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:55.829
 the coefficient of the series we have 08 and we 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.819
 it turns out four loops that is first 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:03.329
 times we add 4 loops further log 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:10.709
 said the following to reduce 4 loops again 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:14.819
 multiplying it 8 it turns out 3 further 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:21.870
 said quivering magazine we multiply by 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:27.990
 our coefficient is 08 and we get 2.4 loops 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.620
 there are two loops and it is said that in each 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.620
 fifth row 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:40.740
 that is, we multiply 5 rows by 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:43.830
 row coefficient here is me too 08 y 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:50.910
 you may be a different factor on 08 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:56.000
 and we get 4, that is, we need to reduce 43 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.000
 and two loops in every fourth row 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:06.410
 Fourth year, in principle, all all good luck
