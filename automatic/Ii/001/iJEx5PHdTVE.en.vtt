00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
pretty much it for this video I know I'm

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.180 
pretty much it for this video I know I'm
really<00:03:22.290> sorry<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.680> really<00:03:23.010> really

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
really sorry for this really really

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.160 
really sorry for this really really
short<00:03:23.280> video<00:03:23.550> but<00:03:23.700> I'm<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.090> so<00:03:24.660> out<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
short video but I'm just so out of it

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.420 
short video but I'm just so out of it
with<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.350> let's<00:03:25.590> play<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.070> I<00:03:26.130> think

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
with the let's play and I think

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.070 
with the let's play and I think
restarting<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.090> would<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.360> good<00:03:27.630> for<00:03:27.690> me<00:03:27.870> too

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
restarting it would be good for me too

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.270 
restarting it would be good for me too
because<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.530> way<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.739> know<00:03:29.070> I'll<00:03:29.250> have

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
because that way you know I'll have

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.890 
because that way you know I'll have
something<00:03:29.820> to<00:03:29.940> do<00:03:30.060> because<00:03:30.360> if<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.540> completely

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
something to do because if we completely

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.810 
something to do because if we completely
restart<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.560> then<00:03:31.739> it'll<00:03:32.430> be<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.549> new<00:03:32.700> adventure
