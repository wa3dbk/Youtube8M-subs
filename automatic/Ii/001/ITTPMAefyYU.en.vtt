00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.660
 DVD review and now all about a movie 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.509
 and a pretty neat trailer and 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
 my expectations were already therewith 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.109
 little increases in the strip of unfortunately 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.820
 only next month in the German 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.330
 Cinemas starts but I have them in advance 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.830
 seen and this is about the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:31.109
 unbelievable they come close up 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:34.669
 because the more you believe you see the more 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.669
 it is easier to fool them 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 3 by room and time to your bank in 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.129
 paris phone this Saturday through 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 make some have their home 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.060
 lost your car today 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.060
 a part of this money back 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.229
 Can you explain to me how you are in three 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.120
 Seconds from Las Vegas to Paris 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.530
 came as say the young people 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.130
 nowadays after yamaguchi section 1 of the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.340
 ag is always the smartest guy in the room 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.630
 her bank was the distraction maneuver 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.270
 while she is preparing the real trick 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.229
 let them fly up and 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.229
 make it ready 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:34.310
 okay not okay thanks thank you 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:36.619
 festzeit loses what a grandiose 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.069
 trick is also he was a long time ago 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.069
 invented 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:47.330
 I believe what comes next 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.330
 will absolutely amaze us 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.780
 look closely for her closer to her 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:01.649
 seem to be the less 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.649
 they actually see the incredible 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.710
 original titles are you see me goes 116 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.239
 minutes and starts on 11 July 2013 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.069
 the German cinema tells the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.260
 History of four mark the with 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.940
 your magical talents also in everyday life 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.930
 but they have a lot of fun 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.000
 Become by a higher instance 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.040
 summoned to a group of 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 horsemen make known before 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.220
 together a magical show in las vegas 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.569
 on the legs 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.130
 who has no equal 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.660
 highly technical tricks and great 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 entertainment a long time succeeds them 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.840
 for example, spectators from the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.940
 make the audience disappear or even 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.890
 to teleport to paris in a bank 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.540
 to clear the safe there at the same time 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.790
 and the captured good three million 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.799
 euro among the audience to distribute the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.690
 but already showing the trailer the 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.150
 Of course, you can not go unpunished 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.709
 and call the fbi on the plan and one 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.360
 Agents who want to know exactly what 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.370
 behind it is added 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.200
 old master of magic art of these 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.720
 Tricks likes to be unmasked and somehow 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.579
 everything interwoven and above all else 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.319
 magical i do not want to stand in the spot 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.390
 Too much to the content but just say so 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.640
 much know you see me or rather 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.260
 the lame german title the unbelievable 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.940
 is really fun 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.920
 what is the reason we have among others 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.049
 to karst with these four main actors 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.819
 jesse within this magical group 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.290
 Eisenberg I love rope 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.269
 fischer the wonderful woody harrelson 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.430
 Here is a man who gives the hypnosis 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.049
 Mighty is so much fun 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.959
 on the screen conjures and dave franco 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.600
 to mark ruffalo as a fbi-agent and 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.970
 michael caine as old master or as 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.440
 patron and rich man of the but that 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.299
 must question where his money from 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.310
 really has and morgan freeman as 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.680
 old masters of magic art are here 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.880
 incredibly-known actor, the 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.639
 but also really great together 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.799
 work news emi is a movie of 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.750
 has a lot of gags and a lot of tension 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.700
 forever the question in your head what is now 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.799
 really was here, building on the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.880
 one or the other twist a single and 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.739
 Alone, the movie really has to 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.590
 let it fall, especially in the back 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.720
 to look madly constructed and 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.430
 but that is a little shame would be the 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.970
 from may or movies as it is 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.340
 for example, the ocean 3 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.140
 he has really fun with marius me 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.300
 the film escape has a great flow 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.830
 is a great value on the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.350
 Canvas can be enjoyed properly 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.180
 has a great cast and on top of that too 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.260
 still one or the other turn at the 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.420
 it's really fun once 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.580
 look back to see how did that happen 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.560
 So it really happened and that's why 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.510
 the incredible for me an absolute 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.640
 recommendation a movie that promises too 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.870
 he keeps what he promises when you get the 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.970
 Trailer sees and that is nowadays 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.770
 not often the fan and that's why 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.330
 I would say who at the trailer 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.320
 The cast buck should have the movie 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.550
 Must see 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.410
 especially the little magical ones 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.450
 deposits and those from the first minute 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.940
 make the movie really fun and 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.500
 that's why the movie gets more than 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.810
 Contempt only six and a half out of ten 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.520
 possible points really as 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.200
 not usually questionable 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.880
 may be almost as funny to me in some 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.380
 moments because overall I find him 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.430
 much better and also a film at the 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.770
 I have the feeling I watch like 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.150
 one two three four times and would too 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.490
 other people recommend therefore of 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.550
 me a really strong 8 out of 10 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.230
 possible points for the incredible 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.460
 be on the edge again briefly over the 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.330
 title spoken I think first 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.500
 again fatal 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.480
 which you never get for a german title 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.770
 Chose the unbelievable is easy 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.419
 only cellar is a group of people 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.190
 where it is unbelievable what the 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.230
 but close to yoshimi's 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.580
 Original title says almost as much as 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.180
 now you see me now you see 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.310
 not me 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.870
 and I think that's a lot cooler 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.760
 too bad that you are here again a bit 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.300
 Uncreative at this point, well 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.070

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.240

 I hope one or the other 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.950
 now already on the strip 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.330
