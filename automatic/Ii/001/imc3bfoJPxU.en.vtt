00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
in the brief balance because I'm sure

sometimes<00:00:43.860> millions<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.520> permutations

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
sometimes millions of permutations

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.500 
sometimes millions of permutations
depending<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.719> days<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:48.090> something<00:00:48.239> like

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
depending one days so for something like

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.950 
depending one days so for something like
that

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.590 
that
sure<00:00:49.410> Beata<00:00:50.219> meters<00:00:51.030> would<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.270> brilliant

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
sure Beata meters would be brilliant

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.020 
sure Beata meters would be brilliant
it's<00:00:52.320> technically<00:00:52.710> possible<00:00:52.800> we're<00:00:53.699> talking

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's technically possible we're talking

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.410 
it's technically possible we're talking
about<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.980> timeline<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.460> come<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
about it timeline to come out but I

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.889 
about it timeline to come out but I
think<00:00:58.410> yeah<00:00:58.739> as<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.309> along<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.629> like

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
think yeah as we get along we would like

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.150 
think yeah as we get along we would like
to<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.379> point<00:01:01.559> where<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.100> start

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
to get to the point where we can start

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.240 
to get to the point where we can start
certain<00:01:04.160> bits<00:01:04.370> of<00:01:04.489> very<00:01:04.670> complex<00:01:05.059> content<00:01:06.250> how

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
certain bits of very complex content how

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.490 
certain bits of very complex content how
much<00:01:07.400> influence<00:01:07.730> and<00:01:08.240> monitoring<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.140> do<00:01:09.260> on

I<00:01:16.040> would<00:01:16.400> say<00:01:16.550> most<00:01:16.880> if<00:01:17.570> not<00:01:17.630> all<00:01:17.840> of<00:01:18.230> the<00:01:18.380> staff

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
I would say most if not all of the staff

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.610 
I would say most if not all of the staff
here<00:01:18.890> are<00:01:19.220> avid<00:01:19.700> gamers<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.210> not<00:01:20.570> just<00:01:20.810> plain

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
here are avid gamers and not just plain

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.240 
here are avid gamers and not just plain
runescape<00:01:22.130> but<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:23.780> be<00:01:23.900> multiple<00:01:24.620> console<00:01:25.040> is

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
runescape but to be multiple console is

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.610 
runescape but to be multiple console is
to<00:01:25.490> play<00:01:25.700> across<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.150> spectrum<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:27.080> yeah

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
to play across that spectrum and yeah

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.920

avidly<00:01:27.980> player<00:01:28.280> competitive<00:01:28.880> games<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.540> think

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
avidly player competitive games I think

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.600 
avidly player competitive games I think
that's<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:30.650> because<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.130> nature<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.430> who

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
that's just because of the nature of who

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.510 
that's just because of the nature of who
they<00:01:31.760> are<00:01:31.790> that's<00:01:32.180> sure<00:01:32.570> that's<00:01:32.780> not<00:01:32.900> really

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.760 
games actually refused to look at any
other<00:01:48.300> games<00:01:48.570> because<00:01:48.900> they<00:01:49.020> don't<00:01:49.200> want<00:01:49.440> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
other games because they don't want so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
other games because they don't want so
you've<00:01:50.340> got<00:01:50.460> tainted<00:01:50.880> inspiration<00:01:51.450> they

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you've got tainted inspiration they

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260 
you've got tainted inspiration they
wanted<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.900> their<00:01:52.080> ideas<00:01:52.790> from<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.940> onset

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
wanted to be their ideas from the onset

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630 
wanted to be their ideas from the onset
so<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.990> there's<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.920> mishmash<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so so there's this a bit of a mishmash I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.580 
so so there's this a bit of a mishmash I
sadly<00:01:57.150> playing<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.110> an<00:01:58.230> amount<00:01:58.470> of

sadly playing and have an amount of

sadly playing and have an amount of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.080 
games across across genres and platforms
we<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.410> reasonably<00:02:05.190> good<00:02:05.280> track<00:02:05.850> of

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
we do have a reasonably good track of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.710 
we do have a reasonably good track of
who<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.700> scald<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> movers<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.179> shakers<00:02:09.240> are

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
who the scald the movers and shakers are

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.590 
who the scald the movers and shakers are
in<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.619> online<00:02:10.800> space<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.610> we'll<00:02:12.480> probably

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
in the online space and we'll probably

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.270 
in the online space and we'll probably
look<00:02:12.810> more<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> online<00:02:13.500> space<00:02:13.800> than<00:02:14.130> just

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
look more to the online space than just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.260 
look more to the online space than just
traditional<00:02:14.959> retail<00:02:15.959> gaming<00:02:16.670> teams

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
traditional retail gaming teams

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.510 
traditional retail gaming teams
Xbox<00:02:19.270> games<00:02:19.600> appear<00:02:19.870> three<00:02:20.080> games<00:02:20.400> because<00:02:21.400> we

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
Xbox games appear three games because we

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.770 
Xbox games appear three games because we
can<00:02:21.730> certainly<00:02:21.850> feel<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.480> future

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
can certainly feel that with the future

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.930 
can certainly feel that with the future
it's<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:22.990> just<00:02:23.200> over<00:02:23.380> there<00:02:23.530> but<00:02:23.920> but<00:02:24.580> I

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
it's not just over there but but I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's not just over there but but I
suppose<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.570> should<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.750> more<00:02:25.960> scientific

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
suppose it should be more scientific

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.660 
suppose it should be more scientific
than<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.620> that's<00:02:26.830> probably<00:02:27.100> no<00:02:27.220> it's<00:02:27.520> just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
than that that's probably no it's just

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.030 
than that that's probably no it's just
hey<00:02:28.630> these<00:02:28.810> guys<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.170> some<00:02:29.350> cool<00:02:29.530> good<00:02:29.860> talk

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
long time can you tell us the details

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.180 
long time can you tell us the details
about<00:03:16.630> mechs<00:03:16.840> Cape<00:03:17.080> what<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.440> coming<00:03:17.710> out<00:03:17.950> what

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
about mechs Cape what is coming out what

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.650 
about mechs Cape what is coming out what
it's<00:03:18.310> gonna<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.790> or<00:03:19.090> still<00:03:19.420> are<00:03:19.510> gone

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
it's gonna be that or still are gone

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.360 
it's gonna be that or still are gone
this<00:03:19.780> instead<00:03:20.020> of<00:03:20.140> going<00:03:20.320> now<00:03:21.270> no<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.950> but

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
this instead of going now no but but

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.770 
this instead of going now no but but
that's<00:03:24.489> an<00:03:24.670> easier<00:03:24.910> one<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.180> answer<00:03:25.330> because<00:03:25.570> I

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
that's an easier one to answer because I

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.990 
that's an easier one to answer because I
don't<00:03:25.959> know<00:03:26.140> as<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.760> guys<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:29.770> dispense<00:03:30.160> the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
don't know as the guys that dispense the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.550 
don't know as the guys that dispense the
last<00:03:31.180> month<00:03:31.510> ensue

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
last month ensue

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.150 
last month ensue
the<00:03:34.560> final<00:03:34.920> stage<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.550> design<00:03:37.100> for<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
the final stage of the design for the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.430 
the final stage of the design for the
time<00:03:38.340> something<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.090> think<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.230> the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
time something I think you know the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.170 
time something I think you know the
final<00:03:41.040> design<00:03:42.410> step<00:03:43.460> we've<00:03:44.460> decided<00:03:44.850> on<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
final design step we've decided on the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.180 
final design step we've decided on the
game<00:03:45.360> within<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.660> village<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.500> then<00:03:46.830> once

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
game within the village and then once

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.680 
game within the village and then once
that's<00:03:47.400> locked<00:03:47.700> down<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.360> we<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.540> say<00:03:48.660> right

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
that's locked down that we can say right

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.080 
that's locked down that we can say right
now<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:49.020> cost<00:03:49.320> it<00:03:49.590> yeah<00:03:50.130> how<00:03:50.550> many<00:03:50.610> hundred
