00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
bouncy it's just so pretty you have to

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.529 
bouncy it's just so pretty you have to
try<00:04:57.289> this<00:04:57.349> hand<00:04:58.569> there's<00:04:59.569> one<00:04:59.630> con<00:05:00.259> to<00:05:01.039> it<00:05:01.539> when

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
try this hand there's one con to it when

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.790 
try this hand there's one con to it when
I<00:05:02.569> received<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.229> it<00:05:03.440> was<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:05.330> another<00:05:05.870> s-wave

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
I received it it was the another s-wave

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.550 
I received it it was the another s-wave
body<00:05:07.220> wave<00:05:07.550> or<00:05:07.819> whatever<00:05:08.090> after<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.050> washed<00:05:09.319> it

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
body wave or whatever after I washed it

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.490 
body wave or whatever after I washed it
did<00:05:09.889> lose<00:05:10.099> its<00:05:10.310> wave<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> bit<00:05:10.940> but<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:12.050> went<00:05:12.289> it

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
did lose its wave a bit but it went it

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.640 
did lose its wave a bit but it went it
wasn't<00:05:12.710> as<00:05:12.979> uniformed<00:05:13.729> it<00:05:13.849> went<00:05:14.030> into<00:05:14.240> like<00:05:14.449> a

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
wasn't as uniformed it went into like a

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:31.679 
wasn't as uniformed it went into like a
more<00:05:15.650> natural<00:05:16.130> wave<00:05:16.909> pattern

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:31.689 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.749 

so<00:05:32.689> when<00:05:32.840> it's<00:05:32.990> wet<00:05:33.229> it's<00:05:33.469> like<00:05:33.680> sums<00:05:34.400> really

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
so when it's wet it's like sums really

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.110 
so when it's wet it's like sums really
curly<00:05:35.150> sums<00:05:35.419> wavy<00:05:35.960> some<00:05:36.229> kind<00:05:36.919> of<00:05:37.039> less<00:05:37.789> wavy

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
curly sums wavy some kind of less wavy

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.480 
curly sums wavy some kind of less wavy
so<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:39.259> natural<00:05:39.439> state<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:39.830> actually<00:05:40.310> pretty

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
so the natural state is actually pretty

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.279 
so the natural state is actually pretty
it's<00:05:40.669> just<00:05:40.789> not<00:05:40.969> uniformed<00:05:41.479> at<00:05:41.569> all<00:05:41.689> so<00:05:41.870> it's

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
it's just not uniformed at all so it's

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.040 
it's just not uniformed at all so it's
really<00:05:42.800> really<00:05:43.129> natural<00:05:43.580> looking<00:05:43.909> so<00:05:44.569> if<00:05:44.900> you

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
really really natural looking so if you

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.529 
really really natural looking so if you
if<00:05:45.349> you<00:05:45.469> want<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:46.279> body<00:05:46.789> waiver<00:05:47.150> you're

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
if you want that body waiver you're

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.580 
if you want that body waiver you're
