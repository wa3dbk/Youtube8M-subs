00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:16.610
 and 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:20.360
 a bench test engineer and he has a little 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.640
 three facets one facet reliability 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.439
 to validate the reliability of the parts 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.869
 today an engine has to make up 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.099
 three big prizes so we try to 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.689
 validate the parts the most severely 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.700
 possible there is the lafa this performance 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.450
 which is to make the engine the most 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.520
 powerful possible 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.100
 the last phase is that's the part 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.070
 focus it's a little bit of 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.290
 custom adaptation to the pilot of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.250
 the car for the engine to respond 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.250
 as the pilot wants 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.400
 the first time we get into a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590
 formula 1 bench we really have the heart 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.530
 who beats harder and that's really 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.790
 it's really catchy and test benches 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 at viry-châtillon it's really something 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.210
 thing at the cutting edge of technology and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.610
 what is really better in the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 whole world 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.230
 it's ten computers three systems 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:20.120
 650 cameras settings monitor all 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.120
 the second 60 km of electrical wires 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.050
 an air conditioning that is capable of 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.580
 blow at over 350 km three hours 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.480
 ice cream that separates us from 130 decibels 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.620
 of formula 1 engine and temperature 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.890
 exhaust going up to over 1000 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.890
 degrees 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.860
 generate huge speed variations 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.020
 from 0 to 18 rounds minutes in one tenth of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.759
 second 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.229
 we can measure below the half 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.470
 riding on a motor that made 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.810
 about 750 same family spirit to 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.590
 viry-châtillon there is a spirit of de 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.540
 will to win 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.950
 it's true that both put together 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.950
 it's something wonderful
