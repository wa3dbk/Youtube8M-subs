00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.770 
took these off and I realized it was
there<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.549> I'm<00:01:20.610> sort<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> MAGIX<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.570> kind

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
there and I'm sort of MAGIX that's kind

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.910 
there and I'm sort of MAGIX that's kind
of<00:01:21.810> weird<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.170> figured<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.680> figure

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
of weird I figured they would figure

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
of weird I figured they would figure
their<00:01:23.040> company<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.580> smart<00:01:23.909> as<00:01:24.030> BMW<00:01:24.330> you'd

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
their company as smart as BMW you'd

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
their company as smart as BMW you'd
think<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.259> would<00:01:25.409> figure<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.740> out<00:01:26.070> they

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
think they would figure that out they

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.859 
think they would figure that out they
should<00:01:26.549> get<00:01:26.610> their<00:01:26.759> nav<00:01:26.970> screens<00:01:27.299> from<00:01:27.450> Lexus

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
horsepower uh less I'll be honest I

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.819 
horsepower uh less I'll be honest I
don't<00:03:13.540> know<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.690> torque<00:03:13.959> figure<00:03:14.260> offhand<00:03:14.650> but

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
don't know the torque figure offhand but

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.670 
don't know the torque figure offhand but
it's<00:03:15.190> lower<00:03:15.400> it's<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> 300<00:03:16.540> like<00:03:16.720> 388<00:03:17.500> I

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
it's lower it's in the 300 like 388 I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620 
it's lower it's in the 300 like 388 I
think<00:03:17.890> it's<00:03:18.010> less<00:03:18.220> than<00:03:18.459> that<00:03:18.579> actually<00:03:18.820> do

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
think it's less than that actually do

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.830 
think it's less than that actually do
you<00:03:19.720> do<00:03:20.610> have<00:03:21.610> you<00:03:21.760> tested<00:03:22.239> have<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.480> pulled

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
you do have you tested have you pulled

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.330 
you do have you tested have you pulled
some<00:03:22.989> performance<00:03:23.530> numbers<00:03:23.799> on<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.010> car<00:03:24.190> you

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
some performance numbers on the car you

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.979 
some performance numbers on the car you
know<00:03:24.459> how<00:03:24.579> quick<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:25.000> thing<00:03:25.209> is<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.570> mean<00:03:25.810> it's

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
know how quick this thing is I mean it's

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.920 
know how quick this thing is I mean it's
it's<00:03:26.260> 0<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.590> 60<00:03:27.010> in<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.430> low<00:03:27.820> fours<00:03:28.299> depending

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
it's 0 to 60 in the low fours depending

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.110 
it's 0 to 60 in the low fours depending
on<00:03:29.079> what<00:03:29.500> mode<00:03:29.709> comes<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.340> launch<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:31.030> know

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
on what mode comes to launch it you know

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.920 
on what mode comes to launch it you know
it's<00:03:31.299> not<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.720> superlight<00:03:32.410> car<00:03:32.799> it's<00:03:33.100> around<00:03:33.930> 35

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
it's not a superlight car it's around 35

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.740 
it's not a superlight car it's around 35
3,600<00:03:35.739> pounds<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.640> with<00:03:36.880> options<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.570> can<00:03:37.660> get

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
3,600 pounds and with options it can get

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.680 
3,600 pounds and with options it can get
up<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.049> like<00:03:38.170> 37<00:03:38.859> 38<00:03:39.190> but<00:03:40.180> it's<00:03:40.299> got<00:03:40.450> launch

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
up to like 37 38 but it's got launch

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.460 
up to like 37 38 but it's got launch
control<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:42.100> it<00:03:42.220> tops<00:03:42.459> out<00:03:42.989> I've<00:03:43.989> seen<00:03:44.320> as

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
control and it tops out I've seen as

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.020 
control and it tops out I've seen as
high<00:03:44.620> as<00:03:44.829> 180<00:03:45.100> in<00:03:45.459> these<00:03:45.609> cars

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
high as 180 in these cars

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.360 
high as 180 in these cars
oh<00:03:46.209> no<00:03:46.780> 3,600<00:03:47.560> pounds<00:03:47.650> doesn't<00:03:48.040> seem<00:03:48.160> real

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
oh no 3,600 pounds doesn't seem real

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.390 
oh no 3,600 pounds doesn't seem real
heavy<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.150> me<00:03:49.269> like<00:03:49.480> I'm<00:03:49.660> a<00:03:49.750> Mustang<00:03:50.200> 3,600<00:03:51.100> any

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
heavy to me like I'm a Mustang 3,600 any

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.310 
heavy to me like I'm a Mustang 3,600 any
other<00:03:51.609> you<00:03:52.150> know<00:03:52.239> your<00:03:52.450> Camaro<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.079> whatever

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
other you know your Camaro and whatever

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.970 
other you know your Camaro and whatever
else<00:03:53.620> they're<00:03:54.280> also<00:03:54.400> old<00:03:54.820> 38<00:03:55.239> yeah<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.140> mean<00:03:56.500> you

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
else they're also old 38 yeah I mean you

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.979 
else they're also old 38 yeah I mean you
know<00:03:57.100> unfortunately<00:03:57.700> in<00:03:58.239> terms<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.540> numbers

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
know unfortunately in terms of numbers

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.259 
know unfortunately in terms of numbers
in<00:03:59.260> terms<00:03:59.440> of<00:03:59.680> you<00:04:00.100> know<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.280> runs<00:04:00.400> about<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.700> 12o

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
in terms of you know it runs about a 12o

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.080 
in terms of you know it runs about a 12o
in<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.540> corner

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
in the corner

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.300 
in the corner
yeah<00:04:02.330> which<00:04:02.450> is<00:04:02.510> about<00:04:02.810> what<00:04:03.140> a<00:04:03.170> Mustang<00:04:03.800> g/t

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
yeah which is about what a Mustang g/t

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.970 
yeah which is about what a Mustang g/t
runs<00:04:04.610> so<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.270> numbers<00:04:05.959> with<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.260> m3<00:04:06.500> don't

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
runs so the numbers with the m3 don't

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.620 
runs so the numbers with the m3 don't
really<00:04:07.190> tell<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.550> whole<00:04:07.580> story<00:04:07.880> it's<00:04:08.390> more

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
really tell the whole story it's more

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.660 
really tell the whole story it's more
about<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.900> feel<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.470> kind<00:04:09.680> of<00:04:09.739> felt<00:04:09.950> like<00:04:10.010> BMW

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
about the feel I kind of felt like BMW

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.250 
about the feel I kind of felt like BMW
has<00:04:10.790> always<00:04:10.970> been<00:04:11.239> kind<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.540> conservative<00:04:12.140> on

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
has always been kind of conservative on

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.380 
has always been kind of conservative on
their<00:04:12.410> numbers<00:04:12.800> because<00:04:13.190> what's<00:04:13.640> the<00:04:13.790> new<00:04:13.940> m5

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
their numbers because what's the new m5

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.470 
their numbers because what's the new m5
the<00:04:14.690> new<00:04:14.810> m5<00:04:15.200> is<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.500> rocket<00:04:16.040> ship<00:04:16.070> but<00:04:16.820> the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
the new m5 is a rocket ship but the

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.650 
the new m5 is a rocket ship but the
manufacturer<00:04:18.139> claims<00:04:18.470> zero<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:18.980> 60<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.660> 4.7

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
manufacturer claims zero to 60 like 4.7

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.540 
manufacturer claims zero to 60 like 4.7
or<00:04:20.780> 4.0<00:04:21.380> it's<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.799> lot<00:04:21.980> but<00:04:22.100> it's<00:04:22.160> literally

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
or 4.0 it's a lot but it's literally

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.490 
or 4.0 it's a lot but it's literally
like<00:04:22.760> three<00:04:23.240> nine<00:04:23.450> yeah<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.720> guess<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.169> not

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
like three nine yeah I guess it's not

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.080 
like three nine yeah I guess it's not
they're<00:04:24.710> also<00:04:24.860> under<00:04:25.160> rating<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.610> horsepower

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
they're also under rating the horsepower

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.909 
they're also under rating the horsepower
of<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.450> car<00:04:26.720> by<00:04:26.990> quite<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.380> bit<00:04:27.410> now<00:04:27.680> these

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
of that car by quite a bit now these

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.379 
of that car by quite a bit now these
they're<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> little<00:04:28.580> closer<00:04:28.820> they're<00:04:29.150> really

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
they're a little closer they're really

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.030 
they're a little closer they're really
not<00:04:29.510> it's<00:04:30.020> easier<00:04:30.350> to<00:04:30.470> under<00:04:30.770> eight<00:04:30.919> the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
not it's easier to under eight the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800 
not it's easier to under eight the
horsepower<00:04:31.460> of<00:04:31.730> a<00:04:31.790> turbocharged<00:04:32.630> engine

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
horsepower of a turbocharged engine

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.320 
horsepower of a turbocharged engine
because<00:04:33.200> the<00:04:33.350> more<00:04:33.980> power<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.850> know<00:04:34.970> with<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
because the more power you know with the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.790 
because the more power you know with the
an<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.600> motors<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.110> not<00:04:36.260> as<00:04:36.410> easy<00:04:36.560> to<00:04:36.650> do<00:04:36.770> that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
an a motors it's not as easy to do that

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.379 
an a motors it's not as easy to do that
right<00:04:37.160> 1m<00:04:37.550> is<00:04:37.729> very<00:04:37.970> underrated<00:04:38.300> as<00:04:38.570> well<00:04:40.389> very

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
right 1m is very underrated as well very

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.990 
right 1m is very underrated as well very
refined<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:42.080> limits<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.680> RPM<00:04:43.070> yeah<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:43.850> so

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
refined it limits the RPM yeah and so

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.969 
refined it limits the RPM yeah and so
until<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.660> motor<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.080> warm<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.620> actually

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
until the motor is warm it actually

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.129 
until the motor is warm it actually
won't<00:04:46.160> let<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.580> rev<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.820> above<00:04:47.240> see<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
won't let you rev it above see the

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.780 
won't let you rev it above see the
movable<00:04:48.620> redline<00:04:48.979> oh<00:04:49.130> this<00:04:49.340> one<00:04:49.520> doesn't<00:04:49.669> even
