prescription and I thought what an
exciting<00:00:14.790> time<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.330> new<00:00:15.450> frames

exciting time to get new frames

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.540 
exciting time to get new frames
obviously<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:16.529> probably<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.310> most

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
obviously that's probably the most

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.029 
obviously that's probably the most
exciting<00:00:17.820> part<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.260> my<00:00:19.500> first<00:00:19.740> time

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
exciting part I know that my first time

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
exciting part I know that my first time
picking<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.550> glasses<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.810> actually

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
picking out glasses it was actually

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.250 
picking out glasses it was actually
pretty<00:00:22.740> difficult<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.430> me<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.140> be

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
pretty difficult for me I and I can be

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.200 
pretty difficult for me I and I can be
pretty<00:00:25.529> undecisive<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> comes<00:00:27.090> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
pretty undecisive when it comes to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
pretty undecisive when it comes to
things<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.660> especially<00:00:28.260> if<00:00:28.769> it's

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
things like that especially if it's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.169 
things like that especially if it's
something<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.550> I'm<00:00:29.699> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.910> be<00:00:30.029> wearing

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
all of these things and it's really hard

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.110

three are the ones I was wearing at the
beginning<00:07:08.930> of<00:07:09.139> this<00:07:09.289> video<00:07:09.500> which<00:07:10.219> are<00:07:10.520> very

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
beginning of this video which are very

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.779 
beginning of this video which are very
similar<00:07:11.210> also<00:07:11.810> tortoise<00:07:12.409> kind<00:07:12.860> of<00:07:13.069> and<00:07:13.310> they

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:13.789 
similar also tortoise kind of and they

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:15.879 
similar also tortoise kind of and they

lightweight<00:07:16.099> which<00:07:17.000> is<00:07:17.240> really<00:07:17.509> important

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:17.930 
lightweight which is really important

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.469 
lightweight which is really important
for<00:07:17.990> glasses<00:07:18.439> I<00:07:18.589> think<00:07:18.830> then<00:07:19.639> we<00:07:19.909> have<00:07:20.210> these

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
for glasses I think then we have these

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.110 
for glasses I think then we have these
clear<00:07:21.349> frames<00:07:21.949> which<00:07:22.310> I've<00:07:22.580> always<00:07:22.849> thought

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
clear frames which I've always thought

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.379 
clear frames which I've always thought
are<00:07:23.750> super<00:07:24.289> cool<00:07:24.560> I<00:07:24.830> don't<00:07:25.520> think<00:07:25.939> I'm<00:07:26.120> cool

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 
are super cool I don't think I'm cool

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.839 
are super cool I don't think I'm cool
enough<00:07:26.509> to<00:07:26.960> pull<00:07:27.169> them<00:07:27.319> off<00:07:27.500> but<00:07:27.949> we<00:07:28.520> were<00:07:28.669> in

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:28.849 
enough to pull them off but we were in

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:29.439 
enough to pull them off but we were in
New<00:07:29.000> York

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:29.449 
New York

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:32.409
