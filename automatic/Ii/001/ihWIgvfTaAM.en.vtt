 in its low calorie intake as 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.900
 every 100 grams would be contributing 47

 in addition to its mineral salts as the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.990
 magnesium and zinc 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.900

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.480
 foods rich in fats and sugars 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.750
