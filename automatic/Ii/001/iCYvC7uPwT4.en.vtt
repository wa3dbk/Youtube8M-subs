00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 gold no the rolls it's not cheesy 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.410
 it does not make grandmother is even 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.230
 completely the opposite 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.730
 the rolls it's super trendy apple 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.590
 point that there are even girls who are 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.560
 walk with their job on their head 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.410
 in the street 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:22.720
 [Music] 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.210
 which is great with the rollers 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.150
 it's a mechanical hairstyle 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.490
 which is absolutely not going to damage the fiber 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.150
 of your hair you can do everything 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.129
 with the brushing side of the smoothings you 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.870
 create volume on the head and it's going 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.640
 very well hold all day without 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.710
 that you need to add 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.239
 Products you can do all 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.940
 the kinds of curls you have 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.300
 want waves or English 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.400
 and finally you can even make some 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.320
 tris zur and again all the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.120
 kinds of safe cherries you have 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.370
 desire 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.230
 [Applause] 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 [Music] 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.050
 so suddenly I spent Saturday at 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.570
 power charles and I'm going to ask a 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.030
 non-violent pressure to achieve a 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 styling you create sections on 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.100
 your head you take less wicks 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.630
 wide that role o position you the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.560
 roll well to the vertical wine you 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 hold on tight 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.400
 this attention at the end is very 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 important and then that you roll 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.570
 simply want to you 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.400
 position with either a bar or 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.970
 with a peak 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.150
 [Music] 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.670
 [Applause] 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.200
 [Music] 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 that's what it gives then it must already 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.350
 you know how do you want to 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.390
 but I was stopped there on 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 the side and the rollers are positioned 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.729
 on one side finally fly in one direction 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.790
 as I wanted volume he did well 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.210
 pulled the roots and then the others 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:02:00.390
 rollers are in the other direction 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:00.390
 [Music] 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.790
 for my styling charles is used 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.190
 tulle rolls and rolls 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.170
 velcro what's great is two 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.170
 rolls it's actually they're airy 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.940
 so that the hair dries well I you 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.400
 advise much less rollers in 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 we necessarily they are filled with 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.500
 foam and suddenly it dries a lot 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.240
 less good 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 and obviously I do not advise you 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.700
 especially not the heated rollers that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.320
 anyway damages the hair since 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.030
 it's the same principle as the iron 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.590
 curl and in addition to the blow it can 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.770
 to be logical that we use a small 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.570
 little electricity for nothing last 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.430
 thing anyway on velcro rolls 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.660
 he used them because I have 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.530
 hair that is very short in the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.660
 neck 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.490
 but otherwise I do not advise you 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.560
 he hangs the hair especially when 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.230
 it's not very good masters like 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.950
 we what like all of us and suddenly 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.950
 they damage the hair 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.310
 as I told you there is really 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.840
 all roll sizes is still 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.090
 this is only a small sample 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.670
 there were even bigger ones for 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.260
 do whatever you want more the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.300
 roll and small obviously over the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.580
 crimp is going to be small plus the roll 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.610
 is fat the more you go to a pike 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.030
 mini wise to hold them you have 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.010
 need 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.959
 in any case charles used peaks 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.410
 but I advise you rather 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.299
 styling tongs flat stuffings 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.879
 and so that's how we liked the 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.720
 first curlers so the one on the left the 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.700
 peak goes all the way down to the hair 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.099
 and all the others who come behind 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.610
 it's a bit like a little train the pic 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.030
 well without a net in the curler that the 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.030
 above 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:49.780
 [Applause]
