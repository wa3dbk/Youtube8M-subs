about and then I'm gonna set it into
position

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.489 

once<00:00:58.519> we've<00:00:58.670> got<00:00:58.850> an<00:00:58.909> accurate<00:00:59.030> position<00:00:59.499> you

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
once we've got an accurate position you

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.800 
once we've got an accurate position you
want<00:01:00.649> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
position on the other side we're going

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:34.250

to<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.690> same

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.780 

once<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.410> check<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.830> position<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.460> need<00:01:36.490> our

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
once you check the position we need our

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.030 
once you check the position we need our
read<00:01:37.030> scrapper<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.840> then<00:01:38.710> we're<00:01:38.830> going<00:01:38.980> to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
read scrapper and then we're going to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.760 
read scrapper and then we're going to
move<00:01:39.250> over<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.640> graphic<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:41.140> make<00:01:41.320> sure<00:01:41.560> it's

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
move over the graphic to make sure it's

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.220 
move over the graphic to make sure it's
stuck<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.310> the<00:01:42.430> transfer<00:01:42.940> tape

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.130 

we<00:01:47.230> then<00:01:47.440> peel<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:48.700> tape<00:01:48.910> off<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:49.870> top

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
we then peel the tape off the top

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.700 
we then peel the tape off the top
position<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:51.150> then<00:01:52.150> we<00:01:52.300> peel<00:01:52.570> away<00:01:52.750> the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
position and then we peel away the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.030 
position and then we peel away the
graphic<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.479> application<00:01:56.290> set<00:01:56.500> from<00:01:56.830> the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
graphic and the application set from the

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.930 
graphic and the application set from the
PIP<00:01:57.280> at<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.729> backing<00:01:58.120> paper<00:01:59.370> do<00:02:00.370> this<00:02:00.580> all<00:02:00.790> the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
PIP at the backing paper do this all the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.170 
PIP at the backing paper do this all the
way<00:02:01.060> across<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:03.220> just<00:02:03.369> lay<00:02:03.610> hanging<00:02:04.570> down<00:02:06.180> not

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
way across and just lay hanging down not

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.270 
way across and just lay hanging down not
touching<00:02:07.690> anything<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.619> sticky<00:02:09.009> side<00:02:09.220> is

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
touching anything so the sticky side is

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:30.180 
touching anything so the sticky side is
out<00:02:28.020> once<00:02:29.020> we've<00:02:29.230> peeled<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.680> graphic<00:02:30.010> back

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
out once we've peeled the graphic back

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.699 
out once we've peeled the graphic back
coming<00:02:30.550> out<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.780> pit<00:02:32.170> that<00:02:32.200> we<00:02:32.560> need

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
coming out it's like a pit that we need

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.090 
coming out it's like a pit that we need
to<00:02:32.830> get<00:02:32.980> rid<00:02:33.130> of<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.209> just<00:02:34.390> use<00:02:34.630> scissors

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
to get rid of this and just use scissors

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.510 
to get rid of this and just use scissors
to<00:02:36.100> roughly<00:02:36.430> cut<00:02:36.730> across<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.950> we<00:02:45.130> need<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
to roughly cut across and we need to

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.060 
to roughly cut across and we need to
remove<00:02:45.820> that<00:02:46.320> once<00:02:47.320> we've<00:02:47.530> got<00:02:47.739> rid<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.950> that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
remove that once we've got rid of that

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.240 
remove that once we've got rid of that
what<00:02:48.910> we<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.300> we<00:02:49.510> take<00:02:49.690> our<00:02:49.870> scraper<00:02:50.320> and<00:02:50.830> we

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
what we do is we take our scraper and we

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.060 
what we do is we take our scraper and we
lift<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.700> back<00:02:51.820> up<00:02:51.880> into<00:02:52.239> position<00:02:57.720> and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
lift it back up into position and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.170 
lift it back up into position and
lightly<00:03:00.070> tap<00:03:01.620> barely<00:03:02.620> touch<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.790> then<00:03:04.000> we

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
lightly tap barely touch it and then we

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.240 
lightly tap barely touch it and then we
take<00:03:04.390> our<00:03:04.600> right<00:03:04.630> grip<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.440> work<00:03:05.680> from<00:03:06.040> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
take our right grip and we work from the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.670 
take our right grip and we work from the
cut<00:03:06.970> line<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.510> where<00:03:07.720> we<00:03:07.870> cut<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.110> paper<00:03:08.380> off

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
cut line of where we cut the paper off

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.930 
cut line of where we cut the paper off
and<00:03:09.430> we<00:03:09.580> just<00:03:12.450> touch<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.950> Swank<00:03:14.950> Nexus<00:03:15.400> tablet

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
and we just touch the Swank Nexus tablet

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.910 
and we just touch the Swank Nexus tablet
all<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.660> way<00:03:16.989> across<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.650> then<00:03:17.739> we<00:03:18.610> work<00:03:19.920> left

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
all the way across and then we work left

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.840 
all the way across and then we work left
to<00:03:21.130> right

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.570 
now that's one half of the graphic stuck
to<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.140> wall<00:03:39.320> we're<00:03:39.710> going<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:39.890> do<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.220> second

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
to the wall we're going to do the second

half which is the bottom half but we're

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.140 
half which is the bottom half but we're
going<00:03:42.740> to<00:03:42.830> rub<00:03:43.010> over<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.400> one<00:03:43.640> more<00:03:43.940> time

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
going to rub over this one more time

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.050

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.220 

okay<00:03:50.060> now<00:03:50.330> we<00:03:50.390> can<00:03:50.600> peel<00:03:50.870> back<00:03:51.020> the<00:03:51.170> tip

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.170 

once<00:03:56.230> we<00:03:56.380> remove<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.980> tip<00:03:57.220> we<00:03:57.640> need<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.910> fold

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
once we remove the tip we need to fold

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.360 
once we remove the tip we need to fold
back<00:03:58.420> important<00:03:58.990> piece<00:03:59.260> of<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.680> graphic<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
back important piece of the graphic and

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.330 
back important piece of the graphic and
then<00:04:00.910> work<00:04:01.150> down<00:04:01.450> so<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:01.840> little<00:04:02.830> bit<00:04:02.950> masking

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
then work down so a little bit masking

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.050 
then work down so a little bit masking
tape<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:05.440> hold<00:04:05.740> it<00:04:05.920> in<00:04:05.950> place<00:04:06.130> while<00:04:06.520> we<00:04:06.580> cut

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
tape just hold it in place while we cut

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.660 
tape just hold it in place while we cut
up<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.810> just<00:04:11.050> put<00:04:11.590> them<00:04:11.710> on<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.920> wall<00:04:12.100> in

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
up so I just put them on the wall in

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.270 
up so I just put them on the wall in
position<00:04:13.660> for<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.080> moment<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.720> graphic<00:04:17.410> but

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
position for the moment the graphic but

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.520 
position for the moment the graphic but
pivot<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.209> position<00:04:20.170> where<00:04:20.350> you<00:04:20.470> had<00:04:20.680> it

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
pivot on the position where you had it

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.280 
pivot on the position where you had it
and<00:04:23.530> then<00:04:23.680> sit<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:26.680> top<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.100> wall<00:04:28.290> just

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
and then sit to the top of the wall just

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.760 
and then sit to the top of the wall just
so<00:04:29.470> that<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:29.950> get<00:04:30.370> your<00:04:30.520> hands-free<00:04:31.260> no<00:04:32.260> get

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
so that you get your hands-free no get

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.600 
so that you get your hands-free no get
both<00:04:32.980> hands<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.640> feel<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:34.630> some<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.930> the

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
both hands and feel like some of the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.850 
both hands and feel like some of the
application<00:04:36.610> tape<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.120> about<00:04:37.360> half<00:04:37.660> way<00:04:37.990> so

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.980 

it's<00:04:41.860> making<00:04:42.070> sure<00:04:42.280> that<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:43.270> graphic<00:04:43.780> is

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
it's making sure that the graphic is

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.190 
it's making sure that the graphic is
still<00:04:44.770> on<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:45.310> plastic<00:04:45.760> transfer<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.840> not<00:04:46.870> on

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
still on the plastic transfer and not on

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.130 
still on the plastic transfer and not on
the<00:04:47.350> paper<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:51.280> then<00:04:51.520> cut<00:04:51.850> off<00:04:52.480> again

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
the paper and then cut off again

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.909 
the paper and then cut off again
recession

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.360 

then<00:04:59.919> we<00:05:00.040> take<00:05:00.220> our<00:05:00.460> square<00:05:00.820> cut<00:05:01.620> let<00:05:02.620> me<00:05:02.770> take

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
then we take our square cut let me take

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.950 
then we take our square cut let me take
the<00:05:03.550> whole<00:05:03.759> graphic<00:05:04.199> in<00:05:05.199> one<00:05:05.410> go<00:05:06.479> boom<00:05:07.479> peel<00:05:07.720> it

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the whole graphic in one go boom peel it

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:13.770 
the whole graphic in one go boom peel it
and<00:05:08.289> then<00:05:08.620> gently<00:05:09.870> lift<00:05:10.870> it<00:05:11.169> down<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:12.780> lightly

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
and then gently lift it down and lightly

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:21.090 
and then gently lift it down and lightly
tap<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.830> wall<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:19.560> then<00:05:20.560> we<00:05:20.710> work<00:05:20.889> with

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
tap it to the wall and then we work with

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.170 
tap it to the wall and then we work with
our<00:05:21.190> sprayer<00:05:21.550> for<00:05:21.759> them<00:05:22.050> along<00:05:23.050> the<00:05:23.229> line

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:35.460 

[Applause]

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.020 

then<00:05:36.470> once<00:05:36.710> we've<00:05:36.890> done<00:05:36.920> that<00:05:37.130> so<00:05:37.400> that's<00:05:37.850> now

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
then once we've done that so that's now

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.940 
then once we've done that so that's now
two-thirds<00:05:38.690> of<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.930> graphic<00:05:39.410> stuck<00:05:39.680> to<00:05:39.860> the

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
two-thirds of the graphic stuck to the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.060 
two-thirds of the graphic stuck to the
wall<00:05:40.160> we<00:05:40.670> just<00:05:40.700> left<00:05:41.090> the<00:05:41.240> last<00:05:41.540> piece<00:05:42.070> take

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
wall we just left the last piece take

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.810 
wall we just left the last piece take
the<00:05:43.190> tip<00:05:43.430> away

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
the tip away

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:54.920 
the tip away
take<00:05:44.390> the<00:05:44.480> paper<00:05:44.690> away

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
is possible with one person and then we

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.990 
is possible with one person and then we
just<00:06:11.830> work<00:06:12.069> the<00:06:12.280> graphic<00:06:12.699> down<00:06:12.849> again

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.200 

and<00:06:19.000> I'm<00:06:19.150> applying<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:19.930> pressure<00:06:20.170> on<00:06:20.530> in<00:06:21.010> a<00:06:21.210> 45

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
and I'm applying the pressure on in a 45

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.630 
and I'm applying the pressure on in a 45
degree<00:06:22.450> angle<00:06:22.690> sweet<00:06:23.470> and<00:06:23.740> Rizzo<00:06:24.160> work<00:06:24.370> across

degree angle sweet and Rizzo work across

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.720 
degree angle sweet and Rizzo work across
this<00:06:24.910> graphic

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.660 

that's<00:06:30.730> now<00:06:30.970> all<00:06:31.210> down<00:06:31.480> smooth<00:06:32.160> just<00:06:33.160> a<00:06:33.340> double

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
that's now all down smooth just a double

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:44.730 
that's now all down smooth just a double
trick<00:06:42.780> pressing<00:06:43.780> a<00:06:43.840> little<00:06:43.990> bit<00:06:44.230> harder<00:06:44.650> this

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
trick pressing a little bit harder this

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.190 
trick pressing a little bit harder this
time<00:06:44.800> just<00:06:45.790> to<00:06:45.940> make<00:06:46.150> sure<00:06:46.180> everything<00:06:47.170> is

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
time just to make sure everything is

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.439 
time just to make sure everything is
down

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:53.449 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:07:00.010 

and<00:06:54.449> then<00:06:54.629> we<00:06:54.749> take<00:06:54.929> house<00:06:55.169> grandpa<00:06:55.649> just
