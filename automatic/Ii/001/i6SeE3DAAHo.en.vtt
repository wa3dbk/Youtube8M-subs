00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
could trade materials in the game is

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700 
could trade materials in the game is
someone<00:01:54.540> these<00:01:54.659> shards<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.380> don't<00:01:55.619> need

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
someone these shards and I don't need

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
someone these shards and I don't need
energy<00:01:55.920> maybe<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.670> could<00:01:56.939> give<00:01:57.060> someone<00:01:57.360> shards

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
energy maybe I could give someone shards

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
energy maybe I could give someone shards
and<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.259> give<00:01:58.409> me<00:01:58.530> exchange<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:59.130> energy

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and they can give me exchange for energy

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.980 
and they can give me exchange for energy
so<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> could<00:02:00.149> actually<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.479> some<00:02:00.570> energy<00:02:00.869> to

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so I could actually have some energy to

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
so I could actually have some energy to
rank<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.500> weapons<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.090> bit<00:02:03.360> of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
training system that could happen is the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.510 
training system that could happen is the
game<00:02:07.350> will<00:02:07.500> get<00:02:07.619> boring<00:02:08.009> quicker<00:02:08.369> because

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
thing but that's what I mean like maybe

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.390 
thing but that's what I mean like maybe
they<00:02:39.780> could<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.080> make<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> site<00:02:40.530> put<00:02:41.070> guns<00:02:41.250> up

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
they could just make a site put guns up

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.590 
they could just make a site put guns up
there<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.700> money<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:41.940> they'll<00:02:42.240> be<00:02:42.420> making

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
there for money and they'll be making

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.360 
there for money and they'll be making
money<00:02:42.960> off<00:02:43.080> bungees<00:02:43.470> game<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:43.950> don't<00:02:44.160> think

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
money off bungees game and I don't think

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.890 
money off bungees game and I don't think
bungee<00:02:44.670> would<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.780> would

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
bungee would like that and it would

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.320 
bungee would like that and it would
instantly<00:02:46.500> remove<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.220> training<00:02:47.580> system<00:02:47.940> now

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
instantly remove the training system now

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
instantly remove the training system now
