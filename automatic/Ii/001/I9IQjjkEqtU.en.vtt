00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 wonderful turn-based strategy scales 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.550
 of prehistoric Japan 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.289
 country of sakura rice and of course samurai 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.330

 samurai regiment in one general okamoto was 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.840
 defeated but during the proclamation 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.300
 generals the realm of the dead a storm arose 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.250
 and the ship leading to the moto was delayed 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 for a couple of days when he arrived in the kingdom 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.189
 it turned out that they already have one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.200
 general okamoto 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 and the place is already taken by expressing its 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.670
 outrage and at the same time chopping off a couple of heads 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 already dead guards and someone 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 picks up a small squad and goes 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.969

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.140
 miss you 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.300
 and scales of step by step can be considered 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.910
 one of the best turn-based strategies for 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.619

 and well-created cards 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 the music in the game is amazingly combat melodies 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.680
 Japanese culture sounds of movement of soldiers 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 the gnash of metal on melody beats were 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.320

 boiling volcano and here's the whole overview 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.709
 I'm talking about the pros of the game 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.900
 but what about the minuses you ask and what 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.850
 As for the minuses, then for myself, I do not 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.920
 found and although some may count 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.200
 that the graphics in the game are too cartoon 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.950
 frivolous management of places on 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.380
 clumsily 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.630
 personally for me on the collective farm in stride everything 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.370
 done for glory and that's all with you 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.470
