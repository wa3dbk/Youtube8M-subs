quite successful so Shannon tell us
about<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.420> importance<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.900> progesterone

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
about the importance of progesterone

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.189 
about the importance of progesterone
testing<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.220> any<00:00:17.369> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.670> breeding

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
testing and in any kind of breeding

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
testing and in any kind of breeding
usually<00:00:19.199> what<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.529> want<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> do<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.279> once<00:00:20.699> you

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
usually what you want to do is once you

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.400 
usually what you want to do is once you
notice<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> bitch<00:00:21.750> comes<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.170> heat

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
notice that the bitch comes in heat

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.250 
notice that the bitch comes in heat
about<00:00:22.830> five<00:00:23.160> days<00:00:23.490> after<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.300> notice<00:00:24.689> any

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
about five days after you notice any

about five days after you notice any
kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.590> discharge<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:26.609> any<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> bulb<00:00:27.240> or

kind of discharge or any kind of bulb or
swelling<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.019> want<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> take<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.650> first

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
swelling you want to take your first

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.040 
swelling you want to take your first
progesterone<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.849> generally<00:00:30.630> you're<00:00:30.779> taking

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
progesterone and generally you're taking

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
progesterone and generally you're taking
about<00:00:31.230> every<00:00:31.560> third<00:00:31.800> day<00:00:31.830> after<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.969> until

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
about every third day after that until

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.830 
about every third day after that until
you<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.649> certain<00:00:35.399> levels<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.210> indicate

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
you see certain levels that indicate

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.869 
you see certain levels that indicate
exactly<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.469> time<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> breed<00:00:38.070> yeah<00:00:38.730> well

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
exactly what time to breed yeah well

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.450 
exactly what time to breed yeah well
what<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.360> those<00:00:39.570> numbers<00:00:39.989> mean<00:00:40.260> well<00:00:41.070> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
what would those numbers mean well it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
what would those numbers mean well it
they<00:00:42.329> pretty<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> synonymous<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:43.829> like

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
they pretty much a synonymous with like

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
they pretty much a synonymous with like
your<00:00:44.129> LH<00:00:44.430> surge<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.300> title<00:00:45.600> ovulation

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
your LH surge and your title ovulation

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.250 
your LH surge and your title ovulation
so<00:00:47.059> depending<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> progesterone<00:00:48.629> levels

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
so depending on the progesterone levels

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
so depending on the progesterone levels
you<00:00:49.710> can<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.070> determine<00:00:50.489> when<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> bitch

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
you can kind of determine when the bitch

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
you can kind of determine when the bitch
ovulate<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.530> when<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> breed

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
ovulate so then you know when to breed

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
ovulate so then you know when to breed
her<00:00:53.280> well<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.030> do<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> consider<00:00:54.510> ovulation

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
her well what do you consider ovulation

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
her well what do you consider ovulation
anywhere<00:00:56.219> between<00:00:56.340> four<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.820> ten<00:00:57.120> generally

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
anywhere between four and ten generally

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
anywhere between four and ten generally
on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.219> progesterone<00:00:59.219> levels<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.829> usually

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
on the progesterone levels so usually

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
on the progesterone levels so usually
want<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.129> breed<00:01:02.340> dogs<00:01:02.699> post<00:01:03.449> ovulation

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
want to breed dogs post ovulation

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
want to breed dogs post ovulation
so<00:01:04.830> you'll<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.220> number<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:05.970> why

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
so you'll have that number and there why

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
so you'll have that number and there why
is<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.470> that's<00:01:07.470> just<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.250> that's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
is that that's just how they are that's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
is that that's just how they are that's
how<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> dog<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.570> made<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.560> basically<00:01:10.890> they

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
how the dog is made they basically they

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.140 
how the dog is made they basically they
ovulate<00:01:11.880> immature<00:01:12.450> eggs<00:01:13.610> immature<00:01:14.610> Oh<00:01:14.790> sites

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
ovulate immature eggs immature Oh sites

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
ovulate immature eggs immature Oh sites
and<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.720> after<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.200> ovulate<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and so after they ovulate they have to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.999 
and so after they ovulate they have to
go<00:01:18.000> through<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> maturation<00:01:18.780> process<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
go through a maturation process and it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
go through a maturation process and it
usually<00:01:20.189> takes<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:21.210> two<00:01:21.960> days<00:01:22.140> generally

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
usually takes about two days generally

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.530 
usually takes about two days generally
two<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> three<00:01:23.670> days<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.060> feel<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
two to three days they feel like to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.999 
two to three days they feel like to
mature<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.470> would<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:25.920> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
mature I know would there be a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.310 
mature I know would there be a
difference<00:01:26.369> when<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> use<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.720> know<00:01:27.840> natural

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
difference when you use you know natural

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.679 
difference when you use you know natural
breed<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> artificial<00:01:29.909> insemination

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
breed or the artificial insemination

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.289 
breed or the artificial insemination
absolutely<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.070> definitely<00:01:32.729> matters<00:01:32.939> on

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
absolutely and it definitely matters on

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.609 
absolutely and it definitely matters on
the<00:01:33.329> type<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> semen<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.290> breeding

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
the type of semen that you're breeding

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.370 
the type of semen that you're breeding
with<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.939> natural<00:01:36.329> breeding<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
with you know with natural breeding you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.300 
with you know with natural breeding you
don't<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.090> have<00:01:39.090> such<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> tight<00:01:39.869> window

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
don't have to have such a tight window

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
don't have to have such a tight window
for<00:01:41.310> your<00:01:41.369> breeding<00:01:41.700> management<00:01:41.850> because

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
for your breeding management because

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.740 
for your breeding management because
you're<00:01:42.899> using<00:01:43.350> live<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:45.000> fertile<00:01:45.390> semen

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you're using live very fertile semen

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.410 
you're using live very fertile semen
generally<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.520> frozen<00:01:48.180> semen

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
generally but if you use frozen semen

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
generally but if you use frozen semen
which<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> kind<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.290> consider<00:01:49.470> SEF<00:01:49.890> fertile

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
which you kind of consider SEF fertile

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.460 
which you kind of consider SEF fertile
you<00:01:50.939> need<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> time<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.229> very

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
you need to time that very very

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.130 
you need to time that very very
precisely<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.340> also<00:01:54.180> you're<00:01:54.390> limited<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.899> how

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
precisely and also you're limited to how

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.660 
precisely and also you're limited to how
many<00:01:55.200> breeding<00:01:55.649> doses<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
many breeding doses you have so

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.330 
many breeding doses you have so
generally<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.360> breeding<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:57.810> time

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
generally you're just breeding one time

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.219 
generally you're just breeding one time
with<00:01:59.340> frozen<00:01:59.579> semen<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.899> want<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.170> know

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
with frozen semen so you want to know

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.580 
with frozen semen so you want to know
exactly<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> best<00:02:02.009> time

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
exactly the best time

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.830 
exactly the best time
her<00:02:02.680> cycle<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:04.119> we<00:02:04.329> know<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.509> do<00:02:04.720> the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
you do the frozen semen and that you can

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.059 
you do the frozen semen and that you can
store<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.119> over<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:10.509> at<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> clinic<00:02:11.170> that's

quality looks good if everything looks

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.520 
quality looks good if everything looks
good<00:02:31.360> then<00:02:31.720> we<00:02:31.810> put<00:02:31.959> it<00:02:32.050> through<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.260> test

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
good then we put it through a test

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.559 
good then we put it through a test
freeze<00:02:32.860> where<00:02:33.550> we<00:02:33.640> actually<00:02:33.970> collected<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
freeze where we actually collected and

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.990 
freeze where we actually collected and
test<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.989> and<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.410> you<00:02:35.590> kind<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.950> know<00:02:36.160> once

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
test it and then you kind of know once

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.449 
test it and then you kind of know once
you<00:02:37.150> thaw<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.500> what<00:02:38.500> your<00:02:38.650> post-op<00:02:39.069> motility

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you thaw that what your post-op motility

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.690 
you thaw that what your post-op motility
is<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:41.230> just<00:02:41.489> depending<00:02:42.489> on<00:02:42.580> how

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
is and then you just depending on how

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.020 
is and then you just depending on how
many<00:02:42.760> doses<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.420> want<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.610> how<00:02:45.819> much

many doses you want you and how much
sperm<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.840> dog<00:02:47.049> gives<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.650> then<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.910> depends

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
sperm that dog gives you then it depends

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.640 
sperm that dog gives you then it depends
on<00:02:49.330> how<00:02:49.510> many<00:02:49.569> times<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.230> want<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.440> collect

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
on how many times you want to collect

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.520 
on how many times you want to collect
them<00:02:50.940> what<00:02:51.940> image<00:02:52.239> is<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.510> ideal<00:02:52.840> age<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.380> do

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
them what image is the ideal age to do

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.910 
them what image is the ideal age to do
that<00:02:53.769> two<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.910> four<00:02:55.150> probably<00:02:55.769> usually<00:02:56.769> once
