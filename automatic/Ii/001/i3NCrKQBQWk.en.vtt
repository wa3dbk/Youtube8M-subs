little<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.510> later<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.960> trailer<00:00:52.379> where

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
little bit later in the trailer where

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
little bit later in the trailer where
it's<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:52.980> Terminator<00:00:53.219> looking<00:00:53.820> thing

screenshot is the coolest of them all

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.240

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
bloodthirsty which means they're

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
bloodthirsty which means they're
probably<00:01:15.479> coming<00:01:15.720> back<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> nuclear

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
probably coming back with the nuclear

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
probably coming back with the nuclear
like<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.159> black<00:01:17.369> ops<00:01:17.610> 2<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.750> vicious<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
like in black ops 2 and the vicious and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.450 
like in black ops 2 and the vicious and
college<00:01:19.560> advanced<00:01:19.890> warfare<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.310> that's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
college advanced warfare so that's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.429 
college advanced warfare so that's
pretty<00:01:20.729> awesome<00:01:20.990> however<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.350> if

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
pretty awesome however I don't know if

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
pretty awesome however I don't know if
there's<00:01:22.590> gonna<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.770> any<00:01:22.920> sort<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
there's gonna be any sort of like

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.679 
there's gonna be any sort of like
tactical<00:01:23.820> nuke<00:01:24.030> killstreak<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
tactical nuke killstreak where you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.630 
tactical nuke killstreak where you
callin<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.619> kills<00:01:25.860> everyone<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.400> anything

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
callin and it kills everyone or anything

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.819 
callin and it kills everyone or anything
game<00:01:26.880> ending<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.720> anything<00:01:28.080> super<00:01:28.439> cool<00:01:28.650> like

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
game ending or anything super cool like

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.530 
game ending or anything super cool like
that<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> next<00:01:29.729> kill<00:01:30.030> streak<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> see

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that so in the next kill streak you see

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.420 
that so in the next kill streak you see
that<00:01:30.689> Annihilator<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:31.829> least<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> think

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
that Annihilator thing at least I think

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310 
that Annihilator thing at least I think
it's<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.640> Annihilator<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.170> saw

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it's the Annihilator thing that we saw

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
it's the Annihilator thing that we saw
earlier<00:01:34.500> in<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:35.070> special<00:01:35.460> ability

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
earlier in the little special ability

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.940 
earlier in the little special ability
where<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.150> press<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.720> buttons<00:01:36.950> that

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
where you press the two buttons that

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380 
where you press the two buttons that
looks<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:38.400> cool<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.909> kinda<00:01:39.150> reminds<00:01:39.390> me

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
looks pretty cool it kinda reminds me

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
looks pretty cool it kinda reminds me
the<00:01:39.570> Goliath<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.140> advanced<00:01:40.380> warfare<00:01:40.470> but

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the Goliath from advanced warfare but

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.340 
the Goliath from advanced warfare but
hopefully<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.570> too<00:01:42.630> overpowered

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
hopefully it's not too overpowered

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.569 
hopefully it's not too overpowered
because<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> trailer<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.369> just
