it<00:02:21.910> could<00:02:22.000> be<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.150> hollow<00:02:22.480> plastic<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.290> the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it could be a hollow plastic but the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.700 
it could be a hollow plastic but the
shell<00:02:23.800> itself<00:02:24.310> feels<00:02:24.550> like<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.060> dense

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710

shell itself feels like it's a dense
almost<00:02:26.710> rubbery<00:02:27.340> plastic<00:02:29.190> for<00:02:30.190> comparison

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
almost rubbery plastic for comparison

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.950 
almost rubbery plastic for comparison
because<00:02:30.970> I'm<00:02:31.090> sure<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.360> guys<00:02:31.510> are<00:02:31.630> gonna<00:02:31.690> want

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
because I'm sure you guys are gonna want

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.270 
because I'm sure you guys are gonna want
to<00:02:32.020> see<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.200> comparison<00:02:32.440> right<00:02:32.740> away<00:02:32.920> for<00:02:32.980> this

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
to see a comparison right away for this

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.750 
to see a comparison right away for this
let's<00:02:34.000> bring<00:02:34.210> Mario<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.490> size

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
let's bring Mario in look at the size

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
let's bring Mario in look at the size
beat<00:02:37.150> size<00:02:37.510> difference<00:02:37.960> between<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> two<00:02:38.590> of

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
beat size difference between the two of

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.210 
beat size difference between the two of
them<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:39.360> good<00:02:40.360> appropriate<00:02:41.260> scale<00:02:41.620> comparison

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
them a good appropriate scale comparison

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.750 
them a good appropriate scale comparison
as<00:02:42.340> well

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
as well

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.650 
as well
Mario<00:02:43.330> mm<00:02:43.930> buzzer<00:02:44.080> should<00:02:44.500> be<00:02:44.680> big<00:02:45.420> beefy<00:02:46.420> in

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
Mario mm buzzer should be big beefy in

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.820 
Mario mm buzzer should be big beefy in
size

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
size

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.110 
size
Mario<00:02:48.310> should<00:02:48.489> be<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.700> course<00:02:48.910> much<00:02:49.090> smaller

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
Mario should be of course much smaller

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.580 
Mario should be of course much smaller
in<00:02:49.930> size<00:02:50.790> also<00:02:51.790> one<00:02:52.000> better<00:02:52.209> -<00:02:52.510> let's<00:02:53.080> bring<00:02:53.380> in

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
in size also one better - let's bring in

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.050 
in size also one better - let's bring in
Donkey<00:02:53.890> Kong<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.370> other<00:02:54.489> figure<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.850> we<00:02:54.940> had

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
Donkey Kong the other figure that we had

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.020 
Donkey Kong the other figure that we had
a<00:02:55.090> look<00:02:55.239> at<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.660> deluxe<00:02:55.930> wave

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
a look at of the deluxe wave

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.090 
a look at of the deluxe wave
yeah<00:02:58.030> his<00:02:58.300> his<00:02:58.810> legs<00:02:59.050> is<00:02:59.380> like<00:02:59.620> stiller<00:02:59.950> an

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
yeah his his legs is like stiller an

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.240 
yeah his his legs is like stiller an
issue<00:03:00.250> but<00:03:01.120> if<00:03:01.570> you<00:03:01.780> stand<00:03:02.200> or<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:03.040> can

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
issue but if you stand or if you can

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.310 
issue but if you stand or if you can
successfully<00:03:03.700> stand<00:03:04.330> Donkey<00:03:04.810> Kong<00:03:04.989> Donkey

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
successfully stand Donkey Kong Donkey

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.410 
successfully stand Donkey Kong Donkey
Kong<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.500> technically<00:03:06.160> taller<00:03:06.550> than<00:03:06.910> Bowser

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
Kong is technically taller than Bowser

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.620 
Kong is technically taller than Bowser
but<00:03:08.140> because<00:03:08.770> his<00:03:08.950> legs<00:03:09.190> are<00:03:09.459> are<00:03:09.760> loose<00:03:10.300> the

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
but because his legs are are loose the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.050 
but because his legs are are loose the
way<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.900> they<00:03:11.050> are<00:03:11.310> most<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.459> time<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.970> would

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
way that they are most of time you would

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.760 
way that they are most of time you would
have<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.300> probably<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.690> Donkey<00:03:14.620> Kong

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
have to probably have Donkey Kong

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.470 
have to probably have Donkey Kong
displayed<00:03:15.220> like<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:15.910> then<00:03:16.030> Bowser

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
displayed like that and then Bowser

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.140 
displayed like that and then Bowser
would<00:03:16.810> win<00:03:17.080> from<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.650> height<00:03:18.160> you<00:03:18.850> know<00:03:18.970> a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
would win from a height you know a

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.199 
would win from a height you know a
height<00:03:19.450> perspective<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.790> think<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.030> one

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
height perspective I think the one

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.850 
height perspective I think the one
reason<00:03:22.600> why<00:03:22.780> Neal<00:03:23.020> just<00:03:23.110> moved<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.470> Kong<00:03:23.680> on

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
reason why Neal just moved on Kong on

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.050 
reason why Neal just moved on Kong on
the<00:03:23.950> way<00:03:24.040> here<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.310> think<00:03:24.519> one<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:24.760> reasons

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
the way here I think one of the reasons

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.300 
the way here I think one of the reasons
why<00:03:25.209> a<00:03:25.239> lot<00:03:25.570> of<00:03:25.660> people<00:03:25.930> wanted<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.380> get<00:03:26.650> Bowser

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
why a lot of people wanted to get Bowser

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.060 
why a lot of people wanted to get Bowser
as<00:03:27.700> well<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.269> because<00:03:28.840> he's<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.050> fully<00:03:29.560> realized

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
as well is because he's a fully realized

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.850 
as well is because he's a fully realized
fully<00:03:30.880> articulated<00:03:31.840> version<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.260> Bowser<00:03:32.410> we

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
fully articulated version of Bowser we

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.140 
fully articulated version of Bowser we
really<00:03:33.100> haven't<00:03:33.340> gotten<00:03:33.489> much<00:03:33.700> of<00:03:33.940> that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
really haven't gotten much of that

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.120 
really haven't gotten much of that
technically<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.110> could<00:03:35.230> count<00:03:35.470> yes<00:03:35.890> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
technically you could count yes the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.780 
technically you could count yes the
connects<00:03:36.780> Bowser<00:03:38.160> which<00:03:39.160> obviously<00:03:39.459> would<00:03:39.640> be

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
connects Bowser which obviously would be

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.729 
connects Bowser which obviously would be
the<00:03:39.940> more<00:03:40.120> minifigure<00:03:40.900> version<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.380> Bowser<00:03:41.530> he

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
the more minifigure version of Bowser he

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.040 
the more minifigure version of Bowser he
had<00:03:41.890> articulation<00:03:42.730> but<00:03:43.150> there<00:03:43.540> never<00:03:43.750> really

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
had articulation but there never really

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.740 
had articulation but there never really
has<00:03:44.170> been<00:03:44.350> a<00:03:44.380> good<00:03:44.680> beefy<00:03:45.489> sized<00:03:45.940> version<00:03:46.390> of

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
has been a good beefy sized version of

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.410 
has been a good beefy sized version of
Bowser<00:03:47.110> really<00:03:47.350> up<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:48.070> point<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.640> the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
Bowser really up to this point and the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.819 
Bowser really up to this point and the
reason<00:03:49.750> why<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> lot<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:50.140> people<00:03:50.350> also<00:03:50.530> want<00:03:50.769> to

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
reason why a lot of people also want to

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.550 
reason why a lot of people also want to
get<00:03:50.950> Bowser<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.519> up<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.120> point<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.660> this

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
get Bowser is up to the point of this

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.350 
get Bowser is up to the point of this
guy<00:03:54.070> really<00:03:54.370> being<00:03:54.549> released

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
guy really being released

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.420 
guy really being released
the<00:03:55.840> s.h.figuarts<00:03:56.790> Mario<00:03:58.440> which<00:03:59.440> is<00:03:59.770> a<00:03:59.800> really

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
the s.h.figuarts Mario which is a really

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.850 
the s.h.figuarts Mario which is a really
super<00:04:00.880> articulated<00:04:01.450> Mario<00:04:01.900> didn't<00:04:02.650> really

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
super articulated Mario didn't really

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.610 
super articulated Mario didn't really
have<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.160> Bowser<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> copy<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.870> accompany<00:04:05.170> him

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
have a Bowser to a copy to accompany him

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.950 
have a Bowser to a copy to accompany him
and<00:04:05.890> up<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.820> point<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.270> maybe<00:04:07.600> figure

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
and up to the point that maybe figure

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.840 
and up to the point that maybe figure
arts<00:04:08.170> will<00:04:08.320> eventually<00:04:08.680> release<00:04:09.040> a<00:04:09.340> Bowser

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
arts will eventually release a Bowser

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.620 
arts will eventually release a Bowser
you<00:04:10.240> got<00:04:10.900> yourself<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.410> perfect<00:04:11.740> fit<00:04:12.430> for<00:04:12.730> SH

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
you got yourself a perfect fit for SH

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.410 
you got yourself a perfect fit for SH
FiguArts<00:04:14.170> Mario<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:15.880> think<00:04:16.000> that's<00:04:16.269> why<00:04:16.390> a

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
FiguArts Mario so I think that's why a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
have Bowser is a really good looking

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.540 
have Bowser is a really good looking
piece<00:04:43.390> he's<00:04:44.170> also<00:04:44.350> quite<00:04:44.620> articulated<00:04:45.370> to

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
piece he's also quite articulated to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.880 
piece he's also quite articulated to
doesn't<00:04:46.510> have<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.630> lot<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.900> articulation<00:04:47.740> and

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
doesn't have a lot of articulation and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.980 
doesn't have a lot of articulation and
by<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.070> lot<00:04:48.340> I<00:04:48.370> mean<00:04:48.670> he<00:04:48.850> has<00:04:48.970> no<00:04:49.000> articulation

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
by a lot I mean he has no articulation

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.480 
by a lot I mean he has no articulation
in<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.170> head<00:04:50.350> he<00:04:50.500> has<00:04:50.590> no<00:04:50.770> articulation<00:04:51.160> in

in the head he has no articulation in
the<00:04:51.580> mouth<00:04:51.730> however<00:04:52.000> when<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:52.870> get<00:04:52.960> to<00:04:53.110> like

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
the mouth however when you get to like

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.470 
the mouth however when you get to like
the<00:04:53.380> arms<00:04:53.680> themselves<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.400> arms<00:04:54.700> are<00:04:54.910> on<00:04:54.940> ball

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
the arms themselves the arms are on ball

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.320 
the arms themselves the arms are on ball
joints<00:04:56.020> it's<00:04:56.500> got<00:04:56.620> hinged<00:04:57.130> elbows<00:04:57.640> these

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330

rotations<00:04:59.050> in<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.320> hands<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.010> more

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
rotations in the hands a little more

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.740 
rotations in the hands a little more
limited<00:05:00.580> in<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.820> hand<00:05:01.060> but<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.300> hands<00:05:01.570> also

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
limited in the hand but the hands also

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.310 
limited in the hand but the hands also
hinge<00:05:02.590> out<00:05:03.450> I'm<00:05:04.450> curious<00:05:04.930> as<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.080> why<00:05:05.260> the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
hinge out I'm curious as to why the

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.780 
hinge out I'm curious as to why the
hands<00:05:05.830> really<00:05:06.010> hinge<00:05:06.310> out<00:05:06.460> because<00:05:06.669> they

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
hands really hinge out because they

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.730 
hands really hinge out because they
can't<00:05:07.390> really<00:05:07.510> move<00:05:07.810> them<00:05:08.169> all<00:05:08.320> that<00:05:08.530> much

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
can't really move them all that much

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.030 
can't really move them all that much
they<00:05:09.010> hinge<00:05:09.669> out<00:05:09.940> ever<00:05:10.240> so<00:05:10.630> slightly<00:05:11.080> and<00:05:11.440> then

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
they hinge out ever so slightly and then

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.260 
they hinge out ever so slightly and then
of<00:05:12.160> course<00:05:12.370> his<00:05:12.520> legs<00:05:12.730> do<00:05:12.970> move<00:05:13.320> move<00:05:14.320> out<00:05:14.560> yes

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
of course his legs do move move out yes

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.190 
of course his legs do move move out yes
forward<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.510> back<00:05:16.660> but<00:05:16.870> when<00:05:16.990> you<00:05:17.050> start

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
forward and back but when you start

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.600 
forward and back but when you start
moving<00:05:17.320> them<00:05:17.530> forward<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:18.010> gives<00:05:18.310> them<00:05:18.460> more

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
moving them forward it gives them more

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.000 
moving them forward it gives them more
of<00:05:18.669> a<00:05:18.790> sitting<00:05:19.330> position<00:05:19.840> than<00:05:20.590> anything<00:05:20.740> else

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
of a sitting position than anything else

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.610 
of a sitting position than anything else
and<00:05:21.400> last<00:05:22.330> but<00:05:22.510> certainly<00:05:22.570> not<00:05:22.840> least<00:05:22.990> he<00:05:23.440> has

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
and last but certainly not least he has

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.420 
and last but certainly not least he has
tail<00:05:24.040> swivel<00:05:25.200> now<00:05:26.200> if<00:05:26.650> you<00:05:26.890> ask<00:05:26.980> me<00:05:27.220> that's

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
tail swivel now if you ask me that's

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.280 
tail swivel now if you ask me that's
just<00:05:27.640> that's<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.300> perfect<00:05:29.020> amount<00:05:29.200> of

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
just that's a perfect amount of

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.690 
just that's a perfect amount of
articulation<00:05:29.950> that<00:05:30.040> you<00:05:30.190> would<00:05:30.280> need<00:05:30.430> for<00:05:30.640> a

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
articulation that you would need for a

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.430 
articulation that you would need for a
piece<00:05:30.850> like<00:05:31.030> this<00:05:31.090> I<00:05:31.450> don't<00:05:32.050> need<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.290> have

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
piece like this I don't need to have

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.500 
piece like this I don't need to have
articulated<00:05:33.100> knees<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.760> don't<00:05:34.150> have<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.360> have

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
articulated knees I don't have to have

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.080 
articulated knees I don't have to have
necessarily<00:05:34.720> an<00:05:35.080> articulated<00:05:35.770> mouth<00:05:36.090> knees

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
necessarily an articulated mouth knees

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.990 
necessarily an articulated mouth knees
especially<00:05:37.330> for<00:05:38.290> peace<00:05:38.740> this<00:05:39.010> heavy<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.640> think

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
especially for peace this heavy I think

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.610 
especially for peace this heavy I think
if<00:05:40.210> you<00:05:40.300> start<00:05:40.479> throwing<00:05:40.690> articulation<00:05:41.500> in

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
if you start throwing articulation in

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.260 
if you start throwing articulation in
the<00:05:41.710> knees<00:05:41.890> and<00:05:42.280> then<00:05:42.400> also<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:42.880> got<00:05:43.030> a<00:05:43.060> figure

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
the knees and then also you got a figure

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.700 
the knees and then also you got a figure
that's<00:05:43.540> going<00:05:43.690> to<00:05:43.750> get<00:05:43.870> loose<00:05:44.169> in<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.560> knees

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
that's going to get loose in the knees

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.010 
that's going to get loose in the knees
and<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:45.250> don't<00:05:45.580> want<00:05:45.790> that<00:05:46.030> I'm<00:05:46.540> happy<00:05:46.990> with

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
and I don't want that I'm happy with

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.140 
and I don't want that I'm happy with
Bowser<00:05:47.500> just<00:05:47.979> the<00:05:48.160> way<00:05:48.310> he<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.850> I<00:05:50.220> would<00:05:51.220> say<00:05:51.580> he

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
Bowser just the way he is I would say he

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.510 
Bowser just the way he is I would say he
is<00:05:52.180> probably<00:05:52.600> the<00:05:52.930> jewel<00:05:53.320> of<00:05:53.680> this<00:05:53.890> set<00:05:54.280> and

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
is probably the jewel of this set and

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.909 
is probably the jewel of this set and
still<00:05:54.820> fairly<00:05:55.090> easy<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.540> find<00:05:55.810> as<00:05:56.050> well<00:05:56.260> though

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
still fairly easy to find as well though

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.830 
still fairly easy to find as well though
I<00:05:56.950> didn't<00:05:57.280> find<00:05:57.460> him<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.669> one<00:05:57.910> toys-r-us<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:58.690> did

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
I didn't find him in one toys-r-us I did

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.540 
I didn't find him in one toys-r-us I did
check<00:05:59.050> out<00:05:59.169> another<00:05:59.350> Toys<00:05:59.650> R<00:05:59.740> Us<00:05:59.830> and<00:06:00.040> they<00:06:00.340> had

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
check out another Toys R Us and they had
