00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi all welcome to ven i want 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.189
 you show how you own one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.590
 flower crown is very often 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.030
 back at festivals but also just at 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.740
 want my way to outfit on fun 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.880
 by means of such a kind of eh yes 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 her hand 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.720
 it bohemian care it looks very 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.400
 cute out and just make your outfit 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 just something fun I think that the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240
 Primark and I thought why don't you go 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.140
 just make it yourself and that is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.519
 happens 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.220
 So you were not allowed to figure out how to do this yourself 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.570
 You can make it keep looking for it 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 This takes yourself of course 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.329
 needed flowers and pincers 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 they could have had rhine and ijssel before you 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.210
 is going to start with the floral wreath 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.420
 Naturally important that you take your head off 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.420
 with it 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.430
 when i think the format is good he 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 continues to illuminate 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.420
 the iron wire and I do this on this one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 way I do nothing with the pinches three 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.670
 pieces off and then make the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.670
 braid shape 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 when the braid is ready I try 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.650
 for a moment that fits well with my 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.850
 head out 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.290
 and then I continue with it 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 cut a flowers from the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.770
 stems off 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.920
 And now it's time to get the flower fixed 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.160
 line with the crown and that also on this one 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.160
 way 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.580
 when i glued all the big flour 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.680
 I'll leave the crown a little while longer 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.430
 dry and then stick a piece 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.110
 tape to be extra secure 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.820
 and finally all the little flowers 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.440
 you can also be this for a while 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.670
 just do it without a line you can do it too 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.910
 has a very loud laugh but I do it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.910
 without 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.470
 that is my way of how you are one 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.760
 can make a flower wreath 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.840
 and if you had a better way 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.370
 then leave it mainly in the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.599
 comments or I am very curious how you 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.069
 could make this even more 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 thank you very much for watching and see you 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.599
 next doeg 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.830
 they sat and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.160
 she had heard from him 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.160
