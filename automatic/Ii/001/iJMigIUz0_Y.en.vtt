this pack it's it's widely acclaimed

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.959 
this pack it's it's widely acclaimed
it's<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.620> huge<00:00:11.010> pack<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.610> been<00:00:11.790> around

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
it's a huge pack it's been around

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.990 
it's a huge pack it's been around
forever<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.920> I<00:00:13.920> don't<00:00:14.429> understand<00:00:14.849> why

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
forever and I don't understand why

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.760 
forever and I don't understand why
you're<00:00:15.150> doing<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.540> because<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.230> usually<00:00:16.500> do

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
you're doing it because you usually do

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.870 
you're doing it because you usually do
smaller<00:00:17.070> resource<00:00:17.490> bags<00:00:17.730> well<00:00:18.500> yeah<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:20.400> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
smaller resource bags well yeah but this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
smaller resource bags well yeah but this
is<00:00:21.270> also<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.260> best<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.010> that's<00:00:23.250> kind

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
is also one of the best so that's kind

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.970 
is also one of the best so that's kind
of<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:23.609> reasoning<00:00:23.970> behind<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:25.080> been

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
of my reasoning behind it it's been

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.150 
of my reasoning behind it it's been
around<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.460> longest<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:27.529> widely<00:00:28.529> used<00:00:28.920> but

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
around the longest it's widely used but

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.370 
around the longest it's widely used but
it's<00:00:29.279> also<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.640> best<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.510> I<00:00:30.539> figured<00:00:30.660> I'd<00:00:31.199> show

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it's also the best so I figured I'd show

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.709 
it's also the best so I figured I'd show
it<00:00:31.410> off<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.830> guys<00:00:32.120> right<00:00:33.120> here<00:00:33.180> if<00:00:33.600> we

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
it off for you guys right here if we

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
it off for you guys right here if we
start<00:00:34.020> out<00:00:34.140> we've<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.440> kind<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.829> cartoony

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
start out we've got kind of a cartoony

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.479 
start out we've got kind of a cartoony
style<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:36.559> textures<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.160> here

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
style of textures as you can see here

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.110 
style of textures as you can see here
what's<00:00:39.090> really<00:00:39.450> adds<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.410> hack<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.969> we

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what's really adds to the hack and if we

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.630 
what's really adds to the hack and if we
break<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.809> block<00:00:43.200> or<00:00:43.379> something<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:44.309> can<00:00:44.489> see

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
break a block or something you can see

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400 
break a block or something you can see
that<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:45.329> away<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.750> texture<00:00:46.140> pack<00:00:46.260> has

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that right away this texture pack has

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.650 
that right away this texture pack has
style<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.610> look<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> block<00:00:48.270> breaking

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
style just look at the block breaking

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.779 
style just look at the block breaking
animation<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> light<00:00:49.500> surface<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.160> that

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
animation on a light surface here that

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.939 
animation on a light surface here that
is<00:00:51.000> amazing<00:00:51.239> I've<00:00:51.719> never<00:00:52.289> seen<00:00:52.410> any<00:00:52.770> other

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
is amazing I've never seen any other

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.639 
is amazing I've never seen any other
block<00:00:53.190> breaking<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.750> that's<00:00:55.469> just

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
block breaking like that that's just

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.130 
block breaking like that that's just
amazing<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.030> hop<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:57.780> creative

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
amazing so if we hop back into creative

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
amazing so if we hop back into creative
mode<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.489> head<00:00:59.670> down<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
mode here we can head down to the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.790 
mode here we can head down to the
water's<00:01:00.480> edge<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.719> take<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> look<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
water's edge and take a look at the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.289 
water's edge and take a look at the
water<00:01:02.059> this<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.539> incredible<00:01:04.729> this<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.909> really

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

water this is incredible this is really
my<00:01:06.570> favorite<00:01:06.780> part<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> texture<00:01:07.590> pack<00:01:07.740> all

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
my favorite part of the texture pack all

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.679 
my favorite part of the texture pack all
together<00:01:08.250> even<00:01:09.060> better<00:01:09.240> than<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> block

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
together even better than the block

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.870 
together even better than the block
breaking<00:01:10.080> animation<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> never<00:01:11.580> been

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
breaking animation there is never been

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
breaking animation there is never been
another<00:01:12.180> resource<00:01:12.600> pack<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.049> has<00:01:13.110> had<00:01:13.350> water

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
another resource pack that has had water

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.219 
another resource pack that has had water
that's<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.630> one<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:15.990> my

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
at the blocks basically this is one of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.240 
at the blocks basically this is one of
the<00:01:21.900> best<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:24.710> it's<00:01:25.710> just

say well let's see if we can dig down
and<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> cave<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.950> placed

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and get a cave here I have not placed

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.230 
and get a cave here I have not placed
this<00:01:32.729> before<00:01:33.119> time<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.780> I'll<00:01:34.259> see<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.579> can<00:01:36.119> get

right fine I'm gonna go find another

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.789 
right fine I'm gonna go find another
cave<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.610> while<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:50.970> doing<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.530> you'll<00:01:52.530> see

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
cave but while I'm doing that you'll see
