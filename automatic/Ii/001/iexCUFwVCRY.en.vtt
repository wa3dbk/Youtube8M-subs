trying to put the rhinestones like we're

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.010 
trying to put the rhinestones like we're
like<00:05:25.590> try<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.919> keep<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.610> same<00:05:27.020> measurement

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
like try to keep the same measurement

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.740 
like try to keep the same measurement
distance<00:05:28.440> from<00:05:29.130> it<00:05:29.310> yes<00:05:29.699> this<00:05:30.270> one's<00:05:30.510> a<00:05:30.600> little

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
distance from it yes this one's a little

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.960 
distance from it yes this one's a little
crooked<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:31.410> I'm<00:05:31.560> going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.830> try<00:05:32.010> to<00:05:32.040> fix<00:05:32.760> it

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
crooked and I'm going to try to fix it

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.250 
crooked and I'm going to try to fix it
but<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.419> move<00:05:33.840> in<00:05:34.050> which<00:05:34.410> that's<00:05:34.979> cool<00:05:35.280> matter

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
but I move in which that's cool matter

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.000 
but I move in which that's cool matter
no<00:05:37.260> one's<00:05:37.500> perfect<00:05:39.290> so<00:05:40.290> it<00:05:40.440> just<00:05:40.470> put<00:05:40.830> some

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
no one's perfect so it just put some

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.770 
no one's perfect so it just put some
glue<00:05:41.220> in<00:05:41.340> here<00:05:42.440> and<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.620> will<00:05:43.710> fix<00:05:43.979> it<00:05:44.780> in

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
glue in here and that will fix it in

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.029 
glue in here and that will fix it in
then<00:05:46.199> I'm<00:05:47.130> going<00:05:47.280> to<00:05:47.340> Center<00:05:47.669> it<00:05:47.699> again<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:49.039> I

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
then I'm going to Center it again and I

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.490 
then I'm going to Center it again and I
will<00:05:50.100> see<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.370> like<00:05:50.580> click<00:05:51.360> on<00:05:51.539> or<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:51.960> yeah<00:05:52.289> see

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
regular the crazy glue you could also

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.650 
regular the crazy glue you could also
use<00:06:07.770> the<00:06:08.070> ones<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.400> we<00:06:08.520> use<00:06:08.639> for<00:06:08.760> when<00:06:09.539> we

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
use the ones that we use for when we

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.040 
use the ones that we use for when we
