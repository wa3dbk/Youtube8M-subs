00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
I'm sure the set of instruction so this

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.280 
I'm sure the set of instruction so this
is<00:01:17.909> where<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> top<00:01:18.299> panel<00:01:18.509> looks<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.200> you

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
is where the top panel looks like as you

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.950 
is where the top panel looks like as you
can<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.189> beautiful<00:01:20.960> shiny

look over here is silver painted

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410 
look over here is silver painted
actually<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.649> be<00:01:40.770> precise<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.240> where<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
actually to be precise this is where the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.380 
actually to be precise this is where the
top<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.780> looks<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.820> these<00:01:44.820> are<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.090> tilt

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
top one looks like these are the tilt

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.660 
top one looks like these are the tilt
angles<00:01:45.720> as<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.229> your<00:01:46.409> very<00:01:47.340> good

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
angles as you can see your very good

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
angles as you can see your very good
tilt<00:01:47.939> angles<00:01:48.329> somewhere<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.259> hand<00:01:49.649> 45

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
tilt angles somewhere on one hand 45

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.319 
tilt angles somewhere on one hand 45
degrees<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.140> fairly<00:01:52.140> slim<00:01:52.969> just<00:01:53.969> like<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
degrees and fairly slim just like the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.359 
degrees and fairly slim just like the
other<00:01:54.450> B<00:01:54.600> series<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.110> no<00:01:55.229> difference<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
other B series is no difference in this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.139 
other B series is no difference in this
and<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.270> other<00:01:57.390> D<00:01:57.570> series<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> color

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
and the other D series but for the color

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.609 
and the other D series but for the color
differential<00:02:02.899> so<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.200> way<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:04.380> looks

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
differential so this is the way it looks

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.380 
differential so this is the way it looks
once<00:02:04.920> opened<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.430> as<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.789> can<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.210> got<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
once opened up as you can see it's got a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.920 
once opened up as you can see it's got a
glare<00:02:07.170> HD<00:02:07.619> LED<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.479> reflective

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
glare HD LED and it's a reflective

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.870 
glare HD LED and it's a reflective
screen<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.740> keep<00:02:10.920> seeing<00:02:11.190> yourself<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.760> the

time<00:02:11.910> on<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> screen<00:02:12.710> so<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.190> use

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
time on the screen so you have to use

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.860 
time on the screen so you have to use
anti<00:02:14.670> layer<00:02:14.850> HD<00:02:15.150> coating

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
anti layer HD coating

the<00:04:52.540> base<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:53.020> pretty<00:04:53.920> simple<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.550> entire

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
the base is pretty simple this entire

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.840 
the base is pretty simple this entire
part<00:04:55.180> in<00:04:55.630> cases<00:04:56.050> Ram<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:57.460> hard<00:04:57.669> drive

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
part in cases Ram the hard drive

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.659 
part in cases Ram the hard drive
although<00:04:58.090> is<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.390> little<00:04:58.690> difficult<00:04:59.050> to

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
although is a little difficult to

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.280 
although is a little difficult to
extract<00:05:00.669> because<00:05:00.880> what<00:05:01.660> if<00:05:01.750> you<00:05:01.840> know<00:05:02.110> the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
extract because what if you know the

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.970 
extract because what if you know the
videos<00:05:02.620> how<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.280> entire<00:05:04.470> bottom<00:05:05.470> panel<00:05:05.800> has

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
videos how the entire bottom panel has

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.560 
videos how the entire bottom panel has
to<00:05:06.130> be<00:05:06.220> open<00:05:06.520> for<00:05:06.700> knowing<00:05:07.090> the<00:05:07.210> hard<00:05:07.360> drive

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
to be open for knowing the hard drive

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.200 
to be open for knowing the hard drive
but<00:05:08.260> grading<00:05:08.890> gram<00:05:09.130> is<00:05:09.280> fairly<00:05:09.640> simple<00:05:09.940> you

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
but grading gram is fairly simple you

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.820 
but grading gram is fairly simple you
have<00:05:10.300> good<00:05:10.600> dissipation<00:05:11.140> meant<00:05:11.350> areas<00:05:11.680> were

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
have good dissipation meant areas were

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.610 
have good dissipation meant areas were
here<00:05:12.070> here<00:05:12.370> as<00:05:12.580> well<00:05:12.760> as<00:05:12.850> here<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:14.200> speakers

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
here here as well as here so speakers

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.130 
here here as well as here so speakers
are<00:05:14.740> over<00:05:14.860> here<00:05:15.130> actually<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:15.820> is<00:05:16.060> the<00:05:16.930> place

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
are over here actually this is the place

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.340 
are over here actually this is the place
where<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.410> speakers<00:05:17.800> are<00:05:17.919> base<00:05:18.070> to<00:05:18.370> speakers

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
where the speakers are base to speakers

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.960 
where the speakers are base to speakers
the<00:05:20.940> differential<00:05:21.940> is<00:05:22.120> not<00:05:22.150> there<00:05:22.660> in<00:05:23.140> the

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
the differential is not there in the

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.240 
the differential is not there in the
studs<00:05:24.970> so<00:05:27.630> all-in-all<00:05:28.630> very<00:05:29.470> good<00:05:29.650> design<00:05:29.980> by

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
studs so all-in-all very good design by

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.500 
studs so all-in-all very good design by
HP<00:05:30.610> but<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:32.470> has<00:05:32.680> low<00:05:33.610> battery<00:05:33.790> backup<00:05:34.240> issues

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
HP but it has low battery backup issues

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.030 
HP but it has low battery backup issues
because<00:05:34.870> it's<00:05:34.990> got<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.200> full<00:05:35.380> processor<00:05:35.770> and<00:05:36.010> a

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
because it's got a full processor and a

you beyond three hours initially and
then<00:05:39.070> maybe<00:05:39.450> it<00:05:40.450> will<00:05:40.630> be<00:05:40.780> K<00:05:40.990> in<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.830> next<00:05:42.040> 6

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
then maybe it will be K in the next 6

then maybe it will be K in the next 6
months<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.610> around<00:05:42.850> one<00:05:43.210> and<00:05:43.330> a<00:05:43.390> half<00:05:43.540> hours
