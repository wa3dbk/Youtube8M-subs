are two different color missiles one of

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.280 
are two different color missiles one of
them<00:01:49.450> was<00:01:49.920> gray<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:51.340> think<00:01:51.369> a<00:01:51.850> pig<00:01:52.060> was<00:01:52.240> gray<00:01:52.420> to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
them was gray I think a pig was gray to

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
them was gray I think a pig was gray to
match<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.619> rocket<00:01:54.009> but<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:54.729> like<00:01:54.909> yellow

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.719 

because<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.810> shows<00:01:59.080> yellow<00:01:59.439> on<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.710> car<00:01:59.920> so

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
because it shows yellow on the car so

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.940 
because it shows yellow on the car so
therefore<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.090> wanted<00:02:01.330> yellow<00:02:04.560> Fatman<00:02:05.560> itself

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
therefore I wanted yellow Fatman itself

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.919 
therefore I wanted yellow Fatman itself

we've got the c-clamp for the action

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.789 
we've got the c-clamp for the action
figure<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.239> kind<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.470> more<00:02:32.680> or<00:02:32.769> less

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799

painted<00:02:54.579> silver<00:02:54.970> as<00:02:55.090> well<00:02:55.299> but<00:02:55.750> they're<00:02:55.930> not

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
painted silver as well but they're not

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.539 
painted silver as well but they're not
on<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.310> boots<00:02:58.680> these<00:02:59.680> little<00:02:59.950> guards<00:03:02.549> because

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
on the boots these little guards because

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.890 
on the boots these little guards because
after<00:03:03.850> all<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.060> may<00:03:04.209> hit<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.420> top<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.810> a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
after all you may hit the top of a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.330 
after all you may hit the top of a
building<00:03:05.079> or<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.440> tower<00:03:05.650> or<00:03:05.890> something<00:03:06.190> and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
building or a tower or something and

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.849 
building or a tower or something and
then<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.579> may<00:03:06.730> break<00:03:06.970> your<00:03:07.030> shins<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.859> must

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
then you may break your shins so must

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.740 
then you may break your shins so must
have<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.100> guards<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:10.150> I'm<00:03:10.269> guessing<00:03:10.600> this<00:03:10.690> is

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
have the guards and I'm guessing this is

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.300 
have the guards and I'm guessing this is
supposed<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.049> be<00:03:11.109> painted<00:03:11.470> silver<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.920> the

supposed to be painted silver on the
gloves<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:12.820> well<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.739> for<00:03:14.739> something<00:03:15.100> really

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
gloves as well and for something really

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.800 
gloves as well and for something really
rare<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.060> course<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.390> tells<00:03:16.570> us<00:03:16.690> this

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
rare and of course it tells us this

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.890 
rare and of course it tells us this
1990s<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:18.100> painted<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.880> back<00:03:19.090> usually

where the pain is starting to a

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.440 
where the pain is starting to a
and<00:03:57.650> what<00:03:58.160> we<00:03:58.250> do<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.640> we<00:03:58.940> take<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.300> little

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
and what we do is we take the little

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.640 
and what we do is we take the little
c-clamp<00:04:00.050> and<00:04:00.200> we<00:04:00.650> paste<00:04:01.520> it<00:04:01.760> on<00:04:02.410> Batman's<00:04:03.410> back

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.640 
c-clamp and we paste it on Batman's back
like<00:04:03.920> so

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
like so

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.310 
like so
we<00:04:07.090> pivot<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.210> engines<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.630> little<00:04:08.810> bit<00:04:08.960> I'm

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
we pivot the engines a little bit I'm

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.390 
we pivot the engines a little bit I'm
guessing<00:04:09.710> they're<00:04:09.800> supposed<00:04:10.070> to<00:04:10.100> be<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.220> bad

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
guessing they're supposed to be a bad

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.280 
guessing they're supposed to be a bad
signal<00:04:10.730> there<00:04:10.910> but<00:04:11.150> there's<00:04:11.330> not<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:14.290> pivot

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
signal there but there's not and pivot

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.340 
signal there but there's not and pivot
the<00:04:15.380> engines<00:04:16.780> make<00:04:17.780> it<00:04:17.900> look<00:04:18.019> like<00:04:18.170> he's

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
the engines make it look like he's

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.390 
the engines make it look like he's
flying<00:04:19.209> bubble<00:04:20.209> dome<00:04:20.360> over<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:21.110> safety<00:04:21.830> so

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
flying bubble dome over for safety so

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.800 
flying bubble dome over for safety so
that<00:04:22.460> we<00:04:22.670> don't<00:04:22.880> get<00:04:22.970> no<00:04:23.120> bugs<00:04:23.360> in<00:04:23.480> this<00:04:23.600> mouth

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
that we don't get no bugs in this mouth

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.980 
that we don't get no bugs in this mouth
and<00:04:24.590> here<00:04:25.070> we<00:04:25.160> have<00:04:27.190> turbojet<00:04:28.190> Batman<00:04:28.990> with

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
and here we have turbojet Batman with

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.380 
and here we have turbojet Batman with
his<00:04:30.200> wrist<00:04:30.680> firing<00:04:31.070> rocket<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.940> must<00:04:35.210> say

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
his wrist firing rocket and I must say

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.680 
his wrist firing rocket and I must say
that<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:36.830> backpack<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:37.820> really<00:04:38.120> heavy<00:04:38.300> so

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
that the backpack is really heavy so

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.780 
that the backpack is really heavy so
you'd<00:04:39.020> have<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.380> display<00:04:39.770> him<00:04:39.980> with<00:04:40.370> the

you'd have to display him with the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.970 
you'd have to display him with the
missile<00:04:41.150> or<00:04:41.270> else<00:04:41.390> he<00:04:41.780> is<00:04:41.960> not<00:04:42.260> going<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.800> stand

missile or else he is not going to stand
up<00:04:45.130> it<00:04:46.130> does<00:04:46.370> leave<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.610> little<00:04:46.970> bit<00:04:47.210> more<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.630> be

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
up it does leave a little bit more to be

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.070 
up it does leave a little bit more to be
desired<00:04:48.910> just<00:04:49.910> because<00:04:50.180> everything<00:04:50.660> is<00:04:50.780> so
