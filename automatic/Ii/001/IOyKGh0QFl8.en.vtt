00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.799
 We will use the following 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:13.230
 Ingredients 300 grams of medium rice 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.230

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.700
 tablespoons of crushed tomato a 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.329
 extra virgin olive and salt 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.550
 we're doing well all the vegetables and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.550
 cut into small cubes 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.170
 when we have finished we put a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 Casserole over medium-high heat and take a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.239
 trickle of virgin olive oil 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.859
 Once hot we started suffering the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.250
 harder ingredients like the pinion and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250
 the onion 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.600
 when they are softening we throw the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.220
 zucchini mushrooms and garlic and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.420
 stir from time to time until 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.420
 all vegetables are overturned 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.439
 now we throw the paprika and the tomato 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.439
 crushed and remove a few moments 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.900
 we toss the rice and we roll it during 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.710
 a few minutes to get us 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.710
 be more loose 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 now we throw the water we have thrown three 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.480
 rice cups so we would have 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.790
 than to throw 6-8 small cups of water 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.010
 You can replace the water with broth 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.260
 vegetables 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.510
 we add a teaspoon of coloring 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.510
 prepared paella and salt to taste 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.030
 stir and cook on high heat 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.430
 until it starts to boil and when 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.560
 take five minutes boiling down to 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.170
 slow fire until all the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.170
 water we stir from time to time 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.810
 then let stand 5 or 10 minutes and 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.459
 is ready 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.890
