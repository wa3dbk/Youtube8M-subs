00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.669
 little what is the kitchen front 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.529

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.550
 colors in black and white and the great 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.200
 particularity that this campaign has is 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.929

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.590
 advantages that ica offers us in its 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.210
 Models 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.760
 let's leave it off so that we do not 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.960
 goal noise and we have it there many times 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.670
 They ask me how these are cleaned 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.340
 bells always carry two behind 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.290
 filters and is super easy to access 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.580
 Today we show you the detail of 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.580
 how are these bells inside 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.520
 in this model and in this combination with 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.010
 the white countertop we have placed a 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.600
 Top opening swing always 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.950
 our brake system pause 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.380
 that is, once we set the height 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.540
 of our head we leave it standing and 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.390
 just to close we push it 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.140
 just below a blind that we 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.729
 It serves for all the small 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.710
 appliance and also for all 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.259
 our preserves and the tower of 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.700
 oven and micro washing machine that we went to see 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.040
 from the other take that sure what 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.690
 let's see better good friends like you 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.340
 said we are going to gut this area of 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.869
 the kitchen look at you when we are 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.789
 a little short of space one of the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.470
 most actionable technical solutions is 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.140
 Always place the washing machine tower 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.509
 oven and microwave us in kitchens 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.830
 djr recommend or advise always 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.289
 that you can the appliances you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.420
 acquire new the place the washing machine 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.460
 of integration because the door the lid 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.020
 and then yes it gives us the feeling of 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.960
 that simply your furniture and not a 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.399
 machine and the oven in 45 centimeters and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.229
 it's not 60 that is the most conventional 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.450
 because because that triggers us a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.880
 the height of the microwave 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.950
 fix with the 45 change oven 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.210
 side note that as now it is to carry 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.170
 a plate take a glass that gives a 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.560
 average height 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.929
 and a conventional height as I said 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 before the blind we have a choice of 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.870
 design and we also download it with the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.870
 client to bring everything to the same line 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.010
 at the same bottom but what is the problem 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.450
 We always thought that we had very, very 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.459
 near the water area you know that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.780
 compress and try to put all the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.640
 services within the stay of the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.410
 kitchen so we decided to retire in the 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.300
 bottom part a little back the the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.690
 pressure what advantages does the pressure give us to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.520
 good 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.290
 I imagine that our client when 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.450
 really be installed here have here 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.730
 Well, all your coffee capsules are 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.500
 toast its fruit in short everything small 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.540
 and what is the final advantage all to say 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.800
 a trick since you have just visit 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.170
 when they ring the bell it 's all a 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.180
 little disorganized I catch it fast what 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.430
 you get inside the blind 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.340
 land and kitchen ready to receive 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.659
 we have two little things left 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.709
 to see the lower illumination that 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.420
 our client also asked us 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.519
 lower illumination in the part of the 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.409
 countertop and we close in that bar and 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.750
 we unveiled and how we would put the bar 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.350
 your house with a round shape or shapes 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.960
 straight 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.460
 good from love the secret of the 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.800
 bar of our client in this case 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.360
 We decided to make it a more kind way 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.770
 a slightly more round shape because 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.540
 because it is in the transit of the 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.340
 terrace and for us it was easier 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.200
 circular with the bar in the form 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.120
 round we have also put a dresser 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.040
 in the back to see a super 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.540
 One meter piece of furniture that helps us 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.340
 place all our great products 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040
 everything we can not get into it 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.510
 in the overall design of the kitchen what 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
 we have here in the back same 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.800
 the TV that for many where I 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.780
 meeting included is indispensable in 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.340
