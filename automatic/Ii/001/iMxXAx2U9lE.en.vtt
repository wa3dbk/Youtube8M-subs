so I want to just describe for the sake
of<00:00:03.330> describing<00:00:04.170> it<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.650> myself<00:00:05.160> maybe

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
of describing it and from myself maybe

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.390 
of describing it and from myself maybe
what<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.899> steps<00:00:07.170> are<00:00:07.350> that<00:00:07.410> I'm<00:00:07.680> doing<00:00:07.859> to<00:00:08.220> cut

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
what the steps are that I'm doing to cut

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.860 
what the steps are that I'm doing to cut
this<00:00:08.550> thread<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.120> I'm<00:00:09.450> sure<00:00:09.660> there<00:00:09.840> are

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
this thread and I'm sure there are

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.959 
this thread and I'm sure there are
hundreds<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.530> well<00:00:10.889> I've<00:00:11.010> seen<00:00:11.309> at<00:00:11.550> least<00:00:11.580> five

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
hundreds of well I've seen at least five

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.330 
hundreds of well I've seen at least five
videos<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.500> web<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.830> describe<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.280> I'm

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
videos on the web that describe it I'm

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.460 
videos on the web that describe it I'm
sure<00:00:14.370> there's<00:00:14.670> like<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> hundred<00:00:15.199> so<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.350> is

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
sure there's like a hundred so this is

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.950 
sure there's like a hundred so this is
nothing<00:00:16.770> new<00:00:16.800> but<00:00:17.550> I'm<00:00:17.850> describing<00:00:18.600> it<00:00:18.869> out

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
nothing new but I'm describing it out

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390 
nothing new but I'm describing it out
loud<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.529> more<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> describe<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
loud because the more I describe it the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.859 
loud because the more I describe it the
better<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.670> understand<00:00:21.090> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
better I understand it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.920 
better I understand it
so<00:00:22.580> this<00:00:23.580> dial<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.840> bit

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
so this dial here was a little bit

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.140 
so this dial here was a little bit
confusing<00:00:25.320> when<00:00:25.529> I<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.890> saw<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.849> there

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
confusing when I first saw it and there

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.400 
confusing when I first saw it and there
were<00:00:27.210> videos<00:00:27.510> where<00:00:27.689> other<00:00:27.810> people<00:00:28.019> confused

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
were videos where other people confused

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.889 
were videos where other people confused
by<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.560> as<00:00:28.710> well<00:00:29.210> when<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.390> move<00:00:31.669> by<00:00:32.669> hand<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
by it as well when you move by hand that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.180 
by it as well when you move by hand that
number<00:00:34.290> changes<00:00:35.239> and<00:00:36.239> when<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.890> turned<00:00:37.890> on

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
number changes and when it's turned on

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.000 
number changes and when it's turned on
and<00:00:38.690> moving<00:00:39.690> under<00:00:39.960> its<00:00:40.110> motion<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.890> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and moving under its motion like that it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.770 
and moving under its motion like that it
changes<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:41.670> that's<00:00:42.329> when<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> whole

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
changes as well that's when the whole

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.260 
changes as well that's when the whole
carriage<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> moving<00:00:44.059> if<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.570> disengage<00:00:46.230> this

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
carriage is moving if you disengage this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.490 
carriage is moving if you disengage this
actually<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> engage<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> number

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
actually if you engage this that number

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.369 
actually if you engage this that number
doesn't<00:00:49.710> move<00:00:49.950> right<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:51.719> seems<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
doesn't move right so that seems a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.779 
doesn't move right so that seems a
little<00:00:52.410> bit<00:00:52.590> confusing<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.129> but<00:00:53.430> ignore

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
little bit confusing at first but ignore

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
little bit confusing at first but ignore
that<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:55.110> I've<00:00:55.199> done<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.770> I've<00:00:55.920> got

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that so what I've done here is I've got

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.680 
that so what I've done here is I've got
so<00:00:56.280> I've<00:00:56.399> got<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.670> bit<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.449> to

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
so I've got this bit and it's going to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.250 
so I've got this bit and it's going to
cut<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.210> I've<00:01:00.210> been<00:01:00.510> incrementing

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
cut in here and I've been incrementing

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.799 
cut in here and I've been incrementing
by<00:01:01.410> three<00:01:02.100> thousands<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> an<00:01:03.000> inch<00:01:03.120> each<00:01:03.420> time

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
by three thousands of an inch each time

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.719 
by three thousands of an inch each time
through<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.350> cut<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.369> will<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
through that I cut so what it will do is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.480 
through that I cut so what it will do is
it<00:01:05.820> will<00:01:05.880> come<00:01:06.090> through<00:01:06.299> it'll<00:01:07.260> cut<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.950> then

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it will come through it'll cut and then

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
it will come through it'll cut and then
I<00:01:08.760> disengage<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> stops<00:01:10.770> moving

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
I disengage this so that it stops moving

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.899 
I disengage this so that it stops moving
this<00:01:11.520> way

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
this way

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
this way
so<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.299> pull<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.840> off<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.320> lead<00:01:13.470> screw<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so I pull this off the lead screw to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.300 
so I pull this off the lead screw to
stop<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.390> dial<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.170> back<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.040> pull

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
stop it I then dial this back so pull

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.990 
stop it I then dial this back so pull
this<00:01:17.520> out<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> doesn't<00:01:20.189> cut<00:01:20.369> i<00:01:20.549> by

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
this out so that so it doesn't cut i by

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
this out so that so it doesn't cut i by
hand<00:01:21.270> move<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.689> back<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> remember

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
hand move it back over but I remember

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
hand move it back over but I remember
where<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:22.979> was<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.790> move<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.360> where

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
where it was then I move it in to where

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
where it was then I move it in to where
it<00:01:24.570> was<00:01:24.689> again<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.380> then<00:01:25.920> another<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.840> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
it was again and then another three and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.749 
it was again and then another three and
there's<00:01:28.560> backlash<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.189> these<00:01:29.310> gifts<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.640> get

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
there's backlash on these gifts you get

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
there's backlash on these gifts you get
to<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:29.939> these<00:01:30.240> wheels<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.110> you've<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.320> to

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
to go on these wheels so you've got to

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.960 
to go on these wheels so you've got to
go<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> little<00:01:32.100> bit<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.579> forward<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
go back a little bit and then forward to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.660 
go back a little bit and then forward to
make<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.310> just

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
make up for it so so then I get just

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.380 
make up for it so so then I get just
lined<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:37.579> then<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.729> start<00:01:39.090> doing<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
lined up right and then I start doing it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.510 
lined up right and then I start doing it
again<00:01:39.450> once<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.930> run<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> wait<00:01:41.280> until

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
again once I run it I have to wait until

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.330 
again once I run it I have to wait until
this<00:01:41.850> number<00:01:42.240> comes<00:01:42.600> around<00:01:43.020> two<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.220> I've

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
this number comes around two and I've

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
this number comes around two and I've
been<00:01:44.520> using<00:01:44.700> number<00:01:45.119> three<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.960> my<00:01:46.140> gearing

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
been using number three for my gearing

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.800 
been using number three for my gearing
for<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.450> 24<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:50.060> glide<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> put<00:01:51.390> these<00:01:51.540> wheels

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
for the 24 the glide to put these wheels

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.230 
for the 24 the glide to put these wheels
on<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.350> 40<00:01:52.619> threads<00:01:52.890> per<00:01:53.070> inch<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.880> said

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
on for 40 threads per inch but it said

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.499 
on for 40 threads per inch but it said
that<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.420> 40<00:01:54.899> threads<00:01:55.170> per<00:01:55.439> inch<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:57.060> doesn't

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that for 40 threads per inch it doesn't

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
that for 40 threads per inch it doesn't
matter<00:01:57.689> what<00:01:57.899> number<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.200> use<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.920> through

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
matter what number you use one through

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.249 
matter what number you use one through
eight<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.090> consistently<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.899> using

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
eight so I'm consistently just using

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.410 
eight so I'm consistently just using
three<00:02:01.680> each<00:02:01.890> time<00:02:02.189> anyways<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> wait<00:02:03.210> till

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
three each time anyways so I wait till

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.749 
three each time anyways so I wait till
three<00:02:03.689> comes<00:02:03.899> around<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> engage<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.640> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
three comes around then I engage then it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.219 
three comes around then I engage then it
goes<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.390> disengage<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> gets

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
goes and then I disengage when it gets

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:07.670 
goes and then I disengage when it gets
to<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> end

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
to the end

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.770 
to the end

like<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:13.050> now<00:05:14.050> would<00:05:14.289> I<00:05:14.410> put<00:05:14.620> this<00:05:15.449> two<00:05:16.449> here

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
like that now would I put this two here

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
like that now would I put this two here
let's<00:05:17.080> try<00:05:17.199> this

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
let's try this

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.790 
let's try this
ah<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:22.630> can<00:05:22.930> screw<00:05:23.440> on<00:05:24.750> tightly<00:05:25.750> even<00:05:25.800> tightly

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
ah it can screw on tightly even tightly

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.960 
ah it can screw on tightly even tightly
enough<00:05:26.949> that<00:05:27.100> I<00:05:27.160> could<00:05:27.220> almost<00:05:27.550> turn<00:05:27.789> the

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
enough that I could almost turn the

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.029 
enough that I could almost turn the
spindle<00:05:28.150> there<00:05:28.389> but<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.380> want<00:05:29.680> it<00:05:29.770> to<00:05:29.889> go

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
spindle there but I want it to go

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:39.150 
spindle there but I want it to go
further<00:05:30.550> in<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:36.120> and<00:05:37.120> go<00:05:37.300> deeper<00:05:37.770> cool<00:05:38.770> anyway

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
further in so and go deeper cool anyway

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.010 
further in so and go deeper cool anyway
that's<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.820> process<00:05:40.090> I<00:05:40.479> just<00:05:40.750> keep<00:05:40.840> doing

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
that's the process I just keep doing

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.080 
that's the process I just keep doing
that<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.470> hopefully<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.610> will<00:05:42.699> get<00:05:42.880> down<00:05:43.060> to

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
that and hopefully that will get down to

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.400 
that and hopefully that will get down to
the<00:05:43.330> point<00:05:43.539> where<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:44.740> matches<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:46.900> thread<00:05:47.199> on

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
the point where it matches the thread on

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.320 
the point where it matches the thread on
that<00:05:49.320> excellent
