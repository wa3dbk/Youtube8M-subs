closing<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.830> process<00:01:05.250> obviously<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.790> didn't

work<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.330> had<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> reboot<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.080> device<00:01:07.170> multiple

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.390 
times I even did a full reinitialize
ation<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.619> completely<00:01:10.920> wiped<00:01:11.159> all<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
ation so it completely wiped all the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.000 
ation so it completely wiped all the
data<00:01:11.580> regardless<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.710> camera

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
was going to compare it to other one

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.300 
was going to compare it to other one
point<00:04:12.810> two<00:04:12.989> megapixel<00:04:13.290> cameras<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.040> see<00:04:14.190> if

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
point two megapixel cameras to see if

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.490 
point two megapixel cameras to see if
maybe<00:04:14.459> they<00:04:14.700> set<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> higher<00:04:15.540> or<00:04:15.750> lower<00:04:15.780> quality

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
maybe they set a higher or lower quality

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.680 
maybe they set a higher or lower quality
I<00:04:16.650> mean<00:04:16.890> it's<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.700> explains<00:04:18.120> itself<00:04:18.450> right

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
I mean it's it explains itself right

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.370 
I mean it's it explains itself right
there<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.500> doesn't<00:04:19.890> even<00:04:19.919> work<00:04:20.100> archos<00:04:20.730> 80<00:04:20.940> g9

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
there it doesn't even work archos 80 g9

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.470 
there it doesn't even work archos 80 g9
720p<00:04:22.380> internal<00:04:22.800> camera

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
720p internal camera

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.440 
720p internal camera
and<00:04:23.600> work<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.580> concludes<00:04:25.730> my<00:04:26.000> review<00:04:26.420> on
