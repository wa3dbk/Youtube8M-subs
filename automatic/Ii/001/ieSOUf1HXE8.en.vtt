 welcome guys to channel 3 with 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.530
 They who are talking to you are the 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.240
 igor 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.429
 today we will play dead kombat 9 with a 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.280
 different doll is the truck 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.520
 Look at this character he is actually a 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.830
 cost a dlc or a character who 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.789
 that was deployed in the game with the port 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.800
 do not officially punish it is the 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.010
 community demand that has created 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.349
 the characters beauty is this character 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.510
 he does not have a bar at the bottom not seeing 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.960
 he can not send x-ray him 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.219
 can not send any more magic 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.950
 concentrated and it was how he walked fast 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.920
 He is very fast he has the ball. 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.250
 sub zero ice he has the desire of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.539
 bodies is a cast has the slide of the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.530
 reptile and I have and it becomes invisible also 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.920
 show you here a little bit 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.710
 his cool gameplay and thus win and 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.859
 getting out of the face is amazing as common 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.600
 It is this game and killed him with 29 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:09.250
 made possible so many is the world cup 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.049
 It ends when we win a round. 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.170
 with and neither does the guy get darned to play 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.909
 direct and I was saying it's 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.000
 awesome as the the deadly game 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:22.570
 kombat 9 allows the galaxy to hack 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.009
 even you do not have a lot of mode 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.009
 different the team for this game 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.530
 Look, I'm just going to shut up a little 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.490
 I will show a little bit how it is 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:43.720
 mpe of the way before apparently 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:46.180
 You can not freeze and use the harpoon. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.210
 freeze the japan or vice versa second 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.670
 blow will bring down the car like 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.750
 play the ice of the times or throw the harpoon 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.159
 two months 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.159
 well now the grade 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.890
 I'll freak you out of being a fucking Qaeda. 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.940
 love us 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:40.100
 not the most part of the way is the 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.800
 based on the reptile time taking only then the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.900
 Special blows from himself so two 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.260
 they are also defendants for example the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.990
 slide and stay invisible is he has a 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.870
 escort then the harpoon and sub zero the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.910
 freeze and his special ability 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.950
 same to me it makes a difference 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.330
 huge is the fact of walking very fast 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:10.130
 He's very fast but he's beaten. 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:12.650
 of them are basically the perceived rating 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.480
 there I froze known as the guy 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.920
 frozen then when I threw the harpoon 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.920
 he just fell 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:44.570
 I do not know how it looks like right Micromet 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:04:06.530
 because two moves in me from a 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:04:09.459
 much the same way that you evaluate the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.070
 thought of this character that this 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.770
 your truck key that dlc 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.900
 I would play with him and that is 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.690
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.550

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.140
