Chevy Trailblazer here they were driving
it<00:00:24.170> towing<00:00:25.040> a<00:00:25.130> trailer<00:00:25.160> a<00:00:25.580> bunch<00:00:25.910> of<00:00:25.970> heavy

it towing a trailer a bunch of heavy
logs<00:00:26.540> on<00:00:26.840> it<00:00:27.020> and<00:00:28.750> so<00:00:29.750> I<00:00:29.780> tore<00:00:30.260> I<00:00:30.500> told<00:00:30.710> her<00:00:30.800> down

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
logs on it and so I tore I told her down

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.900 
logs on it and so I tore I told her down
here<00:00:32.260> we<00:00:33.260> found<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.770> problem<00:00:34.040> at<00:00:34.280> first<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:34.730> was

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
here we found the problem at first I was

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.510 
here we found the problem at first I was
suspecting<00:00:35.270> maybe<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:35.720> Sun<00:00:35.900> shell<00:00:36.370> but<00:00:37.370> it's

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
suspecting maybe the Sun shell but it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.450 
suspecting maybe the Sun shell but it's
not<00:00:37.700> broken<00:00:37.970> or<00:00:38.210> anything<00:00:38.390> it's<00:00:38.660> not<00:00:38.720> stripped

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
not broken or anything it's not stripped

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.860 
not broken or anything it's not stripped
then<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.489> took<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.790> pump<00:00:41.000> apart<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:41.690> you<00:00:41.750> can

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
then I took the pump apart and you can

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.440 
then I took the pump apart and you can
see<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.079> pump<00:00:42.290> slides<00:00:42.530> busted<00:00:43.070> here<00:00:43.250> the<00:00:44.060> gear

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
see the pump slides busted here the gear

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
see the pump slides busted here the gear
actually<00:00:45.230> exploded<00:00:45.860> um<00:00:47.140> here's<00:00:48.140> piece

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
actually exploded um here's piece

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
there's pieces of it right here

there's pieces of it right here
as<00:00:51.410> you<00:00:51.559> can<00:00:51.739> see<00:00:51.920> there's<00:00:52.190> half<00:00:52.430> of<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.700> years

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
as you can see there's half of the years

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.580 
as you can see there's half of the years
and<00:00:53.000> a<00:00:53.090> half

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
and a half

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.380 
and a half
pretty<00:00:55.040> common<00:00:55.309> this<00:00:55.579> transmission<00:00:56.120> I've

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
pretty common this transmission I've

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.549 
pretty common this transmission I've
seen<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.690> few<00:00:56.840> of<00:00:56.960> these<00:00:57.020> do<00:00:57.290> that<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.200> it<00:01:00.200> once

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
seen a few of these do that and it once

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.229 
seen a few of these do that and it once
that<00:01:00.680> happens<00:01:01.010> you're<00:01:01.610> done<00:01:01.880> you've<00:01:02.030> got<00:01:02.120> no

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
that happens you're done you've got no

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.960 
that happens you're done you've got no
pressure<00:01:02.450> it's<00:01:02.630> not<00:01:02.719> moving<00:01:03.729> so<00:01:04.729> here's<00:01:04.909> just

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
pressure it's not moving so here's just

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.580 
pressure it's not moving so here's just
a<00:01:05.150> few<00:01:05.330> parts<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.840> here's<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.110> reverse

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
a few parts of it here's the reverse

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.980 
a few parts of it here's the reverse
input<00:01:07.010> drum<00:01:07.250> your<00:01:07.850> band<00:01:08.150> rides<00:01:08.479> along<00:01:08.750> the

input drum your band rides along the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.140 
input drum your band rides along the
outside<00:01:09.140> of<00:01:09.440> this<00:01:09.650> when<00:01:10.280> it<00:01:10.370> applies<00:01:10.640> it<00:01:10.880> stops

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
outside of this when it applies it stops

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.649 
outside of this when it applies it stops
that<00:01:11.299> drum<00:01:11.690> which<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.680> connected<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.510> the<00:01:14.510> base

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
that drum which is connected to the base

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.460 
that drum which is connected to the base
of<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.960> shell<00:01:15.229> they<00:01:15.830> only<00:01:15.979> fit<00:01:16.250> together<00:01:17.470> like

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
of the shell they only fit together like

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.210 
of the shell they only fit together like
so<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:19.869> when<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.350> band<00:01:21.530> applies<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.979> stop

that drumming that gives you second gear
here's<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.130> input<00:01:25.250> drum<00:01:25.580> as<00:01:25.820> you<00:01:25.909> can<00:01:26.030> see

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
here's the input drum as you can see

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.050 
here's the input drum as you can see
this<00:01:26.840> input<00:01:27.110> drum<00:01:27.500> doesn't<00:01:28.430> have<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.790> little

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
this input drum doesn't have the little

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
o-ring this has the ordering right there

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.320 
o-ring this has the ordering right there
where<00:01:33.350> my<00:01:33.439> thumb<00:01:33.680> is<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.720> a<00:01:36.490> 4<00:01:37.490> L<00:01:37.640> 65

exactly<00:02:46.200> these<00:02:46.319> things<00:02:46.379> I'll<00:02:46.650> go<00:02:46.769> together<00:02:47.069> a

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
exactly these things I'll go together a

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.009 
exactly these things I'll go together a
pretty<00:02:47.340> simple<00:02:47.669> transmission<00:02:48.019> pretty

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
pretty simple transmission pretty

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.229 
pretty simple transmission pretty
reliable<00:02:49.709> setup<00:02:50.099> once<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.430> fix<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:50.969> the<00:02:51.060> weak

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
reliable setup once you fix all the weak

reliable setup once you fix all the weak
spots<00:02:51.510> such<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:51.870> pump<00:02:52.859> breaking<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:54.299> shell

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
spots such as pump breaking the shell

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.979 
spots such as pump breaking the shell
this<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.069> going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.340> get<00:02:56.459> Abbyson<00:02:56.969> shell<00:02:57.329> so<00:02:57.959> we

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
this is going to get Abbyson shell so we

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.209 
this is going to get Abbyson shell so we
won't<00:02:58.199> have<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.349> problem<00:02:58.469> anymore

00:02:59.209 --> 00:02:59.219 
won't have that problem anymore

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.520 
won't have that problem anymore
I'm<00:02:59.549> also<00:02:59.699> going<00:02:59.909> to<00:02:59.969> put<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.329> new<00:03:00.659> gear<00:03:00.989> with

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I'm also going to put a new gear with

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.610 
I'm also going to put a new gear with
the<00:03:01.560> hardened<00:03:02.250> rings<00:03:02.959> these<00:03:03.959> rings<00:03:04.379> right

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
the hardened rings these rings right

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.280 
the hardened rings these rings right
here<00:03:04.889> stock<00:03:05.489> ones<00:03:05.790> are<00:03:06.000> not<00:03:06.150> hardened<00:03:06.659> as<00:03:07.169> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
here stock ones are not hardened as you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.649 
here stock ones are not hardened as you
can<00:03:07.409> see<00:03:07.530> they're<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.919> silver<00:03:08.459> color<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
can see they're just a silver color the

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:10.990 
can see they're just a silver color the
hardened<00:03:09.930> rings<00:03:10.079> are<00:03:10.230> actually<00:03:10.500> black

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
hardened rings are actually black

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.149 
hardened rings are actually black
they're<00:03:12.000> 4140<00:03:12.750> hardened<00:03:13.109> they<00:03:13.259> help<00:03:13.979> to<00:03:14.129> keep

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
they're 4140 hardened they help to keep

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.949 
they're 4140 hardened they help to keep
that<00:03:14.549> gear<00:03:14.909> together<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.329> a<00:03:15.419> higher<00:03:15.599> rpm

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
that gear together in a higher rpm

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.249 
that gear together in a higher rpm
they're<00:03:16.139> real<00:03:16.319> super<00:03:16.590> heavy<00:03:16.769> load<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> that's

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:19.259 
they're real super heavy load so that's

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:23.689 
they're real super heavy load so that's
it<00:03:19.439> for<00:03:20.099> L<00:03:20.220> 65<00:03:20.759> II<00:03:22.189> that's<00:03:23.189> what<00:03:23.370> happened<00:03:23.639> to

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699 
it for L 65 II that's what happened to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.229 
it for L 65 II that's what happened to
pump<00:03:23.879> gear<00:03:24.060> exploded<00:03:24.569> and<00:03:24.750> then<00:03:24.949> she<00:03:25.949> quit<00:03:26.239> so

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
pump gear exploded and then she quit so

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.119 
pump gear exploded and then she quit so
when<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> get<00:03:27.959> it<00:03:28.169> to<00:03:28.290> when<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.709> get<00:03:28.919> ready<00:03:29.009> to
