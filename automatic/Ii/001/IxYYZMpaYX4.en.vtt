00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.260
 all this here it comes from my 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.820
 mobile partnerfun point fr and so if 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.289

 and a fall can quickly happen 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.320
 it would be a shame 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.670

 inside we have a quilted material 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.100
 to protect the ipad mini well and for 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.420
 place it wanted to simply slide to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.920
 inside small hooks like 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.230
