00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.430 

I<00:00:08.000> think<00:00:09.000> everyone<00:00:09.240> has<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.720> dream<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> being

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
I think everyone has the dream of being

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.320 
I think everyone has the dream of being
an<00:00:10.680> astronaut<00:00:11.130> when<00:00:11.340> their<00:00:11.460> little<00:00:11.580> boy<00:00:11.790> right

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
an astronaut when their little boy right

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.270 
an astronaut when their little boy right
the<00:00:12.570> idea<00:00:12.900> of<00:00:12.990> being<00:00:13.170> up<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.500> space<00:00:13.559> looking

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the idea of being up in space looking

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.400 
the idea of being up in space looking
out<00:00:14.400> on<00:00:14.519> these<00:00:14.640> beautiful<00:00:15.450> panoramic<00:00:16.230> sand

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
out on these beautiful panoramic sand

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.920 
out on these beautiful panoramic sand
and<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:17.279> cold<00:00:17.610> airless<00:00:18.090> environments<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
and the cold airless environments that

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.410 
and the cold airless environments that
you'd<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.110> working<00:00:19.290> in<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.830> having<00:00:20.130> that

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
you'd be working in kind of having that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.609 
you'd be working in kind of having that
different<00:00:21.420> experience<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.170> thought<00:00:22.380> oh

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
different experience and we thought oh

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.290 
different experience and we thought oh
what<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> great<00:00:23.280> way<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> put<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.850> player<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
what a great way to put the player and

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320 
what a great way to put the player and
some<00:00:24.390> really<00:00:24.630> unique<00:00:25.160> experiences<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.970> zero

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
some really unique experiences the zero

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.779 
some really unique experiences the zero
gravity<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.960> dead<00:00:28.230> space<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.830> completely

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
gravity and dead space is completely

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.710 
gravity and dead space is completely
unique<00:00:30.090> because<00:00:31.279> it's<00:00:32.279> realistic<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.030> you

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
unique because it's realistic and you

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.619 
unique because it's realistic and you
know<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:33.989> studied<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.129> know<00:00:35.160> NASA<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.330> JPL

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:36.629 
know we studied you know NASA and JPL

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.500 
know we studied you know NASA and JPL
websites<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:38.010> found<00:00:38.280> out<00:00:38.489> how<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> hand

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
websites we found out how much of hand

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.900 
websites we found out how much of hand
weighs<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.110> much<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> head<00:00:40.620> weighs<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.250> zero-g

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
weighs how much a head weighs in zero-g

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.639 
weighs how much a head weighs in zero-g
because<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.450> wanted<00:00:42.720> that<00:00:42.840> realistic<00:00:43.230> weight

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
because we wanted that realistic weight

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
because we wanted that realistic weight
and<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:44.760> very<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:45.180> important<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
and that was very very important to the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.479 
and that was very very important to the
game<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.680> few<00:00:46.829> ways<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.130> gameplay

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
game there are a few ways the gameplay

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
in zero-g works in dead space there are

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.799 
in zero-g works in dead space there are
places<00:00:50.309> where<00:00:50.520> Isaac<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.540> an<00:00:51.629> added

at least 20% of the game is zero gravity

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.549 
at least 20% of the game is zero gravity
and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> some<00:01:03.809> places<00:01:04.050> you<00:01:04.470> know

you're you know maybe walking around an

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.900 
you're you know maybe walking around an
area<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:10.039> you<00:01:11.039> know<00:01:11.160> you<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> jump

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
area but then you know you have to jump

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.609 
area but then you know you have to jump
from<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.270> area<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.630> another<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.200> gonna<00:01:13.500> be

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
from one area to another I just gonna be

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.559 
from one area to another I just gonna be
faced<00:01:14.429> with<00:01:14.459> a<00:01:14.640> number<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:15.000> challenges<00:01:15.450> in

00:01:15.559 --> 00:01:15.569 
faced with a number of challenges in

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:17.600 
faced with a number of challenges in
zero-g<00:01:16.009> sometimes<00:01:17.009> he's<00:01:17.160> gonna<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.550> a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
zero-g sometimes he's gonna be in a

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.550 
zero-g sometimes he's gonna be in a
completely<00:01:18.060> hostile<00:01:18.509> environment<00:01:19.050> out<00:01:19.410> on

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
completely hostile environment out on

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
completely hostile environment out on
the<00:01:19.649> edge<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> ship<00:01:20.209> being<00:01:21.209> bombarded<00:01:21.420> with

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the edge of a ship being bombarded with

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.839 
the edge of a ship being bombarded with
hazards<00:01:22.619> from<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.069> environment<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.700> having

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:23.849 
hazards from the environment and having

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.820 
hazards from the environment and having
to<00:01:23.970> manage<00:01:24.149> his<00:01:24.330> air<00:01:24.479> supply<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:25.410> other<00:01:25.560> times

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to manage his air supply at other times

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.710 
to manage his air supply at other times
he'll<00:01:26.099> be<00:01:26.190> inside<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> ship<00:01:26.849> less<00:01:27.420> worried

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
he'll be inside a ship less worried

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.660 
he'll be inside a ship less worried
about<00:01:27.750> air<00:01:28.080> supply<00:01:28.410> but<00:01:28.679> being<00:01:29.220> overrun<00:01:29.610> by

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
about air supply but being overrun by

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.690 
about air supply but being overrun by
the<00:01:29.910> natural

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
the natural

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.749 
the natural
so<00:01:31.509> going<00:01:31.689> from<00:01:31.900> gravity<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.890> zero-g<00:01:33.369> is<00:01:33.520> is

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
so going from gravity to zero-g is is

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.010 
so going from gravity to zero-g is is
different<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.240> different<00:01:34.330> parts<00:01:34.659> of<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> game

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
different in different parts of the game

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.140 
different in different parts of the game
as<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:35.740> enter<00:01:36.100> into<00:01:36.220> space<00:01:36.549> you'll<00:01:36.820> notice

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
as you enter into space you'll notice

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.050 
as you enter into space you'll notice
that<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.869> tone<00:01:38.170> of<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.409> game<00:01:38.560> gets<00:01:39.280> cold<00:01:39.670> it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
that the tone of the game gets cold it

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.810 
that the tone of the game gets cold it
gets<00:01:40.119> blue<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.560> audio<00:01:41.950> muffles<00:01:42.460> out<00:01:42.610> like

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
gets blue the audio muffles out like

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.600 
gets blue the audio muffles out like
you'd<00:01:42.939> expect<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.540> vacuum<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:45.490> know

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
you'd expect in a vacuum and you know

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.160 
you'd expect in a vacuum and you know
depending<00:01:45.759> on<00:01:46.090> whether<00:01:46.330> it's<00:01:46.509> airless<00:01:46.840> not<00:01:47.020> if

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
depending on whether it's airless not if

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.529 
depending on whether it's airless not if
there's<00:01:47.320> also<00:01:47.500> an<00:01:47.680> airless<00:01:48.130> there's<00:01:48.430> no<00:01:48.640> just

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
there's also an airless there's no just

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:51.950 
there's also an airless there's no just
here<00:01:49.780> you<00:01:49.930> know<00:01:50.049> your<00:01:50.470> heart<00:01:51.039> beating

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
here you know your heart beating

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960 
here you know your heart beating
breathing<00:01:53.039> so<00:01:54.039> we<00:01:54.070> have<00:01:54.220> Necromorphs<00:01:54.789> that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
breathing so we have Necromorphs that

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.330 
breathing so we have Necromorphs that
are<00:01:55.180> particularly<00:01:56.140> effective<00:01:56.770> in<00:01:56.920> gravity

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
are particularly effective in gravity

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.359 
are particularly effective in gravity
and<00:01:58.180> some<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.600> have<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.990> ability<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.369> handle

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
and some that have the ability to handle

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.850 
and some that have the ability to handle
zero<00:02:00.970> gravity<00:02:01.240> really<00:02:01.659> well<00:02:01.810> sort<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.770> a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
zero gravity really well sort of a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:08.340 
zero gravity really well sort of a
horror<00:02:03.340> or<00:02:04.000> error<00:02:06.179> GOG<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.300> also<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:08.110> little

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
horror or error GOG is also a little

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.499 
horror or error GOG is also a little
different<00:02:08.649> than<00:02:08.799> regular<00:02:09.280> gravity<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.179> idea

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
different than regular gravity the idea

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.059 
different than regular gravity the idea
that<00:02:10.780> an<00:02:10.929> enemy<00:02:11.049> can<00:02:11.350> come<00:02:11.530> from<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.799> at<00:02:11.920> any

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
that an enemy can come from you at any

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.940 
that an enemy can come from you at any
angle<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.600> floor<00:02:14.530> may<00:02:14.680> become<00:02:14.890> the

ceiling and the ceiling the floor at any
point<00:02:16.720> as<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> jump<00:02:17.170> across<00:02:17.260> these<00:02:17.590> rooms

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
point as you jump across these rooms

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.160

though<00:02:18.280> I'm<00:02:18.400> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.640> floor<00:02:18.819> I<00:02:19.269> jump<00:02:20.019> to<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
though I'm on the floor I jump to the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.699 
though I'm on the floor I jump to the
ceiling<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.940> whole<00:02:21.970> room<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:22.750> orient<00:02:23.200> so

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
ceiling the whole room but we orient so

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.140 
ceiling the whole room but we orient so
now<00:02:23.860> you're<00:02:24.069> you're<00:02:24.310> on<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.519> ceiling<00:02:24.970> and

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
now you're you're on the ceiling and

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.630 
now you're you're on the ceiling and
you're<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.870> okay<00:02:26.170> where<00:02:26.530> was<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.860> then<00:02:27.519> you've

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you're like okay where was I then you've

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.660 
you're like okay where was I then you've
got<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.970> look<00:02:28.450> around<00:02:28.810> or<00:02:29.230> landmarks<00:02:29.860> where<00:02:30.549> you

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
got a look around or landmarks where you

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.699 
got a look around or landmarks where you
are<00:02:30.880> and<00:02:31.239> get<00:02:31.569> your<00:02:31.690> bearings<00:02:31.840> pretty<00:02:32.470> quickly

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
are and get your bearings pretty quickly

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.780 
are and get your bearings pretty quickly
because<00:02:33.010> if<00:02:33.130> you're<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> middle<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
because if you're in the middle of a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.310 
because if you're in the middle of a
battle<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.480> got<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.720> figure<00:02:34.870> out<00:02:35.049> where<00:02:35.200> you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
battle you got to figure out where you

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.069 
battle you got to figure out where you
are<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:36.190> you'll<00:02:36.820> find<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.180> some<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:37.989> your

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
are so you'll find that some of your

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.840 
are so you'll find that some of your
strategies<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:38.980> use<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.549> gravity

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
strategies that you use in a gravity

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.300 
strategies that you use in a gravity
environment<00:02:40.380> have<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.500> change<00:02:41.799> when<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.190> get

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
environment have to change when you get

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.670 
environment have to change when you get
into<00:02:42.459> an<00:02:42.640> environment<00:02:43.060> where<00:02:43.359> you<00:02:43.480> have

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
into an environment where you have

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.780 
into an environment where you have
leapers<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.859> are<00:02:44.950> flying<00:02:45.190> across<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.579> room

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
leapers that are flying across the room

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.569 
leapers that are flying across the room
at<00:02:45.970> you<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.930> can't<00:02:47.200> outrun<00:02:47.709> them<00:02:48.100> they<00:02:48.400> can

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
at you you can't outrun them they can

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.370 
at you you can't outrun them they can
jump<00:02:48.730> as<00:02:48.880> far<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.239> as<00:02:49.299> fast<00:02:49.359> as<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.870> can<00:02:50.079> so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
jump as far and as fast as you can so

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.800 
jump as far and as fast as you can so
the<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.579> combat<00:02:51.970> changes<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.600> have<00:02:52.690> to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the the combat changes and you have to

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.420 
the the combat changes and you have to
learn<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.079> take<00:02:53.200> advantage<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.920> my

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
learn to take advantage of that my

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.270 
learn to take advantage of that my
favorite<00:02:54.940> moment<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.690> zero-g<00:02:56.260> was<00:02:56.859> one<00:02:57.070> of<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
favorite moment in zero-g was one of the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.729 
favorite moment in zero-g was one of the
one<00:02:57.609> of<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.790> first<00:02:58.120> times<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.810> we<00:02:58.989> actually

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
one of the first times that we actually

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.720 
one of the first times that we actually
you<00:03:00.340> walk<00:03:00.640> into<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:01.000> room<00:03:01.239> that's<00:03:02.019> gravity<00:03:02.730> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
you walk into a room that's gravity and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.470 
you walk into a room that's gravity and
you<00:03:03.940> turn<00:03:04.750> gravity<00:03:05.260> off

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you turn gravity off

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
you turn gravity off
and<00:03:06.599> things<00:03:07.110> start<00:03:07.379> to<00:03:07.410> float<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.129> air

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
and things start to float up in the air

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.880 
and things start to float up in the air
I<00:03:08.580> mean<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.690> of<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.930> sudden<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.349> feel<00:03:10.709> like

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
I mean all of a sudden you feel like

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.170 
I mean all of a sudden you feel like
you're<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.220> completely<00:03:11.730> different<00:03:11.879> world

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
you're in a completely different world

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.290 
you're in a completely different world
and<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.640> moment<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:15.120> we

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
and that that was the moment that we

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.200 
and that that was the moment that we
knew<00:03:15.480> we<00:03:15.629> had<00:03:15.750> something<00:03:15.989> special
