00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we are starting to win I thought that

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.150 
we are starting to win I thought that
seal<00:00:15.030> jeez<00:00:15.360> path<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.080> an<00:00:16.199> avalanche<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
seal jeez path is it's an avalanche and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.250 
seal jeez path is it's an avalanche and
it<00:00:17.820> starts<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.510> middle<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.930> split

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
it starts in the middle of the split

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.679 
it starts in the middle of the split
with<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.250> trickle<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.970> game<00:00:21.180> you<00:00:21.510> lose

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
with a little trickle one game you lose

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.990 
with a little trickle one game you lose
and<00:00:21.900> then<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.619> rest<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.189> lose<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.640> what's

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
and then all the rest you lose so what's

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.269 
and then all the rest you lose so what's
happening<00:00:24.330> well<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.380> ologies<00:00:25.710> progression

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
happening well see ologies progression

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939 
happening well see ologies progression
used<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.320> roller<00:00:28.320> coaster<00:00:28.410> climb

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
used to be like a roller coaster climb

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
used to be like a roller coaster climb
up<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.849> would<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.000> down<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:31.080> is

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
up and then it would go down but this is

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.130 
up and then it would go down but this is
like<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> more<00:00:31.650> advanced<00:00:31.949> roller<00:00:32.250> coaster<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
like a more advanced roller coaster and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.270 
like a more advanced roller coaster and
instead<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.469> down<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> way<00:00:35.070> we

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
instead of going down all the way we

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
instead of going down all the way we
took<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.550> little<00:00:35.730> dip<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.270> just

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300

took a little dip and now we're just
going<00:00:36.480> back<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.620> guys<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.950> altered<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
well we looked over all our games we

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.319 
well we looked over all our games we
basically<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.219> pointed<00:00:59.789> out<00:00:59.879> all<00:01:00.180> our

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
basically just pointed out all our

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.759 
basically just pointed out all our
mistakes<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.760> tried<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.290> say<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.589> oh

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
mistakes and tried not to say like oh

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.200 
mistakes and tried not to say like oh
well<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.129> shouldn't<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.460> done<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:05.909> try

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
well we shouldn't have done that but try

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
well we shouldn't have done that but try
and<00:01:06.360> find<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.990> reasoning<00:01:07.320> why<00:01:07.470> we're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and find like the reasoning why we're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.679 
and find like the reasoning why we're
behind<00:01:08.520> why<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.760> did<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.360> what<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.659> were

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
behind why we did that like what we were

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.350 
behind why we did that like what we were
thinking<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.320> why<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.040> didn't<00:01:11.340> find<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.000> better

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
thinking and why we didn't find a better

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899 
thinking and why we didn't find a better
solution<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.990> win<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> game<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.340> instead

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
solution and win the game and so instead

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.940 
solution and win the game and so instead
of<00:01:15.180> um<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:16.790> feel<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.200> are<00:01:19.200> solving<00:01:19.409> deeper

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
of um I feel like we are solving deeper

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
of um I feel like we are solving deeper
issues<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> team<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.320> know

and that's probably pretty good too for
middling<00:02:36.840> though<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.590> champions

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
