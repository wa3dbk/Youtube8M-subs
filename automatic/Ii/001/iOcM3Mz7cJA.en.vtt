know make it look less noticeable I
don't<00:04:30.770> really<00:04:30.889> care<00:04:31.100> it's<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.550> side

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
don't really care it's just the side

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.060 
don't really care it's just the side
panel<00:04:32.150> who<00:04:32.270> cares<00:04:32.510> but<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:33.710> rest<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:33.979> the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
panel who cares but the rest of the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.640 
panel who cares but the rest of the
computer<00:04:34.400> looks<00:04:34.690> freaking<00:04:35.690> dirty<00:04:35.870> so<00:04:36.290> as<00:04:36.560> you

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
computer looks freaking dirty so as you

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.680 
computer looks freaking dirty so as you
can<00:04:36.800> see<00:04:37.010> but<00:04:37.610> I<00:04:37.669> will<00:04:37.940> clean<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.210> up<00:04:38.419> I<00:04:38.540> will

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
can see but I will clean it up I will

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.800 
can see but I will clean it up I will
make<00:04:38.810> it<00:04:38.930> look<00:04:39.080> pristine

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
make it look pristine

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.480 
make it look pristine
like<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.930> said<00:04:41.990> except<00:04:42.350> for<00:04:42.470> that<00:04:42.590> dent<00:04:43.190> which

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
like I said except for that dent which

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.219 
like I said except for that dent which
I'll<00:04:43.850> try<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.240> work<00:04:44.450> on<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:44.810> when<00:04:44.960> he<00:04:45.050> gets

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
I'll try to work on that when he gets

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.550 
I'll try to work on that when he gets
here<00:04:45.470> but<00:04:46.400> yeah<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.930> good<00:04:48.050> thing<00:04:48.229> about<00:04:48.260> this

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
here but yeah the good thing about this

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.680 
here but yeah the good thing about this
though<00:04:48.740> since<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.160> already<00:04:49.280> have<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.610> GX<00:04:49.970> 620<00:04:50.479> and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
though since I already have a GX 620 and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.870 
though since I already have a GX 620 and
a<00:04:50.810> bunch<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.080> parts<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.620> can<00:04:52.220> upgrade<00:04:52.370> the<00:04:52.639> crap

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
a bunch of parts I can upgrade the crap

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.620 
a bunch of parts I can upgrade the crap
out<00:04:53.090> of<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.330> when<00:04:53.510> he<00:04:53.570> gets<00:04:53.780> here<00:04:54.639> has<00:04:55.639> a<00:04:55.669> P<00:04:55.940> 4<00:04:56.150> HD

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
out of it when he gets here has a P 4 HD

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.500 
out of it when he gets here has a P 4 HD
2.8<00:04:57.410> gigahertz<00:04:57.710> well<00:04:58.100> I'm<00:04:58.760> like<00:04:58.970> I'm<00:04:59.240> gonna

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
2.8 gigahertz well I'm like I'm gonna

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.370 
2.8 gigahertz well I'm like I'm gonna
slap<00:04:59.870> a<00:05:00.310> Pentium<00:05:01.310> D<00:05:01.520> at<00:05:02.210> 2.8<00:05:02.810> gigahertz<00:05:03.110> in

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
slap a Pentium D at 2.8 gigahertz in

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.740 
slap a Pentium D at 2.8 gigahertz in
there<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:04.550> it'll<00:05:04.700> be<00:05:04.820> dual-core<00:05:05.330> which<00:05:05.570> is

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
there so it'll be dual-core which is

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.200 
there so it'll be dual-core which is
sweet<00:05:06.500> it's<00:05:06.979> basically<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.400> same<00:05:07.610> processor

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
sweet it's basically the same processor

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.719 
sweet it's basically the same processor
as<00:05:08.780> the<00:05:09.020> 2.8<00:05:09.470> gigahertz<00:05:09.770> just<00:05:10.190> you<00:05:10.370> know<00:05:10.490> dual

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:10.729 
as the 2.8 gigahertz just you know dual

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.960 
as the 2.8 gigahertz just you know dual
core<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:12.110> think<00:05:12.680> more<00:05:13.370> cache<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:15.560> know<00:05:15.650> I

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
core I think more cache and you know I

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.029 
core I think more cache and you know I
think<00:05:16.970> that's<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.450> for<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.930> differences<00:05:18.410> one

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
think that's it for the differences one

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:20.880 
think that's it for the differences one
gig<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.250> ram<00:05:19.370> screw<00:05:19.880> that<00:05:20.090> I'm<00:05:20.270> gonna<00:05:20.360> put

three<00:05:21.890> gigs<00:05:22.160> in<00:05:22.370> there<00:05:22.900> might<00:05:24.669> depending

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
three gigs in there might depending

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.950 
three gigs in there might depending
depending<00:05:26.060> on<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.539> configuration<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:27.760> the

depending on the configuration of the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.100 
depending on the configuration of the
you<00:05:29.960> know<00:05:30.080> RAM<00:05:30.830> inside<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.820> thing<00:05:32.030> I<00:05:32.240> might<00:05:32.960> be

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
you know RAM inside the thing I might be

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.680 
you know RAM inside the thing I might be
able<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.380> fit<00:05:33.620> four<00:05:33.889> gigs<00:05:34.130> in<00:05:34.310> there<00:05:34.490> but<00:05:35.330> I

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
able to fit four gigs in there but I

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.060 
able to fit four gigs in there but I
don't<00:05:35.870> know<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.440> depends<00:05:36.800> on<00:05:36.979> the

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
don't know it depends on the

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.650 
don't know it depends on the
configuration<00:05:37.250> I<00:05:37.910> might<00:05:38.090> be<00:05:38.240> able<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.450> squeeze

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
configuration I might be able to squeeze

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.590 
configuration I might be able to squeeze
three<00:05:39.050> and<00:05:39.169> a<00:05:39.200> half<00:05:39.380> I<00:05:39.710> don't<00:05:40.669> know<00:05:40.729> I<00:05:40.910> depends

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
three and a half I don't know I depends

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.330 
three and a half I don't know I depends
on<00:05:41.720> how<00:05:42.080> many<00:05:42.139> sticks<00:05:42.500> are<00:05:42.650> in<00:05:42.740> there<00:05:42.889> and<00:05:43.100> you

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
on how many sticks are in there and you

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.070 
on how many sticks are in there and you
know<00:05:43.430> what<00:05:43.669> configuration<00:05:43.910> they're<00:05:44.419> in<00:05:44.539> any

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
know what configuration they're in any

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.270 
know what configuration they're in any
gig<00:05:45.289> hard<00:05:45.500> drive<00:05:45.530> that's<00:05:45.889> probably<00:05:46.160> gonna

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
gig hard drive that's probably gonna

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.590 
gig hard drive that's probably gonna
stay<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.490> same<00:05:46.729> I'm<00:05:46.940> not<00:05:47.060> gonna<00:05:47.180> upgrade<00:05:47.360> the

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
stay the same I'm not gonna upgrade the

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.320 
stay the same I'm not gonna upgrade the
hard<00:05:47.780> drive<00:05:48.020> 80<00:05:48.350> gigs<00:05:48.590> is<00:05:48.770> fine<00:05:49.090> but<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.180> also

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
hard drive 80 gigs is fine but I also

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.480 
hard drive 80 gigs is fine but I also
have<00:05:50.539> a<00:05:50.600> 40<00:05:50.870> gig<00:05:51.020> down<00:05:51.289> there<00:05:51.590> that<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.160> could

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
have a 40 gig down there that I could

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.100 
have a 40 gig down there that I could
slap<00:05:52.729> in<00:05:52.940> there<00:05:53.090> so<00:05:53.270> I<00:05:53.330> can<00:05:53.479> theoretically

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
slap in there so I can theoretically

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.280 
slap in there so I can theoretically
have<00:05:54.970> 120

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
have 120

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.590 
have 120
available<00:05:56.890> space<00:05:57.160> which<00:05:58.030> is<00:05:58.240> cool<00:05:58.870> and<00:06:00.600> yeah

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 
available space which is cool and yeah

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.050 
available space which is cool and yeah
so<00:06:01.930> that's<00:06:02.050> what<00:06:02.260> I<00:06:02.320> bought<00:06:04.140> pretty<00:06:05.140> sweet<00:06:05.410> I

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
so that's what I bought pretty sweet I

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.310 
so that's what I bought pretty sweet I
glad<00:06:07.060> I'm<00:06:07.240> getting<00:06:07.480> the<00:06:07.570> full<00:06:07.750> tower<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:08.230> way

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
glad I'm getting the full tower that way

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.840 
glad I'm getting the full tower that way
I<00:06:08.350> can<00:06:08.620> upgrade<00:06:09.010> whatever<00:06:09.550> I<00:06:09.670> want<00:06:09.940> and<00:06:11.850> yeah

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
I can upgrade whatever I want and yeah

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.270 
I can upgrade whatever I want and yeah
so<00:06:13.840> that<00:06:14.170> is<00:06:14.200> just<00:06:14.440> a<00:06:14.500> quick<00:06:14.650> update<00:06:14.860> is<00:06:15.250> that

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
so that is just a quick update is that

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.200 
so that is just a quick update is that
the<00:06:16.150> repair<00:06:16.690> on<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.050> old<00:06:17.200> GF<00:06:17.530> 620<00:06:18.090> didn't<00:06:19.090> work

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
the repair on the old GF 620 didn't work

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.130 
the repair on the old GF 620 didn't work
so<00:06:19.510> I<00:06:20.080> figured<00:06:20.950> I'd<00:06:21.070> just<00:06:21.100> buy<00:06:21.370> a<00:06:21.850> nice<00:06:22.720> day<00:06:22.930> one

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
so I figured I'd just buy a nice day one

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.620 
so I figured I'd just buy a nice day one
so<00:06:23.470> I<00:06:23.710> know<00:06:24.430> it<00:06:24.550> doesn't<00:06:24.700> look<00:06:24.820> so<00:06:25.150> nice<00:06:25.360> from

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
so I know it doesn't look so nice from

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.420 
so I know it doesn't look so nice from
the<00:06:25.720> pictures<00:06:26.080> but<00:06:26.320> don't<00:06:26.770> worry<00:06:26.890> I'll<00:06:27.250> get<00:06:27.370> it

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430
