00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
bigger and like when it comes between

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.630 
bigger and like when it comes between
should<00:02:22.780> i<00:02:22.810> go<00:02:22.960> into<00:02:23.140> maritime<00:02:23.740> law<00:02:24.040> or<00:02:24.460> should

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
should i go into maritime law or should

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.960 
should i go into maritime law or should
I<00:02:24.730> go<00:02:24.760> into<00:02:25.090> videogame<00:02:25.540> law<00:02:26.490> there's<00:02:27.490> one<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
I go into videogame law there's one that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.150
