00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.070
 since I work in only goalkeepers not 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.719
 I remember receiving such a news 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.250
 good as accounting told me I was going 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.780
 to get a retro edition of the 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.750
 predator most representative of the 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.800
 story I do not usually get naked in public 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.130
 but I recognize that I am a player of 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.619
 predator since I started playing in the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.259
 mid 90's always has two 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.029
 ways of dishes and each of these 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.860
 three dishes that we found in the 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.180
 the table will be used at some point in my 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.320
 sports career and it brings me very good 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.850
 memories 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.040
 adidas is one of the brands with more 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.019
 tradition in football we see how other 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.760
 brands continually make editions 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.500
 retro models not as classic as 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.910
 those that do so with adidas 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.980
 We appreciate the effort that the 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.350
 German brand to bring to our days 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.679
 the three most legendary models of the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.780
 long product history the model of 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:55.989
 1994 the original model of predator the 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.030
 from 1998 the accelerator apparatus and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.249
 perhaps the most legendary of all the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.249
 model of 2002 pedestrian mania 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.310
 to begin with I have to say that although 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.140
 the most purist as is my case 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.970
 We would like the original model of your 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.090
 era really what we have on the 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.890
 table today is a makeover of the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.630
 current prelature is to say that there is 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.899
 hopes to find the pre artur of 2002 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.970
 of 98 or of the year 94 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.420
 We have the current current producer with 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 its with its usual sole with traction 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.580
 2.0 with frame control in materials 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.679
 hybrids but yes they are decorated 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.679
 totally like the predators of your day 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.490
 the first product of 1994 was the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.770
 device that went on sale when 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.410
 was born until this century what he intended 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.640
 was to let the world know its effectiveness at 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.530
 the time to increase the power of 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.900
 shot because I was wearing these scales so 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.550
 aggressive that the player popularized 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.090
 dutch ronald koeman at the world cup 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.090
 USA 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.130
 and we went to 98 we could already see 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.720
 that the silver was settled the silver was 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.060
 knew and what they did is get a 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.399
 very aggressive aesthetics the lines of 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.220
 adidas grow a lot was right at 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.300
 first dish after the logo change 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.070
 the logo is randomly predatory 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.990
 old torch that was left for 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.750
 original ideas while this one takes 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.730
 the new keep meant logo was what 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.030
 I used to put on all boots before 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.030
 high-end 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.190
 then new plus a visibility of the 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.590
 three lines and we continue to maintain the 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.200
 dish item but already much much much 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.239
 more subtle this boot popularized the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.040
 franchise player was zinedine zidane 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.569
 with which he won the world cup of 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.569
 france in 1998 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.040
 and finally we finish with the predator 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.959
 mania stands out above all because it was the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.700
 boot that popularized the great tongue 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.860
 this language is reversible that with a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.290
 fixing system with a rubber se 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.360
 could keep stable and because it was already 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.530
 totally asymmetric is to say the prat or 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.660
 the element these areas that we see 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.390
 marked in white were adapted already 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.769
 only to the area over which 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.900
 what are we going to do most of the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.510
 beats while the rest of boot 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.910
 was released with the skin material in 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.910
 its time and bristol che at this moment 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.099
 a very important practice is the 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.200
 I would take what we will fight the most 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.659
 least is that he had the modular sole 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.610
 Heel was one piece and the whole area 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.140
 another piece on the foot bridge we 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.360
 we found a point that is going to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.420
 allow flexibility to do 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 the torsions was was the great advantage and 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.030
 the big problem with the boot in that 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 period since there were frequent 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.390
 breaks in the foot bridge area 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.750
 that's why help has complicated us and 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.730
 three boots go with the current system of 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.379
 control frame with which we have all 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.739
 the characteristics of a current boot 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.480
 in the previous decoration I have not said 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.709
 what is the franchise player that led 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.959
 the platform nor to 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.790
 it was obviously David Beckham the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.859
 popularized in the Korea World Cup and 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.389
 japan of 2002 you were you using 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.530

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.530
 color combinations 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.590
 as an exclusive edition that is adidas has 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.360
 manufactured very few pairs in fact to 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.769
 Spain only 15 have arrived 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.030
