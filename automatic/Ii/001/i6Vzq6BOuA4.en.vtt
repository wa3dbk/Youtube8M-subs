00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.220
 what pokémon vidoni jobs or mina sun 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.929
 welcome to this new video by 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.540
 pokemon first video I know it's not the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.580
 best graphics you can see but 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.310
 there are neither masons nor anything then 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.270
 the more I will play this way 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.260
 today I want to show you how I do 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.150
 close the eggs enough 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.769
 fast you can't see very well I don't have the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.460
 best video camera in this world but 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460
 it 'does not matter 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.480
 after you go and if you went to 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.210
 take the eggs 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.210
 so I take 6 hamsiks 5 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.670
 use flight and move to the center 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.010
 of lumino poli therefore to where there is the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.719
 my hand is the prism tower 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.850
 ok i turned on the light for a moment let's go 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:05.369
 first of all towards the prism tower ok 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.729
 arrived at torre prisma now if you notice 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.619
 let's get gaby here if we get in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.070
 a certain position that was the center 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.070
 exact 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 in this side here of height and we hold 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 a right silent period 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:27.299
 see that there are no obstacles and the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.600
 map continues to turn this leads to 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.180
 take the limited steps to open up 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.320
 eggs or train the pokemon that are at 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.450
 retirement what we do then 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 we use a peculiarity of 3ds 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.590
 that I do not know how this Cosenza 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:51.750
 call and take a lot of money 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:55.439
 thin or a cardboard this is a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.409
 card enough durable enough 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.689
 hard, however, a card is one millimeter 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.049
 thick or a coin of a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.759
 millimeter of thickness is not a 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.560
 penny because a penny and more 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.530
 often this is five lire 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.340
 I believe not a lira one saying 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:25.709
 a lira now I will use the card 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:30.900
 let's take the cardboard we move this 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:35.489
 we insert it below and I would say the trick 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.060
 it has already arrived, I have picked up about 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:45.510
 50 levels my silvio that was level 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.980
 1 in an hour an hour and a half I think maybe 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.150
 I wasn't playing so much 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.459
 left there intando I was studying 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.290
 imagine I can study while I do 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.900
 training the pokémon maybe I'll do others 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.260
 videos or other tips to give about many 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.239
 we can see each other again 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.080
 if I can also record in a way 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.290
 best 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.220
 I greet you here while in the meantime 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.010
 turning around and meanwhile this is already the pokemon 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.650
 the pension is therefore training e 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.650
 then stoneware prediction mined
