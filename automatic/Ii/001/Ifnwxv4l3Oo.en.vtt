00:00:01.814 --> 00:00:03.294
 Hi, Cole. 

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:04.394
 Hey, how are you? 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.860
 I'm fine thanks. How are you? 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.140
 All right. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.320
 Cool. Are you ready for the interview? 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 I'm more than ready. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.794
 Cool 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.340
 When did you start composing music? 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.480
 4 years ago. I was 13, now I'm 17. 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.720
 I was 13 and since it was something that I liked a lot I started to try and improve more and more. 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.300
 My first instrument was the piano, I was 7 years old and I started taking classical music classes. 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.000
 Then, I left. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.840
 But I kept learning by myself ... trombone, guitar and also bass. 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:55.180
 Flipflops333 asks: When you were a kid, did you think you'd play before crowds? 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.660
 Flipflops, sandals, I like that the name is plural. You always need more than one sandal! 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 I have never thought about it... 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.820
 I'm so lucky to be doing this and so young ... 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:19.680
 Just being able, as I said, to share my music and before crowds is incredible. 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.420
 I shared the stage with many of my heroes, I grew up listening to what they were doing ... 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.140
 ... to be able to say that I played in the same place as them is an unparalleled experience. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.920
 So, nothing ... when I have the opportunity everything is very surreal. 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.260
 Here's a question from Adriannaxx1 ... How do you start with a remix? 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:50.920
 In general, I listen to the original several times, to understand what the track wants to transmit. 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.680
 I start with the piano, to build as I think it should sound with the piano around. 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.960
 And then I think about where I want to take it, put my personal touch and I start to work on the song. 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.320
 Many times you want to keep elements of the original song, I think that is very important. 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.940
 But at the same time you have to add your creative and artistic touch; mix and match 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.280
 Have you ever felt discouraged or experienced stage fright? If so, how have you overcome it? 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.120
 I try not to be discouraged because I think that is not the way to face things. 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.760
 And as for stage fright ... 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.460
 The truth is that I only suffer ... the first 10 seconds until the first minute on stage ... 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.700
 ... there are always nerves and anxiety. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:54.860
 Especially the first show ... as I do more shows are more exciting and all I want to do is get on stage ... 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.860
 ... and start the show as soon as possible. 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.680
 Dome C wants to know: What is the most difficult thing to produce electronic music? 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:12.020
 Create and maintain a sound that is original and that the fans can identify as your sound. 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.540
 And not be one of the bunch. 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:24.040
 There are many artists who make electronic music and maintaining your identity is always a challenge. 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.720
 I try to contribute something new or something that is not heard in the environment long ago. 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.680
 That's why I take influences from things from the 80s or 90s, things I've heard ... until the 70s. 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.000
 Anything you have heard growing up. 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:53.820
 Shubbs03 wants to know ... If you had to be something other than DJ, what would you be? 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.700
 I always wanted to be a marine biologist ... 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.840
 It really has nothing to do with DJ or production. 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.680
 I always liked the ocean and marine life and I would like to explore it more scientifically. 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.300
 Also, I was always interested in deep water. 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.400
 There is so much that we have not discovered there ... 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.900
 I would like to be part of a team that discovered something or produces a change ... 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.640
 The same with space, I love space. Astronaut! 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.260
 I have one last question and it's from Stanley13795: 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.440
 Could you say "Keep penguin", please? 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600
 Woooo! 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 Keep pinguing in CP! 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.180
 CONTINUE PINGÜINEANDO! 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.840
 Pingüi ... pingüi ... pingüineando.
