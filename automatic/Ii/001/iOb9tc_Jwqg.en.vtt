00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello everyone we'll see today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.429
 how to change the full screen on a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.500
 nexus 4 so see it is it 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 damaged at class level and in 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.320
 the more the screen does not work anymore so it 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.939
 must buy a complete kit 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.240
 that is to say the glass over ice 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 the screen so it sells pretty much safe 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.599
 ib 50 euros with a small kit of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.130
 disassembly screwdriver 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 if you too have for example 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.420
 until it's ice and the screen 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.700
 work you can you risk 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 buy that glass actually but that's 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.210
 complicated enough because then you have to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:51.059
 took off the screen glass so good 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 between 25 euros and 50 euros I thought the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.649
 highest buy whatever the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 reason the complete kit that is to say 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.649
 windows and screen when for 50 euros 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.750
 you then have the little tools of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:11.630
 disassembly so let's talk about disassembly 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.970
 you have to look at your lower back with 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 two small very fine torx end on 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.210
 five it takes a special tool come 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100
 remove the two vices that are there in 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.299
 number 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.970
 So here once during lift 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.150
 currencies that I have in a box you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.820
 can remove the back shell so 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.990
 you discover the smartphone if shell 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.450
 back removed so the battery is in there 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 paste but we'll see later 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.150
 so if you may need to 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.130
 change battery because it 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.210
 works more this video explains 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.070
 also how to do 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.290
 then we will unscrew 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.119
 this connector is not necessarily 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.079
 necessary to remove the battery 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.250
 but hey we'll say that I did 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.750
 everything removed what but it's not 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.369
 necessarily necessary so it's not 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.500
 necessarily necessarily lower by six 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.790
 month I was screwed I put them in 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.590
 a corner 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.119
 and then the battery is stuck 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.790
 but good by forcing a little bit she gets 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:18.750
 take off it's a lightweight adhesive if you 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.540
 So we want to take off the battery 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 repeat it is not necessarily necessary 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.100
 then we have two lives without removing 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 again it's not necessarily 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.450
 necessary I have my bearings well I 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.920
 put them in a corner from there against it 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.750
 it is necessary you have eight screws 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.890
 remove all the little vices - the on 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.990
 the top are there we still see a 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.590
 other of 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.360
 all the oils removed but after he 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.700
 must remove plastic cover 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.730
 so that's necessary once 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.190
 the plastic cover completely if we 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.129
 Wish for security reasons 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.200
 because after we have a little forced have 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.870
 removed the electronic part to this 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.900
 moment there must be eclipsed all these 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.480
 elements there so we're eclipsing a 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.040
 other here so these two are there 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.090
 needed for clips knows since this 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.830
 are that it's for the display of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.030
 the screen and then there it must be for the 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.920
 Touch so you have necessarily raised it 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.760
 even if you chose not to 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.560
 remove the electronics 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:42.980
 we have nothing at all I even removed 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:44.660
 the camera and here I chose 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.769
 to remove the electronics but it's not 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:52.519
 necessarily we must also remove the 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:57.099
 sim card holder you have everything 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:01.040
 to remove in the past the screen with seychelles 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.690
 the strength of hot well hot because 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.150
 that in fact the screen is also necklace 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.609
 with an adhesive that will heat one 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.620
 do not really adhere so we go 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.170
 heats the whole surface it changes but 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.789
 a hair dryer to use a scraper 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.609
 thermal to do silly things and that a 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.889
 of the four arteries so here's once 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.450
 that you have warmed up well you can 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:30.700
 start disassembling the screen by the 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:32.270
 on the screen as in c1 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.979
 completely I have almost 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.080
 completely disassembled so I have it by the 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.950
 group 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.349
 but the tablecloths so there we have 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.340
 so completely puts the screen there is 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:50.720
 look at the smartphone from the front we have 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:53.900
 completely raised the screen there we have the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.889
 menu button down and then we have them 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.000
 small slits to pass the tablecloths 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.389
 in the small slot to pass the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.450
 tablecloths 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.800
 no but the new screen there here it takes 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.150
 not touch you could believe that it's 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.620
 a piece of scotch in itself it is 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.760
 present on the old name we do not touch 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.090
 not English that we pass the tablecloths 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.740
 Thu 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:19.340
 handed I saw a video someone put 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.710
 double- sided tape I put a little 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.580
 a universal glue not super glue 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.669
 still jean of universal pole so 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.580
 on the bar be careful allow this 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.760
 place there and on the high end also 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.310
 attention since it is sensor of 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.530
 brightness we do not put in a little 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.370
 everywhere anyway there is the microphone 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.590
 beware the yes the microphone no the high 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.690
 blue speakers at the quarter of an hour we 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:52.490
 is not who there was a little cache in 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:59.540
 plastic who had fled so I 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:02.450
 handed that rubberized manceau we have 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.720
 returned from above we press well 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.990
 the set has for good that it sticks and 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.690
 then the operation that follow as we 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.979
 has spent well positioned tablecloths 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.919
 there behind and a little good thing 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.650
 positioned well positioned but goes back 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.870
 everything so you go back up the camera 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.680
 end it's the pure reverse operation on 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.270
 come back clip it's here for the the 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.340
 battery I put a little bit of his 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.260
 hair because here here there is still 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.229
 Oussalah the glue which raise new 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.889
 collar but the battery the eight cities 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:40.430
 are the two since they are there one 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:43.970
 branch did not flinch on the exit 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.770
 usb of a pc because if the battery is 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.020
 empty it lacks power 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.370
 we are really the charger and then 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:55.430
 this is a test that works so then this 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.610
 who would be good to put a dico 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.370
 on it so that it supports well for that 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.560
 the glue so that the glue does well 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.060
 its effect that the screen is well 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.550
 collar because in fact the screen does not 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.660
 holds that being parcels are well 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:15.410
 stuck on the on the smartphone and then 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:18.520
 the next day aimo metelo cap in the end 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.140
 and then the two currencies torxed 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.740
 the operation is complete 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.740
 thank you for your attention
