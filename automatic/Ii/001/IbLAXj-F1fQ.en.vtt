there's<00:01:35.729> no<00:01:35.969> gasoline<00:01:36.539> engine<00:01:36.899> they<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.710> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
there's no gasoline engine they can do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.920 
there's no gasoline engine they can do
that<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:38.909> thing<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.270> sound<00:01:39.539> so<00:01:39.869> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that the other thing is sound so you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
that the other thing is sound so you
want<00:01:40.109> to<00:01:40.200> be<00:01:40.259> able<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.469> fly<00:01:40.649> these<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:41.159> 78

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
want to be able to fly these at 78

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
dishwasher measured it 250 p2 years ago

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.609 
dishwasher measured it 250 p2 years ago
they<00:01:47.670> came<00:01:48.090> out<00:01:48.240> with<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.450> proposal<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
they came out with a proposal for this I

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.069 
they came out with a proposal for this I
laugh<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.729> impossible<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
laugh because it was impossible it just

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
laugh because it was impossible it just
couldn't<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.320> done<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.039> yet<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.579> two<00:01:53.789> years

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
couldn't be done and yet in two years

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.630 
couldn't be done and yet in two years
there's<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:55.409> least<00:01:55.439> two<00:01:55.890> airplanes<00:01:56.219> here<00:01:56.399> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
there's at least two airplanes here that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.490 
there's at least two airplanes here that
I<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.880> electric<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I know that electric that I think can

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.980 
I know that electric that I think can
meet<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> criteria<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.329> happening<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
meet the criteria it's happening and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.310 
meet the criteria it's happening and
it's<00:02:01.049> happening<00:02:01.640> exponentially

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
it's happening exponentially

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.310 
it's happening exponentially
the<00:02:03.740> batteries<00:02:04.160> get<00:02:04.400> better<00:02:04.960> these<00:02:05.960> airplanes

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
the batteries get better these airplanes

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.370 
the batteries get better these airplanes
are<00:02:06.590> going<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.800> get<00:02:06.890> better<00:02:07.479> and<00:02:08.479> when<00:02:08.690> we<00:02:08.900> see

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
are going to get better and when we see

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.010 
are going to get better and when we see
that<00:02:09.650> it's<00:02:09.950> gonna<00:02:10.910> start<00:02:11.240> to<00:02:11.390> change<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.900> way

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
that it's gonna start to change the way

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.420 
that it's gonna start to change the way
we<00:02:12.170> move<00:02:12.320> about<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.770> planet
