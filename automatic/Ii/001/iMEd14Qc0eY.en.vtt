and seeing different things so you can
see<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:27.020> might<00:02:27.290> look<00:02:27.500> weird<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.070> let's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
see this might look weird to you let's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.310 
see this might look weird to you let's
see<00:02:28.730> if<00:02:28.790> I<00:02:28.910> kept<00:02:29.030> on<00:02:29.150> one<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.570> little<00:02:29.900> more

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
see if I kept on one this little more

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.830 
see if I kept on one this little more
has<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:30.920> few<00:02:31.250> more<00:02:31.370> random<00:02:31.790> things<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:32.360> don't<00:02:32.450> see

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
has a few more random things I don't see

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.070 
has a few more random things I don't see
anything<00:02:33.110> okay<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.370> have<00:02:34.610> these<00:02:35.360> three

anything okay you have these three
symbols<00:02:36.320> that<00:02:36.800> might<00:02:36.980> not<00:02:37.130> make<00:02:37.220> any<00:02:37.280> sense<00:02:37.700> to

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
symbols that might not make any sense to

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.890 
symbols that might not make any sense to
you<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:39.500> is<00:02:39.650> option<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.450> I've<00:02:41.450> heard

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
you but that is option and I've heard

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.250 
you but that is option and I've heard
people<00:02:42.080> say<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:42.590> specially<00:02:42.980> like<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.280> switch<00:02:43.670> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
people say it specially like a switch to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.720 
people say it specially like a switch to
become<00:02:45.260> like<00:02:45.410> your<00:02:45.560> option<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.100> don't<00:02:46.430> see<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
become like your option I don't see the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.479 
become like your option I don't see the
switch<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.600> maybe<00:02:48.410> somebody<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.220> make<00:02:49.459> a

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
switch in it maybe somebody can make a

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.949 
switch in it maybe somebody can make a
diagram<00:02:49.940> over<00:02:50.300> in<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.510> video<00:02:50.750> or<00:02:50.810> something

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
diagram over in a video or something

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.690 
diagram over in a video or something
like<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:51.830> show<00:02:52.040> me<00:02:52.190> how<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:52.489> supposed

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
like that to show me how it's supposed

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.449 
like that to show me how it's supposed
to<00:02:52.760> look<00:02:52.820> like<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.060> switch<00:02:53.860> but<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:54.920> do<00:02:55.040> know<00:02:55.310> its

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
to look like a switch but I do know its

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.789 
to look like a switch but I do know its
option<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.269> then<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.049> command<00:02:57.500> and

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:57.799 
option and then this is command and

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.090 
option and then this is command and
that's<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.519> shot<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.540> then<00:02:59.600> you<00:03:00.110> have<00:03:00.440> shift

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
that's a shot and then you have shift

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.030 
that's a shot and then you have shift
right<00:03:01.519> over<00:03:01.790> here<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.450> control<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.530> like

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
right over here in control is like

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.960 
right over here in control is like
little<00:03:04.430> symbol<00:03:04.820> above<00:03:04.970> six<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.230> think<00:03:06.470> yeah<00:03:07.310> so

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
little symbol above six I think yeah so

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.190 
little symbol above six I think yeah so
I<00:03:08.239> don't<00:03:08.870> see<00:03:09.049> anything<00:03:09.320> for<00:03:09.799> control<00:03:10.310> but

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
I don't see anything for control but

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.600 
I don't see anything for control but
trying<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.290> think<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:12.560> where<00:03:12.709> my<00:03:12.890> hit<00:03:13.100> control

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
trying to think of where my hit control

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.050 
trying to think of where my hit control
I<00:03:14.680> think<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.769> got<00:03:15.950> an<00:03:16.010> assistant<00:03:16.459> preferences

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
I think I got an assistant preferences

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.770 
I think I got an assistant preferences
and<00:03:17.450> a<00:03:17.600> keyboard<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.230> mouse<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:19.540> fold<00:03:20.540> on<00:03:20.690> my

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
and a keyboard a mouse and fold on my

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.020 
and a keyboard a mouse and fold on my
keyboard<00:03:20.959> shortcuts<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.459> control

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
keyboard shortcuts so that is control

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.090 
keyboard shortcuts so that is control
that<00:03:23.930> is<00:03:24.079> shift<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:26.750> option<00:03:27.110> key<00:03:27.620> so

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
that is shift that is the option key so

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.690 
that is shift that is the option key so
yeah<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:28.940> can<00:03:29.269> see<00:03:29.480> all<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.350> then

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
yeah so you can see all that and then

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.830 
yeah so you can see all that and then
now<00:03:31.700> we're<00:03:31.850> going<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.060> show<00:03:32.209> you<00:03:32.269> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
now we're going to show you the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.490 
now we're going to show you the
animations<00:03:33.530> they're<00:03:34.310> slowing<00:03:34.640> down<00:03:34.880> stuff<00:03:35.209> so

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
animations they're slowing down stuff so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.350 
animations they're slowing down stuff so
if<00:03:36.500> i<00:03:36.680> open<00:03:36.829> up<00:03:37.130> my<00:03:37.190> can<00:03:37.459> touch<00:03:37.640> HD<00:03:38.090> you'll

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
if i open up my can touch HD you'll

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.750 
if i open up my can touch HD you'll
notice<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.690> kind<00:03:39.049> of<00:03:39.140> swoops<00:03:39.980> in<00:03:40.250> here<00:03:40.519> and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
notice that kind of swoops in here and

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.819 
notice that kind of swoops in here and
if<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.060> close<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.299> goes<00:03:42.019> back<00:03:42.260> down<00:03:42.410> shrinks

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
if I close it goes back down shrinks

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.240 
if I close it goes back down shrinks
scale<00:03:43.760> that's<00:03:44.209> what<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.570> looking<00:03:44.840> for<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.620> so

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
scale that's what it looking for and so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.539 
scale that's what it looking for and so
if<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.239> hold<00:03:47.450> down<00:03:47.540> shift<00:03:48.019> and<00:03:48.170> do<00:03:48.320> it<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:49.400> I

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
if I hold down shift and do it just I

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.220 
if I hold down shift and do it just I
put<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.850> up<00:03:49.970> you'll<00:03:50.239> notice<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.720> as<00:03:50.840> in<00:03:50.989> slow

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
put it up you'll notice it as in slow

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.080 
put it up you'll notice it as in slow
motion<00:03:51.500> so<00:03:51.860> you<00:03:51.950> can<00:03:52.130> do<00:03:52.310> practically

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
motion so you can do practically

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.809 
motion so you can do practically
everything<00:03:53.810> in<00:03:54.320> slow<00:03:55.010> motion

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
everything in slow motion

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.610 
everything in slow motion
once<00:03:56.090> again<00:03:56.269> I'll<00:03:56.599> create<00:03:56.900> a<00:03:57.140> bunch<00:03:57.439> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
once again I'll create a bunch of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.050 
once again I'll create a bunch of
windows<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:59.450> up<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.469> hoe<00:04:00.590> down<00:04:00.769> shift<00:04:01.219> and<00:04:01.459> hit

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
windows and up a hoe down shift and hit

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.959 
windows and up a hoe down shift and hit
f3<00:04:02.319> you'll<00:04:03.319> notice<00:04:03.680> it's<00:04:03.859> in<00:04:04.280> slow<00:04:04.760> motion

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:04.969 
f3 you'll notice it's in slow motion

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.739 
f3 you'll notice it's in slow motion
opens<00:04:05.780> up<00:04:05.930> expose<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.999> if<00:04:07.999> I<00:04:08.060> hold<00:04:08.209> down<00:04:08.269> shift

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:08.749 
opens up expose and if I hold down shift

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.830 
opens up expose and if I hold down shift
command<00:04:09.290> F<00:04:09.469> 3<00:04:09.829> which<00:04:10.189> will<00:04:10.639> show<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.450> desktop

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
command F 3 which will show the desktop

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.749 
command F 3 which will show the desktop
it'll<00:04:12.290> do<00:04:12.379> that<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.709> slow<00:04:12.829> motion<00:04:13.129> and<00:04:15.759> just

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
it'll do that in slow motion and just

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:19.479 
it'll do that in slow motion and just
press<00:04:16.940> f3<00:04:17.180> back<00:04:17.539> they<00:04:17.780> open<00:04:18.109> up<00:04:18.169> that<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.590> think

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
press f3 back they open up that I think

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.570 
press f3 back they open up that I think
I'm<00:04:19.609> going<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.940> open<00:04:20.090> up<00:04:20.859> yeah<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:21.919> can<00:04:22.190> open

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
I'm going to open up yeah you can open

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.360 
I'm going to open up yeah you can open
up<00:04:22.849> that's<00:04:23.389> wild<00:04:23.660> dog<00:04:24.560> dashboard<00:04:25.039> in<00:04:25.160> slow

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
up that's wild dog dashboard in slow

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.089 
up that's wild dog dashboard in slow
motion<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.720> guess<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:27.139> know<00:04:27.289> anything<00:04:27.770> any

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
motion so I guess you know anything any

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.800 
motion so I guess you know anything any
type<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.310> transitional<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.000> fact<00:04:29.210> slow<00:04:29.419> motion

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
type of transitional in fact slow motion

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.070 
type of transitional in fact slow motion
and<00:04:30.009> if<00:04:31.009> I<00:04:31.099> hold<00:04:31.220> out<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.520> shift<00:04:31.789> I<00:04:32.180> thought

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
and if I hold out of shift I thought

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.629 
and if I hold out of shift I thought
yeah<00:04:33.289> shipped<00:04:33.620> in<00:04:33.830> try<00:04:34.039> to<00:04:34.099> minimize<00:04:34.430> my

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
yeah shipped in try to minimize my

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.870 
yeah shipped in try to minimize my
window<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.630> notice<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.320> will<00:04:36.639> minimize<00:04:37.639> in

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
window and notice it will minimize in

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.439 
window and notice it will minimize in
slow<00:04:38.090> motion<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.880> I'm<00:04:41.060> going<00:04:41.240> to<00:04:41.300> close

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
slow motion and so I'm going to close

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.480 
slow motion and so I'm going to close
these<00:04:41.630> windows<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.320> just<00:04:42.919> give<00:04:43.099> you<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.220> really

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
these windows and just give you a really

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.040 
these windows and just give you a really
big<00:04:43.520> example<00:04:46.330> minimize<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.509> in<00:04:47.660> slow<00:04:47.780> motion

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
big example minimize that in slow motion

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.650 
big example minimize that in slow motion
you<00:04:48.410> know<00:04:48.530> so<00:04:48.830> that's<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.789> few<00:04:50.270> keyboard

the<00:04:59.360> most<00:04:59.509> trouble<00:04:59.780> with<00:04:59.960> if<00:05:00.289> I<00:05:00.500> wasn't<00:05:01.870> so

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
the most trouble with if I wasn't so

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.710 
the most trouble with if I wasn't so
redundant<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:04.070> could<00:05:04.970> have<00:05:05.120> looked<00:05:05.300> over

redundant I could have looked over

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.320 
redundant I could have looked over

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
delete something actually I don't even

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.490 
delete something actually I don't even
see<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.409> so<00:05:15.680> maybe<00:05:16.580> it<00:05:16.759> wasn't<00:05:16.909> my<00:05:17.150> fault

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
see it so maybe it wasn't my fault

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.930

anyway<00:05:18.500> so<00:05:18.740> delete<00:05:19.250> something<00:05:19.520> it's<00:05:19.849> just

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
anyway so delete something it's just

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.610 
anyway so delete something it's just
