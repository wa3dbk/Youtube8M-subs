really<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.780> inspiration<00:00:13.080> for<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.889> was

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
really and the inspiration for it I was

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.150 
really and the inspiration for it I was
going<00:00:14.280> down<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.790> train<00:00:15.590> about<00:00:16.590> 100<00:00:16.980> miles

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
going down on a train about 100 miles

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.689 
going down on a train about 100 miles
away<00:00:17.310> from<00:00:17.580> London<00:00:17.940> cattle<00:00:18.779> class<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.699> my

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
away from London cattle class and my

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.509 
away from London cattle class and my
train<00:00:21.119> bill<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.539> about<00:00:21.779> 80<00:00:22.170> quid<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
train bill was about 80 quid and at the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.279 
train bill was about 80 quid and at the
same<00:00:23.699> time<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.970> was<00:00:24.119> looking<00:00:24.330> at<00:00:24.390> paper<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:25.260> a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
same time I was looking at paper with a

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.130 
same time I was looking at paper with a
return<00:00:25.680> flight<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.340> Marrakech<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.510> 70<00:00:27.930> quid

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
return flight to Marrakech for 70 quid

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.980 
return flight to Marrakech for 70 quid
so<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> inspiration<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.810> kind
