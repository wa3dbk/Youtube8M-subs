00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
here on the side Oppo was really drawing

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
here on the side Oppo was really drawing
from<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.689> theme<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.079> violin

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
whereas Xiaomi just flat-out gave it a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.839 
whereas Xiaomi just flat-out gave it a
curve<00:01:28.529> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.859> back<00:01:29.069> I've<00:01:29.279> always<00:01:29.579> loved<00:01:29.789> the

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:29.849 
curve on the back I've always loved the

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:32.419 
curve on the back I've always loved the
way<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:29.969> this<00:01:30.179> feels<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.630> hand<00:01:31.099> but<00:01:32.099> both<00:01:32.279> of

00:01:32.419 --> 00:01:32.429 
way that this feels in hand but both of

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.190 
way that this feels in hand but both of
these<00:01:32.520> devices<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.299> feel<00:01:33.479> very<00:01:33.779> solid

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
these devices actually feel very solid

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.489 
these devices actually feel very solid
this<00:01:34.469> feels<00:01:34.829> significantly<00:01:35.549> less<00:01:35.789> slippery

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
this feels significantly less slippery

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.849 
this feels significantly less slippery
for<00:01:37.499> how<00:01:37.590> thin<00:01:37.889> it<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:39.259> 6<00:01:40.259> no<00:01:40.709> no

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
for how thin it is now this is 6 no no

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:42.979 
for how thin it is now this is 6 no no
it's<00:01:41.099> supposed<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.459> be<00:01:41.639> a<00:01:41.849> 7<00:01:42.389> point<00:01:42.509> 7<00:01:42.630> but

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:42.989 
it's supposed to be a 7 point 7 but

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:44.179 
it's supposed to be a 7 point 7 but
they're<00:01:43.109> thinking<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.469> making<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.889> thinner

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
they're thinking of making it thinner

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.999 
they're thinking of making it thinner
and<00:01:44.599> 203<00:01:45.599> grams<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.349> may<00:01:46.499> even<00:01:46.529> make<00:01:46.889> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and 203 grams and they may even make it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.459 
and 203 grams and they may even make it
lighter<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:47.669> this<00:01:48.209> is<00:01:48.419> 7<00:01:48.719> millimeters<00:01:49.169> thin

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
lighter now this is 7 millimeters thin

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.529 
lighter now this is 7 millimeters thin
surprisingly<00:01:50.249> I<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.759> really<00:01:50.999> surprised<00:01:51.359> at

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
surprisingly I was really surprised at

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.269 
surprisingly I was really surprised at
that<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.689> guess<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.139> the<00:01:52.499> curve<00:01:52.739> makes<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.130> seem

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:53.279 
that I guess the the curve makes it seem

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.669 
that I guess the the curve makes it seem
a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.579> thinner<00:01:53.849> so<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> 7<00:01:55.259> millimeters

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
a lot thinner so this is 7 millimeters

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.729 
a lot thinner so this is 7 millimeters
at<00:01:55.829> 161<00:01:56.609> grams<00:01:57.059> with<00:01:57.299> 3000<00:01:58.289> milliamp<00:01:58.499> hour
