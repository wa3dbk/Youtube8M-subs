Destroyer move it to the left and right

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
Destroyer move it to the left and right
to<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> link<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.420> move<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> middle

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to the link just move to the middle

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.389 
to the link just move to the middle
until<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.500> gets<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> yellow<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.160> then

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
start moving it up and down until you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.650 
start moving it up and down until you
get<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.579> spot<00:01:02.850> where<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.149> pull<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
get to the spot where you can pull it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.270 
get to the spot where you can pull it
straight<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.409> point<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.769> hold

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
straight down at that point just hold

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
straight down at that point just hold
down<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.240> both<00:01:06.450> sticks<00:01:06.780> don't<00:01:07.140> move<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.590> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
down on both sticks don't move it up and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.870 
down on both sticks don't move it up and
down<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.070> it's<00:01:08.280> showing<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.850> screen

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
down like it's showing you on the screen

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.810 
down like it's showing you on the screen
just<00:01:09.600> hold<00:01:09.840> straight<00:01:10.140> down<00:01:10.610> then<00:01:11.610> you'll<00:01:11.729> have

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
just hold straight down then you'll have

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.870 
just hold straight down then you'll have
to<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> couple<00:01:12.330> times<00:01:13.580> because<00:01:14.580> every

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
to do this a couple times because every

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.560 
to do this a couple times because every
time<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.380> kill<00:01:16.650> all<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> Thai<00:01:17.159> fighters<00:01:17.570> in

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
time you kill all the Thai fighters in

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.210 
time you kill all the Thai fighters in
another<00:01:18.840> minute<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.259> so<00:01:19.320> another<00:01:19.890> way<00:01:20.040> with

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
another minute or so another way with

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.530 
another minute or so another way with
them<00:01:20.340> comes<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> kill<00:01:21.270> them<00:01:21.390> off

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
them comes and you have to kill them off

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.230 
them comes and you have to kill them off
and<00:01:21.810> let<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> Star<00:01:22.500> Destroyer<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:26.240> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and let go of the Star Destroyer and so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
and let go of the Star Destroyer and so
lightning<00:01:27.600> obviously<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> best<00:01:28.380> strategy

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
lightning obviously is the best strategy

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.969 
lightning obviously is the best strategy
for<00:01:29.009> ty<00:01:29.310> oh<00:01:29.610> yes<00:01:30.060> lightning<00:01:30.840> jump<00:01:31.590> double

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
for ty oh yes lightning jump double

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.620 
for ty oh yes lightning jump double
jumping<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.549> using<00:01:32.909> lightning<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.420> TIE

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
jumping and using lightning on the TIE

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
jumping and using lightning on the TIE
fighters<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.770> by<00:01:35.070> far<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> easiest<00:01:35.640> way<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
fighters is by far the easiest way to

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.170 
fighters is by far the easiest way to
kill<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.630> guys<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.369> grab<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:38.880> out<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
kill these guys you can grab them out of

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.499 
kill these guys you can grab them out of
the<00:01:39.240> air<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.990> throw<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:42.090> floating

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the air and you can throw the floating

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.429 
the air and you can throw the floating
kegs<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:43.079> them<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:44.369> it's<00:01:44.850> much<00:01:45.149> easier<00:01:45.689> much

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
kegs at them but it's much easier much

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.670 
kegs at them but it's much easier much
more<00:01:46.500> energy<00:01:47.189> efficient<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.680> midi-chlorian

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
more energy efficient or midi-chlorian

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.200 
more energy efficient or midi-chlorian

efficient force power efficient to just

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.380 
efficient force power efficient to just
double<00:01:54.720> jumping<00:01:54.990> use<00:01:55.140> lightning<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.770> and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
double jumping use lightning on them and
