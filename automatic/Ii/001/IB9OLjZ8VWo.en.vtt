survival<00:00:05.250> world<00:00:05.870> I've<00:00:06.870> been<00:00:07.140> working<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.500> a

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
survival world I've been working on a

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.169 
survival world I've been working on a
few<00:00:07.799> things<00:00:08.069> here<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:08.460> while<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> was<00:00:08.849> doing<00:00:09.000> it

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
few things here and while I was doing it

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.879 
few things here and while I was doing it
I<00:00:09.300> noticed<00:00:09.599> something<00:00:09.750> pop<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.440> lot<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
I noticed something pop up a lot and

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
I noticed something pop up a lot and
someone<00:00:11.759> asked<00:00:11.969> me<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> question<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:12.929> of

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
someone asked me a question in one of

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.390 
someone asked me a question in one of
the<00:00:13.080> comments<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:13.679> gonna<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.040> go<00:00:14.219> over

video but it is a pretty handy video so
with<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> introduction<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.890> tu<00:00:20.160> 19<00:00:20.550> I've

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
with the introduction of tu 19 I've

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.570 
with the introduction of tu 19 I've
noticed<00:00:21.180> several<00:00:22.039> different<00:00:23.039> kind<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
noticed several different kind of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.630 
noticed several different kind of
inventions<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.539> tutorials<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.560> things

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
inventions and tutorials and things

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
inventions and tutorials and things
almost<00:00:26.640> always<00:00:26.910> well<00:00:27.660> at<00:00:27.960> least<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.349> least

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
almost always well at least at least

almost always well at least at least
three<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:28.949> four<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.550> included<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> hopper

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
three or four now have included a hopper

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.110 
three or four now have included a hopper
timer<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.560> I'm<00:00:32.070> gonna<00:00:32.279> really<00:00:32.550> show<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
timer so I'm gonna really show you I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.910 
timer so I'm gonna really show you I
mean<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.630> hopper<00:00:33.960> timer<00:00:34.170> almost<00:00:34.680> actually

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
mean the hopper timer almost actually

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.420 
mean the hopper timer almost actually
solves<00:00:35.460> tons<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.940> different<00:00:36.090> problems<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> I'm

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
solves tons of different problems so I'm

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.799 
solves tons of different problems so I'm
gonna<00:00:38.550> show<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:39.719> gonna

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
gonna show you how to make one I'm gonna

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
gonna show you how to make one I'm gonna
show<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.170> few<00:00:40.440> uses<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> just<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> couple

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
show you a few uses of it just a couple

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
show you a few uses of it just a couple
I'll<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.360> point<00:00:42.570> them<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I'll just point them out right here so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
I'll just point them out right here so
I'm<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:44.010> mountain<00:00:44.219> generator<00:00:44.730> here<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
I'm a mountain generator here this is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.029 
I'm a mountain generator here this is
one<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> times<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.829> be

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
one of the times that you're gonna be

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.150 
one of the times that you're gonna be
using<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.460> hopper<00:00:47.789> timer<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.809> hopper<00:00:49.710> timer<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
using a hopper timer a hopper timer is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
using a hopper timer a hopper timer is
basically<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.969> new<00:00:51.210> way<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> do<00:00:51.780> kind<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
basically the new way to do kind of

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.470 
basically the new way to do kind of
timing<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.100> before<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.640> use<00:00:53.850> those<00:00:54.059> older

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
timing one before we use those older

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.939 
timing one before we use those older
circuits<00:00:54.930> I'll<00:00:55.079> show<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> over<00:00:55.469> there<00:00:55.710> am<00:00:55.829> i

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
circuits I'll show you over there am i

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.209 
circuits I'll show you over there am i
at<00:00:56.129> my<00:00:56.370> mining<00:00:57.000> machine<00:00:57.350> basically<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.949> just

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
at my mining machine basically it's just

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.880 
at my mining machine basically it's just
a<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> time<00:00:59.850> power<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.809> source<00:01:01.170> in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a way to time power going to a source in

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.650 
a way to time power going to a source in
the<00:01:01.949> olden<00:01:02.370> days<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.699> used<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.030> whole<00:01:03.239> bunch<00:01:03.510> of

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the olden days you used a whole bunch of

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.500 
the olden days you used a whole bunch of
repeaters<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.890> sort<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.189> thing<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.330> now

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
repeaters and this sort of thing but now

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.990 
repeaters and this sort of thing but now
we<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.810> use<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> hopper<00:01:07.740> timer<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.250> from

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we just use this hopper timer I'm from

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.510 
we just use this hopper timer I'm from
what<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> gather<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:09.810> invented<00:01:10.350> by<00:01:10.560> ethos

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
what I gather it was invented by ethos

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.580 
what I gather it was invented by ethos
once<00:01:11.729> upon<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> time<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.780> found<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> video<00:01:13.260> by

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
once upon a time and I found a video by

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
once upon a time and I found a video by
him<00:01:13.830> from<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> while<00:01:14.369> ago<00:01:14.509> that<00:01:15.509> shows<00:01:15.720> him

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
him from a while ago that shows him

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
him from a while ago that shows him
making<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.650> ever<00:01:16.860> since<00:01:17.159> then<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> gotta

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
making it but ever since then I gotta

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.740 
making it but ever since then I gotta
say<00:01:17.939> I've<00:01:18.180> seen<00:01:18.390> it

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
say I've seen it

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.719 
say I've seen it
hunt<00:01:19.200> dozens<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> dozens<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.520> different

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
hunt dozens and dozens of different

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.270 
hunt dozens and dozens of different
inventions<00:01:21.150> by<00:01:21.479> different<00:01:21.840> people<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:23.009> I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
inventions by different people so I'm

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.649 
inventions by different people so I'm
assuming<00:01:23.549> he's<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> one<00:01:24.180> who<00:01:24.299> made<00:01:24.479> it

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
assuming he's the one who made it

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.090 
assuming he's the one who made it
I'll<00:01:24.990> give<00:01:25.170> him<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.439> shadow<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.830> he<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I'll give him a shadow as he has a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.340 
I'll give him a shadow as he has a
million<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> half<00:01:26.670> subs<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.840> sure<00:01:28.140> he

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
million and a half subs so I'm sure he

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
million and a half subs so I'm sure he
this<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.070> probably<00:01:29.369> one<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.790> reasons<00:01:29.939> I'm

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this was probably one of the reasons I'm

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.630 
this was probably one of the reasons I'm
just<00:01:30.479> gonna<00:01:30.570> show<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> how<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> make<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.640> once

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
just gonna show you how to make it once

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.130 
just gonna show you how to make it once
I<00:01:32.759> show<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.030> how<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.540> guy's<00:01:33.780> see

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
I show you how to make this guy's see

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
I show you how to make this guy's see
how<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.590> turns<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.340> again<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.820> can

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
how it just turns and then again you can

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.490 
how it just turns and then again you can
make<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> two

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
make it do it see I have it on a two

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
make it do it see I have it on a two
stack<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.490> make<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.360> stack

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stack you can make this a one stack

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
stack you can make this a one stack
there's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.960> few<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.290> things<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.890> a

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there's a few other things that have a

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
there's a few other things that have a
hopper<00:01:41.250> timer<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> I'll<00:01:42.960> show<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.320> an

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
hopper timer so I'll show you an

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
hopper timer so I'll show you an
old-fashioned<00:01:44.490> way<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.840> if<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
old-fashioned way that like if you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
old-fashioned way that like if you
wanted<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.340> rapid-fire<00:01:47.820> timer<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
wanted to do like a rapid-fire timer the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
wanted to do like a rapid-fire timer the
old-fashioned<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> was<00:01:50.340> more<00:01:50.549> glitchy

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
old-fashioned way and was more glitchy

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.240 
old-fashioned way and was more glitchy
and<00:01:51.119> buggy<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.689> something<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.130> is

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and buggy is something like this here is

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.920 
and buggy is something like this here is
where<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.970> used<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.450> create<00:01:54.689> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
where you used to just create this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.340 
where you used to just create this
circuit<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:55.590> spun<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> circle<00:01:56.520> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
circuit that's spun in a circle and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
circuit that's spun in a circle and
really<00:01:58.350> kind<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.799> Dell<00:01:59.250> glitched<00:01:59.579> out<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
really kind of like Dell glitched out it

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520 
really kind of like Dell glitched out it
wasn't<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.390> good<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:01.020> could<00:02:01.170> just<00:02:01.380> do<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
wasn't that good but you could just do a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.700 
wasn't that good but you could just do a
hopper<00:02:01.920> timer<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.840> one<00:02:03.840> block<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.439> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
hopper timer with say one block in it so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.200 
hopper timer with say one block in it so
something<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.520> would<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.820> used<00:02:06.090> for

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
something like that would be used for

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.169 
something like that would be used for
something<00:02:06.930> even<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> water<00:02:07.860> drop<00:02:08.179> or

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
something even like a water drop or

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
something even like a water drop or
anything<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.810> goes<00:02:09.929> instant<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.649> let's<00:02:10.800> just

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
anything that goes instant so let's just

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.380 
anything that goes instant so let's just
find<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.280> spot<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.030> show<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.300> how

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
find a spot right here and show you how

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.020 
find a spot right here and show you how
to<00:02:12.420> make<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> hop

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
to make a hop

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.480 
to make a hop
time<00:02:13.380> will<00:02:14.380> do<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.770> next<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.070> Adrienne's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
time will do it right next to Adrienne's

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.720 
time will do it right next to Adrienne's
house<00:02:16.950> she<00:02:17.950> said<00:02:18.130> someone<00:02:18.340> messed<00:02:18.610> around

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
house she said someone messed around

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.040 
house she said someone messed around
with<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:19.060> house<00:02:19.210> I'm<00:02:19.330> just<00:02:19.420> gonna<00:02:19.570> go<00:02:19.720> do<00:02:19.930> it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
with this house I'm just gonna go do it

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.080 
with this house I'm just gonna go do it
a<00:02:20.080> little<00:02:20.170> quick<00:02:20.440> check<00:02:20.710> yeah<00:02:21.520> I<00:02:21.610> think<00:02:21.730> there

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
a little quick check yeah I think there

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.390 
a little quick check yeah I think there
was<00:02:22.240> lava<00:02:22.540> down<00:02:22.900> here<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.830> don't<00:02:24.310> know

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
was lava down here and then I don't know

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.500 
was lava down here and then I don't know
oh<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:25.120> lava<00:02:25.450> walls<00:02:26.910> let's<00:02:27.910> go<00:02:28.060> outside<00:02:28.210> we

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
oh the lava walls let's go outside we

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.790 
oh the lava walls let's go outside we
don't<00:02:28.570> need<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.840> do<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.020> in<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.200> dark<00:02:29.410> we'll

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
don't need to do it in the dark we'll

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.170 
don't need to do it in the dark we'll
build<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.100> right<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.370> top<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.820> tree<00:02:31.030> ins

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
build it right on top of a tree ins

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.360 
build it right on top of a tree ins
house<00:02:31.380> see<00:02:32.380> if<00:02:32.410> Adrienne<00:02:32.830> likes<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> when<00:02:33.250> he

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
house see if Adrienne likes it when he

house see if Adrienne likes it when he
comes<00:02:33.490> back<00:02:33.730> could<00:02:33.970> be<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> hopper<00:02:34.420> timer<00:02:34.630> on

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
comes back could be a hopper timer on

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.790 
comes back could be a hopper timer on
top<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.080> his<00:02:35.170> house<00:02:35.320> Oh<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:38.230> no<00:02:38.410> he<00:02:38.680> won't

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
top of his house Oh actually no he won't

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.020 
top of his house Oh actually no he won't
even<00:02:38.980> see<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.790> my

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
even see this because this is my

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.730 
even see this because this is my
creative<00:02:40.450> world<00:02:40.630> Oh<00:02:40.810> No

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
creative world Oh No

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.470 
creative world Oh No
okay<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:42.190> let's<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.610> drop<00:02:42.760> on<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.060> floor<00:02:43.090> so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
okay so let's just drop on the floor so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.050 
okay so let's just drop on the floor so
let's<00:02:44.170> start<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.620> hopper<00:02:44.950> timer<00:02:45.160> out<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:45.670> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
let's start this hopper timer out so the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.290 
let's start this hopper timer out so the
easiest<00:02:46.450> way<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.720> start<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.110> hopper<00:02:47.410> timer<00:02:47.650> is

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
easiest way to start a hopper timer is

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.630 
easiest way to start a hopper timer is
grab<00:02:49.300> some<00:02:49.510> sticky<00:02:49.840> pistons<00:02:50.370> two<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.520> them

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
grab some sticky pistons two of them

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.180 
grab some sticky pistons two of them
you're<00:02:51.940> gonna<00:02:52.060> need<00:02:52.360> mm-hmm<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.560> you're

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
you're gonna need mm-hmm and you're

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.370 
you're gonna need mm-hmm and you're
gonna<00:02:54.310> need<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.610> redstone<00:02:54.880> block<00:02:55.230> again<00:02:56.230> this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
gonna need a redstone block again this

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.060 
gonna need a redstone block again this
is<00:02:56.530> something<00:02:56.739> new<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.040> we<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:57.640> for<00:02:59.070> 40

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
is something new that we could do for 40

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.930 
is something new that we could do for 40
you<00:03:00.190> nineteen<00:03:00.870> grab<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.250> piston<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:05.940> piston

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
you nineteen grab the piston and piston

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.850 
you nineteen grab the piston and piston
and<00:03:08.880> block<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.330> when<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.840> do<00:03:10.959> that<00:03:11.080> throw

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
and block so when you do that throw

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.340 
and block so when you do that throw
yourself<00:03:12.130> some<00:03:12.280> dust<00:03:12.520> behind<00:03:12.820> here<00:03:13.350> just

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
yourself some dust behind here just

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.920 
yourself some dust behind here just
behind<00:03:14.500> here<00:03:14.860> looks<00:03:15.850> good<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.360> don't<00:03:16.540> like<00:03:16.660> the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
behind here looks good I don't like the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.710 
behind here looks good I don't like the
stupid<00:03:17.350> weeds<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:17.769> my<00:03:17.799> way<00:03:18.070> bothering<00:03:18.580> me<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
stupid weeds in my way bothering me and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.130 
stupid weeds in my way bothering me and
then<00:03:19.780> throw<00:03:20.260> yourself<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.680> block<00:03:20.890> right<00:03:21.070> here

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
then throw yourself a block right here

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:32.759 
then throw yourself a block right here
and<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:30.310> you<00:03:30.459> go<00:03:31.200> comparator<00:03:32.200> comparator

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
and there you go comparator comparator

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.340 
and there you go comparator comparator
and<00:03:32.799> then<00:03:33.100> throw<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.370> hopper<00:03:33.790> here

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
and then throw a hopper here

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.720 
and then throw a hopper here
crouch<00:03:35.350> down<00:03:35.380> place<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.160> bust<00:03:36.430> it<00:03:36.580> out

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
crouch down place it in bust it out

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.440 
crouch down place it in bust it out
place<00:03:37.239> it<00:03:37.420> in<00:03:38.549> so<00:03:39.549> now<00:03:39.730> that<00:03:39.790> you've<00:03:40.000> seen<00:03:40.239> that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
place it in so now that you've seen that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.210 
place it in so now that you've seen that
you've<00:03:40.720> pretty<00:03:41.080> much<00:03:41.230> completed<00:03:41.769> a<00:03:41.950> hopper

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
you've pretty much completed a hopper

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.900 
you've pretty much completed a hopper
timer<00:03:42.780> with<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.130> basically<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.549> is<00:03:45.760> now

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
timer with the basically this is now

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.600 
timer with the basically this is now
gonna<00:03:46.180> be<00:03:46.390> your<00:03:46.540> output<00:03:46.930> right<00:03:47.110> here<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:48.040> how

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
gonna be your output right here so how

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.370 
gonna be your output right here so how
long<00:03:48.850> does<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.030> take<00:03:49.329> to<00:03:49.480> go<00:03:49.630> so<00:03:49.959> let's<00:03:49.989> just

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
long does it take to go so let's just

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.930 
long does it take to go so let's just
say<00:03:50.560> we're<00:03:50.860> gonna<00:03:50.950> throw<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.519> and<00:03:51.760> let's

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
say we're gonna throw it in and let's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.460 
say we're gonna throw it in and let's
just<00:03:52.180> put<00:03:52.390> it<00:03:52.510> let's<00:03:52.870> make<00:03:53.019> it<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.230> quicker

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
just put it let's make it a quicker

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.310 
just put it let's make it a quicker
hopper<00:03:53.890> timer<00:03:54.130> let's<00:03:54.910> put<00:03:55.209> in<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:58.750> two<00:03:58.989> three

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
hopper timer let's put in one two three

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.819 
hopper timer let's put in one two three
four<00:03:59.560> five<00:03:59.829> see<00:04:00.340> so<00:04:00.730> now<00:04:00.880> we<00:04:00.940> got<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.209> five

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
four five see so now we got a five

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.380 
four five see so now we got a five
something<00:04:02.829> quicker<00:04:03.280> is<00:04:03.519> gonna<00:04:03.700> be<00:04:03.910> like<00:04:04.120> say

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
something quicker is gonna be like say

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.750 
something quicker is gonna be like say
let's<00:04:05.110> let's<00:04:05.650> even<00:04:05.860> take<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.280> out<00:04:06.459> once<00:04:06.640> it

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
let's let's even take this out once it

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.120 
let's let's even take this out once it
gets<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:06.970> five<00:04:07.320> there<00:04:08.320> you<00:04:08.410> go<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:08.739> now<00:04:08.860> we<00:04:08.920> turn

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
gets to five there you go so now we turn

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.940 
gets to five there you go so now we turn
it<00:04:09.310> off<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:10.090> basically<00:04:10.959> if<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.260> want<00:04:11.560> this<00:04:11.769> to

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
it off so basically if you want this to

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.310 
it off so basically if you want this to
go<00:04:12.100> fast<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.670> can<00:04:12.820> even<00:04:13.000> do<00:04:13.209> one<00:04:13.450> watch<00:04:14.049> it'll

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
go fast you can even do one watch it'll

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.150 
go fast you can even do one watch it'll
go<00:04:14.470> right<00:04:14.680> away<00:04:19.109> what's<00:04:20.109> going<00:04:20.440> on<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.829> think<00:04:21.070> I

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
go right away what's going on I think I

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.379 
go right away what's going on I think I
locked<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.549> up

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
locked it up

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.840 
locked it up
hmm<00:04:26.690> there<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.780> go<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.830> that<00:04:29.190> one<00:04:29.310> goes<00:04:29.340> really

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
hmm there you go so that one goes really

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.939 
hmm there you go so that one goes really
quick<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.630> one<00:04:30.810> kind<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.169> locked<00:04:31.320> it<00:04:31.470> up<00:04:31.590> but

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
quick the one kind of locked it up but

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.920 
quick the one kind of locked it up but
if<00:04:32.220> you<00:04:32.699> need<00:04:32.910> something<00:04:33.120> to<00:04:33.240> turn<00:04:33.479> on<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:33.900> off

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
if you need something to turn on and off

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.659 
if you need something to turn on and off
very<00:04:34.139> quickly<00:04:34.500> that<00:04:34.979> will<00:04:35.160> be<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.370> new<00:04:35.520> way<00:04:35.639> to

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
very quickly that will be the new way to

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.790 
very quickly that will be the new way to
do<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.110> let's<00:04:37.110> try<00:04:37.290> to<00:04:37.380> take<00:04:37.650> these<00:04:37.830> out<00:04:39.800> and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
do it let's try to take these out and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.439 
do it let's try to take these out and
there<00:04:40.919> you<00:04:40.949> go<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.340> we<00:04:41.430> turn<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.760> off<00:04:41.880> so

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
there you go so we turn it off so

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.450 
there you go so we turn it off so
basically<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.500> your<00:04:43.800> new<00:04:43.979> best<00:04:44.160> friend

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
basically this is your new best friend

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.800 
basically this is your new best friend
guys<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.970> know<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.240> seems<00:04:45.510> pretty

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
guys I know it seems pretty

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.230 
guys I know it seems pretty
straightforward<00:04:46.100> but<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.460> here<00:04:47.520> but

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
straightforward but this right here but

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.330 
straightforward but this right here but
what<00:04:48.570> I'm<00:04:48.810> pretty<00:04:49.080> sure<00:04:49.199> created<00:04:49.680> by<00:04:49.770> ethos<00:04:50.130> is

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
what I'm pretty sure created by ethos is

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.340 
what I'm pretty sure created by ethos is
actually<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.240> new<00:04:51.479> cool<00:04:51.810> way<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:51.990> do<00:04:52.229> it

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
actually the new cool way to do it

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.320 
actually the new cool way to do it
because<00:04:52.470> instead<00:04:53.400> of<00:04:53.550> messing<00:04:53.729> around<00:04:54.030> you

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
because instead of messing around you

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.020 
because instead of messing around you
know<00:04:54.419> this<00:04:54.660> could<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:54.960> taken<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.560> like<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:56.030> blaze

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
know this could be taken to like a blaze

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.210 
know this could be taken to like a blaze
crusher<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.840> blaze<00:04:58.110> farm<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.770> just<00:04:58.979> put

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
crusher and a blaze farm you just put

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.430 
crusher and a blaze farm you just put
the<00:04:59.370> right<00:04:59.639> amount<00:04:59.669> of<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.900> right<00:05:01.050> amount<00:05:01.110> of

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
the right amount of the right amount of

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.260 
the right amount of the right amount of
items<00:05:01.560> in<00:05:01.919> there<00:05:02.130> that<00:05:02.430> will<00:05:02.550> crush<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:03.060> blaze

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
items in there that will crush the blaze

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.140 
items in there that will crush the blaze
and<00:05:03.740> instead<00:05:04.740> of<00:05:04.860> doing<00:05:05.160> all<00:05:05.400> these<00:05:05.610> huge

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
and instead of doing all these huge

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.850 
and instead of doing all these huge
circuits<00:05:06.810> which<00:05:06.990> is<00:05:07.139> what<00:05:07.290> everybody<00:05:07.650> had<00:05:07.830> to

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
circuits which is what everybody had to

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.940 
circuits which is what everybody had to
do<00:05:08.130> in<00:05:08.910> console<00:05:09.479> addition<00:05:09.840> up<00:05:09.960> till<00:05:10.139> tu<00:05:10.380> 19<00:05:10.740> so

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
do in console addition up till tu 19 so

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.490 
do in console addition up till tu 19 so
now<00:05:11.100> we<00:05:11.430> just<00:05:11.460> put<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:11.970> in<00:05:12.090> one<00:05:12.780> stack<00:05:13.110> will<00:05:13.380> go

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
now we just put it in one stack will go

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.250 
now we just put it in one stack will go
one<00:05:13.740> stack<00:05:14.479> play<00:05:15.479> around<00:05:15.720> with<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.990> times

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
one stack play around with the times
