00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
always look back and think if only we'd

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:20.839

had<00:02:19.799> done<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.189> and<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.430> don't<00:02:20.610> think<00:02:20.700> they're

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
had done this and I don't think they're

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.520 
had done this and I don't think they're
leaving<00:02:20.939> any<00:02:21.299> stone<00:02:21.599> unturned<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> think

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
leaving any stone unturned so I think

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.809 
leaving any stone unturned so I think
it's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> wise<00:02:22.890> decision<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.519> bring<00:02:23.670> in

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
it's a wise decision to bring in

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.160 
it's a wise decision to bring in
somebody<00:02:24.060> who's<00:02:24.329> still<00:02:24.659> got<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.989> following

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.569 
you know think of the fresh matchups it
brings<00:02:27.180> think<00:02:28.019> about<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:29.189> following

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
brings think about the the following

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.190 
brings think about the the following
that<00:02:29.700> Batista<00:02:30.180> has<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.750> fact<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.019> that's

is become more and more of the case that

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.520

they're<00:04:14.970> pulling<00:04:15.299> back<00:04:15.359> on<00:04:15.510> on<00:04:15.900> shelling<00:04:16.769> out

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
they're pulling back on on shelling out

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.129 
they're pulling back on on shelling out
big<00:04:16.919> contracts<00:04:17.489> themselves<00:04:18.000> so<00:04:18.690> you're<00:04:19.019> right

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
big contracts themselves so you're right

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.289 
big contracts themselves so you're right
there's<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.590> lack<00:04:20.099> of<00:04:20.130> competition<00:04:20.760> i<00:04:21.060> think

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
there's a lack of competition i think

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.779 
there's a lack of competition i think
that<00:04:21.539> but<00:04:22.440> i<00:04:22.530> think<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:22.770> they<00:04:23.039> both<00:04:23.520> those

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
that but i think that they both those

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:27.010 
that but i think that they both those
things<00:04:23.820> add<00:04:24.360> to<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.960> perhaps<00:04:25.680> lack<00:04:26.250> of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
things add to the perhaps lack of

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.619 
things add to the perhaps lack of
you<00:04:27.259> know<00:04:27.550> morale<00:04:28.550> in<00:04:28.819> it<00:04:29.060> within<00:04:29.270> a<00:04:29.449> company

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:29.629 
you know morale in it within a company

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:31.270 
you know morale in it within a company
because<00:04:30.080> they've<00:04:30.229> now<00:04:30.379> got<00:04:30.620> no<00:04:30.800> option<00:04:31.099> to<00:04:31.129> go

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
because they've now got no option to go

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.860 
because they've now got no option to go
elsewhere<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:31.819> they're<00:04:32.030> being<00:04:32.150> sort<00:04:32.780> of

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
elsewhere and they're being sort of

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.330 
elsewhere and they're being sort of
passed<00:04:33.169> over<00:04:33.530> if<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.770> like<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:33.949> some<00:04:34.250> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
passed over if you like for some of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.279 
passed over if you like for some of
these<00:04:34.400> bigger<00:04:34.580> starts<00:04:35.000> potentially<00:04:35.539> or<00:04:35.900> what

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289 
these bigger starts potentially or what

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.689 
these bigger starts potentially or what
are<00:04:36.379> considered<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.860> be<00:04:36.949> bigger<00:04:37.280> size<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.639> as

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
are considered to be bigger size and as

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:40.540 
are considered to be bigger size and as
I<00:04:37.789> say<00:04:37.970> for<00:04:38.389> me<00:04:38.569> if<00:04:39.530> when<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:39.860> rock<00:04:40.069> comes<00:04:40.310> back

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
I say for me if when the rock comes back

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.369 
I say for me if when the rock comes back
I<00:04:40.789> say<00:04:41.090> well<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.659> know<00:04:41.750> there's<00:04:41.870> no<00:04:42.289> one

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:42.379 
I say well you know there's no one

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:43.600 
I say well you know there's no one
reason<00:04:42.650> why<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.800> rock<00:04:42.949> comes<00:04:43.159> back<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:43.520> is

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
reason why the rock comes back and is

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.070 
reason why the rock comes back and is
able<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:44.000> come<00:04:44.120> back<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.389> the<00:04:44.479> reason<00:04:44.720> why<00:04:44.810> W

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
able to come back and the reason why W

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.480 
able to come back and the reason why W
we<00:04:45.169> will<00:04:45.259> pay<00:04:45.379> them<00:04:45.409> that<00:04:45.650> much<00:04:45.770> money<00:04:45.979> is

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
we will pay them that much money is

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.369 
we will pay them that much money is
because<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:46.909> rock<00:04:47.060> genuinely<00:04:47.599> nobody<00:04:48.229> is<00:04:48.349> a

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:48.379 
because the rock genuinely nobody is a

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:49.930 
because the rock genuinely nobody is a
bigger<00:04:48.680> star<00:04:48.889> is<00:04:49.009> the<00:04:49.129> rock<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.699> entire

punks and the Daniel Bryan's that really

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.140 
punks and the Daniel Bryan's that really
I<00:06:03.020> mean<00:06:03.770> it's<00:06:03.949> a<00:06:04.009> woman<00:06:04.219> to<00:06:04.400> me<00:06:04.550> almost<00:06:04.759> looks

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
I mean it's a woman to me almost looks

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.180 
I mean it's a woman to me almost looks
like<00:06:05.240> that<00:06:05.479> could<00:06:05.630> be<00:06:05.659> perceived<00:06:05.990> as<00:06:06.500> being<00:06:06.919> a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
like that could be perceived as being a

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.930 
like that could be perceived as being a
level<00:06:07.669> of<00:06:08.469> no<00:06:09.469> confidence<00:06:09.740> but<00:06:10.400> essentially

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
level of no confidence but essentially

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.430 
level of no confidence but essentially
in<00:06:11.120> those<00:06:11.389> smaller<00:06:11.690> guards<00:06:12.080> and<00:06:12.229> I<00:06:12.259> think

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
in those smaller guards and I think

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.860 
in those smaller guards and I think
that's<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.680> topic<00:06:12.889> for<00:06:13.039> another<00:06:13.550> time<00:06:13.849> but<00:06:14.840> I

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
that's a topic for another time but I

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.290 
that's a topic for another time but I
think<00:06:14.960> Batista<00:06:15.380> could<00:06:15.740> be<00:06:15.969> again<00:06:16.969> we'll<00:06:17.150> see

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
think Batista could be again we'll see

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.550 
think Batista could be again we'll see
what<00:06:17.419> happens<00:06:17.509> you<00:06:18.080> know<00:06:18.199> we'll<00:06:18.319> see<00:06:18.349> what

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
what happens you know we'll see what

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.839 
what happens you know we'll see what
happens<00:06:18.650> but<00:06:18.919> but<00:06:19.159> but<00:06:19.340> that<00:06:19.370> could<00:06:19.669> be<00:06:19.819> that

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
happens but but but that could be that

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.580 
happens but but but that could be that
could<00:06:20.300> be<00:06:20.599> something<00:06:20.779> that<00:06:20.990> really<00:06:21.259> start

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590
