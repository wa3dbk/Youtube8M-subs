00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.950
 we don't need flour anymore 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:40.870
 now go we need one piece of butter 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.660
 oh so me this slimy oil can 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.660
 two hands agony thread somehow 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.290
 under no doubt it's still excess 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:55.090
 sleeve will be left-handed like real geniuses 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:59.940
 so lower the hand omit and grab no 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:03.550
 not that something is not necessary to go closer 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.240
 God, how is it so difficult to be 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.920

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.010

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.229
 throw duck butter there and sugar left 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.199
 left sugar is not so difficult 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.680
 turned out like I thought especially if you 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.199
 left handed 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:31.370
 on management here is just hellish honest 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:35.850
 saying so grab grab so grab 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:41.370
 no no no just don't fall just not 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:44.099
 fall grabbed 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:50.000
 we grabbed him so sugar grabbed 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:55.710
 keep wonderful wonderful 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.759
 it seems to me that your sugar hour has come 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.039
 get enough sleep 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:05.520
 how do you pour yourself out how do you pour out 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:07.400
 god sugar sugar sleep sad 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.889
 sugar story does not want to intercede 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:16.289
 will have to pass it well let's 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:22.620
 probably try to take the other hand that 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:26.180
 Does hand number two come in handy 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.180
 Clamp your side here ok 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.060
 now the main thing is not to break this 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:41.420
 freaking bowl correctly understand 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:44.420
 right stop stop right hand 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.420

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.289
 pour it out pouring freaking sugar 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:59.760
 in short, I understood that now we are perfect 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.710
 need to take this plate 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.550
 I thought we would cook right so far 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.320
 so we are not with the eggs and sugar 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.390
 while in the package for we will prepare 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:14.060
 I hope that maybe we do not 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:18.960
 there was a sugar 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.230
 I took and can not understand it I took this 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.230
 a bowl 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:33.930

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:37.250

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:57.690
 practically already baked a pie and put it down 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:07:01.169
 how do you let out like very well 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:04.259
 wait no just not through the grid like 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.479
 so it turns out that through the mesh well 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:11.150
 Okay, let's go like this because it will rise 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:17.610
 on the grid yes we cooked a pie and 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:19.380
 ready to close the door Well
