00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.910
 dvd criticism and this week should be 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.500
 right in my second kinostart go 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.320
 namely to a series of two times 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 is filmed after the 1995 er version 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.460
 with is that main role delaunay 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:25.289
 and that's about the kinostart today 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:30.510
 by dread 3d 800 million people 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 live in the ruins of the old world and 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.030
 only one instance of the regulation in the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.030
 chaos fights 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 and women from the Justices palace 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.329
 in peachtree it becomes the whole slomo 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.510
 we had produced for mega city one 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 no george street for a long time 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.010
 now they have one she has over everything 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.520
 the control 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.690
 Stage one to two dogs 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540
 June 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 is not that good 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.940
 i want to comfort her we have to go in the middle 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.940
 through them you are ready 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.870
 Do you look that way ? 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.460
 and just too fresh stretch of time 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.460
 completed 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.540
 but is not the law that's me 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 the season is over 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.150
 Dirt 3d or really only dirt in the 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.750
 original of the same title from the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.940
 year 2012 and goes 95 minutes has fsk18 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.979
 we come across it quite brutally and it 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.600
 comes to the history of george kick 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.920
 in the united states one not 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.690
 unspecified future is 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.180
 There are now 800 million 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.830
 inhabitants most old skyscrapers 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 are abandoned and almost barracked 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.240
 Meanwhile, there are huge blocks in the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.830
 Tens of thousands of people live where themselves 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.630
 Tens of thousands and they still have to 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.580
 control keep unemployment 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 is as high as never before and the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.390
 crime on the streets as well 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.070
 and the jazz are from the Ministry of Justice 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.350
 the only ones to impose a verdict 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.870
 may do it immediately and thus 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.120
 is one of the noblest people ever 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.739
 follow the law and on the streets 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.330
 the united states for right and 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.160
 order at least as far as that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.290
 possible one day until one day 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.550
 new recruit in the form of a mutant 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.380
 the one addressed is the one special 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.120
 ability and they both actually 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.739
 quotes a normal one 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.690
 but work day should deny it 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.150
 succeeded in the largest slum block 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.690
 ever and the ways a leader 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.090
 encounter a criminal organization 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.830
 and fight against these in a kind of drugs 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.530
 let war be involved yes that is the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.510
 he turns the story of the 95 minutes 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.130
 now on 15 11 2012 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.810
 since Germany's first cinema 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.209
 release has a bit of history 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.500
 we know already during the 195 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.480
 at least what the main characters of her 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.310
 drowning one lies above the law 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.890
 shows that to the end of the film 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.239
 a little will loosen up is 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.860
 actually pretty much what you are 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.600
 if you get the trailer 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.130
 Look, this is a science fiction 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.709
 action movie on a comic series 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.360
 is no longer based and not less and 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.070
 Do you go with exactly these expectations in 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.570
 the film is pure in the well 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.790
 I honestly want to say there is 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.280
 a lot of shootings and this movie 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.620
 is a bit like gun in the stop 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.720
 There are emotional 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.930
 a lot of blood a lot more interesting 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.610
 and well done the logo or slow 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.110
 motion effects because it is due to a 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.030
 drug also in the film is about that 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.950
 people if they take the drug one 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.690
 minute 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.489
 a hundred times or and a hundredths 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.530
 speed experience everything so mega 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.209
 slow motion and that looks in 3d and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.550
 Full of rainbow colors 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.260
 experience will be very interesting 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.489
 made and not bad and that 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.690
 So are the things that you are positive 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.569
 Mention must be simply plain 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.310
 the whole visual aspect of the film and 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.650
 from the main actors you all 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.209
 not as unbelievable as recognizes in the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.739
 you can not do much in the broad world 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.360
 complain but there is not so much 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.650
 Great thing to say about that 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.600
 playful duty when they get 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.930
 has her cool lions and that's it 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.370
 also 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.050
 and the story is not that exciting 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.010
 and so thrilling but that's what the movie wants 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.660
 neither and you have to 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.800
 be aware when you go to the cinema 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.840
 watching this movie 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.220
 that means for me in points is red 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.900
 really a neat made of 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.030
 science fiction action movie with good 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.440
 effect well that I also fsk18 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.910
 because then you have 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.080
 at least a little bit looks thinking 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.760
 He also shoots me now 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.800
 the face away and the same five times 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.090
 yes that looks very funny for 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.680
 all who care that it 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.780
 done properly he gets from me 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.760
 this genre therefore six and a half out of ten 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.130
 possible points being quite honest 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.840
 have to say that the 3d is not that good 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.639
 except in these slow motion effects and 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.470
 especially the medi film 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.660
 makes you incredibly dark and you in 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.880
 some dark scenes very strong 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.440
 Image noise has what is a pity 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.330
 film by the way both times to the largest 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.310
 a part in South Africa produces in total 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.139
 in the overall ranking against all 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.520
 cases of this world and for the normal 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.080
 I would not be cinema-goer for this movie 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.120
 definitely recommend it legally 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.160
 cinema because the 3d ticket number is not quite 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.530
 is cheap and really worth it 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.210
 the investment thereby in the normal film 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.680
 do not love it now and the movie is 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.720
 then no big bring but also 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.130
 not as bad as expected did that 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.360
 almost surprised me a bit 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.389
 I talked a little 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.430
 already felt and can actually with 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.960
 the touchpad with sly stallone actually 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.130
 but I need that too 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.139
 not that he says it all in all 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.000
 score four out of ten for me 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.320
 score ok friends that was it from me 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.970
 for today with a short war 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.099
 Kinostart of board in quotation marks 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.060

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.820
 get some outtakes right away 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.979
 I somehow present omas today 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.419

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:58.390

 new video last major under may 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.690
 a opinion on brad friedel correctly 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.880
 stupid is when I then down 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.770
 my must show so already and how 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.660
