you can go in and stop her e with your w
and<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.390> Q<00:00:24.810> her<00:00:24.960> afterwards<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> lot<00:00:25.949> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and then Q her afterwards like a lot of

and then Q her afterwards like a lot of
lockup<00:00:26.420> j4<00:00:27.420> kinda<00:00:27.599> fault<00:00:27.810> Phil's<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
lockup j4 kinda fault Phil's into the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.480 
lockup j4 kinda fault Phil's into the
same<00:00:28.590> role<00:00:28.830> except<00:00:29.130> he's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.400> more

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
same role except he's a little more

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.859 
same role except he's a little more
aggressive<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.029> more<00:00:30.330> front<00:00:30.570> damage

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
aggressive a little more front damage

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.749 
aggressive a little more front damage
loaded<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.830> just<00:00:31.859> constantly<00:00:32.460> trade

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
loaded so you can just constantly trade

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
loaded so you can just constantly trade
with<00:00:32.910> her<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.420> forth<00:00:33.660> he<00:00:34.079> does<00:00:34.380> fall<00:00:34.649> off

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
with her back and forth he does fall off

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.290 
with her back and forth he does fall off
late<00:00:35.070> game<00:00:35.250> though<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.610> that's<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.850> caveat

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
late game though and that's the caveat

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.569 
late game though and that's the caveat
is<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.870> his<00:00:37.260> output<00:00:37.469> later<00:00:37.980> on<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.430> very

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
is that his output later on it's very

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.770 
is that his output later on it's very
risky<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> had<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> shut<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
risky you kind of had to shut the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
risky you kind of had to shut the
lissandra<00:00:40.170> down<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.620> did<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> kills

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
lissandra down they did that in kills

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.340 
lissandra down they did that in kills
but<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.670> didn't<00:00:41.910> keep<00:00:42.000> him<00:00:42.149> down<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.450> CS<00:00:42.840> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
but they didn't keep him down in CS so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.779 
but they didn't keep him down in CS so
ultimately<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.829> did<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.370> lissandra

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
ultimately you did see the lissandra

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.970 
ultimately you did see the lissandra
come<00:00:45.059> back<00:00:45.239> into<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> game<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> j4

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
come back into the game and then the j4

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
come back into the game and then the j4
kind<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.219> fall<00:00:47.460> off<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.180> relevant

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
kind of fall off and not be as relevant

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.350 
kind of fall off and not be as relevant
I<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.500> say<00:00:49.710> though<00:00:49.739> gam<00:00:50.520> Saddam's<00:00:51.210> who

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
I do have to say though gam Saddam's who

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.569 
I do have to say though gam Saddam's who
did<00:00:51.539> play<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.680> early<00:00:52.710> lane<00:00:53.219> he<00:00:53.430> even

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
did play well in the early lane he even

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.180 
did play well in the early lane he even
got<00:00:53.670> focused<00:00:54.149> came<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.480> 200<00:00:55.110> even<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.890> CS

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
got focused came out 200 even in CS

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.029 
got focused came out 200 even in CS
which<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.520> great<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.469> expand<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
which is great and now if we expand that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.950 
which is great and now if we expand that
to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.460> team<00:00:59.670> compositions<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.600> we<00:01:00.750> were

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
to the team compositions right we were

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
to the team compositions right we were
looking<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:01.500> two<00:01:01.710> team<00:01:01.949> compositions

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
looking at these two team compositions

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.750 
looking at these two team compositions
that<00:01:02.579> had<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.719> heavy<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.979> heavy<00:01:05.309> engage

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that had really heavy like heavy engage

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.490 
that had really heavy like heavy engage
right<00:01:06.090> both<00:01:06.299> had<00:01:06.570> mechanics<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> engage

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
right both had mechanics to engage

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.280 
right both had mechanics to engage
through<00:01:07.799> bindings<00:01:08.340> or<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> nice<00:01:09.900> tons

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
through bindings or you know a nice tons

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
through bindings or you know a nice tons
and<00:01:10.470> things<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> really

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and things like that so it was a really

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.820 
and things like that so it was a really
explosive<00:01:12.420> game<00:01:12.869> when<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> fights<00:01:13.380> actually

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
explosive game when the fights actually

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
explosive game when the fights actually
arrived<00:01:14.100> yeah<00:01:14.460> both<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.060> these<00:01:15.150> were<00:01:15.360> very

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
arrived yeah both of these were very

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
arrived yeah both of these were very
heavy<00:01:15.840> lockdown<00:01:16.439> compositions<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> team

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
heavy lockdown compositions and the team

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.120 
heavy lockdown compositions and the team
that<00:01:17.850> makes<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> first<00:01:18.450> move<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.990> usually<00:01:19.920> in

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
that makes the first move is usually in

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.820 
that makes the first move is usually in
the<00:01:20.490> best<00:01:20.909> possible<00:01:21.180> position<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.439> keep

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the best possible position if you keep

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
the best possible position if you keep
your<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.189> line<00:01:23.460> safe<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.150> engage<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
your back line safe so you engage you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.570 
your back line safe so you engage you
throw<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> down<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> priority<00:01:26.189> targets

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
throw it down on the priority targets

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
throw it down on the priority targets
there<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> teamfight<00:01:27.540> though<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> want

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
filling that role but the fact that

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.910

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
ball pivot in champion select is very

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.500 
ball pivot in champion select is very
beneficial<00:04:38.410> for<00:04:38.950> them<00:04:39.040> as<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.220> team<00:04:39.550> it<00:04:39.790> they

but they have to be able to Pratt v
practiced<00:04:42.010> at<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.310> if<00:04:42.550> you're<00:04:42.880> just

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
practiced at that if you're just

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.950 
practiced at that if you're just
throwing<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.390> in<00:04:43.600> there<00:04:43.720> you're<00:04:43.840> like<00:04:43.900> I

throwing that in there you're like I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.850 
throwing that in there you're like I
don't<00:04:43.990> want<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.260> play<00:04:44.320> it's<00:04:44.530> like<00:04:44.620> what<00:04:44.740> do<00:04:44.800> you

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
don't want to play it's like what do you

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.440 
don't want to play it's like what do you
mean<00:04:44.920> you<00:04:45.100> don't<00:04:45.130> want<00:04:45.400> to<00:04:45.460> play<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.730> we<00:04:46.030> picked

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
mean you don't want to play it we picked

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.300 
mean you don't want to play it we picked
Kenan<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.050> lissandra<00:04:47.560> you<00:04:47.950> don't<00:04:48.130> want<00:04:48.250> to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
Kenan and lissandra you don't want to

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.580 
Kenan and lissandra you don't want to
play<00:04:48.370> it<00:04:48.550> like<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:49.480> that<00:04:50.080> that's<00:04:50.290> one<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.530> the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
play it like so that that's one of the

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.380 
play it like so that that's one of the
situations<00:04:51.010> where<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.400> backfire<00:04:51.580> but<00:04:52.330> the

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
situations where it can backfire but the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.370 
situations where it can backfire but the
fact<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.600> they<00:04:52.750> were<00:04:52.810> able<00:04:52.990> to<00:04:53.050> pull<00:04:53.230> it<00:04:53.260> off

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
fact that they were able to pull it off

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.280 
fact that they were able to pull it off
was<00:04:53.620> great<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.480> he<00:04:55.480> did<00:04:55.720> touch<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.260> fact

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
was great and he did touch on the fact

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.380 
was great and he did touch on the fact
that<00:04:56.530> Kenan<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.190> team<00:04:57.730> fighting<00:04:58.000> seems<00:04:58.270> very

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
that Kenan and team fighting seems very

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.670 
that Kenan and team fighting seems very
prevalent<00:04:58.690> right<00:04:59.020> now<00:04:59.140> which<00:04:59.590> actually

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
prevalent right now which actually

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.050 
prevalent right now which actually
sparked<00:05:00.070> in<00:05:00.160> my<00:05:00.220> mind<00:05:00.430> because<00:05:00.520> currently<00:05:00.910> on

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
sparked in my mind because currently on

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.200 
sparked in my mind because currently on
the<00:05:01.120> PBE<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:02.380> inner<00:05:02.950> turrets<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.760> shield<00:05:04.030> on

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
the PBE the inner turrets the shield on

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.420 
the PBE the inner turrets the shield on
them<00:05:04.330> is<00:05:04.450> actually<00:05:04.870> reduced<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.740> middle

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
them is actually reduced and the middle

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.590 
them is actually reduced and the middle
one<00:05:06.460> doesn't<00:05:06.760> give<00:05:06.850> a<00:05:06.880> shield<00:05:07.090> right<00:05:07.240> now<00:05:07.360> so

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
one doesn't give a shield right now so

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.420 
one doesn't give a shield right now so
if<00:05:07.690> those<00:05:07.810> changes<00:05:08.170> go<00:05:08.290> through<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.770> wonder<00:05:09.370> if

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
if those changes go through I wonder if

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.860 
if those changes go through I wonder if
the<00:05:09.520> metas<00:05:09.730> just<00:05:09.850> going<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.060> completely<00:05:10.510> shift

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
the metas just going to completely shift

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.080 
the metas just going to completely shift
from<00:05:10.990> team<00:05:11.230> fighting<00:05:11.500> in<00:05:11.800> to<00:05:12.310> see<00:05:12.490> Ching<00:05:12.700> like

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
from team fighting in to see Ching like

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.640 
from team fighting in to see Ching like
because<00:05:13.660> he<00:05:13.750> said<00:05:13.900> it<00:05:13.930> wasn't<00:05:14.080> very<00:05:14.230> rewarding

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
because he said it wasn't very rewarding

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.870 
because he said it wasn't very rewarding
right<00:05:14.770> now<00:05:14.890> so<00:05:15.130> he<00:05:15.250> cannons<00:05:15.580> in<00:05:15.640> the<00:05:15.730> meta

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
right now so he cannons in the meta

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.450 
right now so he cannons in the meta
today<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.900> two<00:05:17.080> weeks<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.620> don't<00:05:18.310> know<00:05:18.370> it's

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
today in two weeks I don't know it's

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.070 
today in two weeks I don't know it's
going<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.610> happen<00:05:18.760> that's<00:05:19.120> right<00:05:19.390> well<00:05:19.600> before

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
going to happen that's right well before

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.600 
going to happen that's right well before
we<00:05:20.200> get<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.440> that<00:05:20.470> two<00:05:20.770> weeks<00:05:20.980> we<00:05:21.130> do<00:05:21.310> get<00:05:21.490> to
