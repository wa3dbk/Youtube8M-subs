hello<00:00:01.050> everybody<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.040> as<00:00:02.310> you<00:00:02.490> can<00:00:02.700> tell<00:00:02.730> from

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hello everybody and as you can tell from

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.789 
hello everybody and as you can tell from
the<00:00:03.240> title<00:00:03.480> we're<00:00:03.840> looking<00:00:04.140> at<00:00:04.259> some<00:00:04.440> solar

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
the title we're looking at some solar

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.340 
the title we're looking at some solar
power<00:00:05.100> today<00:00:05.370> so<00:00:06.180> I've<00:00:06.779> laid<00:00:06.960> out<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.109> couple

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
power today so I've laid out a couple

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.830 
power today so I've laid out a couple
solar<00:00:07.680> panels<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.220> as<00:00:08.429> you<00:00:08.790> can<00:00:08.940> tell<00:00:08.970> some

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
solar panels and as you can tell some

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.450 
solar panels and as you can tell some
power<00:00:10.019> is<00:00:10.170> coming<00:00:10.500> out<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.860> know<00:00:10.980> not<00:00:11.280> too

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
power is coming out you know not too

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.459 
power is coming out you know not too
much<00:00:11.639> but<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.179> not<00:00:12.330> bad<00:00:12.540> if<00:00:12.750> you're<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.410> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
much but it's not bad if you're going to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.200 
much but it's not bad if you're going to
want<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> lot<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.130> power<00:00:14.400> you'd<00:00:15.089> have

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
want to have a lot of power you'd have

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.439 
want to have a lot of power you'd have
to<00:00:15.269> make<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.809> big<00:00:16.320> area<00:00:16.650> solar<00:00:17.250> panels<00:00:17.490> right<00:00:17.850> or

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
to make a big area solar panels right or

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.820 
to make a big area solar panels right or
wrong<00:00:19.289> if<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.820> look<00:00:20.970> over<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.330> i<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
wrong if you look over here i have a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.279 
wrong if you look over here i have a
solar<00:00:23.220> array<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.359> it's<00:00:24.930> just<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.260> really

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
solar array so it's just a really

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.620 
solar array so it's just a really
efficient<00:00:25.980> way<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> layout<00:00:26.519> solar<00:00:26.910> panels<00:00:27.359> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
efficient way to layout solar panels so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.470 
efficient way to layout solar panels so
that<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:28.830> really<00:00:28.949> waste<00:00:29.220> space<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.789> as

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
that you don't really waste space and as

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.850 
that you don't really waste space and as
you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.289> tell<00:00:31.320> why<00:00:31.679> power<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.730> lot

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
you can tell why power is going up a lot

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.889 
you can tell why power is going up a lot
so<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.399> don't<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> technical<00:00:36.120> terms<00:00:36.630> for

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
so I don't know the technical terms for

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.830 
so I don't know the technical terms for
these<00:00:37.020> things<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.890> four<00:00:38.219> stems<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.969> us

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
these things but I have four stems of us

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.650 
these things but I have four stems of us
of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.350> solar<00:00:40.829> array<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.550> each<00:00:41.940> one<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.300> like

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
of the solar array and each one has like

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.740 
of the solar array and each one has like
four<00:00:43.020> branches<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.270> bat<00:00:45.510> box

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
four branches off and I have a bat box

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.490 
four branches off and I have a bat box
on<00:00:45.930> each<00:00:46.079> end<00:00:46.350> each<00:00:46.980> intersection<00:00:47.989> to<00:00:48.989> receive

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
on each end each intersection to receive

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
on each end each intersection to receive
power<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.190> send<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> down<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.420> other

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
power and then send it down to the other

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
power and then send it down to the other
bat<00:00:51.809> boxes<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> bat<00:00:53.309> boxes<00:00:53.760> go

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
bat boxes and all of the bat boxes go

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.330 
bat boxes and all of the bat boxes go
down<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.199> down<00:00:55.320> until<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:55.860> reach<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
down and down until they reach the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.470 
down and down until they reach the
sensor<00:00:57.239> high-voltage<00:00:57.750> em<00:00:58.640> FSU<00:01:01.730> so<00:01:02.730> what<00:01:03.359> can

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
sensor high-voltage em FSU so what can

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
sensor high-voltage em FSU so what can
you<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.559> power<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.040> ask<00:01:05.400> well

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
you do with this power you ask well

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
you do with this power you ask well
there's<00:01:06.360> lots<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.720> things<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.320> mod<00:01:07.560> so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
there's lots of things in this mod so

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.570 
there's lots of things in this mod so
what<00:01:09.090> I've<00:01:09.210> done<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.479> created<00:01:10.229> matter<00:01:10.580> through

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
what I've done is created matter through

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.359 
what I've done is created matter through
thee<00:01:12.260> that's<00:01:13.260> machine<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:16.040> have<00:01:17.040> made

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
thee that's machine and I have made

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.880 
thee that's machine and I have made
quantum<00:01:17.850> suit<00:01:18.030> our<00:01:18.270> quantum<00:01:19.020> suit<00:01:19.229> armor<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
quantum suit our quantum suit armor and

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.719 
quantum suit our quantum suit armor and
a<00:01:20.520> jet<00:01:20.729> pack<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:22.130> fueled<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.340> electric

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
a jet pack I have fueled at the electric

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
a jet pack I have fueled at the electric
jet<00:01:23.909> pack<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.450> quantum<00:01:24.720> suit<00:01:24.900> armor<00:01:25.140> does

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
jet pack so what quantum suit armor does

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.649 
jet pack so what quantum suit armor does
is<00:01:25.530> allow<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> run<00:01:26.759> around<00:01:26.880> super<00:01:27.420> fast

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
is allow you to run around super fast

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.800 
is allow you to run around super fast
like<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.380> am<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:30.150> course<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> jet

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
like I am right here and of course a jet

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.370 
like I am right here and of course a jet
pack<00:01:30.990> does<00:01:31.860> whatever<00:01:32.130> jet<00:01:32.610> pack<00:01:32.820> does<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
pack does whatever jet pack does and the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.649 
pack does whatever jet pack does and the
quantum<00:01:34.740> suit<00:01:34.920> armor<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.880> don't<00:01:36.060> get<00:01:36.210> hurt<00:01:36.390> so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
quantum suit armor you don't get hurt so

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.380 
quantum suit armor you don't get hurt so
that's<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.170> nice<00:01:37.470> when<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.799> powered<00:01:38.130> on

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
that's that's nice when it's powered on

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
that's that's nice when it's powered on
so<00:01:39.390> we're<00:01:39.600> gonna<00:01:39.799> run<00:01:40.799> around<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.400> let<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
so we're gonna run around and let the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
so we're gonna run around and let the
jetpack<00:01:42.329> come<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.020> bit<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.829> can

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
jetpack come down a little bit so we can

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.359 
jetpack come down a little bit so we can
charge<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.640> our<00:01:44.729> solar<00:01:44.970> panel<00:01:45.420> array

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
charge it up in our solar panel array

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.210 
charge it up in our solar panel array
cuz<00:01:47.369> we're<00:01:47.549> cool<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:49.740> I'm<00:01:50.070> gonna

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
cuz we're cool like that so I'm gonna

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.020 
cuz we're cool like that so I'm gonna
hop<00:01:50.490> around<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.500> hold<00:01:52.549> spacebar<00:01:53.549> down

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.610 

that<00:01:59.030> should<00:01:59.300> be<00:01:59.450> enough<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.220> let's<00:02:01.220> do<00:02:01.460> it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
that should be enough so let's do it

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.740 
that should be enough so let's do it
well<00:02:03.620> that's<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:03.979> wrong<00:02:04.160> slot<00:02:04.510> that's<00:02:05.510> what

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
well that's the wrong slot that's what

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.620 
well that's the wrong slot that's what
she<00:02:05.960> said<00:02:06.850> okay<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.000> was<00:02:08.090> terrible<00:02:08.360> I'm

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
she said okay that was terrible I'm
