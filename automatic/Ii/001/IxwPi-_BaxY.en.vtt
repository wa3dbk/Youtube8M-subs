1080p you can expect performance similar

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060 
1080p you can expect performance similar
to<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.049> console<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.859> lot<00:00:17.010> of

to that of a console and in a lot of
cases<00:00:17.400> much<00:00:17.730> better<00:00:18.029> than<00:00:18.210> what<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.420> would

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600

find<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> console<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.529> let's<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.859> right

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
threading but this cpu for 110 dollars
still<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.660> perform<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.200> well<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.590> even

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
still can perform really well at even

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.530 
still can perform really well at even
the<00:00:35.010> highest<00:00:35.160> end<00:00:35.579> games<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.969> lot<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.329> people

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the highest end games a lot of people

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.660 
the highest end games a lot of people
think<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.930> core<00:00:37.140> i3<00:00:37.500> can't<00:00:37.770> run<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.399> witcher

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
think the core i3 can't run the witcher

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
think the core i3 can't run the witcher
3<00:00:38.700> wild<00:00:38.940> hunt<00:00:39.239> but<00:00:39.570> if<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> decent

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
3 wild hunt but if you have a decent

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.900 
3 wild hunt but if you have a decent
video<00:00:40.620> card<00:00:40.980> which<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.280> do<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.579> build<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
video card which we do in this build you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.160 
video card which we do in this build you
could<00:00:42.030> actually<00:00:42.149> play<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> witcher<00:00:42.780> 3<00:00:42.930> at

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
could actually play the witcher 3 at

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
could actually play the witcher 3 at
1080p<00:00:43.469> at<00:00:43.770> around<00:00:43.920> medium<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.430> high<00:00:44.550> settings

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
1080p at around medium to high settings

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
1080p at around medium to high settings
obviously<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> i3<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.230> limiting<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.070> some<00:00:47.280> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
obviously the i3 is limiting in some of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.770 
obviously the i3 is limiting in some of
the<00:00:47.520> higher-end<00:00:47.730> games<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.600> five

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the higher-end games but in a five

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.060 
the higher-end games but in a five
hundred<00:00:48.930> dollar<00:00:49.200> budget<00:00:49.649> you're<00:00:49.920> not

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
hundred dollar budget you're not

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
hundred dollar budget you're not
expecting<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> run<00:00:50.760> every<00:00:51.059> game<00:00:51.210> maxed<00:00:51.600> out

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
expecting to run every game maxed out

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.080 
expecting to run every game maxed out
like<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.020> said<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.559> i3<00:00:52.980> 4160<00:00:53.610> is<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.760> decent

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
like I said so the i3 4160 is a decent

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.330 
like I said so the i3 4160 is a decent
gaming<00:00:54.480> option<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> say<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> i3<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
gaming option now I say the i3 is a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
gaming option now I say the i3 is a
decent<00:00:56.520> gaming<00:00:56.820> option<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.660> yes<00:00:57.870> that's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
decent gaming option because yes that's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
decent gaming option because yes that's
what<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> i3<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.680> primarily<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.940> would<00:01:00.149> not

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
what the i3 is primarily for I would not

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
what the i3 is primarily for I would not
get<00:01:00.570> an<00:01:00.719> IV<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> intention<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> video

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
get an IV with the intention of video

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.100 
get an IV with the intention of video
editing<00:01:02.280> live<00:01:02.760> streaming<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.420> rendering<00:01:03.840> if

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
editing live streaming or rendering if

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.570 
editing live streaming or rendering if
you're<00:01:04.320> looking<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.040> would<00:01:05.100> say<00:01:05.400> get

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you're looking for that I would say get

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.910 
you're looking for that I would say get
a<00:01:05.640> build<00:01:05.970> centered<00:01:06.330> around<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.630> FX<00:01:07.049> 6300<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
a build centered around the FX 6300 the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.890 
a build centered around the FX 6300 the
idea<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.310> more<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> gaming<00:01:09.030> centric<00:01:09.450> cpu

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
idea is more of a gaming centric cpu

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359 
idea is more of a gaming centric cpu
that<00:01:10.049> provides<00:01:10.409> more<00:01:10.680> per<00:01:10.890> core<00:01:11.159> performance

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that provides more per core performance

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.219 
that provides more per core performance
so<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> great<00:01:12.689> option<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so i think this was a great option in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.630 
so i think this was a great option in
the<00:01:13.320> gaming<00:01:13.560> bill<00:01:13.799> for<00:01:14.010> only<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.250> hundred<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the gaming bill for only a hundred and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
the gaming bill for only a hundred and
ten<00:01:14.820> dollars<00:01:15.240> for<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> motherboard<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
ten dollars for the motherboard I with

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.370 
ten dollars for the motherboard I with
the<00:01:16.259> asrock<00:01:16.680> age<00:01:16.830> 97<00:01:17.280> /<00:01:17.549> 04<00:01:17.850> ATX<00:01:18.360> LGA<00:01:18.810> 1150

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
this around 6 12 months ago would have

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.880 
this around 6 12 months ago would have
been<00:01:54.750> much<00:01:54.930> more<00:01:54.990> than<00:01:55.380> forty<00:01:55.680> four<00:01:55.860> dollars

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
been much more than forty four dollars

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.709 
been much more than forty four dollars
so<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.369> great<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.670> see<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.060> can<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.479> 8

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
so it's great to see that you can get 8

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.270 
so it's great to see that you can get 8

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
you can't add more later but that's not

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
you can't add more later but that's not
something<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.730> should<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:27.030> now<00:02:27.270> for<00:02:27.720> now<00:02:27.840> get
