maybe twice in the summer months now
what<00:01:11.990> this<00:01:12.139> will<00:01:12.350> accomplish<00:01:12.679> is<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.609> will

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
what this will accomplish is it will

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.849 
what this will accomplish is it will
encourage<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.420> roots<00:01:14.719> to<00:01:14.869> actually<00:01:15.409> reach

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
encourage the roots to actually reach

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.099 
encourage the roots to actually reach
down<00:01:16.369> into<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.909> moist<00:01:17.119> soil<00:01:17.479> for<00:01:17.779> the<00:01:17.869> water

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:18.109 
down into the moist soil for the water

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:19.809 
down into the moist soil for the water
so<00:01:18.439> that's<00:01:18.829> going<00:01:19.069> to<00:01:19.130> give<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.429> a<00:01:19.459> stronger

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
so that's going to give you a stronger

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:22.239 
so that's going to give you a stronger
root<00:01:20.119> system<00:01:20.600> now<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.439> rule<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.950> thumb<00:01:22.189> for

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
root system now the rule of thumb for

root system now the rule of thumb for
established<00:01:23.119> plan<00:01:23.389> is<00:01:23.749> about<00:01:24.079> one<00:01:24.529> inch<00:01:24.920> of

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
established plan is about one inch of

established plan is about one inch of
water<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.579> week<00:01:25.929> well<00:01:26.929> how<00:01:27.079> do<00:01:27.139> you<00:01:27.259> know<00:01:27.350> how

water a week well how do you know how

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.580 
water a week well how do you know how
much<00:01:27.709> one<00:01:28.130> inch<00:01:28.369> is<00:01:28.609> the<00:01:29.539> easiest<00:01:29.959> way<00:01:30.259> is<00:01:30.560> to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
much one inch is the easiest way is to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.139 
much one inch is the easiest way is to
just<00:01:30.770> go<00:01:31.039> out<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:31.219> get<00:01:31.429> yourself<00:01:31.579> a<00:01:31.909> rain
