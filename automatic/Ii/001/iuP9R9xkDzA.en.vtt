00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.150
 and I do not bring a makeup for the day 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.150
 guy can be a fix with me 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.730
 because I have to make up to leave 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.160
 then so I invite you to stay and 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.150
 apply a test of my favorite test 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.930
 as you already know all the encrym 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.920
 and explained in the bread I'm going to use the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.700
 palette rodeo come from zoÃ© van and I'm going to 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.510
 use these tones more clearly in 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.610
 beige the camel and the brown quoted I'll 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
 use the time because I promised you that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.879
 I was going to do a makeup with her and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.500
 as a state linked to the issue of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
 eyes and everything but I could not do 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.109
 make-up but now I'm going to show you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 I'm going to catch this camel shadow with a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.969
 flat brush 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.809
 or dabs to the fixed stay 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.809
 shadow 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.800
 next I'm going to catch the shadow more 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 brown oscurito with the same brush or 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.610
 cleaned a little on paper 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.210
 and what I'm going to do is to touch 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.210
 here in the middle 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.280
 This shadow has a shine 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.310
 although really then on the eyelid it 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.540
 little remains 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.540
 with this shadow 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.190
 I will blur in the top part 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.909
 and I step a little bit where we put the 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.549
 dark brown 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.050
 to integrate it completely with the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.580
 You see us, we take the product 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.520
 and we give a little 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.180
 above in the part where we have not 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.180
 the makeup 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.790
 and now let's blur it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.790
 and now with a gel eyeliner and a 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.790
 brush 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.120
 and we're going to use the mask 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.650
 tabs 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.650
 wow to see 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.030
 and once we have the ready eyes 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.600
 let's face makeup 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.600
 do not 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.030
 Hello 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.030
 I have been 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.860
 the dance 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.060
 do not 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.060
 where is the 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.199
 I want 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.820
 and never 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.800
 who had been king 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.340
 the air 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.340
 do not 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.450
 look 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.020
 and good as you see here is the result 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.760
 I love lately I'm adopting 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.430
 very much with this type of makeup 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.130
 I think it helps me to frame the 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.880
 eye with a shadows eyeliner 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.790
 dark but not much loved or anything and 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.370
 Well, nothing more natural in the 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.080
 lips because it's true that I'm good 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.540
 Now I have to give her a course and so on and 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.590
 no it's not plan it 's a bit of super iu 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.080
 made up 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.050
 but hey I like I like the result 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.790
