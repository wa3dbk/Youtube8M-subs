00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
at 1280 by 800 and soon as I connected

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.380 
at 1280 by 800 and soon as I connected
this<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> first<00:01:44.430> time<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.970> went<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> this

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
this for the first time it went to this

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.170 
this for the first time it went to this
resolution<00:01:46.579> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.930> 2560<00:01:48.930> by<00:01:49.049> 1440<00:01:50.030> which<00:01:51.030> I

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
resolution which is 2560 by 1440 which I

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330 
resolution which is 2560 by 1440 which I
believe<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.810> close<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> its<00:01:52.950> highest

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
believe it's close to its highest

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.810 
believe it's close to its highest
resolution<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:54.509> not<00:01:55.189> then<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.729> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
resolution if not then it's just a

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.929 
resolution if not then it's just a
little<00:01:57.030> bit<00:01:57.240> off<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:58.640> another<00:01:59.640> thing<00:01:59.909> you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
little bit off and another thing you

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.209 
little bit off and another thing you
guys<00:02:00.180> might<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.509> wondering<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:01.320> Mac<00:02:01.500> users<00:02:01.530> if

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
