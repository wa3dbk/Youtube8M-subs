00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.910
letâ€™s study the charge distribution on metal
bodies in contact , let us understand this

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.090
with the example of two metal spheres , say
we are given with 2 metal spheres one is of

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:25.210
radius r1 and , other is of say smaller radius
r2 , and say the 2 are placed far apart , and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.850
the initial charges on these are, q1 and q2.
now if we connect these 2 spheres with the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.879
help of a wire , and along with a switch , then
on closing the switch , some charge flow will

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.710
take place , or exchange of charges will take
place between the 2 spheres , if initially

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.109
they were at different potentials, and , in
earlier sections we have studied that when

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.489
2 bodies at different potentials are connected
.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.589
charge will always flow from high potential
end to the low potential end , now initially

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:06.420
if these 2 are at equal potential no charge
flow will take place , but if they were at

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.160
different potential some charge flow will
take place , till the 2 will be at same potential

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.970
, we can also write it down as a concept.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:34.030
that is , after connection . of, 2, charged,
metal bodies , charge exchange takes place

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:52.830
, till . both will be at, same potential , this
is because , when 2 bodies are at different

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.810
potentials , the system potential energy will
be more and when the 2 bodies , will be at

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.240
same potential, we can say that , their final
potential energy will be , equal .

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.479
so in this situation say after connection
the final charges on the spheres will be q1

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:17.940
final , and q2 final , then in this situation
we can say , the potential of spheres, k q1

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.530
final by r1 must be equal to , k-q2 final
by r2 . here we can say , if sigma 1 and sigma

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:40.350
2 , be the final . surface density of charge
or the surface charge densities .

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:49.330
on spheres . this implies we can write , q1
final will be sigma 1 multiplied by the area

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.310
4 pie r1 square , and q2 final can be written
as sigma 2 multiplied by , 4 pie r2 square

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.850
, substituting the values of charges over
here we can see , here k cancels out , substituting

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:12.350
the charges it will be sigma 1 into 4 pie
r1 square by r1 , Is equal to sigma 2 into

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.930
4 pie r2 square by , r2 , here 4 pie cancels
out , r1 and r2 also cancels out .

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.980
here we are getting sigma 1 r1 is equal to
sigma 2- r2 , it means here we can see that

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.470
the product of surface charge density and
the radius remains, constant.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.690
or we can write the surface charge density
is inversely proportional to the, radius of

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:47.730
curvature, of the surface which are at same
potential , so always remember that the surface

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.890
charge density on the metal surface , will
always be inversely proportional to their

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.430
radius of curvature if these are at, same
potential .

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:05.349
this result will be used ,always whenever
there are same potential surfaces, for same

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:12.440
potential surfaces this will always hold,
this is an important concept for the metal

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.650
bodies which are at same potential , always
remember this .
