00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.490 
the healing and healer and Archer idea
way<00:00:56.910> off<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> corner<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:57.989> frankly

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
way off in the corner but frankly

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
way off in the corner but frankly
there's<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.920> enough<00:00:58.980> true<00:00:59.430> space<00:00:59.730> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
there's just not enough true space to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.380 
there's just not enough true space to
both<00:01:00.210> three-star<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.289> lore<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.579> there's<00:01:03.270> not

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
both three-star and lore or there's not

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
both three-star and lore or there's not
enough<00:01:03.449> time<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> lure<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> kill<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.040> anyway

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
enough time to lure and kill so anyway

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.620 
enough time to lure and kill so anyway
that's<00:01:05.640> why<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> clan<00:01:06.030> castle<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.479> not

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
that's why the clan castle is not

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
that's why the clan castle is not
centralized<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.439> favor<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> archer<00:01:08.490> Queen

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

a<00:01:44.310> little<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.939> keep<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.600> away<00:01:45.750> from

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
a little bit and keep them away from

a little bit and keep them away from
that<00:01:46.340> Inferno<00:01:47.340> tower<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.630> pretty<00:01:48.840> good

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that Inferno tower so it's a pretty good

that Inferno tower so it's a pretty good
anti<00:01:49.380> 3<00:01:49.649> design<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.280> also<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.909> good

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
anti 3 design and it's also pretty good

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of inexperienced attackers will go to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.959 
of inexperienced attackers will go to

through all the high hit point units all

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.509 
through all the high hit point units all
the<00:02:48.630> storages<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.769> center<00:02:50.160> along

attacking<00:03:06.090> DPS<00:03:06.510> seems<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:07.049> get<00:03:07.170> bogged<00:03:07.470> down

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
attacking DPS seems to get bogged down

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.009 
attacking DPS seems to get bogged down
if<00:03:08.099> they<00:03:08.519> don't<00:03:08.549> attack<00:03:09.030> this<00:03:09.239> base<00:03:09.510> into<00:03:09.780> the

that is the AI it's just a wacky AI to
this<00:03:23.310> base<00:03:23.579> right<00:03:23.820> because<00:03:24.420> your<00:03:24.930> units<00:03:25.290> are

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
this base right because your units are

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
gonna go all over the place oftentimes

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.819

use these designs on your on your war
attacks<00:03:56.450> primarily<00:03:57.450> because<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.350> can<00:03:58.560> get

those those four air defenses pretty

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.330 
those those four air defenses pretty
easily<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.870> making<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:07.769> vulnerable<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:08.310> a

three-star bit now this base here this

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.910 
three-star bit now this base here this
is<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.180> very<00:04:12.480> nice<00:04:12.690> design<00:04:12.930> we<00:04:13.350> would<00:04:13.500> recently

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
is a very nice design we would recently

is a very nice design we would recently

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
went up against I'm going to go ahead

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.610 
went up against I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:15.150> show<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.450> defensive<00:04:15.989> replay<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.530> it

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
and show you a defensive replay of it

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
and show you a defensive replay of it
and<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.919> is<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.190> type<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.400> base<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.789> would<00:04:17.940> use

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
and this is the type of base I would use

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.180 
and this is the type of base I would use
in<00:04:18.239> clan<00:04:18.510> wars<00:04:18.810> if<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.470> do<00:04:19.680> want<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.950> go<00:04:20.039> ahead

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
in clan wars if you do want to go ahead

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.250 
in clan wars if you do want to go ahead
and<00:04:20.579> implement<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.090> design<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.870> your<00:04:21.959> clan

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
and implement this design to your clan

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.560 
and implement this design to your clan
war<00:04:22.440> base<00:04:22.650> now<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.340> reason<00:04:24.000> being<00:04:24.210> is<00:04:24.419> because

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
war base now the reason being is because

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.760 
war base now the reason being is because
you<00:04:24.750> have<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> smaller

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
you have a smaller

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.770 
you have a smaller
whore<00:04:25.979> right<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:27.090> still<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.509> lot<00:04:27.750> of

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
whore right you still have a lot of

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.140 
whore right you still have a lot of
firepower<00:04:28.080> there<00:04:28.650> but<00:04:29.160> now<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:29.430> have<00:04:29.849> on<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
firepower there but now you have on the

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.950 
firepower there but now you have on the
outside<00:04:30.180> that's<00:04:31.139> just<00:04:31.319> totally<00:04:32.449> under<00:04:33.449> thwe

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
outside that's just totally under thwe

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.110 
outside that's just totally under thwe
Keable<00:04:34.259> if<00:04:34.440> you<00:04:34.560> will<00:04:34.740> right<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.580> it's<00:04:35.879> very

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
Keable if you will right so it's very

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.600 
Keable if you will right so it's very
difficult<00:04:36.659> to<00:04:36.900> take<00:04:37.080> out<00:04:37.289> all<00:04:37.710> those<00:04:37.949> walls<00:04:38.370> so

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
difficult to take out all those walls so

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.830 
difficult to take out all those walls so
you<00:04:38.639> really<00:04:38.940> have<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.150> bring<00:04:39.240> a<00:04:39.389> lot<00:04:39.539> of<00:04:39.659> wall

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
you really have to bring a lot of wall

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.899 
you really have to bring a lot of wall
breakers<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.470> you<00:04:40.889> really<00:04:41.520> have<00:04:41.729> to

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
breakers and you really have to

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.300 
breakers and you really have to
understand<00:04:42.539> funneling<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.379> as<00:04:43.979> you<00:04:44.159> guys

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
understand funneling and as you guys

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.890 
understand funneling and as you guys
know<00:04:44.370> just<00:04:44.909> a<00:04:44.970> lot<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.180> attackers<00:04:45.539> don't

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
know just a lot of attackers don't

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.689 
know just a lot of attackers don't
understand<00:04:46.349> funneling<00:04:46.770> that<00:04:46.889> well<00:04:47.159> and<00:04:47.430> even

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
understand funneling that well and even

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.520 
understand funneling that well and even
if<00:04:47.879> you<00:04:47.970> do<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.479> many<00:04:48.569> things<00:04:48.840> can<00:04:49.020> go<00:04:49.080> wrong<00:04:49.229> in

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
if you do so many things can go wrong in

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.499 
if you do so many things can go wrong in
this<00:04:49.770> space<00:04:50.129> you<00:04:50.370> can<00:04:50.819> see<00:04:50.970> there's<00:04:51.150> a<00:04:51.240> hidden

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:51.509 
this space you can see there's a hidden

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.119 
this space you can see there's a hidden
Tesla<00:04:51.960> right<00:04:52.259> over<00:04:52.470> there<00:04:52.590> in<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.770> eastern

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
Tesla right over there in the eastern
