00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.460
 There are 2,000 ways to make wine 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.920
 so there is not a single Beaujolais Nouveau, 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:07.980
 there are new Beaujolais! 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.780
 I would say there are so many Beaujolais Nouveaux 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.420
 that there are men who make them 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.120
 since we only have one grape variety 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.980
 the gamay, which serves to make 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.680
 and to produce these wines 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.660
 but which are different depending on the winemaker 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.820
 who will work, the work he will bring to his vineyard 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.320
 and the technique he will use to vinify these wines. 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.340
 New Beaujolais 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.180
 are a part of the production 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.960
 Beaujolais wines that are released for consumption 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.700
 in premiere so in preview, 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 there is a derogation to market them 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.540
 earlier than the other appellations, 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.380
 it's our specificity to us, to be able to do 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.320
 young wines that come to somehow give 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.680
 a ray of sunshine in the fall. 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.060
 The know-how of the winemakers, I think it's patience, 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.260
 you have to wait for a very good maturity 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.700
 so the grapes must be ripe 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.280
 for there to be an alcohol / acidity balance. 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.160
 The whole vineyard can not be mechanized 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.920
 so we have the main works of the vineyard 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.580
 that can be done manually 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 and mainly the grape harvest too. 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.700
 The territory of Beaujolais is a territory 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.680
 where we work a lot by hand, 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.600
 there is a lot of manual work in the vineyard, 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.220
 when it's time to shear the vines, 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.280
 there are many things that are actually done 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 manually all year. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.200
 The hand of man is present permanently. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 Gamay is a very special grape, 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.340
 so already it's a red grape with white juice 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 so that is very little planted worldwide. 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.340
 In France, the main production area 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.960
 of this grape variety 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.560
 so it's the Beaujolais region. 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.500
 Gamay is really a variety that requires care, 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.140
 which requires delicacy. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.040
 Sometimes my husband says it's like women 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.060
 and I quite agree with him eventually. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.820
 We need to be treated, 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.680
 pampered to give a quality wine. 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.280
 The Beaujolais Nouveau is really on this weft 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.840
 fruit, lightness. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.040
 It's a variety that does not have a lot of tannin, 

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:25.095
 which has little tannin so that really allows 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.920
 to have very round wines. 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.633
 These are wines that are fond, 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.620
 who are on the fruit with a grape variety 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.120
 who gives us all that we can expect from a wine, 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.840
 easy to share, easy to drink. 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.560
 For the third Thursday of November, 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 the release of Beaujolais Nouveau 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.220
 it's really something very very nice, 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.900
 very friendly, I look forward to it 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.240
 every year because it's the first returns 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.360
 that we have of our work that we did for 1 year. 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.300
 It's rather nice to see the world 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.080
 who comes to see us to taste these new Beaujolais 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.340
 because it's historic, it's party time. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.420
 We put forward a know-how, 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.183
 we highlight men 

00:03:07.183 --> 00:03:09.323
 and today we highlight quality wines. 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.840
 You have to be friendly to be a winemaker 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.340
 in Beaujolais. 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.800
 Friendliness, sharing 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.440
 it's values ​​that make the region. 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.440
 It is first of all a spirit of discovery, 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.980
 a spirit of work. 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.840
 The first adjective that comes to me 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.180
 it is a wine of sharing and a wine of conviviality. 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.660
 The first wine of the year, 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.060
 the buddy's wine, 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.900
 the wine of pleasure, 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.580
 it's really a beautiful land of welcome 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.320
 with a very beautiful heritage. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.720
 We have something specific, 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.720
 this is recognized worldwide. 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.400
 And a spirit of putting forward a know-how 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.420
 and a friendliness that is truly the image of the region. 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.160
 Wines that are made by men, 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.080
 who are craftsmen 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.900
 and who are even artists in my opinion.
