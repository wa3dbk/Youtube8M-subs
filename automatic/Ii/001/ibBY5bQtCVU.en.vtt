00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
get a better week worth of temperatures

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.700 
get a better week worth of temperatures
around<00:00:20.279> zero<00:00:20.760> Celsius<00:00:21.449> maybe<00:00:22.380> you've<00:00:22.650> just

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
around zero Celsius maybe you've just

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.519 
around zero Celsius maybe you've just
below<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.689> then<00:00:24.689> look<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.050> days<00:00:25.260> like

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
below that and then look at days like

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.320 
below that and then look at days like
today<00:00:25.560> where<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.250> nineteen<00:00:26.640> twenty<00:00:26.970> degrees

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
today where it's nineteen twenty degrees

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
today where it's nineteen twenty degrees
so<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.859> really<00:00:29.160> playing<00:00:29.519> chaos<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
so it's really playing chaos on the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.010 
so it's really playing chaos on the
plants<00:00:31.550> anyway<00:00:32.550> um<00:00:32.850> let's<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.630> let's<00:00:33.809> start

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
plants anyway um let's see let's start

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.799 
plants anyway um let's see let's start
over<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.440> side<00:00:35.390> these<00:00:36.390> are<00:00:36.510> some<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
over on this side these are some of the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.319 
over on this side these are some of the
little<00:00:37.020> peppers<00:00:37.760> they're<00:00:38.760> growing<00:00:39.149> pretty

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
little peppers they're growing pretty

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.440 
little peppers they're growing pretty
slow<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.989> most<00:00:40.379> peppers<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:41.149> but<00:00:42.149> they're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
slow like most peppers do but they're

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
slow like most peppers do but they're
looking<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:42.840> nice<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.890> are<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> larger

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
looking pretty nice these are the larger

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.569 
looking pretty nice these are the larger
bell<00:00:44.760> peppers<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> onions<00:00:47.489> are

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
bell peppers and then the onions are

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.790 
bell peppers and then the onions are
doing<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:48.030> well<00:00:48.239> I'm<00:00:49.079> hoping<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> start

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
doing really well I'm hoping to start

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
doing really well I'm hoping to start
hardening<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> transplanting

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
hardening them off and transplanting

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.689 
hardening them off and transplanting
them<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> main<00:00:52.350> garden<00:00:52.649> soon<00:00:52.920> it's

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
them out in the main garden soon it's

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580 
them out in the main garden soon it's
just<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.390> our<00:00:54.539> weather<00:00:54.690> being<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.199> close<00:00:55.559> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
just with our weather being so close to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.880 
just with our weather being so close to
zero<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.420> day<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> didn't<00:00:58.260> want<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> be

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

to<00:01:14.189> come<00:01:14.340> up<00:01:14.460> they<00:01:15.330> were<00:01:15.509> slow<00:01:15.750> germinating

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to come up they were slow germinating

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
to come up they were slow germinating
but<00:01:16.439> they're<00:01:16.560> doing<00:01:16.710> pretty<00:01:16.860> good<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.150> and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150

the broccoli looks really nice and the
germination<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:21.869> this<00:01:22.170> was<00:01:22.380> really<00:01:22.710> really

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
germination on this was really really

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760 
germination on this was really really
spotty<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:24.780> gonna<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
spotty so I'm gonna have to go back and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
spotty so I'm gonna have to go back and
fill<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> some<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.330> bear<00:01:27.540> cells<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.110> there

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.780 
fill in some of the bear cells in there
but<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.890> did<00:01:29.070> come<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.460> doing<00:01:29.670> really

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
but what did come up is doing really

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.010

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
from the little toilet paper tubes that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.490 
from the little toilet paper tubes that
I<00:01:38.460> started<00:01:38.820> them<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.960> ones<00:01:40.140> at<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.290> back

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I started them in the ones at the back

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950 
are a little bit bigger um one thing i
noticed<00:01:44.070> germination<00:01:44.640> has<00:01:44.880> been<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.420> all

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
noticed germination has been really all

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.389 
noticed germination has been really all
over<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> place<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.680> year<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.369> know

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
over the place this year you know

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.310 
over the place this year you know
instead<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.850> having<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.329> flat<00:01:48.600> germinating<00:01:49.200> at

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
instead of having a flat germinating at

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
instead of having a flat germinating at
the<00:01:49.409> same<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:49.909> i'm<00:01:50.909> finding<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.720> maybe

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
they're starting right now so I was

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.009 
they're starting right now so I was
thinking<00:03:49.430> about<00:03:49.640> adding<00:03:50.120> some<00:03:50.480> extra<00:03:50.569> seeds

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
thinking about adding some extra seeds

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.509 
thinking about adding some extra seeds
to<00:03:51.230> some<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> empty<00:03:51.739> cells<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.310> might

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
to some of the empty cells but I might

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.080 
to some of the empty cells but I might
wait<00:03:52.670> a<00:03:52.700> little<00:03:52.910> while<00:03:53.000> yet<00:03:54.730> these<00:03:55.730> are<00:03:55.940> more

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
wait a little while yet these are more

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.460 
wait a little while yet these are more
