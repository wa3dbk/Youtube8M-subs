00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
not getting a lot of money and then your

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.300 
not getting a lot of money and then your
third<00:01:15.990> vehicle<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> take<00:01:17.130> out

third vehicle you're going to take out
is<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.390> vehicle<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.990> going

to be replaced by the duplicated vehicle
so<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:23.250> case<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.850> vehicle<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.960> little

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
