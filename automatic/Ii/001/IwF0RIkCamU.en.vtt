consoles again keeping the Xbox in March

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.589 
consoles again keeping the Xbox in March
and<00:00:10.710> actually<00:00:11.429> as<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.580> turns<00:00:11.820> out<00:00:11.969> all<00:00:12.389> three

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
and actually as it turns out all three

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.870 
and actually as it turns out all three
versions<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:13.110> pretty<00:00:13.500> similar<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.490> Xbox

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
versions are pretty similar the Xbox

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.550 
versions are pretty similar the Xbox
version<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> gamecube<00:00:15.780> version<00:00:15.809> are

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
version and the gamecube version are

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.140 
version and the gamecube version are
slightly<00:00:16.859> cleaned<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.369> graphically<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
slightly cleaned up graphically but the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.269 
slightly cleaned up graphically but the
ps2<00:00:18.510> version<00:00:18.650> you<00:00:19.650> could<00:00:19.800> say<00:00:19.890> probably<00:00:20.160> has

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
ps2 version you could say probably has

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
ps2 version you could say probably has
the<00:00:20.369> best<00:00:20.490> control<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.630> control<00:00:21.900> seemed

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the best control the control seemed

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.410 
the best control the control seemed
optimized<00:00:22.560> for<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> DualShock<00:00:23.220> controller

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
optimized for the DualShock controller

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.609 
optimized for the DualShock controller
if<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> own<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.840> three<00:00:24.990> platforms<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.590> you

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
if you own all three platforms and you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.720 
if you own all three platforms and you
were<00:00:25.740> wondering<00:00:25.980> which<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> should<00:00:26.400> get

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
were wondering which one you should get

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.250 
were wondering which one you should get
you<00:00:27.210> really<00:00:27.420> can't<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.720> wrong<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.990> any<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you really can't go wrong with any of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.089 
you really can't go wrong with any of
them<00:00:28.349> because<00:00:28.529> they're<00:00:28.830> they're<00:00:29.070> pretty

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
them because they're they're pretty

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.160 
them because they're they're pretty
similar<00:00:29.519> so<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.269> sims<00:00:30.480> originally<00:00:30.869> appeared

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
similar so the sims originally appeared

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.870 
similar so the sims originally appeared
on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> PC<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.740> 2000<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.369> since<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.730> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
on the PC in 2000 and since then it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
on the PC in 2000 and since then it's
become<00:00:33.149> reportedly<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.290> best-selling<00:00:34.649> PC

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
become reportedly the best-selling PC

become reportedly the best-selling PC
game<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.309> history<00:00:35.899> that's<00:00:36.899> probably<00:00:37.260> because

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
game in history that's probably because

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.639 
game in history that's probably because
of<00:00:37.649> its<00:00:37.980> combination<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:39.200> really<00:00:40.200> open-ended

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
of its combination of really open-ended

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.860 
of its combination of really open-ended
gameplay<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.250> lets<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> control<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.090> family

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
gameplay that lets you control a family

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
gameplay that lets you control a family
of<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.980> computer-controlled<00:00:44.550> people

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
of little computer-controlled people

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
of little computer-controlled people
called<00:00:45.510> Sims<00:00:45.920> basically<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.280> build<00:00:47.520> them

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
called Sims basically you can build them

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.720 
called Sims basically you can build them
up<00:00:48.350> choose<00:00:49.350> their<00:00:49.530> appearance<00:00:49.890> choose<00:00:50.579> their

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
up choose their appearance choose their

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.850 
up choose their appearance choose their
personality<00:00:51.329> build<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.469> house<00:00:52.620> for

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
personality build up a little house for

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.410 
personality build up a little house for
them<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:53.850> basically<00:00:53.969> let<00:00:54.270> them

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
them and then just basically let them

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.959 
them and then just basically let them
run<00:00:54.539> around<00:00:54.739> see<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.890> happens<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.820> should

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
run around see what happens what should

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.220 
run around see what happens what should
they<00:00:57.059> do<00:00:57.120> depending<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.570> their<00:00:57.719> personality

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
they do depending on their personality

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
they do depending on their personality
so<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> sims<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.489> consoles<00:00:59.879> does<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so if the sims for consoles does is it

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
so if the sims for consoles does is it
takes<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> sims<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.230> PC<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> puts<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
takes the sims for PC and it puts it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.880 
takes the sims for PC and it puts it
kind<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.670> new<00:01:03.120> graphical<00:01:03.660> wrapper<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
kind of in a new graphical wrapper the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
kind of in a new graphical wrapper the
game<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.339> fully<00:01:05.640> 3d<00:01:05.970> including<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
environments and says the camera so it's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609

versions actually actually disabled the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.050 
versions actually actually disabled the
autonomy<00:03:14.390> or<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.440> free<00:03:15.680> will<00:03:15.860> option<00:03:16.310> which

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
autonomy or the free will option which

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.490 
autonomy or the free will option which

but<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.640> will<00:03:19.760> also<00:03:20.030> mean<00:03:20.209> that<00:03:20.330> they<00:03:20.480> may

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
but that will also mean that they may

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.940 
but that will also mean that they may
not<00:03:20.959> take<00:03:21.470> care<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.709> their<00:03:21.799> own<00:03:21.920> needs

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
not take care of their own needs

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.100 
not take care of their own needs
otherwise<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.209> sims<00:03:23.420> for<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:23.630> consoles<00:03:23.959> is

otherwise the sims for the consoles is

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.289 
otherwise the sims for the consoles is
pretty<00:03:24.590> similar<00:03:24.799> to<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.130> PC<00:03:25.340> game<00:03:25.519> which<00:03:26.150> is

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
pretty similar to the PC game which is

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.300 
pretty similar to the PC game which is
by<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.570> large<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.810> good<00:03:26.959> thing<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.830> sims<00:03:28.040> is

by and large a good thing the sims is

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.640 
by and large a good thing the sims is
