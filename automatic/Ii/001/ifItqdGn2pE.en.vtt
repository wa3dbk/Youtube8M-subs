was a 90 last year so he gets a plus to
the<00:03:07.360> only<00:03:07.570> reason<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:07.990> think<00:03:08.320> this<00:03:08.530> spot<00:03:09.100> right

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
the only reason I think this spot right

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160 
the only reason I think this spot right
here<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.640> be<00:03:09.700> debated<00:03:10.240> was<00:03:10.450> because<00:03:10.840> Henrik

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
here could be debated was because Henrik

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.350 
here could be debated was because Henrik
Zetterberg<00:03:11.200> only<00:03:11.890> played<00:03:12.160> half<00:03:12.610> this<00:03:13.180> season

Zetterberg only played half this season

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.790 
Zetterberg only played half this season
last<00:03:13.720> year<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.930> think<00:03:14.290> he<00:03:14.350> only<00:03:14.500> played<00:03:14.740> about

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
last year I think he only played about

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.850 
last year I think he only played about
45<00:03:15.340> games<00:03:15.640> grandi<00:03:16.420> he<00:03:16.570> was<00:03:16.810> I<00:03:16.840> believe<00:03:17.080> above<00:03:17.710> a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
45 games grandi he was I believe above a

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.940 
45 games grandi he was I believe above a
point<00:03:18.160> above<00:03:19.150> point-per-game<00:03:19.690> player<00:03:20.200> even

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
point above point-per-game player even

point above point-per-game player even
in<00:03:21.459> those<00:03:21.640> 45<00:03:22.150> games<00:03:22.390> they<00:03:22.570> did<00:03:22.810> play<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.380> for

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
in those 45 games they did play and for

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.410 
in those 45 games they did play and for
the<00:03:23.950> playoffs<00:03:24.130> didn't<00:03:24.670> really<00:03:24.880> couldn't

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
the playoffs didn't really couldn't

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.970 
the playoffs didn't really couldn't
really<00:03:25.540> do<00:03:25.780> much<00:03:25.810> against<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> Boston<00:03:26.739> Bruins

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
really do much against the Boston Bruins

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.110 
really do much against the Boston Bruins
but<00:03:27.750> still<00:03:28.750> this<00:03:28.930> one<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.500> don't<00:03:29.950> know<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.610> could

but still this one I don't know it could

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.510 
but still this one I don't know it could
go<00:03:31.450> either<00:03:31.480> way<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:32.380> Detroit<00:03:32.770> pencil<00:03:33.190> why

Washington Capitals Alexander Ovechkin
sure<00:03:53.230> Ovechkin<00:03:53.800> might<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.160> slightly

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
sure Ovechkin might be slightly

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.520 
sure Ovechkin might be slightly
one-dimensional<00:03:55.480> but<00:03:55.690> does<00:03:55.870> he<00:03:56.019> ever<00:03:56.200> do<00:03:56.500> that

one-dimensional but does he ever do that
to<00:03:56.830> mention<00:03:57.190> well<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.610> veteran<00:03:58.239> comes<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:58.660> as

Rashad<00:04:06.130> power<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.489> 94<00:04:06.880> Rashad<00:04:07.239> accuracy<00:04:07.840> is

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
minus one from last year last year he

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.780 
minus one from last year last year he
was<00:04:15.850> rated<00:04:16.090> 94<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.900> he<00:04:17.830> will<00:04:18.040> go<00:04:18.400> back<00:04:18.430> down<00:04:18.760> to

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
was rated 94 and he will go back down to

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
he will go down to a 93 this year the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.340 
he will go down to a 93 this year the
only<00:04:21.580> reason<00:04:22.000> people<00:04:22.150> might<00:04:22.539> debate<00:04:22.720> this<00:04:23.080> one

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
only reason people might debate this one

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.370 
only reason people might debate this one
is<00:04:23.530> because<00:04:24.120> Ovechkin<00:04:25.120> last<00:04:25.660> year<00:04:25.870> played<00:04:26.169> on

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
is because Ovechkin last year played on

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.870 
is because Ovechkin last year played on
the<00:04:26.650> right<00:04:26.890> wing<00:04:27.100> I

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
the right wing I

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.370 
the right wing I
leave<00:04:27.970> his<00:04:28.120> natural<00:04:28.480> position<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.080> left

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
leave his natural position is a left

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.960 
leave his natural position is a left
wing<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.830> think<00:04:30.220> that's<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> reason<00:04:30.730> they

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
wing so I think that's the reason they

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.160 
wing so I think that's the reason they
put<00:04:31.180> him<00:04:31.360> on<00:04:31.540> this<00:04:31.840> list<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.320> many<00:04:33.040> people

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
put him on this list but many people

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.240 
put him on this list but many people
might<00:04:35.170> have<00:04:35.290> considered<00:04:35.440> might<00:04:36.040> have

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
might have considered might have

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.100 
might have considered might have
considered<00:04:36.520> Alexander<00:04:37.480> Ovechkin<00:04:37.570> to<00:04:37.960> be<00:04:38.080> a

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
considered Alexander Ovechkin to be a

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.440 
considered Alexander Ovechkin to be a
right-wing<00:04:38.770> this<00:04:38.950> year<00:04:39.220> although<00:04:39.820> he<00:04:39.880> kind<00:04:40.330> of

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
right-wing this year although he kind of

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.690 
right-wing this year although he kind of
was<00:04:40.660> forced<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:41.230> play<00:04:41.380> on<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.190> right<00:04:42.340> wing<00:04:42.520> by

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
was forced to play on the right wing by

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.780 
was forced to play on the right wing by
Adam<00:04:43.030> Oates<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:43.860> ovies<00:04:44.860> national<00:04:45.280> position<00:04:45.670> is

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
Adam Oates so ovies national position is

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.120 
Adam Oates so ovies national position is
left<00:04:46.210> wing<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:46.900> i<00:04:46.960> guess<00:04:47.350> ii<00:04:47.530> I<00:04:47.560> kind<00:04:47.920> of<00:04:47.950> just

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
left wing so i guess ii I kind of just

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.850 
left wing so i guess ii I kind of just
stick<00:04:48.370> with<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.940> put<00:04:49.200> kept<00:04:50.200> OV<00:04:50.560> on<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
stick with that and put kept OV on the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.010 
stick with that and put kept OV on the
left<00:04:51.070> wing<00:04:51.250> made<00:04:51.490> him<00:04:51.670> number<00:04:51.940> one<00:04:52.240> at<00:04:52.480> a<00:04:52.540> 93

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
left wing made him number one at a 93

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.770 
left wing made him number one at a 93
overall<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:54.040> there's<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.550> top<00:04:54.820> five<00:04:55.090> left

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780
