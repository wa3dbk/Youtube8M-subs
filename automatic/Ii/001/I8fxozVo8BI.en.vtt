just love that Bell like quality of the
tone<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.629> gives<00:01:00.839> a<00:01:00.960> distinct<00:01:01.440> clarity<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.159> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
tone it gives a distinct clarity and it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090

it<00:01:03.420> just<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> great<00:01:04.110> way<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> breaks

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it just has a great way that it breaks

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.639 
it just has a great way that it breaks
up<00:01:05.509> what<00:01:06.509> makes<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:06.869> classic<00:01:07.380> amps<00:01:07.530> so

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
up what makes those classic amps so

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.249 
up what makes those classic amps so
special<00:01:08.190> though<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.580> think<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.810> has<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
special though I think so that has that

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.830 
special though I think so that has that
distinct<00:01:10.799> chime<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.940> it's<00:01:12.119> clean<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.600> when

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
distinct chime when it's clean but when

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
distinct chime when it's clean but when
it's<00:01:12.990> cranked<00:01:13.440> up<00:01:13.530> loud<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:14.100> breaks<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.610> very

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it's cranked up loud it breaks up very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.990 
it's cranked up loud it breaks up very
nice<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> tone<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> cuts<00:01:16.740> through<00:01:17.550> due

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
nice but with a tone it cuts through due

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.180 
nice but with a tone it cuts through due
to<00:01:18.179> its<00:01:18.300> mid-range<00:01:18.750> hump<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.140> clarity<00:01:19.500> yeah

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
to its mid-range hump and clarity yeah

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.830 
to its mid-range hump and clarity yeah
that<00:01:20.310> has<00:01:20.429> a<00:01:20.460> particular<00:01:20.789> feel<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.450> just

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that has a particular feel that's just

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.109 
that has a particular feel that's just
hard<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> duplicate<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.710> pedal<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.850> after

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
hard to duplicate in the pedal but after

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.580 
hard to duplicate in the pedal but after
three<00:01:24.360> years<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.750> bread<00:01:25.050> boarding<00:01:25.440> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
three years of bread boarding and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.919 
three years of bread boarding and
building<00:01:25.830> prototypes<00:01:26.210> we<00:01:27.210> finally<00:01:27.509> did<00:01:27.690> it

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
building prototypes we finally did it

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.559

few different settings on the pedals
that<00:02:02.620> will<00:02:02.860> showcase<00:02:03.040> them<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.430> ace<00:02:03.580> 30<00:02:03.850> times

to<00:02:05.230> start<00:02:05.470> here's<00:02:06.190> my<00:02:06.340> clean<00:02:06.670> towel

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.210 

now<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.050> I<00:02:15.080> have<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.590> switch<00:02:15.980> here<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
now you see I have a switch here that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.500 
now you see I have a switch here that
goes<00:02:16.489> from<00:02:17.230> 8:30<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.470> 15<00:02:19.269> that's<00:02:20.269> going<00:02:20.450> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
goes from 8:30 to 15 that's going to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.259 
goes from 8:30 to 15 that's going to
kind<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.720> emulate<00:02:21.019> more<00:02:21.650> Headroom<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.730> bit

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
kind of emulate more Headroom and a bit

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.550 
kind of emulate more Headroom and a bit
more<00:02:23.420> clarity<00:02:23.810> whenever<00:02:24.170> you're<00:02:24.319> on<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
more clarity whenever you're on the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.380 
more clarity whenever you're on the
thirty<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:25.640> going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.910> distort<00:02:26.239> a

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
thirty and it's going to distort a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.789 
thirty and it's going to distort a
little<00:02:26.599> bit<00:02:26.690> easier<00:02:27.050> when<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.560> 15

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
little bit easier when it's on the 15

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:45.360 
little bit easier when it's on the 15
I'll<00:02:30.799> start<00:02:31.129> on<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.370> thirty<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:36.140> gives<00:02:36.500> this

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.880 

so<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.430> can<00:02:46.670> cut<00:02:47.390> some<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:47.900> clarity

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.120 

or<00:02:54.760> make<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.060> very<00:02:55.360> bill<00:02:55.750> like

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.230 

so<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.220> can<00:03:03.340> see<00:03:03.490> it<00:03:03.580> just<00:03:03.610> has<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.090> really

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
so you can see it just has that really

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.790 
so you can see it just has that really
distinct<00:03:04.780> chime<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.470> those<00:03:05.890> amps<00:03:06.160> have<00:03:07.800> now

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
distinct chime that those amps have now

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.440 
distinct chime that those amps have now
it<00:03:08.860> will<00:03:09.100> break<00:03:09.490> up<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:10.030> little<00:03:10.060> bit<00:03:10.330> as

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
it will break up just a little bit as

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:20.700 
it will break up just a little bit as
well<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:13.270> sounds<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.600> bit<00:03:13.630> like<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:19.650> now<00:03:20.650> we

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
well it sounds a bit like this now we

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.700 
well it sounds a bit like this now we
can<00:03:20.800> add<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.310> treble<00:03:21.730> booster<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.150> that

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
can add in the treble booster to that

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.949 
can add in the treble booster to that
you<00:03:23.710> can<00:03:23.890> get<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.070> little<00:03:24.160> bit<00:03:24.370> more<00:03:25.240> girth<00:03:25.690> and

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
you can get a little bit more girth and

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:39.960 
you can get a little bit more girth and
a<00:03:26.050> little<00:03:26.290> bit<00:03:26.410> more<00:03:27.370> roundness<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.000> it

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.600 

now<00:03:40.970> I'm<00:03:41.390> on<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.659> 15<00:03:42.110> setting<00:03:42.560> you'll<00:03:43.280> notice

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:46.189 
it doesn't have as much of that chime

00:03:46.189 --> 00:04:54.890 
it doesn't have as much of that chime
but<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.549> does<00:03:46.790> distort<00:03:47.450> easier

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.540 

you'll<00:04:55.900> also<00:04:56.080> notice<00:04:56.440> even<00:04:56.920> when<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.400> have

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
that much gain on it it still cleans up

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:13.119 
that much gain on it it still cleans up
really<00:04:59.920> well

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.619
