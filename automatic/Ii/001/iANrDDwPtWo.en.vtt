00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
like now what you see on your screen

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.710 
like now what you see on your screen
here<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.440> basically<00:00:17.010> what<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.850> blue<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.330> build

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
here is basically what the blue as build

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500 
here is basically what the blue as build
is<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.100> main<00:00:20.310> problem<00:00:20.520> people<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.060> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
is but the main problem people have is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.290 
is but the main problem people have is
how<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.140> itemize<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.769> correctly<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
how to itemize it correctly and in the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.480 
how to itemize it correctly and in the
right<00:00:24.480> order<00:00:24.769> so<00:00:25.769> I've<00:00:25.859> seen<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> lot<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.279> people

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
right order so I've seen a lot of people

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.080 
right order so I've seen a lot of people
going<00:00:26.820> tier<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.539> blue<00:00:28.380> s<00:00:28.560> first<00:00:28.890> which<00:00:29.670> isn't

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
going tier on blue s first which isn't

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
going tier on blue s first which isn't
exactly<00:00:30.179> ideal<00:00:30.660> because<00:00:31.050> you're<00:00:31.260> going<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> be

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
exactly ideal because you're going to be

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.110 
exactly ideal because you're going to be
going<00:00:31.679> up<00:00:31.920> against<00:00:32.189> someone<00:00:32.399> with<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> ramp<00:00:32.850> and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
going up against someone with a ramp and

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.060 
going up against someone with a ramp and
potentially<00:00:33.660> another<00:00:33.809> Dorrans<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.590> well<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
potentially another Dorrans as well and

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040 
potentially another Dorrans as well and
you're<00:00:36.059> generally<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.540> going<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.809> get<00:00:36.870> out

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
you're generally just going to get out

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.600 
you're generally just going to get out
traded<00:00:37.500> every<00:00:37.710> time<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.190> only<00:00:38.280> really<00:00:38.550> works

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
traded every time it only really works

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
traded every time it only really works
on<00:00:39.149> things<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.960> rides<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.590> navier--

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
on things like rides in the navier--

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.560 
on things like rides in the navier--
because<00:00:41.250> they're<00:00:41.460> AP<00:00:41.820> carries<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> rise

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
because they're AP carries a rise

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.299 
because they're AP carries a rise
obviously<00:00:42.960> gets<00:00:43.140> damaged<00:00:43.469> from<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.710> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
obviously gets damaged from the the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.090 
obviously gets damaged from the the
manner<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> Olivia<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.809> clear<00:00:46.530> waves<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
manner and Olivia can clear waves and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.860 
manner and Olivia can clear waves and
things<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.789> blue<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
things like that but blue is really

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.779 
things like that but blue is really
needs<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.070> spirit<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> elder

that's<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> mistake<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.320> see<00:01:01.350> people<00:01:01.949> make

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that's the mistake I see people make

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.460 
that's the mistake I see people make
with<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> build<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.989> puts<00:01:04.290> them

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
with this build and it kind of puts them

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.740 
with this build and it kind of puts them
off<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> from<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> start<00:01:05.309> after<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> spirit

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
off it from the start after the spirit

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.000 
off it from the start after the spirit
of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> elder<00:01:07.110> lizard<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> should<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> course

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of the elder lizard you should of course

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.780 
of the elder lizard you should of course
get<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> tier<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:11.040> need<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> stack<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.640> up

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
get the tier and you need to stack it up

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
get the tier and you need to stack it up
a<00:01:11.939> bit<00:01:11.970> before<00:01:12.450> turning<00:01:13.140> into<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> man<00:01:13.590> immune

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
a bit before turning into a man immune

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.910 
a bit before turning into a man immune
and<00:01:14.070> generally<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.939> better<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.320> ice

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and generally it's better to get the ice

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160 
and generally it's better to get the ice
bomb<00:01:17.220> gauntlet<00:01:17.729> before<00:01:17.970> turning<00:01:18.630> into<00:01:18.900> money

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
bomb gauntlet before turning into money

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.499 
bomb gauntlet before turning into money
me<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.439> you'll<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.520> feel<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> power<00:01:21.270> of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
me and you'll really feel the power of
