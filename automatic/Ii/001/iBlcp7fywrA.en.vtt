00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.290
 explain how to add deleted screens to the page 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.959
 home your phone does not ring his galaxy tab and especially the little 9000 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.429
 so that's pretty simple you have to know that it sucks galaxy s 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.650
 has an interface called that I remain three points 0 so a 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.310
 proprietary interface that gets me drunk 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.500
 and for those who allows us to add as many screens redacted and that is 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.779
 so to know how many there are two 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.289
 deba on the phone has recently been found to be attacking the very 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.540
 big walk on the top of the screen was seeing the small dots so this is the 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.539
 number of screens already to the displayed on the input phone 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.290
 we do not know vote you can maybe worse ap 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.350
 June 4 and 5 to set it on fire 5 th home page for the problem is often 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.600
 a bit the same percent for everyone e 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.660
 peugeot is not necessarily needed these five home pages elsewhere we 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.970
 go see it on the page charest knows something there 4 at the hour 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.560

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.810
 there alas one actually they are complete so what am I going to you 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.270
 explain how to remove screens 9 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.730
 others you do not need a lot we just see go on the 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.230
 menu key that is right there 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.600
 then we are going to change so far 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.920
 alas you see all the screens that appears 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.230
 in fact he flies over the main bank page 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.710
 above each screen we can not see a small sign meaning 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.070
 banned mas is simple if you delete them an empty screen you press 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.969
 on the sincere panel without lingering 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:33.719
 for their first trip 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.180
 so there they are deleted but do not forget to save so you do 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.029
 menu again and the button saved so he quotes at the front 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.659
 confirms our modifications alas you can see on top of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.289

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.080

 amended 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.050

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.100
 a page and you do more 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.280
 so if I'm going to add in advance between these two the canvas and always 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.359
 edit in district 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.609
