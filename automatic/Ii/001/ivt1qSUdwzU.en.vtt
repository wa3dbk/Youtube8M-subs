time we are taking a look at the top
five<00:00:23.670> defensive<00:00:24.420> midfielders<00:00:25.110> and<00:00:25.259> it<00:00:26.070> should

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
five defensive midfielders and it should

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.970 
five defensive midfielders and it should
be<00:00:26.369> fairly<00:00:26.550> good<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.779> projected<00:00:27.989> Renton's

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
be fairly good so projected Renton's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.550 
be fairly good so projected Renton's
here<00:00:29.579> we<00:00:29.700> go<00:00:29.849> starting<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.899> number<00:00:31.079> five

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
here we go starting off with number five

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.549 
here we go starting off with number five
who<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.310> think<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.079> Daniel<00:00:34.079> de<00:00:34.170> Rossi

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
who I think it will be Daniel de Rossi

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.400 
who I think it will be Daniel de Rossi
so<00:00:34.800> pes2014<00:00:35.280> rate<00:00:35.820> 90<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.899> he's<00:00:37.050> gonna<00:00:37.230> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
so pes2014 rate 90 I think he's gonna be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.139 
so pes2014 rate 90 I think he's gonna be
a<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.649> less<00:00:37.800> than<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.790> think

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a little less than that I don't think

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.660 
a little less than that I don't think
you'll<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> higher<00:00:39.750> echelon<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.470> the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
you'll be in the higher echelon of the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.450 
you'll be in the higher echelon of the
90s<00:00:41.670> players<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.329> PES<00:00:43.290> 2014<00:00:43.830> I<00:00:43.950> think<00:00:44.130> his<00:00:44.220> legs

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
90s players in PES 2014 I think his legs

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.130 
90s players in PES 2014 I think his legs
have<00:00:44.610> kind<00:00:44.790> of<00:00:44.880> suffer<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.240> little<00:00:45.450> bit<00:00:45.690> he's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
have kind of suffer a little bit he's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.200 
have kind of suffer a little bit he's
not<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.350> player<00:00:46.620> he<00:00:46.740> once<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.130> as<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:47.970> saw

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
not the player he once was as we saw

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.320 
not the player he once was as we saw
with<00:00:48.900> Italy<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.590> he's<00:00:50.130> being<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:50.490> and<00:00:50.790> again

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
with Italy but he's being good and again

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.820 
with Italy but he's being good and again
I<00:00:51.510> think<00:00:51.810> he's<00:00:51.900> impressive<00:00:52.350> enough<00:00:52.470> to<00:00:52.680> get

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
I think he's impressive enough to get

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.650 
I think he's impressive enough to get
into<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> top<00:00:53.430> five<00:00:53.640> defensive<00:00:54.150> midfielders

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
into the top five defensive midfielders

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
into the top five defensive midfielders
in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.380> game<00:00:55.560> because<00:00:55.740> he<00:00:55.920> still<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.220> in<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
in the game because he still is in the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.940 
in the game because he still is in the
world<00:00:56.610> anyway<00:00:57.060> so<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.380> it<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.560> the<00:00:58.800> top

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
world anyway so that is it for the top

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.760 
world anyway so that is it for the top
five<00:00:59.190> they're<00:00:59.690> kicking<00:01:00.690> things<00:01:00.810> off<00:01:01.020> Xabi

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
five they're kicking things off Xabi

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
five they're kicking things off Xabi
Alonso<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.400> in<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.210> second<00:01:03.660> spot<00:01:03.750> at<00:01:04.079> number

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
Alonso is in the second spot at number

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.340 
Alonso is in the second spot at number
four<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.150> could<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.780> little<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
four and this could be a little bit of a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.440 
four and this could be a little bit of a
controversial<00:01:07.799> choice<00:01:08.009> as<00:01:08.430> well<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.970> just

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
controversial choice as well I just

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.030 
controversial choice as well I just
think<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.750> Real<00:01:10.290> Madrid<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> be

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
think that Real Madrid are going to be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740 
think that Real Madrid are going to be
absolutely<00:01:11.159> crazy<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.149> they<00:01:12.479> want<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
absolutely crazy because they want the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
absolutely crazy because they want the
Champions<00:01:13.140> League<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.579> I<00:01:14.909> think<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
Champions League and and I think that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
Champions League and and I think that
all<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.050> know<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.260> can<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.040> his

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
pes2014 rent was 91 I think it'll be in

pes2014 rent was 91 I think it'll be in
around<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.490> I've<00:01:20.790> dropped<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.300> 88

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

of you know abilities or whatever I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.760 
of you know abilities or whatever I
don't<00:01:27.690> think<00:01:28.080> he's<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> high

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
don't think he's going to be in the high

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.289 
don't think he's going to be in the high
90s<00:01:29.250> like<00:01:29.400> he<00:01:29.610> shouldn't<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:29.940> anywhere

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
90s like he shouldn't be anywhere

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
90s like he shouldn't be anywhere
because<00:01:30.450> he's<00:01:30.659> getting<00:01:30.960> old<00:01:31.110> he's<00:01:31.680> tipping<00:01:32.040> on

because he's getting old he's tipping on

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.590 
because he's getting old he's tipping on
he<00:01:32.370> might<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.729> from<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> droid<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.390> don't

Mascherano<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.840> his<00:01:51.930> ways<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
Mascherano I think his ways to the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.630 
Mascherano I think his ways to the
person<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:52.979> they're<00:01:53.220> trying<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.460> make

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
person I think they're trying to make

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
person I think they're trying to make
him<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.880> centre-half<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.540> don't<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:54.900> he's<00:01:54.990> a

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
him a centre-half I don't think he's a

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.870 
him a centre-half I don't think he's a
centre-half<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.650> think<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.310> between<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
centre-half I think just in between and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120 
centre-half I think just in between and
that<00:01:57.000> Claude<00:01:57.600> Makelele<00:01:58.049> role<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.619> think

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
that Claude Makelele role I think

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.530 
that Claude Makelele role I think
there's<00:01:59.310> no<00:01:59.460> one<00:01:59.640> as<00:01:59.760> good<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.450> be

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
there's no one as good as it to be

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.899 
there's no one as good as it to be
honest<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:00.960> he<00:02:01.049> does<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:02.400> said<00:02:02.760> maybe

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
honest at what he does and I said maybe

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.039 
honest at what he does and I said maybe
number<00:02:03.689> one<00:02:03.900> put<00:02:04.170> next<00:02:04.830> up<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> Andrea<00:02:05.430> Pirlo<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
number one put next up is Andrea Pirlo I

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.419 
number one put next up is Andrea Pirlo I

potential<00:03:11.909> rate<00:03:12.209> 93<00:03:12.840> probably<00:03:13.379> even<00:03:13.439> a<00:03:13.560> bit

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680

potential rate 93 probably even a bit
low<00:03:13.829> i<00:03:13.859> think<00:03:14.219> he's<00:03:14.310> one<00:03:14.459> of<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.609> best<00:03:14.760> players
