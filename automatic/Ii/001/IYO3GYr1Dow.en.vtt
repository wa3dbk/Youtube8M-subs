 they turn the page and prefer 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.010
 turn a deaf ear to the bitter 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.870
 experience after their imitators 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.150
 will support all kinds of comments 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.780
 discriminatory through networks 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.690
 social 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.119
 the group heart serrano opts for 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.940
 ignore those who do not deserve our 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.040
 opinion because they call us made the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.020
 they are all bad here we are not coastal 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.980
 Your comments make us stronger and 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.560
 is that they think they give us 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.970
 to fall to let us fall for its simple 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.890
 comments because they are simple 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.170
 comments let's take importance 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.090
 everything started with the presentation of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.980
 four young girls who surprised by 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.050
 its great resemblance to the members of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.120
 the grouping the name of heart 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.460
 Serrano became a trend in the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.170
 twitter but at the same time it was the platform 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.650
 for a series of messages 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.650
 discriminatory 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.159
 listening to serrano heart and 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:58.190
 automatically my employee uncovered a 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:00.260
 beer bottle with teeth 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.620
 who listen to the heart serrano are 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.750
 poor and live in the hills at any 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.020
 cholita comes out the voice of heart 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.970
 serrano the true grouping does not 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.100
 amilana although they admitted feeling 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.460
 pity for the people who express themselves 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.250
 that way the people who say well 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.439
 they will have their reasons or they will not have a love 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.729
 own that does not harm me at all 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.610
 they 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.380
 You are a mountain worker with great honor and I feel 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.840
 proud of what I am of what I do 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.759
 why a closed is a grouping of 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.369
 Peruvian cumbia that was formed in Piura in 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.229
 the year 93 and that initially you 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.259
 they integrated the eight neira brothers 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.420
 twenty years later they have reached such 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.970
 fame and recognition that have broken 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.119
 records for sale fill stadiums with more 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.920
 38 thousand people and their concerts are 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.319
 the most wanted by Peruvians in 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.200
 youtube reaching more than one million 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.060
