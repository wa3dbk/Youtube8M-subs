00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
the parts inside so with the motherboard

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.680 
the parts inside so with the motherboard
it<00:04:38.650> is<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.460> asus<00:04:40.210> m4a<00:04:41.080> 88<00:04:41.710> th<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.370> evo<00:04:42.790> it's

is<00:05:45.280> I'm<00:05:45.460> not<00:05:46.210> too<00:05:46.450> good<00:05:46.480> at<00:05:46.720> hiding<00:05:47.020> my<00:05:47.170> cables

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
is I'm not too good at hiding my cables

yet<00:06:13.270> you<00:06:13.750> need<00:06:13.840> to<00:06:13.930> get<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.080> second<00:06:14.650> SATA<00:06:14.860> cable

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510

died<00:06:19.480> go<00:06:20.020> figure<00:06:20.260> sitting<00:06:20.500> you're<00:06:20.710> actually

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
died go figure sitting you're actually

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.460 
died go figure sitting you're actually
pretty<00:06:21.070> cheap<00:06:21.340> but<00:06:21.370> at<00:06:21.910> night<00:06:22.630> it<00:06:22.900> is<00:06:22.960> very

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
pretty cheap but at night it is very

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.150 
pretty cheap but at night it is very
nice<00:06:23.680> to<00:06:23.740> illuminate<00:06:24.700> the<00:06:24.850> case<00:06:25.710> as<00:06:26.710> you<00:06:27.040> can

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
nice to illuminate the case as you can

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.640 
nice to illuminate the case as you can
see<00:06:27.280> again<00:06:27.490> there's<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.060> mega<00:06:28.570> flow<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:29.200> then

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
see again there's the mega flow and then

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.830 
see again there's the mega flow and then
exhaust<00:06:29.980> and<00:06:30.250> then<00:06:30.400> a<00:06:30.430> sickle<00:06:30.970> flow<00:06:31.180> 120<00:06:31.690> as

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
exhaust and then a sickle flow 120 as

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.580 
exhaust and then a sickle flow 120 as
also<00:06:32.380> as<00:06:32.560> an<00:06:32.740> exam

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
also as an exam

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.260 
also as an exam
so<00:06:34.590> that's<00:06:34.889> pretty<00:06:35.190> much<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.400> insides<00:06:35.910> of<00:06:36.210> my

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
so that's pretty much the insides of my

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.360 
so that's pretty much the insides of my
case<00:06:36.750> hopefully<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.590> can<00:06:37.860> upgrade<00:06:38.040> the

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
case hopefully I can upgrade the

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.629 
case hopefully I can upgrade the
motherboard<00:06:38.820> cpu<00:06:39.240> soon<00:06:39.900> but<00:06:40.380> as<00:06:40.620> you<00:06:41.250> can<00:06:41.370> see

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
motherboard cpu soon but as you can see

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.860 
motherboard cpu soon but as you can see
throughout<00:06:41.910> this<00:06:42.030> 13<00:06:42.330> video<00:06:42.540> there<00:06:42.690> are<00:06:42.750> a<00:06:42.780> lot

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
throughout this 13 video there are a lot

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.080 
throughout this 13 video there are a lot
of<00:06:42.900> things<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.199> like<00:06:43.350> to<00:06:43.380> upgrade<00:06:43.590> but<00:06:44.060> none<00:06:45.060> of

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
of things I like to upgrade but none of

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.340 
of things I like to upgrade but none of
which<00:06:45.330> are<00:06:45.479> probably<00:06:45.720> going<00:06:45.840> to<00:06:45.930> happen<00:06:46.169> any

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
which are probably going to happen any

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.969 
which are probably going to happen any
time<00:06:46.440> soon<00:06:47.720> so<00:06:48.720> that's<00:06:49.080> pretty<00:06:49.380> much<00:06:49.470> it<00:06:49.650> we're

time soon so that's pretty much it we're
going<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.220> do<00:06:50.400> one<00:06:50.669> more<00:06:51.090> final<00:06:51.600> pan<00:06:52.400> across

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
going to do one more final pan across

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.640 
going to do one more final pan across
the<00:06:53.850> desk<00:06:54.120> and<00:06:54.979> that<00:06:55.979> is<00:06:56.220> basically<00:06:56.699> it<00:06:57.419> so<00:06:58.020> you

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
the desk and that is basically it so you

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.409
