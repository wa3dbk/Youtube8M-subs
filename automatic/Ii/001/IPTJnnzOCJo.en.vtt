let's let's race the world is solved but

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.830 
let's let's race the world is solved but
shameful<00:00:38.400> as<00:00:38.580> well<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.330> not<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> training

saltwater<00:00:48.059> swimming<00:00:48.330> pool<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.080> then<00:00:49.739> we're

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
saltwater swimming pool and then we're

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.450 
saltwater swimming pool and then we're
actually<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:50.970> looking<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:52.010> changing<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
actually now looking into changing the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.600 
actually now looking into changing the
swimming<00:00:53.820> pool<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.080> ozone<00:00:55.620> swimming

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
swimming pool to the ozone swimming

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.390 
swimming pool to the ozone swimming
pools<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.809> then<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.470> won't<00:00:58.830> use<00:00:59.070> any

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
pools because then we won't use any

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.869 
pools because then we won't use any
chemicals<00:01:00.030> salt<00:01:00.570> nothing<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.610> a<00:01:02.730> lot

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
chemicals salt nothing and it's a lot

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
chemicals salt nothing and it's a lot
healthy<00:01:03.540> and<00:01:03.659> it's<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.839> cleaner<00:01:04.230> but<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.040> a

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
healthy and it's not cleaner but it's a

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.680 
healthy and it's not cleaner but it's a
process<00:01:05.370> we<00:01:05.730> have<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.570> you're

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
process we have to go through and you're

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.670 
process we have to go through and you're
looking<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.380> right<00:01:07.409> now<00:01:09.290> no<00:01:10.290> salt<00:01:10.620> no

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
looking into it right now no salt no

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.730 
looking into it right now no salt no
chemicals<00:01:11.340> no<00:01:11.400> salt<00:01:11.760> no<00:01:11.820> nothing<00:01:12.350> it's<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.590> do

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
chemicals no salt no nothing it's to do

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.030 
chemicals no salt no nothing it's to do
with<00:01:13.770> an<00:01:14.070> infrared<00:01:14.550> I<00:01:15.650> don't<00:01:16.650> know<00:01:16.740> too<00:01:16.800> much

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
with an infrared I don't know too much

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
with an infrared I don't know too much
about<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:17.909> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
about it but it's to do with the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
about it but it's to do with the
infrared<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:19.050> water<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.470> pushed<00:01:19.740> through

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
infrared so the water is pushed through

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.300 
infrared so the water is pushed through
a<00:01:20.040> rate<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.850> let's<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.600> go<00:01:21.630> through<00:01:22.020> an

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
a rate and it's let's it go through an

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.420 
a rate and it's let's it go through an
ultra<00:01:23.310> violent<00:01:23.880> chamber<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.049> light<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.830> kills

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
ultra violent chamber of light and kills

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.789 
ultra violent chamber of light and kills
everything<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.110> it'll<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.470> just<00:01:28.680> like

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
everything in it so it'll be just like

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.020 
everything in it so it'll be just like
swimming<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.430> tap<00:01:29.640> water

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
swimming in tap water

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.709 
swimming in tap water
so<00:01:31.460> hopefully<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.700> tap<00:01:32.880> waters<00:01:33.180> nice<00:01:33.360> yes

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
so hopefully the tap waters nice yes

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.260 
so hopefully the tap waters nice yes
yeah<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:34.710> nobody<00:01:35.280> Oso<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.939> way<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
yeah but nobody Oso is the way of the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.800 
yeah but nobody Oso is the way of the
future<00:01:36.420> yeah<00:01:40.729> so<00:01:41.729> now<00:01:41.880> we're<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> cool<00:01:42.570> level

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
future yeah so now we're on a cool level

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.050 
future yeah so now we're on a cool level
again<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.070> walk<00:01:44.219> about<00:01:44.460> here

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
again and if we walk about here

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.230 
again and if we walk about here
this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:46.399> water's<00:01:47.399> fine<00:01:52.789> so<00:01:53.789> anything<00:01:54.060> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
this is the water's fine so anything is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.779 
this is the water's fine so anything is
a<00:01:54.270> little<00:01:54.689> bit<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.170> restore<00:01:55.350> as<00:01:55.649> well<00:01:55.829> you

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
a little bit more to restore as well you

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.580 
a little bit more to restore as well you
seem<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.180> our<00:01:57.359> cabins<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> way<00:01:58.350> down

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
seem to have our cabins all the way down

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.550 
seem to have our cabins all the way down
here<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.250> then<00:01:59.939> they<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.479> way<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.840> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
here and then they go all the way up and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
here and then they go all the way up and
then<00:02:01.710> our<00:02:01.859> townhomes<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.640> back<00:02:03.200> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
