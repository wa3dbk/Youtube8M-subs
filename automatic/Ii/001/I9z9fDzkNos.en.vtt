00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
there is a QR code of my card number
itself<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.970> can<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.209> ahead<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.360> scan<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.720> it's

itself you can go ahead and scan it it's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.750 
itself you can go ahead and scan it it's
not<00:02:10.080> real<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.860> we'll<00:02:11.009> go<00:02:11.129> ahead<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> hit<00:02:11.489> add

you know you can hit information and you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.780 
you know you can hit information and you
just<00:02:25.230> read<00:02:25.440> all<00:02:25.590> about<00:02:25.680> subways<00:02:26.220> rules<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
delete button and hit delete isn't that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.460 
delete button and hit delete isn't that
cool<00:02:53.330> Apple<00:02:54.330> does<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.660> securely<00:02:55.140> and

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
cool Apple does it securely and

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.960 
cool Apple does it securely and
obviously<00:02:55.920> it's<00:02:56.100> apples<00:02:56.490> so<00:02:56.670> i<00:02:56.700> would

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
obviously it's apples so i would

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.449 
obviously it's apples so i would
definitely<00:02:57.000> trust<00:02:57.600> them<00:02:57.840> um<00:02:58.620> but<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.160> does<00:02:59.340> it

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
definitely trust them um but it does it

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.420 
definitely trust them um but it does it
securely<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.300> shreds<00:03:00.630> up<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> card<00:03:01.200> and

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
securely and it shreds up the card and

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.800 
securely and it shreds up the card and
once<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:02.640> gone<00:03:02.820> that's<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.540> then<00:03:03.690> in

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
once it's gone that's it and then in

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.210 
once it's gone that's it and then in
real<00:03:03.990> life<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.530> want<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.770> actually<00:03:04.890> shut

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
real life if you want to actually shut

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.920 
real life if you want to actually shut
up<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.490> card<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.790> real<00:03:05.940> life<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.330> can<00:03:06.510> too<00:03:06.720> but

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
up the card in real life you can too but

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.530 
up the card in real life you can too but
it<00:03:07.770> completely<00:03:08.190> deletes<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.209> record

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
it completely deletes that record

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.420 
it completely deletes that record
history<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.620> had<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.040> phone

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
history that you had on your phone

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.940 
history that you had on your phone
itself<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.209> yeah<00:03:13.110> that's<00:03:13.230> pretty<00:03:13.380> much<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
itself and yeah that's pretty much it to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.410 
itself and yeah that's pretty much it to
it<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.370> see<00:03:14.520> i<00:03:14.550> just<00:03:14.850> created<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.209> bunch

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.469 
it's going to work the same way as it
does<00:05:01.949> now<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.490> think<00:05:02.940> apple<00:05:03.210> will<00:05:03.240> have

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
does now I think apple will have

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:04.969 
does now I think apple will have
something<00:05:03.810> in<00:05:03.930> the<00:05:04.050> passbook<00:05:04.470> app<00:05:04.650> where<00:05:04.889> you

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
something in the passbook app where you

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:06.469 
something in the passbook app where you
can<00:05:05.099> add<00:05:05.310> everything<00:05:05.550> and<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.000> think<00:05:06.210> it'll<00:05:06.360> be

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
can add everything and I think it'll be

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.150 
can add everything and I think it'll be
a<00:05:06.509> little<00:05:06.780> bit<00:05:06.960> more<00:05:07.110> unified<00:05:07.590> and<00:05:07.770> easier<00:05:08.130> to

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
a little bit more unified and easier to

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.920 
a little bit more unified and easier to
use<00:05:08.280> than<00:05:08.639> what<00:05:09.060> we<00:05:09.180> currently<00:05:09.210> have<00:05:09.660> with<00:05:09.840> the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
use than what we currently have with the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.749 
use than what we currently have with the
past<00:05:10.169> source<00:05:10.380> web<00:05:10.590> site<00:05:10.830> I<00:05:11.009> definitely<00:05:11.430> know

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
past source web site I definitely know

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.310 
past source web site I definitely know
that<00:05:11.789> apple<00:05:12.180> will<00:05:12.270> not<00:05:12.479> be<00:05:12.630> using<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:13.080> past

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
that apple will not be using this past

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.469 
that apple will not be using this past
source<00:05:13.590> web<00:05:13.830> site<00:05:14.070> in<00:05:14.250> their<00:05:14.759> final<00:05:15.120> version

although<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:16.289> probably<00:05:16.680> will<00:05:17.130> still<00:05:17.430> be<00:05:17.550> able

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
although you probably will still be able

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:19.520 
although you probably will still be able
to<00:05:17.820> use<00:05:17.940> it<00:05:18.300> if<00:05:18.419> you<00:05:18.840> do<00:05:19.020> want<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.289> create

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
to use it if you do want to create

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.350 
to use it if you do want to create
custom<00:05:19.949> things<00:05:20.159> because<00:05:20.520> through<00:05:20.789> the<00:05:20.970> oldest

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
custom things because through the oldest

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.810 
custom things because through the oldest
if<00:05:21.539> I<00:05:21.630> just<00:05:21.870> let's<00:05:22.110> say<00:05:22.259> I<00:05:22.289> hit<00:05:22.610> boarding<00:05:23.610> pass

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
if I just let's say I hit boarding pass

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.180 
if I just let's say I hit boarding pass
you<00:05:24.240> can<00:05:24.449> create<00:05:24.780> whatever<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.349> want<00:05:25.620> custom

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
you can create whatever you want custom

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.339 
you can create whatever you want custom
and<00:05:26.370> then<00:05:26.400> just<00:05:26.849> hits<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:27.960> mean<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.259> do

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
and then just hits that I mean to do

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.170 
and then just hits that I mean to do
that<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.650> then<00:05:29.130> just<00:05:29.159> hit<00:05:29.550> go<00:05:29.819> all<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.150> way

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
that and then just hit go all the way

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.670 
that and then just hit go all the way
down<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:30.479> hit<00:05:30.720> create<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:31.229> could<00:05:31.409> customize

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
down and hit create you could customize

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.129 
down and hit create you could customize
it<00:05:32.159> fully<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:32.940> I'm<00:05:33.210> sure<00:05:33.419> Apple<00:05:33.840> will<00:05:33.990> either

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
it fully so I'm sure Apple will either

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.670 
it fully so I'm sure Apple will either
have<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.530> custom<00:05:35.190> setting<00:05:35.639> that<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.880> can<00:05:36.060> do<00:05:36.240> or

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
have a custom setting that you can do or

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.230 
have a custom setting that you can do or
they'll<00:05:37.680> set<00:05:37.949> their<00:05:38.130> presets<00:05:38.610> like<00:05:38.909> we<00:05:39.090> have

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
they'll set their presets like we have

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.700 
they'll set their presets like we have
on<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.570> past<00:05:39.810> source<00:05:40.050> website<00:05:40.530> but<00:05:40.680> I

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
on the past source website but I

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.080 
on the past source website but I
definitely<00:05:41.039> think<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.400> apple<00:05:41.789> will<00:05:41.909> have

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
definitely think that apple will have

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.839 
definitely think that apple will have
something<00:05:42.380> hopefully<00:05:43.380> very<00:05:43.560> soon<00:05:43.710> built<00:05:44.520> into

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:44.849 
something hopefully very soon built into

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:46.159 
something hopefully very soon built into
this<00:05:44.940> at<00:05:45.180> where<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.509> could<00:05:45.690> just<00:05:45.810> create

this at where you could just create

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.379 
this at where you could just create
stuff<00:05:46.469> yourself<00:05:47.039> whether<00:05:47.400> it<00:05:47.610> be<00:05:47.789> branded

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
stuff yourself whether it be branded

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.490 
stuff yourself whether it be branded
with<00:05:48.990> stores<00:05:49.409> without<00:05:49.680> stores<00:05:50.479> custom<00:05:51.479> etc<00:05:52.440> or

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500
