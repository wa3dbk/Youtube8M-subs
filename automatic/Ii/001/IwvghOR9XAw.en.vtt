00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.910
 social networks not only we 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.430
 let them be close to our friends 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.980
 but they also allow that when 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.320
 try to play we can resort to them 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.620
 to ask for help or some coins 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.140
 virtual to win our game the 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.330
 games within facebook usually occupy 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.699
 much of the time we spent in the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.369
 network and this usually happens without giving us 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.550
 account once we are immersed in 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.890
 any 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.770
 many started giving life to a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.379
 pet in pet society where you create it 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.750
 with your favorite color you gave him a name 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.970
 and an empty house that you should then 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.120
 decorating and furnishing buying with coins 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.920
 these are received after 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.620
 visit your contacts' pets 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.840
 that if they wanted, I could also send you 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.660
 of gift some object for your house 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.210
 but if taking care of a pet was not what 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.300
 you had the farmville option 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 that continues available here you have to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 I charge a virtual farm where you should 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 plant and harvest crops breed 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.229
 animals and wait patiently for that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.380
 things happen if you do not have the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.119
 patience or you will not get the fun coins 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
 and form houses to buy what 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.369
 you need your friends can send you 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.860
 gifts for your farm to grow and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.980
 produce more and more 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.500
 farmville began to be displaced by itself 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.750
 I divided a game of similar technique that 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.270
 his predecessor but with elements 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.880
 relative of the city here you can 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.940
 become governor mayor or 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.490
 president and your duty is to grow a 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.590
 small town either with your own 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.050
 effort as well as with the help 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.630
 of your friends to send you gifts 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.080
 or permits to quickly end with 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.290
 your missions but not all are games 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.100
 innocent there is also mafia wars that 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.080
 last year it enjoyed a lot of popularity 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.000
 as its name says here you are a 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.119
 mafioso who must do dirty jobs 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.330
 to get money power and establish 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.820
 your own mafia in this game you must 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
 fight against your facebook friends and 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.239
 even recruit some to be 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.239
 part of your criminal empire 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.660
 it's such an addictive game that once 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.330
 you know, you will not be less than 10 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160
 minutes in the it started as a game for 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.860
 pc that then moved to the 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.770
 apps for smartphones and landed 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.500
 on facebook you will not need help from your 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.810
 friends because this is a personal game 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.180
 the one that you must gather gems equal and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.910
 make them explode but if you can 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.910
 publish your score and get your picks 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.040
 friends a very similar game is to give the 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.100
 assembly that is currently one of the 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.450
 more addictive then in 60 seconds you should 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.810
 eliminate groups of gems of the same color 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.610
 until a few months ago the music lovers 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.860
 they found in software a way to 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.739
 measure your knowledge about music with 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.800
 your friends from the social network and that is that they are 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.269
 pop that also exists as a allows you 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.940
 a dogfight where you must 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.250
 guess what the song is that sounds or 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:20.080
 your interpreter choosing one of four 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.540
 options of a certain gender 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.120
 we could not leave out the star 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.660
 of these last weeks the candy crush 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.880
 If you have not played yet, be prepared to be 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.240
 one of his new followers because candy 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.610
 cross is addictive although its goal is 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.770
 the same kevin youkilis or diamond dash 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.840
 the competition between users by 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.580
 reach the maximum score is the 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.190
 main motivation to put together 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.750
 different types of candies and make 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.750
 explode to score points 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.530
 you already know if it was not enough to spend 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.239
 much of your time reviewing the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.790
 updates from your friends 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.489
 facebook now you have one more reason to 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.480
 delay that painful moment when 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.480
 you must unlog yourself close
