00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.039
 This ball will roll in the streets where you 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.150
 green when the ball gets there is not in the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.839
 network on the network in the network there they are 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.449
 gorgeous 

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:26.699
 they are the cats but will they 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.779
 They think it's beautiful that they think 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.779
 nice cat 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.140
 it is easier to deal with the insecurity of 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.899
 a model that thinks ugly or with the ego 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.040
 inflated from a socialite 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.480
 there I prefer the models a person who 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.610
 It appears to be very safe has a voice 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.649
 very imposing you have a woman 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.000
 very sensitive and susceptible to criticism 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.860
 behind the security everybody 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.809
 criticizes we have to be open 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.329
 to receive that the more success is 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.770
 most critical parent you take there as it is 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.289
 live said think it's boring unity is me 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.410
 I think the most complicated of these 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:15.170
 system is that sometimes this fame is 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.390
 so instant does people throw 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.149
 the foot by the skillful hands rochette is 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 back now will use that fanny pack 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.550
 who put that lie behind it had 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.170
 known for bringing much more modes 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.539
 know where and how you are going to apply it 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.979
 in your day to day explain love you look 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.979
 It's beautiful and it 's not 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.770
 I see my son up his sleeve for you 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 she is very beautiful she will not look 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.170
 for her because she does not say much 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.240
 Beautiful will not be able to make three 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.270
 Ball questions to wake you up and what? 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.430
 always think beautiful is beautiful is 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.800
 always nice if you think it's good, right? 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.040
 they find nothing makes the rope only use mother 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.630
 I even got a makeup 9 rolled 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.190
 more confidence I will not lie to you 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.190
 you are so right no 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.840
 like the fashion and beautiful people look 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.340
 A lot has moments that you are not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.580
 looking at what's pretty any little 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.650
 another banal reason people look 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 quite like this but now do preaching 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.880
 it is easier you get there try to get 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.650
 good eyes 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.100
 I 'm suspect to talk because I 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.990
 I almost married her girlfriend too 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.270
 but it is very easy to exchange a look like this 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.820
 It's already in my opinion that the pass is beautiful. 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.500
 a trend that came when the guys 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.360
 envy to any kind of crisis what 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 that calls to do so thousand 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.860
 Now do not be too envious of me. 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.560
 of friendships but I think there are people 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 and the people who speak are envious and 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.270
 she said try to find a fault in the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.270
 car
