00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
see a couple of devices running it we

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.730 
see a couple of devices running it we
already<00:04:23.719> know<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.050> HTC<00:04:24.380> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
already know that HTC the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.100 
already know that HTC the
of<00:04:25.100> raining<00:04:25.400> quad-core<00:04:25.850> processors<00:04:26.479> as<00:04:26.750> of

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
of raining quad-core processors as of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.080 
of raining quad-core processors as of
their<00:04:27.259> new<00:04:27.410> batch<00:04:27.650> coming<00:04:27.979> up<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.310> hopefully

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
their new batch coming up so hopefully

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.839
