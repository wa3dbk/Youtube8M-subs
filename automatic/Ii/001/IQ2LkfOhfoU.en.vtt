00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.190
 Hello to all friends today is Saturday 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.170
 then it’s time for another 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.230
 portions of advice for those who only 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.400
 plans to start repairs 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.920
 the first thing I would like to call your 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.590
 attention is on the apron and now pretty 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.140
 common tile but rather 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.810
 often used in apron solutions 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.120
 this is rectangular white from this 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.300
 called brick and all 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.330
 usually use the layout so 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.010
 called the brick I offer you 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.800
 apply a different layout 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.370
 Christmas tree seems to me such a layout as 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.590
 see on the map it is much more interesting 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.030
 much more dynamic looks better in 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.200
 Anyway, it will not be like all 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.170
 other next tip also applies 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.540
 apron you all know that again 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.650
 quite often used as 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.510
 kitchen apron 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:15.190
 mosaic and usually there 99.9 percent 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.650
 mosaic laid out well as usual 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.510
 glass rows I suggest you 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.280
 put the mosaic diagonally to me 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.520
 it seems too much more interesting 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.170
 looks and at least in the near 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.540
 the environment you are such an apron is not exactly 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.229
 find it here are tips that 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.110
 concerned 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.940
 kitchen apron next tip 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.130
 concerns saving on rough materials 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.049
 governing council is suitable and everything is only 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.400
 for those who are not in a hurry to call in their housing 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:44.140
 those who rent an apartment and those who 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.479
 built for some investment purposes 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.220
 that is, the purpose of putting your house in 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.159
 rental of course tips fit and 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.659
 you may need to call in as soon as possible 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.409
 make repairs and call in your apartment 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.430
 but those who are not in a hurry for such advice 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.020
 that is, or quite often they have the wrong 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.049
 which is quite often almost always 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.500
 after repairs from your neighbors remains 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.170
 liquid and excess materials and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.580
 if you sign up on social networks 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 your company’s website quite often 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.660
 posting there such ads that who 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.120
 it will ever give you sales to us 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.610
 almost half price 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.320
 excess plaster excess putty 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.630
 too drywall and so this is the very same 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.680
 like so as not to arrange 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.709
 their apartments do all warehouse 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.890
 materials they will be useful to them 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.090
 I advise before you drag your 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.100
 the apartment is all these materials 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.160
 invite the master to make you 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.410
 First estimate for the cost of work and in 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.370
 second you ask him so he 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.459
 also provided you with a quote for 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.410
 amount of roughing materials 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.750
 based on this estimate you will be exactly 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 know but if you invite 2 3 masters 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.410
 masters then you really will 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.250
 know exactly 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.470
 the required number of rough 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.470
 materials for your apartment and already proceeding 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.750
 from this list you can some part 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.269
 on can buy and either totally perfect 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.440
 free to take your neighbors like 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.780
 the rule is a dead end here of all this happening 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.830
 on the second third month after 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.160
 you were given the keys 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.220
 that is, the first month people are still there 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:30.780
 swinging 2 3 months actively goes 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.340
 the main part of the repairs somewhere in the end 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.860
 the third month is already a big part 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.120
 apartments for rent directly live 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.250
 the most at this moment is just 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.730
 but there appear base excess 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.350
 materials that nobody wants on 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.010
 this you can basically decently 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.950
 to save 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.799
 I think that the one-room apartment 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.660
 about 1030 you can save not 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.910
 consider this money as saving 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.720
 your repair better see how 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.600
 redistribution of resources let's say 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.120
 saving here those 30 thousand for rough 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 materials you can well on standard 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.290
 bathroom example will find 25 30 squares 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.910
 tiles you can buy tile 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.750
 if you planned let's say for 1000 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.090
 rubles you are already mine 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.040
 buy for 2000 to make a friend tile 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.769
 or example if you were planning 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.650
 floor apartment covering the room in 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.590
 average about 18 20 squares 600 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.380
 rubles laminate you can already take 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.520
 2000 floorboard completely different 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.270
 there will be a level of repair 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.830
 this is such advice next advice 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.560
 As for how not to do 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.900
 quite often the people of their apartment 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.760
 enclose incomprehensible drywall 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.510
 designs that you can see on 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.419
 pictures 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.600
 I strongly recommend this 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.790
 do reward such things with his 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.860
 apartment well you surprise your 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.630
 friends and acquaintances who will come to you in 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.960
 but surprise guests and you are only one of them 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.210
 time will pass a few years and you will want 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.300
 do redevelop not redevelop 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.130
 rearrangement of furniture yes and now these are all 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.760
 designs you have to break toy 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.419
 story 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:16.550
 Well, this time it's extra dust collectors 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:19.169
 as if any any room she is much 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.419
 more interesting looks much more practical 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.770
 when we are succinctly there is a functional 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.229
 correct this promise is simple 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.700
 rectangular 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.740
 finally i would suggest you 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.750
 visit website
