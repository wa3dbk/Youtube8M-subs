untethered jailbreak update this is the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.970 
untethered jailbreak update this is the

whatever whatever exploits and stuff
that<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.780> used<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:38.879> jailbreak<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.809> a4<00:00:40.530> chip

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
that is used to jailbreak the a4 chip

that is used to jailbreak the a4 chip
I'm<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.820> sure<00:00:41.969> if<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.120> I'm<00:00:42.510> not<00:00:42.600> sure<00:00:42.660> if

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I'm not sure if this I'm not sure if

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.660 
I'm not sure if this I'm not sure if
those<00:00:42.899> will<00:00:43.079> work<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> a5<00:00:44.010> chips<00:00:44.340> yet<00:00:44.550> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
those will work on the a5 chips yet or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.260 
those will work on the a5 chips yet or
not<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.719> 5x<00:00:46.289> chip<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> even<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.789> little

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
not and a 5x chip which is even a little

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.970 
not and a 5x chip which is even a little
bit<00:00:48.360> more<00:00:48.510> different<00:00:48.840> than<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> a5<00:00:49.350> obviously

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
bit more different than the a5 obviously

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830 
bit more different than the a5 obviously
as<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.129> guys<00:00:50.309> know<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.850> as<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.570> not

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
sure as to what devices at work for but

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.330 
sure as to what devices at work for but
we<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.629> sure<00:00:54.690> it's<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.289> iphone<00:00:55.920> 4<00:00:56.160> which

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
we know for sure it's the iphone 4 which

we know for sure it's the iphone 4 which
is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.750> a4<00:00:57.750> chip<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.170> don't<00:00:58.289> work<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
is the a4 chip so don't work on all a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
is the a4 chip so don't work on all a
four<00:00:59.010> devices<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.699> those<00:01:00.000> actually<00:01:00.510> day<00:01:00.750> for

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
four devices and those actually day for

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.130 
four devices and those actually day for
device<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> already<00:01:01.410> jailbroken<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:02.190> iOS<00:01:02.250> 5.1

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
device is already jailbroken on iOS 5.1

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.270 
device is already jailbroken on iOS 5.1
but<00:01:04.140> it's<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> tethered<00:01:04.619> jailbreak<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.159> now

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
but it's a tethered jailbreak but now

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
but it's a tethered jailbreak but now
we're<00:01:05.850> confirmed<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.080> work<00:01:07.110> for

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
we're confirmed that it will work for

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
we're confirmed that it will work for
the<00:01:07.560> a4<00:01:07.860> chip<00:01:08.150> untethered<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.810> still<00:01:10.020> but

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the a4 chip untethered but we still but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.830 
the a4 chip untethered but we still but
like<00:01:10.590> i<00:01:10.680> said<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.070> no<00:01:11.220> word<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.840> what

like i said we have no word as to what
other<00:01:12.990> devices<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.530> work<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> bit<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.130> work

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
other devices to work for a bit of work

other devices to work for a bit of work
for<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.729> day<00:01:15.270> 5<00:01:15.600> &amp;<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.110> 5<00:01:16.290> X<00:01:16.470> chip<00:01:16.740> um<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.220> guess

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
for the day 5 &amp; a 5 X chip um I guess

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.890 
for the day 5 &amp; a 5 X chip um I guess
for<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> ET<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.119> jailbreak<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.720> gonna

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
for the ET and this jailbreak is gonna

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
for the ET and this jailbreak is gonna
be<00:01:19.049> about<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.290> week<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:20.189> within<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.939> week<00:01:21.090> it

could still be a while yet I don't know

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890 
could still be a while yet I don't know
how<00:01:23.640> long<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.240> he<00:01:24.689> said<00:01:24.869> a

how long it's going to be he said a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960 
how long it's going to be he said a
while<00:01:25.080> it'd<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> month<00:01:25.950> or<00:01:26.100> two<00:01:26.130> months<00:01:26.280> but

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
while it'd be a month or two months but

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.310 
while it'd be a month or two months but
because<00:01:27.330> he's<00:01:27.479> already<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.810> Joe<00:01:27.990> Brooklyn

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
because he's already got Joe Brooklyn

because he's already got Joe Brooklyn
I'm<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:29.460> within<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.119> week<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.470> could

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
I'm gonna say within a week but it could

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.719 
I'm gonna say within a week but it could
be<00:01:31.740> longer<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.369> don't<00:01:32.490> comment

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
be longer than that so don't comment

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.789 
be longer than that so don't comment
that's<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.450> ta<00:01:33.720> he<00:01:33.990> never<00:01:34.170> gave<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.530> ETA

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
that's just my ta he never gave an ETA

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.640 
that's just my ta he never gave an ETA
that's<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:37.110> amount<00:01:37.590> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that's just what I think the amount of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980 
that's just what I think the amount of
time<00:01:37.829> it'll<00:01:38.100> take<00:01:38.189> before<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.850> released<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
time it'll take before it's released to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
time it'll take before it's released to
the<00:01:40.229> public<00:01:40.619> but<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> guys<00:01:41.700> that's

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
the public but that is it guys that's

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.490 
the public but that is it guys that's
just<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> quick<00:01:42.479> update<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.320> want<00:01:43.470> to
