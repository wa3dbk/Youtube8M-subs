00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.180
 Hi guys, how are you and here 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.240
 we are in minecraft in rebuilding 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.219
 my world 1 but this time to give you the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.020
 map yes guys I will share the map 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 in the description will appear as 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.519
 sure in the link so you can 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 download link is by thrombus 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:24.599
 those who do not know then the truth 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.490
 it's very interesting is a very page 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.189
 interesting in which you create a disc 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.689
 hard virtual and you can share files 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.120
 with your friends who also have 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.399
 dropbox or even those who do not have it 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 also still if you have any problems 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.899
 you have the main dropbox page and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.850
 There, it tells you how to download it is very 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.670
 simple does not have any science 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 truth and the truth and the truth the truth 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 the truth and good guys it's worth it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.160
 You asked me a lot 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.780
 go see if I could share this world 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 and I think I'm going to share it because 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.100
 it really is your world is almost more 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.750
 you mine because it was made by 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.039
 you for all the subscribers that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.079
 They wanted to be part of this project 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.489
 has already started with the second season 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.500
 and when the new season ends 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 absolutely the same good as you see 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.430
 around here turning around so you can see 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.770
 the great constructions that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.509
 made 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.250
 and subscribers that were part of 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.840
 this first season yes with what 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.490
 I said I have started the second season 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.409
 I started it in an extra flat world 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 because as you see these mountains all 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.840
 these mountains that were already in shape 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.469
 natural in this map that the map was the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.039
 the seed was called - u and how was it 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.119
 minus 11 plus 1000 there I do not remember how 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.479
 exactly good guys at the 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.219
 description appeared then it was a motorcycle 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.569
 in a way that had some very mountains 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.329
 good very nice as you are seeing 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.470
 for here but to make constructions 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.869
 It really was a little messy because 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 because it reached the maximum height very 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.369
 very fast then I decided to do the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.229
 second season in an extra world 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.429
 you can see that I have two chapters on 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.679
 first that was the training and the 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.869
 second that I did it if I'm not wrong 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.759
 but before yesterday and well what I wanted 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.869
 comment is that the vote that ends 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.369
 also this season has also 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.750
 shared with you but good there 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.759
 there are lots of plots for all the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.659
 world can be part and the boy dayz 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.829
 has commented over time removes 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.200
 results that are apart from the 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.780
 constructions you see this is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.940
 a tutorial of what is a 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.000
 a gum dispenser as you see 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.860
 I give the lever and go down to this one 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.280
 fallen from that part of there what is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.780
 in this case a dynamite and a stone 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 a block of stone but you can not 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.400
 can do with whatever 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.819
 with the items that you want now 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.580
 yes in the tutorial of this how am I the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.800
 tutorial of this mechanism you have it in 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 my channel but good if we do not dismantle it 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.640
 there you see it then I have here my 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.860
 super house that is already here 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.140
 down that is also worth it because 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.400
 is not already you see here has a bed in 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 the top part and if you do not have much 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870
 but apart from down here is where I have 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.760
 recorded what are the tutorials of the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.500
 spell table that is in this area of 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.080
 Here you see that you're great and 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.130

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 part of here apart from having the portal 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.140
