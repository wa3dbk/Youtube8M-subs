00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 they could break in with the cheremisses on 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.490
 line d give there crazy damage 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.890
 pick your opponents and saw a lot 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.679
 webs work from unity also happens in general 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.929
 do not forget all you know 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.070
 good tactics these are usually those 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.710
 distant old railway trying to find with 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390
 bottom base either from the top base 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.660
 try to go through the eight as 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.490
 option this all can be to the ultimate 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.019
 so up trend trends but 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 sometimes just old proven 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.309
 some kind of tactic she just might well 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.130
 stop by because you can just forget 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.020
 we have seen it in many games 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.280
 was repeatedly in eSports but what 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.950
 do friends really start a fight 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.440
 map Himmelsdorf lower base at unity 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.730
 they know not the way good nehilo 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 Defe we ​​saw it and in 742 and 768 and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.020
 In general, in all the variations and the lower 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.760
 the upper base that's just as well very 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.590
 not bad on her guys from 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.820
 Team natus vincere remember 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 grand final in poland how many times 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.800
 here is virtus.pro 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.630
 f1 when na'vi played over defense then 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.100
 then everything was fine but slightly 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.350
 Time enough that what is happening in 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
 we already have 1 info card 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.340
 place a team with him 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.290
 banana and the nuclear whether but bulkin eat 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.060
 infa na'vi is an opportunity somehow 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.490
 tune out a counterattack 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.630
 either arrange something this very much 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.390
 time for na'vi right now everywhere is the suite 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.940
 let's light up what can come of it 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.160
 but oh, what a gap gave regina now 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.380
 like a sekirin yes very very experienced 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.240
 then he saw most of those and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.280
 na'vi commands so that it can 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.830
 happen in such a situation imagine 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.220
 that's where there is literally a centimeter 2 slightly 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.600
 a little bit left and everything and could in 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.640
 principle get up and leave the stage 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.619
 the fact that the score could become 20 issue on 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.170
 narita rhodes your mines chances 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.240
 not much but when 20 I think there already and 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.670
 hung they can ride first 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.380
 minutes of battle go yourself to attack do 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.509
 30 it would all be over 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.580
 Well five minutes and 30 seconds is very 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.290
 non-standard start himmelsdorf i 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.090
 generally foretold that the guys still 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.060
 will wait on the open cards where there 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.100
 more attack options but no 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.320
 unity will try on his movie 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.910
 maybe something come up and maybe it's 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.060
 it just means a scare moment 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.140
 us so that they do not go on the attack 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.579
 just tighten the time to open cards 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.140
 time I look but basically they wanted 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.730
 playing at nothing would n't just stand in 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.530
 your dev on the bottom base aku strike 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.530
 problems see what happens here before 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.150
 720p at the strike then flew into one who 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.250
 answer well, really, one shot of everything 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.799
 only and so far one shot ahead 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.110
 the unity command comes out and this is the first 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.590
 such and the dance of butterflies gray to already minus 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.410
 n n n 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.350
 let's start with the fact that this is already minus the bumpiness 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.660
 and this is m 50100 of which in general 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.180
 favorably blocking weaving which 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.010
 In general, if there is a df bottle, then it is there 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.570
 and decides everything but of course we can and 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.100
 in another way we play there it is just like 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.560
 then a little table situation when he got 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.570
 arson vs lanes in online part only 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.700
 on bam initially less than at least one of 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.379
 tanks he loses 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.190
 goal and then that structure won the duel 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.290
 she goes and destroys everything well, until the dream 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.090
 these are key tanks in general 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.980
 not arrangement in such a scheme then 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.290
 weaving 1 st second hand on the end 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 the main to leave the efficiency not to be substituted 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.540
 the beginning of the battle it has not begun here 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.760
 so well deluxe saw in light 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.610
 Rena saw from 3 which very so 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.069
 aggressively already under enemy base 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.380
 but here's the position principle here's the deluxe myself 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.230
 same copy was the same guys 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.760
 in my total dv at the top base and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.410
 In principle, they are well aware of all of him. 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.660
 strengths and weaknesses of course here 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.430
 need to somehow try to pull apart the trunks 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.579
 so that all the same when you're going out 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.079
 in the blood and not a lot of damage you got 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.750
 need to somehow loosen their opponents 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.010
 and it's not just super titled there 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.650
 super experienced navi 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.230
 but this is rarely a defense 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.390
 some special mainly here 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.700
 some schemes and the same 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.650
 deluxe location for example yes nothing 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.540
 some na'vi command techniques have seen the same 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.819
 strike then there is information that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.359
 she has an hour 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.670
 The principle is to fully understand what you can 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.160
 waiting from that techniques that have not seen and 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.989
 given the experience of the unity command, come in and 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.750
 hack this protection is possible but right there 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.639
 the question is how good 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.240
 are you ready navi and yet this ball 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:25.810
 which such departures reduced sight 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.490
 will not forgive this problem but so what 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.310
 periodically there highlighted Deluxe 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.260
 on again for a bunch but nothing else 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.460
 not yet happening yet of course 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.440
 However, no one but 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:41.320
 too early let's attack also not 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.850
 will try time a little picture bye 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.010
 we have 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.310
 Clear max note for mic see this 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.510
 round there is no fashion natali jaws kigan 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:55.210
 darin in the period from 10 to yes this is it but I 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.280
 can't see their shells just saw 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.940
 bent over 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.660
 don't worry we'll do well 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.220
 believe it 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.630
 or everything will be fixed so we look 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.530
 pressure some pokemon for 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.500
 closer, closer approaching so happens happens 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.540
 so oh well guys all 9 and 18 seconds 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.130
 here something is needed very soon 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.050
 probably the matter year bulkin there starts on 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.350
 t1 to my uncle suites is of course too 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.610
 very interesting battle 12 eat 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.800
 scouts first get 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.720
 the fence flew it by rail and 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.120
 dance forer someone had him a little 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.680
 send so much why ron 413 well 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.230
 Yes, more and more above average alpha then 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.240
 passed by a fraction but at least 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.270
 no fraud on him so here is such a 100 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.580
 eclipse doesn't give that light pretty 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.410
 Children continue and Tolik comes 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.750
 mood that blows a shot at the harp and 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:56.700
 Now who will beat the well 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:59.620
 Alpha Strike Alpha Strike wow 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.720
 there are alpha friends, well, let's see what 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.240
 it's over and here's a look at a fight 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.400
 probably more time left in the center 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.040
 in order to place them your tanks 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.320
 in defense for novelty no they try 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.660
 fight back on diode 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.530
 coupe to everyone who tries to step up a little 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.380
 closer to base 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.990
 but I do not know I do not know about the latter 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.180
 and because then my rub for now 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.930
 let's see the screen all lyutsinka lit on 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.090
 railway 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.500
 this is where guys should understand something 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.080
 from the na'vi team here and we understood 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:32.020
 idea unity pick there strike somehow 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.180
 my fears of soup are damage and gives but here to damage 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.440
 the buttercup is still surviving 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.260
 he can not take it of course 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.760
 the problem will flow out to failed in the same 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.760
 breathe you can lose two tanks 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.860
 gets 48 john doe navipower slide 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.630
 too for iso on there 423 if 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.540
 alpha blown out there only released 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.730
 cyrilloid 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.160
 can you let have eclipse eat t1 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.350
 which can save the gift of the course 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.300
 time is very short 6 seconds 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.320
 tanks are alive with only one loss 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.070
 na'vi was right now 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.580
 and everything is on it most likely this map and 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.080
 ends last 26 seconds 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.390
 another attempt from the unity team and 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.700
 another good damage performed by us 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.330
 the policy score policy so he peeks 

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.270
 it's just here 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:17.600
 50100 unity crew mare inflicted 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:20.810
 times three big about this this eclipse 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.610
 your leaving on the neck every such very 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.780
 greatly helps the human course without him 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:29.630
 it would be hard for a strike in Well 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.850
 feed on my side of the drive 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:35.720
 writes that karma to his country and this fight 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:38.650
 ends still account with us
