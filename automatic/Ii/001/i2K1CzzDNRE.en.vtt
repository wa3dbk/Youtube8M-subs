so I think as long as you're drinking

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.039 
so I think as long as you're drinking
like<00:01:42.990> normally<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:44.520> bladder<00:01:44.820> fills<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.570> so

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
like normally your bladder fills up so

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.730 
like normally your bladder fills up so
quickly<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.799> unbelievable<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.990> mean<00:01:49.530> I

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
quickly it's unbelievable so I mean I

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
quickly it's unbelievable so I mean I
remember<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.780> couple

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.340 
appointments ago I had to have quite a
few<00:01:53.759> ultrasounds<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:55.049> having

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
few ultrasounds because I was having

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.350 
few ultrasounds because I was having
some<00:01:55.700> complications<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:56.939> having<00:01:57.149> some

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
some complications that was having some

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.289 
some complications that was having some
bleeding<00:01:57.719> during<00:01:58.020> early<00:01:58.439> pregnancy<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.299> I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
bleeding during early pregnancy and I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.690 
bleeding during early pregnancy and I
doubted<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.409> example<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.159> then<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> doctor

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
doubted your example and then the doctor

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.190 
doubted your example and then the doctor
decided<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.329> he<00:02:03.540> wanted<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.110> an

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
decided that he wanted to do an

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200 
decided that he wanted to do an
ultrasound<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:05.369> worried<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.759> I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
ultrasound and I was worried that I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.080 
ultrasound and I was worried that I
didn't<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.079> any<00:02:07.920> urine<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.429> my<00:02:08.550> bladder<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
didn't have any urine in my bladder and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.390 
didn't have any urine in my bladder and
he<00:02:09.840> said<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:10.319> worry<00:02:10.470> your<00:02:10.800> bladder<00:02:11.039> fills

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
he said don't worry your bladder fills

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.010 
he said don't worry your bladder fills
up<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.790> quickly<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.300> there<00:02:12.720> was

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
up so quickly and there was

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.500 
up so quickly and there was
plenty<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.380> pee<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.770> there<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.270> as

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
plenty of pee in there so I think as

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.510 
plenty of pee in there so I think as
long<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.680> container<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.310> water

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
long as you have a container of water

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.250 
long as you have a container of water
with<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.180> you're<00:02:18.330> drinking<00:02:18.510> regularly

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
with you and you're drinking regularly

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740 
with you and you're drinking regularly
just<00:02:19.470> go<00:02:20.220> pee<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.730> right<00:02:21.060> before<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.570> get

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
just go pee like right before you get

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.490 
just go pee like right before you get
there<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:22.410> hopefully<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:25.050> know<00:02:25.200> since

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
there and then hopefully you know since

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.610 
there and then hopefully you know since
you're<00:02:25.710> keeping<00:02:26.130> up<00:02:26.280> your<00:02:26.430> fluid<00:02:26.820> intake<00:02:27.620> but

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you're keeping up your fluid intake but

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
you're keeping up your fluid intake but
hopefully<00:02:29.340> they're<00:02:29.520> not<00:02:29.760> backed<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:30.390> but<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
hopefully they're not backed up but the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.360 
hopefully they're not backed up but the
doctors<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.500> then<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.830> don't<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
doctors up is then you don't have to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.710 
doctors up is then you don't have to
wait<00:02:32.550> too<00:02:32.790> long<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.910> should<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.660> should

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
wait too long so it should be it should

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.540 
wait too long so it should be it should
be<00:02:36.930> fine<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.470> communicates<00:02:38.190> out<00:02:38.370> with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
be fine if you communicates out with

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.670 
be fine if you communicates out with
them<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.870> let<00:02:40.080> them<00:02:40.200> know<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.560> just

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680
