00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
as you can see right there is where the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.600 
as you can see right there is where the
the<00:02:34.610> bulb<00:02:35.540> is<00:02:35.720> located<00:02:36.230> with<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.830> infiniti

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
the bulb is located with the infiniti

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.000 
the bulb is located with the infiniti
cars<00:02:37.790> they<00:02:38.180> use<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> bi<00:02:38.750> xenon<00:02:39.230> which<00:02:39.500> means<00:02:39.800> two

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
cars they use a bi xenon which means two

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.190 
cars they use a bi xenon which means two
high<00:02:40.160> beam<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.640> low<00:02:40.790> beams<00:02:41.060> or<00:02:41.270> is<00:02:41.510> um

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
high beam and the low beams or is um

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.460 
high beam and the low beams or is um
using<00:02:42.830> one<00:02:43.220> bulb<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.240> that's<00:02:45.020> how<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.230> know

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
using one bulb so that's how you know

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.680 
using one bulb so that's how you know
that<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:47.120> headlight<00:02:47.450> bulb

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
that it's a the headlight bulb

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.110 
that it's a the headlight bulb
inspection<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.070> once<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.400> have<00:02:49.490> access<00:02:50.090> to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
inspection so once you have access to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.410 
inspection so once you have access to
the<00:02:50.510> bulb<00:02:50.780> right<00:02:51.050> here<00:02:51.640> you're<00:02:52.640> going<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.210> want

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
the bulb right here you're going to want

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.380 
the bulb right here you're going to want
to<00:02:53.630> turn<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.580> left<00:02:56.540> rotate<00:02:57.530> it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
to turn this to the left rotate it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.570 
to turn this to the left rotate it
counterclockwise<00:02:59.390> and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:01.010> they<00:03:01.190> will<00:03:01.340> pop

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
counterclockwise and then they will pop

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.970 
counterclockwise and then they will pop
open<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.060> says<00:03:02.270> right<00:03:02.570> there<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.830> arrow

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
open it says right there that the arrow

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.520 
open it says right there that the arrow
pointing<00:03:04.550> to<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> left<00:03:05.030> is<00:03:05.270> open<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.900> then

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
pointing to the left is open and then

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.180 
pointing to the left is open and then
pointing<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.400> right<00:03:07.610> is<00:03:08.140> close<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:09.500> I'm

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
pointing to the right is close so I'm

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.910 
pointing to the right is close so I'm
going<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.210> try<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.450> hold<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.110> camera<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.530> do

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
going to try to hold the camera and do

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.000 
going to try to hold the camera and do
at<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.160> same<00:03:13.340> time<00:03:14.020> so<00:03:15.020> right<00:03:15.140> there<00:03:15.470> wash

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
at the same time so right there wash

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
at the same time so right there wash
i'ma<00:03:16.310> rotate<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:16.940> left<00:03:18.640> right<00:03:19.640> like

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
i'ma rotate it to the left right like

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.120 
i'ma rotate it to the left right like
that<00:03:20.530> then<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.710> just<00:03:21.800> pops<00:03:22.160> out<00:03:22.990> there<00:03:24.130> that

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
that then it just pops out there that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.680 
that then it just pops out there that
little<00:03:25.430> silver<00:03:25.730> thing<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.270> there<00:03:26.480> that's

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
little silver thing right there that's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.670 
little silver thing right there that's
where<00:03:27.050> the<00:03:27.170> ballast<00:03:27.530> is<00:03:27.710> so<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.880> remove<00:03:29.180> that

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
where the ballast is so to remove that

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.700 
where the ballast is so to remove that
I'm<00:03:30.680> going<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:30.950> stick<00:03:31.220> my<00:03:31.250> hand<00:03:31.640> right<00:03:31.970> in<00:03:32.150> here

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
I'm going to stick my hand right in here

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.910 
I'm going to stick my hand right in here
hang<00:03:33.710> on<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.520> then<00:03:34.940> you<00:03:35.090> rotate<00:03:35.540> it

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
hang on to that and then you rotate it

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.650 
hang on to that and then you rotate it
to<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:36.950> left<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.610> it<00:03:38.060> will<00:03:38.240> just<00:03:38.420> come

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
to the left and it will just come

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.000 
to the left and it will just come
straight<00:03:38.990> out<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:40.010> once<00:03:40.220> you<00:03:40.400> rotate<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:41.000> just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
straight out so once you rotate it just

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.440 
straight out so once you rotate it just
pull<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.130> out<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:46.070> ballast<00:03:46.490> to

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
pull it out so this is the ballast to

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.970 
pull it out so this is the ballast to
the<00:03:47.480> HID<00:03:47.990> and<00:03:48.380> my<00:03:49.220> recommendation<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.980> make

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
the HID and my recommendation is make

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.000 
the HID and my recommendation is make
sure<00:03:52.160> that<00:03:52.430> your<00:03:52.640> car<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.090> cool<00:03:53.500> before<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.860> do

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
sure that your car is cool before you do

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.830 
sure that your car is cool before you do
this<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:55.459> make<00:03:55.670> sure<00:03:55.700> that<00:03:55.850> light<00:03:56.300> you<00:03:56.510> haven't

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
this so make sure that light you haven't

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.500 
this so make sure that light you haven't
been<00:03:56.959> using<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.440> the<00:03:58.220> HID<00:03:58.550> has<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.209> haven't

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
been using it the HID has it you haven't

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.270 
been using it the HID has it you haven't
been<00:03:59.570> using<00:03:59.810> it<00:04:00.080> before<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.740> change<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:01.130> out

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
been using it before you change it out

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.190 
been using it before you change it out
because<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:02.090> might<00:04:02.420> get<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.660> little<00:04:02.900> bit<00:04:02.990> hot<00:04:03.170> in

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
because it might get a little bit hot in

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.800 
because it might get a little bit hot in
there<00:04:03.500> as<00:04:03.680> remove<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.340> ballast<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.940> next

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
there as remove the ballast the next

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.270 
there as remove the ballast the next
thing<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.020> guys<00:04:06.170> are<00:04:06.320> going<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.530> do<00:04:06.740> is<00:04:06.980> you

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
thing you guys are going to do is you

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.949 
thing you guys are going to do is you
see<00:04:07.459> that<00:04:07.490> little<00:04:07.880> clip<00:04:08.270> right<00:04:08.450> there<00:04:08.510> a

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
see that little clip right there a

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.260 
see that little clip right there a
little<00:04:09.860> like<00:04:10.040> hook<00:04:10.310> right<00:04:10.490> there<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:11.060> there's

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
little like hook right there so there's

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.150 
little like hook right there so there's
one<00:04:11.570> on<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.959> other<00:04:12.080> side<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:12.920> can't

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
one on the other side to just I can't

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.730 
one on the other side to just I can't
get<00:04:13.310> my<00:04:13.430> camera<00:04:13.820> but<00:04:14.480> basically<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.350> pinch

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
get my camera but basically you pinch

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.510 
get my camera but basically you pinch
that<00:04:16.190> clip<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.709> bulb<00:04:18.980> will<00:04:19.130> come<00:04:19.340> out

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
that clip and the bulb will come out

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.280 
that clip and the bulb will come out
because<00:04:19.700> that's<00:04:19.850> what's<00:04:20.150> securing<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:21.049> bowl

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
because that's what's securing the bowl

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.680 
because that's what's securing the bowl
to<00:04:22.040> make<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.340> lock<00:04:22.580> in<00:04:22.760> place<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.300> it's<00:04:23.450> not

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
to make it lock in place and it's not

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.719 
to make it lock in place and it's not
going<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.960> move<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:24.140> you<00:04:24.320> basically<00:04:24.830> got<00:04:25.580> to

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
going to move so you basically got to

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.560 
going to move so you basically got to
flip<00:04:25.940> that<00:04:26.120> thing<00:04:26.180> up

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
there that is the most tricky part of

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.980 
there that is the most tricky part of
this<00:05:10.110> installation<00:05:11.540> alright<00:05:12.540> guys<00:05:12.720> so<00:05:12.930> now

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
this installation alright guys so now

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.250 
this installation alright guys so now
I'm<00:05:13.110> going<00:05:13.200> to<00:05:13.260> put<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.620> ballast<00:05:14.100> back<00:05:14.340> in<00:05:14.550> so

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
I'm going to put that ballast back in so

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.330 
I'm going to put that ballast back in so
remember<00:05:16.260> in<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.380> beginning<00:05:16.710> how<00:05:16.950> it<00:05:17.190> was

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
remember in the beginning how it was

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.690 
remember in the beginning how it was
tilted<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:17.970> left<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.660> little<00:05:18.840> bit<00:05:19.050> so<00:05:19.860> see<00:05:20.670> I

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
tilted to the left a little bit so see I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.820 
tilted to the left a little bit so see I
put<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.150> back<00:05:21.360> in<00:05:21.600> make<00:05:21.840> sure<00:05:21.870> the<00:05:22.020> flat<00:05:22.440> part

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
put it back in make sure the flat part

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.050 
put it back in make sure the flat part
is<00:05:23.300> you<00:05:24.300> know<00:05:24.420> on<00:05:24.660> top<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:26.220> wire<00:05:26.430> part<00:05:26.700> is<00:05:26.910> on

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
is you know on top the wire part is on

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.870 
is you know on top the wire part is on
top<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.920> basically<00:05:28.920> I<00:05:29.010> haven't<00:05:29.490> locked<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.790> in

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
top and basically I haven't locked it in

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.630 
top and basically I haven't locked it in
but<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.150> see<00:05:30.300> how<00:05:30.390> it's<00:05:30.540> tilting<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.170> the<00:05:31.260> left

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
but you see how it's tilting to the left

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.730 
but you see how it's tilting to the left
and<00:05:32.640> then<00:05:32.970> all<00:05:33.090> you<00:05:33.180> have<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.390> do<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.780> push<00:05:34.710> it

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
and then all you have to do is push it

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.960 
and then all you have to do is push it
in<00:05:35.040> and<00:05:35.660> turn<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.530> right<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:38.040> then<00:05:38.850> you

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
in and turn it to the right and then you

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.600 
in and turn it to the right and then you
should<00:05:39.060> hear<00:05:39.300> like<00:05:39.480> a<00:05:39.510> click<00:05:39.960> ok<00:05:40.800> so<00:05:40.860> once<00:05:41.430> you

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
should hear like a click ok so once you

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.450 
should hear like a click ok so once you
have<00:05:41.760> that<00:05:42.120> balance<00:05:42.960> back<00:05:43.350> into<00:05:43.800> the<00:05:44.130> lock

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
have that balance back into the lock

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.310 
have that balance back into the lock
blocking<00:05:45.300> position<00:05:45.720> everything's<00:05:46.110> all

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
blocking position everything's all

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.000 
blocking position everything's all
secure<00:05:46.770> last<00:05:47.640> thing<00:05:47.850> is<00:05:47.940> to<00:05:48.060> put<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.480> on<00:05:49.010> the

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
secure last thing is to put that on the

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.160 
secure last thing is to put that on the
cover<00:05:50.220> back<00:05:50.520> on<00:05:50.700> so<00:05:51.180> once<00:05:51.390> you<00:05:51.510> put<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.900> cap

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.170 
cover back on so once you put that cap

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.090 
cover back on so once you put that cap
back<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.820> you<00:05:53.820> want<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.210> rotate<00:05:54.630> it<00:05:55.040> to<00:05:56.040> the

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
back on you want to rotate it to the

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.610 
back on you want to rotate it to the
right<00:05:57.890> and<00:05:58.890> now<00:05:59.160> it's<00:05:59.460> locked<00:05:59.940> into<00:06:00.180> place

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
right and now it's locked into place

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.230 
right and now it's locked into place
like<00:06:01.620> just<00:06:02.280> check<00:06:02.490> to<00:06:02.520> see<00:06:02.670> if<00:06:02.790> it's<00:06:02.940> secure

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
like just check to see if it's secure

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.210 
like just check to see if it's secure
yet<00:06:03.360> so<00:06:03.630> it's<00:06:03.780> locked<00:06:04.050> we<00:06:04.230> should<00:06:04.470> see<00:06:04.620> left<00:06:05.010> is

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
yet so it's locked we should see left is

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.440 
yet so it's locked we should see left is
open<00:06:05.870> right<00:06:06.870> is<00:06:07.250> lock<00:06:08.250> so<00:06:08.550> that<00:06:08.760> is<00:06:09.030> pretty

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.450 
open right is lock so that is pretty

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.110 
open right is lock so that is pretty
much<00:06:09.720> it<00:06:10.040> now<00:06:11.040> you<00:06:11.100> need<00:06:11.370> to<00:06:11.520> do<00:06:11.640> is<00:06:11.760> just<00:06:11.880> put

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
much it now you need to do is just put

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.900 
much it now you need to do is just put
back<00:06:12.330> these<00:06:12.570> tabs<00:06:13.010> which<00:06:14.010> is<00:06:14.250> really<00:06:14.880> easy

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
back these tabs which is really easy

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.020 
back these tabs which is really easy
those<00:06:15.390> three<00:06:15.750> little<00:06:16.100> taps<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.430> that's<00:06:17.670> it<00:06:17.880> so

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
those three little taps and that's it so

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.560 
those three little taps and that's it so
you<00:06:18.090> repeat<00:06:18.540> the<00:06:18.750> same<00:06:18.930> process<00:06:19.200> to<00:06:19.680> the<00:06:20.570> to

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
you repeat the same process to the to

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.350 
you repeat the same process to the to
the<00:06:21.720> passenger's<00:06:22.590> side<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.220> will<00:06:23.400> work<00:06:23.670> so

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
the passenger's side and it will work so

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.450 
the passenger's side and it will work so
