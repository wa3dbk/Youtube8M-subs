 everyone at some time of the year we notice 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.399
 that our hair falls a little bit 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.610
 more than the truth, this is something 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.110

 so well I'll show you some 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.000
 of the foods that I like the most 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.690
 to prevent 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.690
 hair loss 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.079
 sentence 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.589
 all right 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.199
 On the one hand we have here a series of 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.960
 things that I found by the pantry and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.450
 which are very good for hair in 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.420
 first place we have oats flakes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 of oatmeal according oats apart from 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 be great in vitamin B that contains 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.409
 a lot of magnesium that is critical to 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.420
 the hair according to second place 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.850
 we have the canons the canons 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.720
 they also have a lot of minerals 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.170
 very beneficial for the skin and for the 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.990
 hair 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.250
 here we have this is this green of 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.509
 agreement is all the steps that go best 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.770
 Ezeiza accustomed to seeing green tea 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.679
 in pure green tea bags 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.750
 well the processed in this way that is 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.329
 who bought it this way and in 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.740
 pills all this is one of the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.590
 varieties that you can find from tea 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 green green tea what it does is apart 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.159
 of all the antioxidants that have 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.549
 which it is very good for the skin because 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.549
 apart from green tea it reduces an enzyme 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.590
 which is alpha 5 reductase which is the 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.200
 responsible for the hair falling out of 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.420
 agreement is responsible for preventing 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.229
 nutrients arrive from the follicle 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.569
 hairy 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.120
 green tea is highly recommended 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.590
 On the other hand we have horsetail 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.629
 which is also a plant that has 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.110
 many, many, many properties for 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.730
 the hair many minerals 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.490
 and the brewer's yeast that is 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
 fundamental for the hair because it is 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.500
 fundamental brewer's yeast part 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.840
 of all minerals and magnesium 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.900
 we have seen that he had oats 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.360
 a cutaneous disinfectant will kill 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
 any small skin infection that 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.069
 we can have on the skin of the leather 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.799
 scalp and so on 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.349
 good that I have here is a glass of water 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.150
 many people come to me with a lot of 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.020
 problems and the first thing I ask them 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.500
 is if they drink water 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.720
 Many tell me that I do not have cramps and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.600
 how much water babies per day, sometimes not 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.480
 I take a glass and drink a coffee one 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.730
 cocacola at mealtime and then a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.230
 glass of milk before going to bed is 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.370
 crazy is that the body 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.080
 you need water for everyone 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.670
 hair for example is one of the things 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.360
 that you can fall a lot if we do not see 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.879
 enough water to be well 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.310
 hydrated our body works 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.830
 mostly with water is the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.470
 star element the vital element that 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.930
 we need to avoid any 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.090
 problem that we may have or that a 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.129
 liter and a half two liters of water you should 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.290
 drink those spread out during the day very 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.150
 important 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.400
 what foods would be missing here for the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.379
 hair that I have not found in the kitchen 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.900
 for good food rich in omega 3 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.090
 they are also very good blue fish 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.959
 the omega 3 is very good for the hair 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.519
 the alfalfa sprouts and there are good 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.409
 many foods as I say 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.400
 agreement that they are the ones I found found 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.189
 moment and that they will go very well in case 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.480
 that you can not buy so many 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.280
 You can not consume food 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.750
 let's say our diet all these 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.540
 food because you spend a lot of time 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.909
 So I recommend that you 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.400
 buy a vitamin containing 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.989
 all generals and everything 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.590
 let's say all the vitamins and minerals 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.100
 that the hair needs me in its day I bought 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.650
 this green synergy formula anti fall 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.509
 that what he does apart from training the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.560

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.479
 Strengthens and regulates fat levels 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.370

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.259
 and the truth is that it is very very 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.870

 hair loss remember that it is 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.759
 something normal in some stations of 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:20.500
 year and neither do you have to be stressed 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:24.370
 that yes you have to put an attack plan 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.820
