 sprechers immediately an atom is from the kommst 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 Then separate at three masks change 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.939

 a crash in the moment in the metal will be like that 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.349
 a lot of searching that you always have a goal 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:58.260
 to throw away a bth the stronger 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:58.260
 engine drops immediately the field could too 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:10.530
 especially from the game often 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:14.199
 can be more important than destroy 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.139
 Frank rust comes to the matchup 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:21.250
 but all is what is not so hot 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.290

 and clean is when the crime already 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.870
 Everything remained from the players on the 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:43.060

 doblo the map in the way on the wall 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.269
 Playing such effects will make a return 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:55.840
 discarded and a walking 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.500

 an exit it I would still two it 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:10.599
 play but as I said comes to stake out 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.199
 the game table I do not know then 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.389
 shoots an angel around in the lake games 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:18.779
 Cemetery to recycle and its critics 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.120

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:24.700
