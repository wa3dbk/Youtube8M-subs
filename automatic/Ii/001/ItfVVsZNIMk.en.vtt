00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.220
 but what Kruiswijk is starting tonight is the basis at kdo sc heerenveen fc emmen 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.449

 the two knew a cross from crucial mars inc and that's it in such a hunt 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.599

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.599
 for the young sc heerenveen 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.920
 what the points can use well because the first competition duels went 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.770

 in the island of ivory 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.640
 young helmond sport it's hard to see if Kruiswijk FC is doing anything 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 but the penalty is there for the visitors 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.770
 so behind the ball city that red duke 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.690
 and that sends goalkeepers defrance valverde wrong in zellik after 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.460
 eleven with the player both teams are equal again on the contrary 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 heerenveen is the better team in the first half 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.250
 so narsingh you know if a good combination is again one next to ing 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.730
 na and so on huntink 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.910
 at the robbery gate comes to under the ball by showing great opportunity 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.710
 heerenveen 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.610
 but no hit 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.080
 roorda alpine stage narsingh racing is the most dangerous man at heerenveen in the 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.080
 first half the cross from narsingh the bar at a johnstone 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.430
 and he can tap the ball in two minutes before the break but an excellent one 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.390
 rescue of boats from the fed a confrontation 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.880
 we are going to calm both teams with an instant 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.369
 in the second half arnold Kruiswijk holds a suspension and becomes 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.460
 replaced by Jeffrey Gouweleeuw 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.930
 and early in the second half huge chance that luc chatel buissink on 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.370
 indicate a beautiful ball from Bradley Cooper 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.750
 but since he unfortunately hit the ball next to the goal 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.750
 but heerenveen starts well in the second half 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.000
 so again rico wolves with a ball on narsingh 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.319
 the action starts father adventure 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.599
 lost an opponent 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.369
 but not really tackled 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 and in that the second opponent loses to the action of narsingh 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:25.309
 does he have an overview of what he has ever had 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:30.539
 and that ended well it is two a for Heerenveen film the 51st minute 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.609
 type of errors of a pebble contribute so the number then tick 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.469
 and so the deserved lead for young Heerenveen with continues 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.989
 again narsingh is sent away a lot of danger from him also in the second half 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.339
 raid place 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:47.719
 have to make these balls refuses 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.769
 but sneak up 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.759
 incomprehensible manner 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.159
 the final stop itself already that he knows that he is the 3rd and the possible decision on 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:57.459
 The shoesize 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.629
 Then you go helmond sport in the chase through the neighborhood already a punishment 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.249
 is wrong 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.859
 and I don't really have the ball out of here two 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.419
 the counter that the ball's input can be protruding header from the fire 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.189
 in camps 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.419
 just like that 2 to 2 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.779
 heerenveen is much better in the second half giving some chance away 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.119
 and then the first option is the right one for young helmond sport 2 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:22.989
 against 2 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.989
 And so Heerenveen has to look for the lead again 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.849
 I have young helmond sports the ball just away 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.109

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:33.549

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.939
 so by accident for the feet of fall thorens thus officially completed 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.019

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.429
 3 2 for young heerenveen 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.429
 in the 69th minute 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.229
 and then Heerenveen passes by is president of dico bol of the header of 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.379
