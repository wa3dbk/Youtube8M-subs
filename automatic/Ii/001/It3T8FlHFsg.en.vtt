00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
later than those Springs oh we got a

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:33.660 
later than those Springs oh we got a
little<00:02:11.680> ding<00:02:11.860> edge<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.190> one<00:02:33.489> with

skill avoid warranty
well<00:02:56.230> Ben<00:02:56.530> yeah<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.670> that's<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.120> alumina<00:02:58.630> and

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.030 

should<00:03:03.100> be

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:15.959 

should<00:03:09.040> be<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.579> a<00:03:09.760> five-point<00:03:10.689> I<00:03:14.909> don't<00:03:15.909> know

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:15.969 
should be like a five-point I don't know

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.670 
should be like a five-point I don't know
where<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:16.389> but<00:03:16.599> I'll<00:03:16.749> figure<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.260> out<00:03:17.439> where

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
where it is but I'll figure it out where

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.819 
where it is but I'll figure it out where
the<00:03:18.159> adjustability<00:03:18.760> is<00:03:19.060> on<00:03:19.329> this<00:03:19.510> thing<00:03:21.209> but

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
the adjustability is on this thing but

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:37.500 
the adjustability is on this thing but
yeah<00:03:23.829> so<00:03:24.099> there's<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.489> one<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:35.819> then<00:03:36.819> Cu

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
yeah so there's that one and then Cu

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:50.390 
yeah so there's that one and then Cu
Springs<00:03:45.689> yeah<00:03:46.689> so<00:03:47.019> we've<00:03:47.169> got<00:03:47.439> some<00:03:48.310> Springs<00:03:48.819> I

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
Springs yeah so we've got some Springs I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.649 
Springs yeah so we've got some Springs I
guess<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.609> one's<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.879> front<00:03:52.239> one<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:52.419> this

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
guess that one's the front one and this

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.689 
guess that one's the front one and this
is<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.049> rear<00:03:53.319> or<00:03:53.680> maybe<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:54.069> could<00:03:54.400> be<00:03:54.430> all<00:03:54.669> the

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
is the rear or maybe it could be all the

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.429 
is the rear or maybe it could be all the
way<00:03:54.849> around

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.640 

take<00:03:59.439> that<00:03:59.560> ones<00:03:59.769> are<00:03:59.980> here

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.009 

looks<00:04:04.400> like<00:04:04.580> we've<00:04:04.790> got<00:04:05.000> four<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.569> there<00:04:05.890> so

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
looks like we've got four in there so

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.380 
looks like we've got four in there so
that's<00:04:09.019> what<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:09.379> have<00:04:09.620> I'm<00:04:10.519> gonna<00:04:11.090> probably

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
that's what we have I'm gonna probably

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.689 
that's what we have I'm gonna probably
install<00:04:11.900> this<00:04:13.000> later<00:04:14.000> this<00:04:14.209> week<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:15.110> it's

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:15.699 
install this later this week so it's

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:21.549 
install this later this week so it's
gonna<00:04:16.699> look<00:04:16.940> nice<00:04:17.859> it's<00:04:18.859> sweet
