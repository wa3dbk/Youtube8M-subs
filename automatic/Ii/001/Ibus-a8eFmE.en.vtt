it's a sharp display although it has a
glossy<00:01:03.090> display<00:01:03.420> right<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:07.400> we're<00:01:08.400> just

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
glossy display right here and we're just

taking a quick look around as you can
see<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> LEDs<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.250> pretty<00:01:11.760> light<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:13.320> my

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
see the LEDs are pretty light I for my

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.810 
see the LEDs are pretty light I for my
part<00:01:13.530> find<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.520> pretty<00:01:14.729> bothering<00:01:15.390> actually

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
part find that pretty bothering actually

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.859 
part find that pretty bothering actually
because<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.939> I'm<00:01:18.090> looking<00:01:18.360> at<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> screen<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
because if I'm looking at the screen and

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.660 
because if I'm looking at the screen and
the<00:01:19.259> LEDs<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.799> brighter<00:01:20.130> than<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> screen

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the LEDs are brighter than the screen

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
the LEDs are brighter than the screen
itself<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.360> not<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.320> good<00:01:23.930> well<00:01:24.930> let's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
itself that's not too good well let's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.610 
itself that's not too good well let's
take<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> quick<00:01:25.799> look<00:01:25.890> around

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
take a quick look around

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.990 
take a quick look around
as<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.280> said<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.700> has<00:01:28.730> a<00:01:29.050> 10.1<00:01:30.050> inch<00:01:30.080> display

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
as I said it has a 10.1 inch display

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.660 
as I said it has a 10.1 inch display
with<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.030> high<00:01:32.210> resolution<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.520> there<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.640> a

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
with a high resolution and there is a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.640 
with a high resolution and there is a
chiclet<00:01:35.030> keyboard<00:01:35.570> that's<00:01:35.840> actually<00:01:36.470> pretty

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
chiclet keyboard that's actually pretty

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.940 
chiclet keyboard that's actually pretty
nice<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:37.070> type<00:01:37.250> on<00:01:37.720> feels<00:01:38.720> a<00:01:38.930> little<00:01:39.680> bit

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
nice to type on feels a little bit

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.820 
nice to type on feels a little bit
flimsy<00:01:40.490> but<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.300> reaction<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.050> pressure

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
flimsy but the reaction and the pressure

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.230 
flimsy but the reaction and the pressure
points<00:01:43.640> are<00:01:43.760> pretty<00:01:44.660> good<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.760> keys<00:01:46.970> are<00:01:47.120> not

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
points are pretty good the keys are not

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.340 
points are pretty good the keys are not
entirely<00:01:47.600> flat<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.710> that<00:01:49.130> makes<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:50.290> easier<00:01:51.290> to

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
entirely flat so that makes it easier to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.450 
entirely flat so that makes it easier to
type<00:01:51.680> in<00:01:51.860> them<00:01:51.980> and<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.460> find<00:01:52.640> them<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:54.250> mean<00:01:55.250> all

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
type in them and to find them I mean all

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.760 
type in them and to find them I mean all
the<00:01:55.580> other<00:01:56.020> netbooks<00:01:57.020> with<00:01:57.410> chiclet

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
the other netbooks with chiclet

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.520 
the other netbooks with chiclet
keyboards<00:02:00.100> are<00:02:01.240> pretty<00:02:02.240> typable<00:02:02.990> too<00:02:03.260> but

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
keyboards are pretty typable too but

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.280 
keyboards are pretty typable too but
this<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.100> right<00:02:04.850> here<00:02:05.120> with<00:02:05.540> its<00:02:05.720> curved

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
this one right here with its curved

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.190 
this one right here with its curved
surfaces<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:08.720> even<00:02:09.050> nicer<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.470> use<00:02:10.030> um<00:02:11.200> this

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
surfaces is even nicer to use um this

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.080 
surfaces is even nicer to use um this
device<00:02:12.500> right<00:02:12.650> here<00:02:13.660> has<00:02:14.660> one<00:02:15.230> gig<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.440> RAM<00:02:16.090> 160

gig<00:02:17.600> hard<00:02:17.810> drive<00:02:18.460> there's<00:02:19.460> n<00:02:19.820> Wi-Fi<00:02:20.030> in<00:02:20.450> there

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
gig hard drive there's n Wi-Fi in there

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.930 
gig hard drive there's n Wi-Fi in there
and<00:02:23.710> there's<00:02:24.710> a<00:02:24.770> model<00:02:25.100> available<00:02:25.310> with<00:02:25.910> a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
and there's a model available with a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.520 
and there's a model available with a
touchscreen<00:02:26.210> this<00:02:26.630> one<00:02:26.840> right<00:02:26.960> here<00:02:27.170> doesn't

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
touchscreen this one right here doesn't

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.390 
touchscreen this one right here doesn't
have<00:02:27.680> touch<00:02:29.110> alright<00:02:30.110> let's<00:02:30.860> take<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.100> look<00:02:31.250> at

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
have touch alright let's take a look at

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.290 
have touch alright let's take a look at
the<00:02:31.520> inside<00:02:31.850> first<00:02:32.230> up<00:02:33.230> here<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.430> tiny

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
the inside first up here we have a tiny

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.570 
the inside first up here we have a tiny
webcam<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:36.410> resolution<00:02:36.950> shouldn't<00:02:37.370> be<00:02:37.430> too

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
webcam the resolution shouldn't be too

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.080 
webcam the resolution shouldn't be too
high<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.790> guess<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.420> 0.3<00:02:39.140> megapixel

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
high I guess it's a 0.3 megapixel

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.630 
high I guess it's a 0.3 megapixel
there's<00:02:41.090> speakers<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> side<00:02:42.620> both<00:02:43.610> sides

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
there's speakers on the side both sides

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.270 
there's speakers on the side both sides
