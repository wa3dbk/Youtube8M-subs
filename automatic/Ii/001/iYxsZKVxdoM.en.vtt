00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
we've got activated so let's get a

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.120 
we've got activated so let's get a
tracing<00:00:50.100> paper<00:00:50.930> put<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> over<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.440> top<00:00:52.470> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
to the table and to the photocopy get

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
to the table and to the photocopy get
another<00:01:03.600> piece<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:06.840> then<00:01:06.960> we're<00:01:07.110> going

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
another piece there and then we're going

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
another piece there and then we're going
to<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.380> our<00:01:07.530> pencil<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> 5b

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to get our pencil now this is a 5b

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.959 
to get our pencil now this is a 5b
pencil<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.040> important<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.579> it's<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
pencil and it is important that it's a

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.090 
pencil and it is important that it's a
soft<00:01:12.299> pencil<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.439> graphite<00:01:13.890> will

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
soft pencil because the graphite will

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.749 
soft pencil because the graphite will
adir<00:01:14.429> easily<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.270> plate<00:01:15.710> okay<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.009> let's

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
adir easily to the plate okay so let's

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
adir easily to the plate okay so let's
go<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.729> use<00:01:20.909> any<00:01:21.179> design<00:01:21.749> from<00:01:22.140> any

so<00:01:37.619> we're<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:37.950> done<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:39.780> we're<00:01:39.899> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.079> take

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
so we're all done so we're going to take

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.219 
so we're all done so we're going to take
off<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.679> masking<00:01:41.249> tape

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.620 

and<00:01:45.560> now<00:01:46.549> what<00:01:46.759> we're<00:01:46.909> going<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.090> do<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.420> just

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and now what we're going to do is just

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.499 
and now what we're going to do is just
cut<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.259> size<00:01:48.799> because<00:01:49.369> it's<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.969> little<00:01:50.390> bit

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
cut this size because it's a little bit

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.690 
cut this size because it's a little bit
too<00:01:50.659> much<00:01:50.869> tracing<00:01:51.350> paper<00:01:51.469> feel<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.159> so

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
too much tracing paper feel with so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.389 
too much tracing paper feel with so
we're<00:01:52.820> going<00:01:52.939> to<00:01:53.030> cut<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.630> size<00:01:53.659> now<00:01:54.399> I'm

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
we're going to cut this to size now I'm

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.219 
we're going to cut this to size now I'm
just<00:01:55.640> going<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:55.969> cut<00:01:56.270> all<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:56.659> excess

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
just going to cut all this excess

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.249 
just going to cut all this excess
tracing<00:01:57.799> paper<00:01:57.950> off<00:01:58.369> there<00:01:58.700> as<00:01:59.600> we<00:01:59.810> don't<00:01:59.990> need

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
tracing paper off there as we don't need

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.930 
tracing paper off there as we don't need
it<00:02:00.469> okay<00:02:02.920> right<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.429> we've<00:02:05.060> got<00:02:05.270> our<00:02:05.420> tracing

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.789 

now<00:02:10.940> we're<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.269> to<00:02:11.330> get<00:02:11.630> some<00:02:11.840> scrap<00:02:12.230> paper

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
now we're going to get some scrap paper

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.100 
now we're going to get some scrap paper
and<00:02:13.099> we're<00:02:13.549> going<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.790> put<00:02:14.090> onto<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.690> reverse

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and we're going to put onto the reverse

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
and we're going to put onto the reverse
and<00:02:16.090> then<00:02:17.090> go<00:02:17.269> over<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.720> tracing<00:02:18.140> again<00:02:18.410> okay

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and then go over the tracing again okay

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.979 
and then go over the tracing again okay
so<00:02:19.190> we're<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:19.459> to<00:02:19.519> trace<00:02:19.910> over<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.630> design

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
so we're going to trace over the design

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.430 
so we're going to trace over the design
again<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:22.360> you<00:02:23.360> might<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:23.690> noticed<00:02:24.290> that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
again and you might have noticed that

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.199 
again and you might have noticed that
this<00:02:24.739> design<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.790> actually<00:02:26.530> symmetrical<00:02:27.530> and

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
this design is actually symmetrical and

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.940 
this design is actually symmetrical and
the<00:02:29.209> reason<00:02:29.599> it's<00:02:29.750> symmetrical<00:02:30.380> is<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.769> that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the reason it's symmetrical is so that

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.500 
the reason it's symmetrical is so that
we<00:02:31.069> could<00:02:31.220> trace<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.730> design<00:02:32.060> from<00:02:32.239> either

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
we could trace this design from either

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.339 
we could trace this design from either
side<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.500> see<00:02:33.709> what<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> mean<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.400> minute

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
side you see what I mean in a minute

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.990 
side you see what I mean in a minute
actually<00:02:36.349> I'm<00:02:36.829> going<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.099> just<00:02:37.310> cut<00:02:37.730> these

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
actually I'm going to just cut these

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.750 
actually I'm going to just cut these
ends<00:02:38.329> off<00:02:38.630> as<00:02:38.840> well<00:02:39.370> something's<00:02:40.370> going<00:02:40.579> to<00:02:40.610> be

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
ends off as well something's going to be

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.789 
ends off as well something's going to be
much<00:02:41.000> easier<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.750> work<00:02:41.959> with<00:02:42.019> when<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:42.620> go

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
much easier to work with when we go

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.160 
much easier to work with when we go
around<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.220> plate<00:02:44.290> okay<00:02:46.569> so<00:02:47.569> now<00:02:47.780> let's<00:02:47.959> get

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
around the plate okay so now let's get

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.309 
around the plate okay so now let's get
up<00:02:48.410> right<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.450> want<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> make<00:02:50.870> sure<00:02:51.079> this

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
up right and you want to make sure this

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.090 
up right and you want to make sure this
has<00:02:51.470> been<00:02:51.650> cleaned<00:02:52.010> beforehand<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.980> your

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
has been cleaned beforehand and get your

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.370 
has been cleaned beforehand and get your
little<00:02:55.280> bits<00:02:55.459> of<00:02:55.549> masking<00:02:56.120> tape<00:02:56.230> stick<00:02:57.230> them

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
little bits of masking tape stick them

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.550 
little bits of masking tape stick them
on<00:02:57.530> either<00:02:57.739> end<00:02:58.160> of<00:02:58.340> your<00:02:58.430> tracing<00:02:59.380> and<00:03:00.380> we're

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
on either end of your tracing and we're

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.750 
on either end of your tracing and we're
going<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.769> start<00:03:01.069> tracing<00:03:01.370> over<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.970> design

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
going to start tracing over the design

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.479 
going to start tracing over the design
we're<00:03:04.760> placing<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.600> just<00:03:05.950> under<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> centimeter

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
we're placing it just under a centimeter

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.620 
we're placing it just under a centimeter
from<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> edge

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.270 

so<00:03:13.630> press<00:03:13.900> quite<00:03:14.200> hard<00:03:14.500> as<00:03:14.680> you're<00:03:14.830> doing<00:03:15.160> this

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
so press quite hard as you're doing this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.040 
so press quite hard as you're doing this
and<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.580> graphite<00:03:15.970> will<00:03:16.180> transfer<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.690> your

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
and the graphite will transfer to your

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:26.140 
and the graphite will transfer to your
plate

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.830 

okay<00:03:27.150> there<00:03:27.510> we<00:03:27.630> go

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
okay there we go

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.890 
okay there we go
all<00:03:28.290> done<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.730> now<00:03:29.880> we're<00:03:30.090> done<00:03:30.270> tracing<00:03:30.780> we

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
all done so now we're done tracing we

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.750 
all done so now we're done tracing we
are<00:03:30.959> ready<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.380> apply<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> marabou<00:03:32.130> ceramic

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
are ready to apply the marabou ceramic

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.550

ceramic<00:03:34.950> ax<00:03:35.220> first<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:40.620> we're<00:03:40.770> going<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.010> fill

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
ceramic ax first and we're going to fill

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.270 
ceramic ax first and we're going to fill
in<00:03:41.550> all<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.030> large<00:03:42.390> details<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.650> all<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.100> kind

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.050 
in all the large details so all the kind
of<00:03:44.370> leaf<00:03:44.640> like<00:03:44.970> shapes<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:50.250> these<00:03:50.520> green

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
of leaf like shapes and these green

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:57.250 
of leaf like shapes and these green
paint<00:03:51.600> we're<00:03:51.810> gonna<00:03:51.900> do<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.500> really<00:03:52.950> simply

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.170 

and<00:03:58.260> even<00:03:58.590> though<00:03:58.800> you've<00:03:59.070> made<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> tracing

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
and even though you've made a tracing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.750 
and even though you've made a tracing
don't<00:04:00.810> worry<00:04:01.080> about<00:04:01.260> being<00:04:01.680> super<00:04:02.160> precise

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
don't worry about being super precise

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.940 
don't worry about being super precise
because<00:04:03.150> we<00:04:03.420> can<00:04:03.600> remove<00:04:03.959> these<00:04:04.410> outlines

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
because we can remove these outlines

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.300 
because we can remove these outlines
afterwards<00:04:09.470> right<00:04:10.470> so<00:04:10.800> we've<00:04:10.920> done<00:04:11.070> with<00:04:11.220> the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
afterwards right so we've done with the

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.990 
afterwards right so we've done with the

with this pattern you could do large

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.990 
with this pattern you could do large
plates<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.440> small<00:04:36.770> plates<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:37.550> your<00:04:37.640> bowls
