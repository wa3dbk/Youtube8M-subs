00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.189
 circuit where you will get a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.810
 more technology and has a turnover 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.760
 between the devices 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.260
 first they who want to do those there 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.060
 obvious that it was of what can be 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.650
 cleto said track any traffic 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.050
 aerobic activity for five minutes 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 moderate intensity when you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.590
 feels a legal comfort 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 ok we'll go to the exercise later 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.219
 of making leg press 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.110
 the mec intended to do a three series 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.110
 each of 30 seconds 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.010
 between these series in particular with 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.130
 abdominal exercises on the ground 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.880
 even three series of 30 seconds 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.170
 after that he wants to do if he's called boss 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.170
 ps3 series of 30 seconds 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:12.229
 alternating with the closed paddling 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.850
 37 of 30 seconds made a series 1 goes 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.229
 to the other to the second series in the other 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.000
 and so on 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.740
 these two training blocks we would 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.970
 do one more aerobic exercise 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.140
 treadmill bike transit any of these 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.540
 standard equipment b leza three 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.190
 there in the case of high intensity 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.259
 so do it faster than you 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.020

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.420
 alternating 33 series of 30 seconds between 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.090

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.710
 work the biceps that will be a thread 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.659

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 normal in France also three series of 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.070
