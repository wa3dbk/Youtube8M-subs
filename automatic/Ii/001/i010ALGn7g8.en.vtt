00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.980
 considered a leader in combat use 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 unmanned aerial vehicles over 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.540
 the middle east and africa and now 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.690
 US authorities allow their use 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.330
 over its own territory since 2004 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.090
 the cia carried out in Pakistan about 330

 blows however recently appeared new 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 problem after february in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.640
 the result of two blows dealt 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 unmanned vehicles in pakistani

 Islamabad expressed the US embassy 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.590
 officially protest but american 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.540
 officials said that washington is not 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.020
 struck no blows to the territory 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 Pakistan from January it turns out that the United States 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.500
 shift the responsibility on the air force 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.110
 pakistan so set who 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.030
 however struck these blows impossible however 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.280
 Some experts believe that the box 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.629
 pandora may soon be opened and then 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.219

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.219
 anonymous unmanned vehicles 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 drone anonymity 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.650
 becomes possible because this 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.080
 technology allows 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.930
 control being at a distance of a hundred 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.420
 often even thousands of kilometers this is one of 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.130
 the most destructive and dangerous consequences 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.290
 use of droneless 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.420
 I must say that the US authorities have become 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.520
 the main culprit spread 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 negative influences all over the planet 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 since the use of punches 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.520
 unmanned vehicles outside 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.670
 own boundaries began to be considered 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.920
 normal 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.140

 the president may order strikes 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.719
 to protect the country 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.369
