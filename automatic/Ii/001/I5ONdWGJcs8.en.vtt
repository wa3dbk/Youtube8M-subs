discussion especially targeting the new
nurse<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:06.330> medical<00:00:06.899> abbreviations<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.950> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
nurse with medical abbreviations in the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.339 
nurse with medical abbreviations in the
clinical<00:00:08.460> setting<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.780> part<00:00:10.080> one

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
clinical setting and this is part one

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.780 
clinical setting and this is part one
because<00:00:10.590> there's<00:00:10.920> quite<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> lot<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.580> talk

because there's quite a lot to talk

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.410 
because there's quite a lot to talk
about

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
about

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.160 
about
in<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.900> next<00:00:13.110> few<00:00:13.700> sessions<00:00:14.839> so<00:00:15.839> we're<00:00:15.990> going

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
in the next few sessions so we're going

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.810 
in the next few sessions so we're going
to<00:00:16.260> talk<00:00:16.500> about<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:17.070> we<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.369> see<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:17.760> are

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
to talk about here we can see there are

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.300 
to talk about here we can see there are
two<00:00:17.970> scenarios<00:00:18.240> one<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> ER<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.100> one

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
two scenarios one is in the ER and one

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.109 
two scenarios one is in the ER and one
is<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> ER<00:00:20.880> ah

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
is in the ER ah

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.109 
is in the ER ah
what<00:00:21.810> does<00:00:22.020> er<00:00:22.439> mean<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.980> emergency<00:00:23.640> room

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
what does er mean the emergency room

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.509 
what does er mean the emergency room
what<00:00:24.539> does<00:00:24.720> oh<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> mean<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.650> operating<00:00:26.279> room

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
what does oh I mean the operating room

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.089 
what does oh I mean the operating room
so<00:00:27.449> let's<00:00:27.480> proceed<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.650> next<00:00:28.800> clinical

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so let's proceed to the next clinical

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.830 
so let's proceed to the next clinical

and H stands for hemoglobin and
hematocrit<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.070> hemoglobin<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.299> is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
hematocrit the hemoglobin as we know is

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.080 
hematocrit the hemoglobin as we know is
if<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.799> low<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.400> means<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.939> you're

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
if it's low then it means that you're

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
if it's low then it means that you're
lacking<00:01:09.299> an<00:01:09.570> eye<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.840> red<00:01:10.020> blood<00:01:10.170> cells<00:01:10.650> not

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
lacking an eye on red blood cells not

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
lacking an eye on red blood cells not
very<00:01:11.189> good<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.580> carrying<00:01:11.820> oxygen<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
very good for carrying oxygen if you

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
very good for carrying oxygen if you
don't<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.799> enough<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
don't have enough and then the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.969 
don't have enough and then the
hematocrit<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> circulating

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
hematocrit is actually the circulating

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.450 
hematocrit is actually the circulating
volume<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.820> red<00:01:18.119> blood<00:01:18.330> cells<00:01:19.070> next<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.250> can

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
volume of red blood cells next we can

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.300 
volume of red blood cells next we can
see<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.299> doctor<00:01:21.540> ordered<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.590> unit<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
see that the doctor ordered one unit of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.140 
see that the doctor ordered one unit of
prbcs<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:25.229> means<00:01:25.590> he<00:01:25.830> ordered<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.580> unit<00:01:26.939> of

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
prbcs that means he ordered a unit of

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.810 
prbcs that means he ordered a unit of
packed<00:01:27.479> red<00:01:27.990> blood<00:01:28.020> cells<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:29.520> order<00:01:29.670> to

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
packed red blood cells in order to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
packed red blood cells in order to
complement<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> problem<00:01:31.200> which<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> low

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
complement the problem which is the low

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.719 
complement the problem which is the low
hemoglobin<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.310> even

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
hemoglobin and so we can see here even

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.030 
hemoglobin and so we can see here even
in<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.150> situation<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.439> number<00:01:37.860> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
in one situation the number of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.670 
in one situation the number of
abbreviations<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:40.110> used<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
abbreviations it can be used and this is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
abbreviations it can be used and this is
only<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.369> shortened<00:01:41.880> version<00:01:41.939> there

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
only you know a shortened version there

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.690 
only you know a shortened version there
are<00:01:42.780> always<00:01:43.049> abbreviations<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> important

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
are always abbreviations the important

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
are always abbreviations the important
thing<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.060> remember<00:01:45.649> whenever<00:01:46.649> an

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
thing is to remember whenever an

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
thing is to remember whenever an
abbreviation<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.759> used<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.329> correctly

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
abbreviation is used that it's correctly

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
abbreviation is used that it's correctly
interpreted<00:01:49.829> whether<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.280> me<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> doctor

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
interpreted whether it's me the doctor

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
interpreted whether it's me the doctor
who<00:01:51.060> wrote<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.450> or<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.530> there<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.829> a

who wrote it or you that there is a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.950 
who wrote it or you that there is a
correct<00:01:53.280> interpretation<00:01:53.689> because<00:01:54.689> remember

correct interpretation because remember
there's<00:01:55.350> always<00:01:55.530> room<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:55.920> error<00:01:56.630> next<00:01:57.630> we're

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
there's always room for error next we're

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.149 
there's always room for error next we're
going<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.110> on<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.409> another<00:01:58.500> clinical

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
EKG what does that mean

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.180 
EKG what does that mean
it's<00:04:01.060> an<00:04:01.680> electrocardiogram<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.160> a

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
it's an electrocardiogram and this is a

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.060 
it's an electrocardiogram and this is a
diagnostic<00:04:03.700> test<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.630> will<00:04:05.109> tell<00:04:05.350> if<00:04:05.650> he<00:04:05.829> has

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
diagnostic test that will tell if he has

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.610 
diagnostic test that will tell if he has
what<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.519> an<00:04:06.670> MI<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.570> what's<00:04:07.810> an<00:04:08.019> MI<00:04:08.380> a

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
what is an MI and what's an MI a

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.640 
what is an MI and what's an MI a
myocardial<00:04:09.070> infarction<00:04:09.750> which<00:04:10.750> in<00:04:10.930> itself<00:04:11.320> is

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
myocardial infarction which in itself is

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.620 
myocardial infarction which in itself is
death<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.609> part<00:04:12.910> of<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.150> heart<00:04:13.329> muscle

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
death of the part of the heart muscle

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.620 
death of the part of the heart muscle
which<00:04:14.079> makes<00:04:14.549> pumping

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
which makes pumping

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.120 
which makes pumping
blood<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.930> little<00:04:16.260> more<00:04:16.560> difficult<00:04:17.070> than

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
blood a little more difficult than

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.820 
blood a little more difficult than
normal<00:04:17.640> than<00:04:17.820> an<00:04:17.940> undamaged<00:04:18.420> heart<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:19.530> this

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
normal than an undamaged heart so this

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.680 
normal than an undamaged heart so this
is<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> beginning<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:21.000> hope<00:04:21.300> you<00:04:21.510> have

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
is just the beginning I hope you have

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.290 
is just the beginning I hope you have
benefited<00:04:22.050> from<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.710> have<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> great<00:04:23.610> day<00:04:23.970> and
