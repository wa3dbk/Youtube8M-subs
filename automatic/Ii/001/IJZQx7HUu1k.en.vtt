literally sitting on my head and it's

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.990 
literally sitting on my head and it's
fine<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.799> course<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.250> don't<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.700> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
fine now of course I don't have the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.259 
fine now of course I don't have the
amazing<00:03:06.660> audio<00:03:07.260> quality<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:07.890> had<00:03:08.069> before

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
amazing audio quality that I had before

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.370 
amazing audio quality that I had before
but<00:03:09.269> as<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.510> can<00:03:09.630> hopefully<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.140> it's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
but as you can hopefully here it's

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.610 
but as you can hopefully here it's
definitely<00:03:10.940> good<00:03:11.940> enough<00:03:12.200> what<00:03:13.200> did<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.350> put<00:03:13.530> up

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
definitely good enough what did I put up

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.729 
definitely good enough what did I put up
here<00:03:13.769> spartan<00:03:14.160> laser<00:03:14.190> now<00:03:14.580> rocket<00:03:15.060> launcher

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
here spartan laser now rocket launcher

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.720 
here spartan laser now rocket launcher
makes<00:03:16.739> sense<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.430> kind<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.640> like

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
makes sense because that's kind of like

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.229 
makes sense because that's kind of like
a<00:03:17.850> secret<00:03:18.090> location<00:03:19.670> just<00:03:20.670> go<00:03:20.880> around<00:03:20.970> here

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
a secret location just go around here

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
real quick then i'll probably wrap up
