00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.430 
at one point basically they did this to
enhance<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.860> reason<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.690> go<00:02:19.690> study<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.410> that

enhance the reason to go study in that
certain<00:02:20.770> place<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.190> why<00:02:21.340> girls<00:02:21.760> should<00:02:22.150> go

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
certain place so why girls should go

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.270 
certain place so why girls should go
study<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.319> certain<00:02:23.620> country<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> know

it<00:02:24.400> was<00:02:24.520> kind<00:02:24.760> of<00:02:24.790> an<00:02:24.940> incentive<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.020> guess

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it was kind of an incentive so I guess

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.720 
it was kind of an incentive so I guess
they're<00:02:26.620> doing<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.950> same<00:02:27.130> thing<00:02:27.340> for<00:02:27.370> males
