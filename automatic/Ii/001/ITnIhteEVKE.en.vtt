those are the quickest ways to get to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.600 
those are the quickest ways to get to
the<00:00:30.269> choice<00:00:30.720> doors<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.920> only<00:00:32.430> to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the choice doors it's like here only to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
strictly guards with goon this way did

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.690 
strictly guards with goon this way did
me<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.719> bandit<00:00:36.719> Royce<00:00:36.870> fluorescently<00:00:37.469> 18<00:00:38.460> of

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
me and bandit Royce fluorescently 18 of

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.940 
me and bandit Royce fluorescently 18 of
the<00:00:38.820> normal<00:00:39.149> time<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.930> also<00:00:40.379> try<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> show<00:00:40.890> you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the normal time and also try to show you

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.139 
the normal time and also try to show you
what<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> short<00:00:41.399> hallway<00:00:41.550> looks<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
what the short hallway looks like so you

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
what the short hallway looks like so you
can<00:00:42.270> identify<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.780> quickly<00:00:42.989> that's<00:00:43.800> not<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
can identify it quickly that's not it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.049 
can identify it quickly that's not it
then<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.410> short<00:00:46.649> hallway<00:00:47.059> very

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
then there we are the short hallway very

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
then there we are the short hallway very
short<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.500> can<00:00:49.620> very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
short so as you can see you can very

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
short so as you can see you can very
efficiently<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.270> two<00:00:51.449> rooms<00:00:51.660> since

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
efficiently get to the two rooms since

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.600 
efficiently get to the two rooms since
then<00:00:52.140> except<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> play<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> part<00:00:53.520> at

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
then except to play through this part at

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.569 
then except to play through this part at
least<00:00:53.640> once<00:00:54.530> here's<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> dome<00:00:56.039> which<00:00:56.370> mark

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
least once here's the dome which mark

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
least once here's the dome which mark
twice<00:00:56.940> actually<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.660> he'll<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
twice actually so he'll just do that and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.650 
twice actually so he'll just do that and
open<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> door<00:00:59.010> quick<00:00:59.250> then<00:01:00.090> next<00:01:00.329> thing<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
open the door quick then next thing you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
open the door quick then next thing you
want<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.129> is<00:01:03.710> for<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.890> section<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.790> done

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
want to do is for this section have done

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.179 
want to do is for this section have done
this<00:01:06.299> part<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.750> least<00:01:06.810> once<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.350> after

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this part at least once because after

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.920 
this part at least once because after
the<00:01:08.340> loading<00:01:08.610> screen<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.000> elevator<00:01:09.390> arrival

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the loading screen the elevator arrival

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
the loading screen the elevator arrival
will<00:01:10.080> be<00:01:10.200> much<00:01:10.380> faster<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.220> if<00:01:11.490> you've<00:01:11.820> done

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
will be much faster so if you've done

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480 
will be much faster so if you've done
this<00:01:12.180> elevator<00:01:12.630> arrival<00:01:13.170> section<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:14.159> won't

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
this elevator arrival section it won't

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.310 
this elevator arrival section it won't
