 and also sugar now what are we going to 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.160
 to do is to whiten 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:22.500
 and all or almost all of us know what it is 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.500
 the beat the butter with age 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.510
 once he has bleached we are going to 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.220
 incorporate the eggs and we will do one to 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.520
 one we put one first and now we're going to 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.520
 shake 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.610
 when this is already integrated we continue 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.740
 with the other 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.790
 there 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.790
 and we keep beating 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.130
 and we're also going to put the vanilla 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.049
 we follow latina 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 On the other hand we will prepare the color 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.880
 and we're going to do it with a glass of milk 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.670
 or a yogurt in this case is going to be a 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.130
 We had here to glass of milk 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.800
 move it well and we will be adding 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.500
 droplets of red color until obtaining the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.720
 desired color 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.080
 that will depend if you like more or less 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.630
 intense 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.140
 we return with the container of the eggs 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:29.710
 the sugar and all those little things and now 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.320
 yes let's start putting a little bit to 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.700
 little the mix we had made with a 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.650
 cocoa and flour and wrapping 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.650
 let's go integrating 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.710
 we will find a little bit of flour and 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.910
 cocoa and we will also put a trickle of 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.910
 milk with coloring 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.380
 we will put cocoa again 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.470
 and so we will do it until the end 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.890
 two things with milk and with flour and 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.890
 cocoa 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.910
 Well, this is the color 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.160
 I think it's going to be pretty little 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.080
 also tell you that I had forgotten 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.060
 put the teaspoon of baking soda 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.650
 I have also put him 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.389
 and how are so many things because we are 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.120
 forget one thing but good we have 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.550
 taken into account is already placed and 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.410
 now we are going to go to oil the 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.410
 the containers already put 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.540
 Well, here we have the container 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.680
 that we have already put the butter and 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.620
 we have put a little bit of flour to 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.800
 to be able to 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.860
 then demold well and we have also 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.470
 put the oven to 180 degrees and we're going 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.210
 to have once I put it here 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.910
 we'll put it in the oven and we'll have it 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.650
 a few will check how we say 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.750
 always with the tip of a knife 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.770
 a stick if it comes out clean will already be 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.139
 ready 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.020
 Well, here it is after having it 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.860
 about 40 minutes in the oven already as 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.300
 has said 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.770
 you have to click on it and when it comes out 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.270
 limpito if you see that you need 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.729
 Well, no 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.729
 it's a little bit more until it's not 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:12.729
 we have 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.710
 and now let's add the icing sugar 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.460
 as you see it because it had the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.460
 forgotten to buy 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.010
 and we will also incorporate 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.010
 the vanilla 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.380
 beating so you do not get off 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.689
 and now yes 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.689
 let's put the cheese 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.120
 I'm going to crush a little here 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.350
 this we have to integrate it in a way 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.890
 wrap so that the cream does not fall 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.890
 we will be putting 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.700
 we will integrate it 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.810
 well until we have it 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.810
 well dissolved 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.820
 now it touches the decoration part 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.570
 we have cut 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.570
 in 4 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.770
 more or less the same thickness 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.789
 we had done before the cream the 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:34.740
 cheese and sugar with vanilla already 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.919
 we had montadito and there the observer 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.320
 Well now let's take it, let's go 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:44.289
 put enough amount 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.720
 we will do with the layer 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:50.420
 3 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.420
 and then decorate as I like 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.770
 and now we are going to make beige we have 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.050
 three hats 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.050
 now let's put the last 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.510
 we will put everything 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.900
 and with this we will have finished 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.900
 our 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.480
 I hope you liked it
