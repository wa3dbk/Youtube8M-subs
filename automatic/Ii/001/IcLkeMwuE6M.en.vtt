we have to be on the ground it is a lot
but<00:03:58.049> probably<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.590> land<00:03:58.919> spot<00:03:59.220> tornado<00:03:59.609> at<00:03:59.790> this

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
but probably a land spot tornado at this

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.250 
but probably a land spot tornado at this
point<00:04:00.239> but<00:04:00.419> we<00:04:00.540> do<00:04:00.659> have<00:04:00.780> debris<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.230> the

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
ground and lots of rotation if you can

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.229 
ground and lots of rotation if you can
see<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.250> i<00:04:05.400> don't<00:04:05.609> know<00:04:05.699> if<00:04:05.790> that's<00:04:05.909> clear

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
see that i don't know if that's clear

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.119 
see that i don't know if that's clear
enough<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.780> feed<00:04:07.049> well<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.859> know<00:04:07.949> what

that's<00:04:15.090> on<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.449> ground<00:04:15.659> again<00:04:15.810> one<00:04:16.199> mile

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
that's on the ground again one mile

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.729 
that's on the ground again one mile
south<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:17.299> Interstate<00:04:18.299> 90<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.109> highway<00:04:19.409> 281

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
I'm going to put a viper here for just a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.050 
I'm going to put a viper here for just a
second<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.039> we<00:04:26.070> can<00:04:26.250> show<00:04:26.430> folks

little closer and this is where they are
this<00:04:33.300> location<00:04:33.870> right<00:04:34.169> here<00:04:34.230> which<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:34.919> just

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
this location right here which is just

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
this location right here which is just
again<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.360> mile<00:04:36.750> south<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.460> Interstate<00:04:38.460> 90<00:04:39.060> and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
again a mile south of Interstate 90 and

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330 
again a mile south of Interstate 90 and
this<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:39.990> interstate<00:04:40.320> 90<00:04:40.650> right<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.280> is

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
this is interstate 90 right here this is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.210 
this is interstate 90 right here this is
u.s.<00:04:41.850> highway<00:04:42.060> 281<00:04:42.750> right<00:04:43.139> here<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:44.070> this

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
u.s. highway 281 right here and so this

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.340 
u.s. highway 281 right here and so this
is<00:04:44.280> where<00:04:44.580> they're<00:04:44.760> located<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.750> tornado<00:04:46.139> is

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
is where they're located the tornado is

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.560 
is where they're located the tornado is
in<00:04:46.500> this<00:04:46.710> vicinity<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.820> tornado<00:04:48.030> is<00:04:48.300> actually

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
in this vicinity the tornado is actually

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:49.940 
in this vicinity the tornado is actually
right<00:04:48.810> over<00:04:48.840> here<00:04:49.440> because<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.710> believe

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
right over here because I believe

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.260 
right over here because I believe
they're<00:04:50.130> looking<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.639> northeast<00:04:51.060> they're

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
they're looking to the northeast they're

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.390 
they're looking to the northeast they're
west<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> storm<00:04:52.200> and<00:04:52.410> there<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.220> can<00:04:53.250> see

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
west of the storm and there you can see

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.750 
west of the storm and there you can see
