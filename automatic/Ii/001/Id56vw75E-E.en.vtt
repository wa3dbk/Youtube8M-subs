all this mod is a little bit buggy this
certainly<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:31.320> beta<00:01:31.590> phase<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.939> died

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
certainly in a beta phase so I have died

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.149 
certainly in a beta phase so I have died
a<00:01:33.240> couple<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.720> times<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.170> no<00:01:34.439> good<00:01:34.590> reason<00:01:34.650> I

a couple of times for no good reason I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.460 
a couple of times for no good reason I

ground if you're not careful that is
always<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.620> fear<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.780> we're<00:03:18.140> going<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.290> use<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
always a fear and we're going to use the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.560 
always a fear and we're going to use the
hand<00:03:18.830> brake<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.310> slow<00:03:19.550> down<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.060> then<00:03:20.450> we

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
hand brake here to slow down and then we

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.270 
hand brake here to slow down and then we
can<00:03:20.690> press<00:03:20.930> ENTER<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.820> dismount<00:03:22.820> as<00:03:23.120> well<00:03:24.280> or

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
can press ENTER to dismount as well or

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.650 
can press ENTER to dismount as well or
at<00:03:25.490> least<00:03:25.640> we're<00:03:25.760> trying<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> game<00:03:26.480> isn't

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
at least we're trying to the game isn't

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.110 
at least we're trying to the game isn't
letting<00:03:26.840> us<00:03:27.020> quite<00:03:27.230> yet<00:03:27.410> up<00:03:27.680> up<00:03:28.010> aha<00:03:28.760> here<00:03:29.000> we

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
letting us quite yet up up aha here we

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.910 
letting us quite yet up up aha here we
go<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.510> see<00:03:29.660> now<00:03:29.810> we<00:03:29.870> are<00:03:30.080> dismounted<00:03:30.709> the

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
go so you see now we are dismounted the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.630 
go so you see now we are dismounted the
airship<00:03:31.790> is<00:03:31.940> in<00:03:32.480> floating<00:03:33.140> position<00:03:33.830> and<00:03:34.100> it's

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
airship is in floating position and it's

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.770 
airship is in floating position and it's
actually<00:03:34.880> kind<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.060> fun<00:03:35.270> I<00:03:35.300> was<00:03:35.510> playing

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
actually kind of fun I was playing

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
actually kind of fun I was playing
around<00:03:35.870> with<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.380> earlier<00:03:37.340> today<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.000> was

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
around with this earlier today and I was

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.870 
around with this earlier today and I was
like<00:03:38.270> sniping<00:03:38.810> Giants<00:03:39.320> from<00:03:39.590> here<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.100> all

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
like sniping Giants from here and all

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.130 
like sniping Giants from here and all
that<00:03:41.060> good<00:03:41.209> business<00:03:41.480> I'm<00:03:41.600> trying<00:03:41.630> to<00:03:41.930> find

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
that good business I'm trying to find

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.360 
that good business I'm trying to find
something<00:03:42.380> I'll<00:03:42.560> look<00:03:42.740> at<00:03:42.890> this<00:03:43.010> here<00:03:43.250> we<00:03:43.340> go

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
something I'll look at this here we go

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.910 
something I'll look at this here we go
yeah<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.850> can<00:03:44.000> actually<00:03:44.170> do<00:03:45.170> some<00:03:45.410> sniping

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
yeah so you can actually do some sniping

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.310 
yeah so you can actually do some sniping
shots<00:03:46.730> from<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.180> airship<00:03:47.660> which<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.959> fun<00:03:48.140> the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
shots from the airship which is fun the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.870 
shots from the airship which is fun the
giant<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.680> course<00:03:48.860> has<00:03:48.980> no<00:03:49.130> idea<00:03:49.370> how<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.550> react

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
giant of course has no idea how to react

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.150 
giant of course has no idea how to react
to<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.150> he<00:03:50.390> has<00:03:51.050> never<00:03:51.230> seen<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> more<00:03:51.800> airship

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
to this he has never seen a more airship

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.500 
to this he has never seen a more airship
but<00:03:52.250> he's<00:03:52.400> just<00:03:52.520> gonna<00:03:52.640> run<00:03:52.880> he's<00:03:53.209> going<00:03:53.450> to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
but he's just gonna run he's going to

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.570 
but he's just gonna run he's going to
make<00:03:53.630> a<00:03:53.690> break<00:03:53.900> for<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.260> which<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:55.160> probably

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
make a break for it which is probably

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.100 
make a break for it which is probably
the<00:03:55.820> correct<00:03:56.060> decision<00:03:56.480> when<00:03:56.600> fireballs

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
the correct decision when fireballs

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.050 
the correct decision when fireballs
start<00:03:57.410> raining<00:03:57.740> from<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.950> sky<00:03:58.250> that's

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
start raining from the sky that's

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.120 
start raining from the sky that's
probably<00:03:59.360> a<00:03:59.540> time<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.230> get<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.650> hell<00:04:00.830> out<00:04:01.100> of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
probably a time to get the hell out of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.250 
probably a time to get the hell out of
Dodge<00:04:01.459> oh<00:04:01.760> that's<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.600> folks<00:04:02.780> I'm<00:04:03.050> going<00:04:03.200> to

buggy<00:04:11.810> sometimes<00:04:12.110> when<00:04:13.100> you<00:04:13.190> interact<00:04:13.430> with

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
buggy sometimes when you interact with

buggy sometimes when you interact with
the<00:04:13.790> steering<00:04:14.030> wheel<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.420> will<00:04:14.600> just<00:04:14.870> die<00:04:15.140> for

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the steering wheel you will just die for

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.680 
the steering wheel you will just die for
no<00:04:15.680> good<00:04:15.950> reason<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.910> make<00:04:17.060> sure<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.359> quick

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
no good reason so make sure you quick

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.940 
no good reason so make sure you quick
save<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:18.049> lot<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.500> all<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.770> good<00:04:18.890> stuff

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
save a lot and all that good stuff

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.219 
save a lot and all that good stuff
obviously<00:04:19.669> these<00:04:20.180> do<00:04:20.419> not<00:04:20.450> have<00:04:20.750> collision

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.000 
problem eventually the bottom acre will
get<00:04:26.630> everything<00:04:27.110> sorted<00:04:27.290> out<00:04:27.560> but<00:04:27.770> for<00:04:27.950> the
