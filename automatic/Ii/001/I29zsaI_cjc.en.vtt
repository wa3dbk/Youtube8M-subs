health<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.320> game<00:00:43.469> would

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
health you have because this game would

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.110 
health you have because this game would
is<00:00:43.710> not<00:00:43.890> available<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.340> private<00:00:44.730> match<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
is not available in private match so I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.490 
is not available in private match so I
couldn't<00:00:45.390> go<00:00:45.510> into<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.750> private<00:00:45.989> match<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
couldn't go into a private match and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.500 
couldn't go into a private match and
test<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.250> fully<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> was<00:00:48.300> messing

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
test it out fully but I was messing

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.670 
test it out fully but I was messing
around<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.840> some<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> weapons<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.590> I

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
around with some of the weapons and I

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.529 
around with some of the weapons and I
know<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> health<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.640> under<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> hundred

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
know that the health is under a hundred

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.010 
know that the health is under a hundred
and<00:00:51.750> forty<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.649> more<00:00:53.010> than<00:00:53.750> 126<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> think

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and forty but more than 126 so I think

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.889 
and forty but more than 126 so I think
you<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:56.010> around<00:00:56.250> 130<00:00:56.910> maybe<00:00:57.210> 135

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
you have like around 130 maybe 135

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
you have like around 130 maybe 135
health<00:00:58.260> something<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:59.039> whereas

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
health something like that whereas

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.910 
health something like that whereas
normally<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.079> hundred<00:01:01.410> health<00:01:01.710> so

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
normally you have a hundred health so

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.380 
normally you have a hundred health so
it's<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.129> thirty<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.640> thirty-five<00:01:03.059> percent

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's about thirty to thirty-five percent

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.780 
it's about thirty to thirty-five percent
more<00:01:03.750> difficult<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.680> kill<00:01:04.890> somebody<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
more difficult to kill somebody and to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090 
more difficult to kill somebody and to
be<00:01:05.970> killed<00:01:06.270> by<00:01:06.420> somebody<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.590> game<00:01:07.860> type

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
I'm really really enjoying this game
mode<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.840> cuz<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.680> most<00:01:40.890> weapons<00:01:41.159> in

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
mode you know cuz for most weapons in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
mode you know cuz for most weapons in
the<00:01:41.610> game<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:42.509> adding<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.590> two

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the game it's adding like one to two

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
the game it's adding like one to two
more<00:01:43.979> shots<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.030> somebody

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
more shots you have to get on somebody

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.819 
more shots you have to get on somebody
to<00:01:45.420> kill<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.869> obviously<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> makes<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to kill them so obviously that makes a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.340 
to kill them so obviously that makes a
big<00:01:47.100> difference<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:48.149> some<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> weapons

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
big difference but some of the weapons

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.530 
big difference but some of the weapons
in<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> game<00:01:49.740> aren't<00:01:50.159> affected<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.360> as
