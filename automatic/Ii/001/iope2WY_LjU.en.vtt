this<00:01:37.710> other<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> yourself

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
this other one and you think to yourself

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
this other one and you think to yourself
how<00:01:39.899> can<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.080> put<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> candle<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.890> one

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
how can I put a candle in that one

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.270 
how can I put a candle in that one
because<00:01:41.450> it's<00:01:42.450> just<00:01:43.440> been<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> roll<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.190> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
because it's just been a roll out of it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920 
because it's just been a roll out of it
but<00:01:44.580> when<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.820> looking<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.300> size<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.780> it

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
but when I was looking at the size of it

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.719 
but when I was looking at the size of it
went<00:01:46.500> ahead<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.649> put<00:01:46.800> the<00:01:46.890> berries<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.460> I'm

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
went ahead and put the berries in I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.990 
went ahead and put the berries in I'm
like<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.060> bet<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> jelly<00:01:49.920> jar<00:01:50.040> candle<00:01:50.820> will

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
like I bet that a jelly jar candle will

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.230 
like I bet that a jelly jar candle will
fit<00:01:51.210> perfectly<00:01:52.080> in<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:53.149> anything<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
fit perfectly in there anything so I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.889 
fit perfectly in there anything so I
love<00:01:57.240> how<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.450> my<00:01:57.720> turned<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:59.899> think

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
love how that my turned out and I think

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.710

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
that this turned out good I went ahead

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.389
