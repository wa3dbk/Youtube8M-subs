today<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.589> was<00:00:07.950> thinking<00:00:08.250> about<00:00:08.340> talking<00:00:08.730> about

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
today I was thinking about talking about

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.930 
today I was thinking about talking about
the<00:00:09.120> occasion<00:00:09.630> where<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.080> almost<00:00:10.559> burned<00:00:11.550> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
the occasion where I almost burned to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.030 
the occasion where I almost burned to
death<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.540> saying<00:00:13.200> burned<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.679> death<00:00:13.799> is

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
death and saying burned to death is

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.470 
death and saying burned to death is
maybe<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.400> over<00:00:14.820> exaggerated<00:00:15.299> because

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
maybe a little over exaggerated because

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.019 
maybe a little over exaggerated because
I<00:00:15.570> think<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.020> wasn't<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.650> totally<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.699> harm's

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I think I wasn't like totally in harm's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.429 
I think I wasn't like totally in harm's
way<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.539> was<00:00:18.630> still<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> pretty<00:00:19.109> scary

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
way but it was still a pretty scary

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.980 
way but it was still a pretty scary
experience<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.699> I'll<00:00:21.060> begin<00:00:21.270> my<00:00:21.420> story<00:00:21.750> by

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
experience so I'll begin my story by

and<00:03:31.290> my<00:03:31.410> friend<00:03:31.709> realizes<00:03:32.400> obviously<00:03:33.000> at<00:03:33.180> this

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and my friend realizes obviously at this

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.539 
and my friend realizes obviously at this
point<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.840> was<00:03:34.019> right<00:03:34.319> all<00:03:34.920> along<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.310> was

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
point that I was right all along I was

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.220 
point that I was right all along I was
right<00:03:35.819> not<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.420> setting<00:03:36.810> things<00:03:36.989> on<00:03:37.170> fire

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
right not to be setting things on fire

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
right not to be setting things on fire
in<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> desert<00:03:38.069> they<00:03:38.310> were<00:03:38.370> all<00:03:38.579> horribly

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
in the desert they were all horribly

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.990 
in the desert they were all horribly
wrong<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.980> it<00:03:40.980> didn't<00:03:41.280> matter<00:03:41.459> because<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
wrong and it didn't matter because the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.659 
wrong and it didn't matter because the
whole<00:03:42.180> mountain<00:03:42.690> was<00:03:43.049> in<00:03:43.200> flames<00:03:43.470> now<00:03:43.859> if<00:03:44.099> you

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
whole mountain was in flames now if you

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.159 
whole mountain was in flames now if you
know<00:03:44.940> Vegas<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.169> know<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.060> housings

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.169 
know Vegas you know that the housings

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.710 
know Vegas you know that the housings
are<00:03:49.169> separated<00:03:50.069> by<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> big<00:03:50.489> brick<00:03:50.849> wall<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.389> so

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
are separated by a big brick wall and so

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.150 
are separated by a big brick wall and so
on<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.989> other<00:03:52.019> side<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.470> big<00:03:52.709> brick<00:03:52.919> wall

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
on the other side of this big brick wall

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.159 
on the other side of this big brick wall
is<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.489> desert<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.030> in<00:03:54.389> the<00:03:54.510> desert<00:03:54.780> was<00:03:54.959> that

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
is the desert and in the desert was that

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.569 
is the desert and in the desert was that
kind<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.709> fairly<00:03:56.400> big<00:03:56.870> mountainous<00:03:57.870> area<00:03:58.579> we

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
kind of a fairly big mountainous area we

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.339 
kind of a fairly big mountainous area we
were<00:03:59.700> right<00:03:59.910> there<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.299> mountain<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:00.720> I

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
were right there on the mountain and I

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.069 
were right there on the mountain and I
just<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.250> throw<00:04:02.760> my<00:04:02.910> water<00:04:03.150> bottle<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.780> just

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
just I throw my water bottle and I just

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.199 
just I throw my water bottle and I just
start<00:04:04.440> running<00:04:04.859> there's<00:04:05.310> not<00:04:05.549> much<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.000> can

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
start running there's not much you can

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.059 
start running there's not much you can
do<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.510> we<00:04:06.599> all<00:04:06.750> kind<00:04:06.989> of<00:04:07.049> dispersed<00:04:07.739> in<00:04:07.980> two

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
do and we all kind of dispersed in two

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.860 
do and we all kind of dispersed in two
different<00:04:08.250> directions<00:04:08.459> because<00:04:09.150> we're<00:04:09.720> kind

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
different directions because we're kind

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.330 
different directions because we're kind
of<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.079> separated<00:04:10.620> because<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.980> fire<00:04:11.190> is

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
of like separated because the fire is

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.120 
of like separated because the fire is
just<00:04:11.579> like<00:04:11.730> all<00:04:11.970> over<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.569> place<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.049> we<00:04:13.859> just

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
just like all over the place and we just

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.150 
just like all over the place and we just
dip<00:04:14.489> out<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.970> there<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.079> look<00:04:16.410> back<00:04:16.709> and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
dip out of there and I look back and

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.279 
dip out of there and I look back and
there<00:04:18.090> was<00:04:18.180> no<00:04:18.419> way<00:04:18.599> could<00:04:18.810> have<00:04:18.930> like<00:04:19.049> gotten

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
there was no way could have like gotten

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.229 
there was no way could have like gotten
to<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.620> homes<00:04:19.859> because<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.700> brick<00:04:20.969> wall

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
to the homes because of that brick wall

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.350 
to the homes because of that brick wall
but<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:21.959> was<00:04:22.079> still<00:04:22.349> pretty<00:04:23.039> close<00:04:23.520> right

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
but it was still pretty close right

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.420
