they just lost the Dallas at home you

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
they just lost the Dallas at home you
know<00:00:51.510> Dallas<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.770> legitimate<00:00:52.860> team

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
know Dallas is a very legitimate team

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
know Dallas is a very legitimate team
here<00:00:53.579> Pat<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.449> Miami<00:00:54.750> team<00:00:54.989> has<00:00:55.110> been

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
here Pat but this Miami team has been

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
here Pat but this Miami team has been
beating<00:00:55.559> up<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.860> some<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> weaker

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
beating up on some of the weaker

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.760 
beating up on some of the weaker
competition<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> leak<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.320> handle

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
competition in the leak and they handle

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
competition in the leak and they handle
the<00:00:59.280> top<00:00:59.489> teams<00:00:59.730> yeah<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.629> can

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the top teams yeah I think they can

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
the top teams yeah I think they can
handle<00:01:01.020> them<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> think<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> main<00:01:01.770> problem

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
handle them I think the main problem

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
handle them I think the main problem
with<00:01:02.160> Miami<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.730> when<00:01:02.879> they<00:01:03.000> go<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.210> against<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
with Miami is when they go up against a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
with Miami is when they go up against a
really<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.080> point<00:01:04.320> guard<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:04.799> mean<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.250> saw

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
really good point guard I mean you saw

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.100 
really good point guard I mean you saw
it<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.700> lost<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> Chris<00:01:06.299> Paul<00:01:06.570> early<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it when they lost to Chris Paul early in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.760 
it when they lost to Chris Paul early in
the<00:01:07.229> year

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the year

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
the year
I'm<00:01:08.070> Deron<00:01:08.640> Williams<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.150> lost<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.479> Jazz

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
I'm Deron Williams they lost to the Jazz

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.719 
I'm Deron Williams they lost to the Jazz
I<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.470> main<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.280> their<00:01:11.460> point

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
I think the main thing is their point

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.070 
I think the main thing is their point
guard<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.150> handle<00:01:12.420> any<00:01:12.570> one<00:01:12.810> two

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
guard they can handle any one two

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.289 
guard they can handle any one two
through<00:01:13.320> four<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:14.130> their<00:01:14.250> Center<00:01:14.850> position

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
through four in their Center position

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.660 
through four in their Center position
you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.509> Joe<00:01:15.720> al<00:01:15.869> Anthony's<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.710> horrible

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you know Joe al Anthony's just horrible

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
you know Joe al Anthony's just horrible
Center<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> works<00:01:18.750> his<00:01:18.930> butt<00:01:18.960> off<00:01:19.170> but

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
Center you know works his butt off but

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.260 
Center you know works his butt off but
not<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> good<00:01:20.040> center<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> league<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
not a good center in the league so I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.580 
not a good center in the league so I
think<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.659> why<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.930> mean<00:01:22.080> obviously<00:01:22.229> that's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
think that's why I mean obviously that's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.899 
think that's why I mean obviously that's
where<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.890> struggle<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
where they struggle is the one in the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
where they struggle is the one in the
