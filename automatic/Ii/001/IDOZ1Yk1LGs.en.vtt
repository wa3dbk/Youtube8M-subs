00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.739
 what 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:16.790
 So far, I've been looking at each part of the computer on my side. 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.530
 From this time on, we will discuss the process of assembling the computer and installing the operating system. 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.920
 I'll see. 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.280
 Let's take a look at the computer assembly process with me. 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.280
 5 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.600
 Ah 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.190
 Just prior to assembling the five-Kobe hair for studies necessary for computer assembly 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.860
 I'll find out. 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 The computer requires a driver, a long nose pliers nipper flash, etc. 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:47.530
 First, the driver is the air force that is required to assemble the computer. 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.400
 A 15 cm red driver is adequate. 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.960
 And if it's a product on that fine chair of the 10th driver 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.670
 Easy to assemble screws that can not drop the screws and keep the screws 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.070
 You can raise it. 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:09.470
 Agriculture is a sharp, long nose pliers pliers type of tool motherboard hard disk 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:14.770
 Can be used conveniently when removing or inserting a jumper 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:19.430
 The ripper is mainly used to organize internal wiring at the final stage of assembly . 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:24.140
 It is used to cut the jaws on cable ties 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:27.440
 I've been studying various things so far. Phillips screwdriver and Long Nose Flyer 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.470
 Be sure to prepare 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.470
 5 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.570
 5 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:43.789
 The cpu and memory in order to assemble the first try tendeyo mounted on the main board 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.159
 When assembling the computer for the first time, it is important to pre-install these components 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.590
 It is convenient 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:53.690
 Well, first of all, it was a cpu box. 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.140
 Since the tempo is tightly sealed, use the scissors, etc. 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.140
 Cut 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:06.700
 If you open the box, the plastic case with the cpu in the paper box, install the cooler. 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:13.140
 I've got a booklet with a warranty. 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.140
 The cardboard logo sticker is attached to the back of the brochure and should be kept separately 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:21.659
 Now it's time to install the cpu on the motherboard. 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.159
 It is important to keep the cushioning material on the bottom of the motherboard box 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:28.170
 good 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:31.859
 Put the buffer board carefully down and cover the plastic 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.930
 Remove the protective cover 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:39.409
 Push the lever of the cpu socket down slightly and pull it to the side to lock the lever 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.409
 Release 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.700
 4 Keep the plastic cover in case you need to get a chord mainboard as 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.700
 You must leave 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:58.319
 The rest pu belongs to the top 3 cpu. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 Place the cpu on both sides so that it snaps into the cpu stool. 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:07.709
 Multiple 2 I close the cover of some cpu 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.379
 If the cover does not fit properly and it feels like lifting , reorient the cpu 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.739
 I have to check 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.569
 Now it's time to run the cpu cooler. 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:20.069
 The cpu cooler should be secured in alignment with the claw fixing holes in the main secondary 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:25.409
 I will 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:30.420
 the plastics bridge to the cpu cooler cooler to fit into holes on the mainboard cooler fixing 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:35.849
 It is important to move your leg lightly 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:39.599
 Press firmly on the cpu cooler until it clicks 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:42.930
 There are a total of four fixed fans in the thread fair cooler. 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:48.180
 You can press them in diagonal order 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:53.730
 Now you have to turn the motherboard over and make sure that the pin is secure. 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:56.639
 Each fixing pin has a black fixing pin protruding between two prong white plastic 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:01.319
 Condition must be corrected 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:06.180
 If you do not see a black pin or only one white plastic 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:10.889
 It is incorrectly fixed and you will need to reinstall the caller 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.889
 When the caller to remove the arrow plastic leg with a flat screwdriver or wire 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:18.720
 Turn it in the direction and pull it. 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:20.699
 When you assemble it again, just put the plastic leg back in place. 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.099
 It's possible 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:28.770
 If Conroe is equipped with finishing the 4-pin power connector on the motherboard cpu cooler 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:33.780
 I plug it into the cpu fan connector. 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 Match the groove engraved on one side of the caller power connector and the projection of the mainboard connector 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:43.169
 When plugged in, the cpu installation is finished 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:49.349
 Be careful not to put the memory marking the direction of insertion into memory 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:53.250
 Slide the levers out on both sides of the slon to put the memory first and leave it like me 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:58.139
 Grab both sides of the memory and snap it into the slot. 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.969
 Who topped the state in the memory into the slot to release the correct memory slots 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:05.580
 Check 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:08.969
 If it does not match the lightness and the memory slot as garlic inserted incorrectly display 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.699
 You have to put it upside down. 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.539
 After verifying that the memory direction is correct 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:20.969
 Tilt 2 Lock the lever on either side 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:25.639
 While holding the memory with both thumbs , hold both levers with your index finger 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.639
 You can easily lock it by pushing it in. 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:37.270
 I have finished installing the cpu and memory on my motherboard 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.270
 Remember that cpu and memory should be plugged in. 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.450
