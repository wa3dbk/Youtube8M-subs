Hey

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.170 

traditionally<00:00:13.890> artillery<00:00:14.550> systems<00:00:14.970> are

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
traditionally artillery systems are

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.300 
traditionally artillery systems are
tracked<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.230> some<00:00:16.440> parts<00:00:16.770> word<00:00:16.980> there<00:00:17.220> is

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
tracked but in some parts word there is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.950 
tracked but in some parts word there is
a<00:00:17.370> clear<00:00:17.670> move<00:00:17.970> toward<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.600> design

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
a clear move toward the design

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.840 
a clear move toward the design

development product in the wheeled
artillery<00:00:21.300> systems<00:00:21.780> when<00:00:22.590> compared<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.070> their

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
artillery systems when compared to their

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.550 
artillery systems when compared to their
tight<00:00:23.460> counterparts<00:00:24.210> these<00:00:24.600> potentially

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
tight counterparts these potentially

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
tight counterparts these potentially
have<00:00:25.860> a<00:00:25.890> lower<00:00:26.100> life<00:00:26.400> cycle<00:00:26.430> cost<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.450> are

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
have a lower life cycle cost and are

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.409 
have a lower life cycle cost and are
easier<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.860> operate<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.460> maintain<00:00:29.610> this
