00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.850
 so here we are for a video of 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.919
 beyblade 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.210
 for this first video I'm doing this 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.250
 going to be on the drago destroy good in 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.160
 french it gives the destructive drago 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.640
 so I present this spinning top 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.949
 so here is already the box that I just 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 from Japan that I personally have 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.970
 bought on amazon so already we're going 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:36.110
 start right here is the box 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:39.090
 here we can see ryu ga here 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.640
 now i will introduce you to the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.469
 top then here is the destructive drago 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.469
 with its tip that can retract 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.030
 if he has so after we can 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.240
 here 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:13.009
 so his ca or bullet and bone fusion 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.079
 so therefore the opposite of spinning tops 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.719
 basic normally and his donkey or 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.599
 the energy that there is low rubber and 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.979
 finally it's down so it's not 

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.399
 it's not really called our 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:33.609
 energy I do not really know so I 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.609
 go there I'm going to remove the pieces 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.060
 so 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.280
 so we will start 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.280
 here is the cargo 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.930
 here it is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.750
 so there's our energy with rubber 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.329
 the red is the rubber the blue goes 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.329
 it's plastic 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:46.840
 here after that is the bass the bass and 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.310
 sopel f s so this is where we energy has 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:58.570
 need performance are in one 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:59.980
 piece is finally here the metal we helped him 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.840
 to be damaged yesterday I made fights 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:12.550
 but now there are several 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:15.580
 modes so here it's the attack mode or 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.920
 the rubber is covered by the la 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.660
 metal surface and then there is 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.930
 when they return the absorption mode 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.600
 that beats the rubber absorbs the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.570
 rotation of his opponent and the 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.940
 transforms for herself to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.940
 observation here 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.780
 a base that's all for this video the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.280
 next video it will be for bing bang 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:55.150
 pegasus and after ben we'll see maybe 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.299
 varied under three axes here at more 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.299
 late
