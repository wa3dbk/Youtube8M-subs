00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.740
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.180
 amway921 and today we will again 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.390
 talking about the American average 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.280
 tank level 9 t-54 going in one of our 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.560
 past issues we are already more than 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.390
 discussed in detail all the parameters 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.300
 technically related to booking with 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.520
 arming with everything else in 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.890
 hangar and I hope you watched this video 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.830
 but if you didnâ€™t see it then I advise 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.630
 Required to haul for your 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.760
 intelligence and self development on it 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.339
 look and at the end for you 2 on the process 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.170
 hero link well and in this battle and in this 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.530
 specifically the video we will already talk about 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.929
 more like this old side 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.019
 about applying this tank but also here in 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:49.329
 This is the map of Prokhor which 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.829
 very difficult for our tank because 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.319
 that she is all open 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.449
 in the sense that there is neither destructible 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.359
 shelter and very difficult to hide here 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.510
 from the shells and today in this video we 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.780
 discuss two things that I am for a few 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.700
 battles understood on this tank and try them 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.250
 stick and practice shows that 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 it really is probably optimal 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 at least a more optimal way 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.670
 I have not found a tank application yet and if 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.710
 you remember from the past video about it 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.620
 tank that he almost all 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.760
 weapon related parameters 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:28.420
 the penultimate is not the last in anything but 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.100
 not the first one far away and that means everything to us 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.010
 but I remind you that he is extremely oblique 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.290
 the gun comes down on extremely long and here 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.540
 such is all plus recharge 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.940
 it turns out on one shot very long 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.210
 the drum itself charges for 34 with one 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 seconds and between shots another 2 and 22 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.070
 it turns out that but almost 11 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.000
 seconds need to once 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.390
 a shot for an e100 sheath is really long and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.130
 that's what it all give us we can't on 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.170
 this tank because I remind you of him 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.280
 the most mediocre dynamics most 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.869
 worst among all st step 9 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.700
 no we can not like here like for example 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.170
 center pay attention to the minimap 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 we have a Christmas tree here 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.569
 drives and all our four they act 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.819
 absolutely competently absolutely true train 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.130
 with him the direction they drive are highlighted 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.560
 because they can drive and if they can 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.600
 that left sometimes on prokhorovke here with 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.250
 this side yes from any side and st-shki 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.410
 some go uphill but in this case 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.100
 we have here tyazh I collect because there is 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.930
 step here is not thick and these areas 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.239
 which I called you natural 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.250
 ordinary gray need dynamics and where 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.320
 possible if that escape is not suitable for 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.480
 of our hamster because we run away 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.220
 no time to come and come in first 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.709
 also do not have time because we see very 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.370
 slow and deed we drive like a heavy tank 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.150
 and 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.060
 video is the meaning of video in our today is 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.269
 I realized that on this tank you need 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.580
 ride like a heavy one I explain 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.050
 I mean the direction of the attack 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.390
 There is now I came and became for 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.060
 the house is usually heavy duty to do 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.760
 come to the village or here rub on 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.260
 alley but us on the alley like you 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.450
 unimaginably many allies piled up 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.910
 but usually here somehow in the village tyazh here 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.540
 huddle and snooping around the edges and here 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.370
 I am realizing what has given me great 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.829
 the developer he gave me great 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.269
 one-time damage and the only problem with 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.700
 this one-time damage is that the gun 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.640
 Extremely concerned I told you more than once 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.680
 and shoot on this tank this is the second we 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.739
 you promise 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.630
 necessary even point-blank not only there on 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.299
 growth at distance is understandable even in 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.070
 emphasis is necessary with full information and not 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.220
 there is no hurry because the price is a slip 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.660
 high reloading one shot at 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.640
 total as i told you 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.590
 about ten seconds eleven of this 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.480
 too long to yet 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.190
 allow yourself maz and here with god 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.489
 using code 4 projectile enter with 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.950
 the opponent feels just like that 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.650
 as it should but again that is, we go 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.970
 slow and we can't play like zad 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.500
 same time on these directions 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.650
 for heavy tanks because we have armor 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.650
 there is no and we need to beware all that 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.660
 need to do along the route it is but 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.730
 here it was not demonstrated 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.680
 of some mighty resistance in that 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.900
 same village 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.790
 and at the same time necessary 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.380
 some other maps here if there 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.639
 great resistance then hold on to 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.240
 back some big 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:24.400
 trusting friend and in his say so not 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.530
 use his armor and himself be 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.949
 his spear and punish all who 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.580
 pop out that's exactly what's come 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.539
 I literally have some battles there 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.539
 maybe even 100 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.039
 that is, I think that I am enough 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.139
 I understand enough about this tank to 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.150
 seek that he is not bad and not good he 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.039
 just extremely unusual and even a bit 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.560
 strange because here it is quite by 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.590
 the idea is not the average did not give him to God 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.410
 dynamics but gave it a very good one 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.229
 gun though she and this gun with her 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.449
 all the minuses it is really far 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.410
 not standing out among classmates but 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.620
 Availability 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.570
 automatic loader puts us a little 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.669
 higher in the food chain than just 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.229
 such is the usual oblique gun as 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:12.570
 for example on the same pulled up on the ninth 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.919
 level and i believe that absolutely 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.159
 act like this because 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:22.090
 it is this tactic and very conveniently lies 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:25.030
 right when the tank appears from this 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.060
 level heavy american t57 heavy 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.310
 he will probably be the same about 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.650
 what are we talking about in this video today 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.080
 perfectly fit into 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.300
 this is the saddle and that is exactly the way i think in 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.320
 research tree that way and 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.270
 lined up 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.940
 have these new americans with guns 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.070
 in order to get used to something already 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.440
 what this all leads to us that is 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.720
 dynamics with each level with each 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.560
 a tank with every new one every 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.490
 worse and worse 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.370
 and the rage from the gun is higher and higher and 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.220
 This is what I wanted for you in this. 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.270
 battle to say but in confirmation of everything 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.680
 what i'm telling you i want to say that 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.440
 like I'm not new to this game but all 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.570
 equal to me pretty pretty confident 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.160
 I feel when I go out there on the tanks 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.200
 almost all the fights that are on it 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.820
 held with few exceptions may 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.100
 be the exception may be me i am not 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.140
 I remember exactly the maximum fights probably 10 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.900
 it was a platoon some games all 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.340
 the rest is solo and winning percentage you can 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.620
 field to elicit my stats and 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.460
 average damage and average experience are very 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.010
 quite good and very often issued such would 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.010
 where i do damage and much more than 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.960
 yours and 1750 if you 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.970
 apply hp 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.610
 damage more than your health then 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.170
 consider that you have already played plus they are 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.570
 minus whether your team and here in this 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:54.210
 in battle it will be a good example of 7 thousand 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.710
 damage takes 1000 flew out and only 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.020
 just because we're here 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.610
 acted neatly we did not climb forward 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.860
 we are not fit to be 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.130
 at the point of attack you are adapted only 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.590
 just to be so 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.970
 with the punishing eye of our sauron 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.500
 allies precisely for this simple reason 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.960
 despite such a large number 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.090
 damage no marks on this 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.000
 my received was not for that simple 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.570
 the reason is that half the experience from damage by 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.520
 light up 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.130
 ticking for those who just highlight us 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.530
 enemies and I think you know all about it 

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.240
 great and i hope this video was you 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.610
 useful and now you know a little bit 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.680
 more about how best on and more correct 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.900
 just best act best on 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.460
 a tank like 341 but maybe 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.950
 Subsequently, there were doctors else 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.260
 more interesting and some more thoughts on 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:42.210
 this bill i'm sure not by 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.710
 so everyone thanks for 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.449
 do not subscribe to the channel until new 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.060
 meetings swing Americans and 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:50.240
 enjoy auto loaders all 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.240
 until
