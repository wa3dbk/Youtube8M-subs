feel comfortable for a lot of people

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
feel comfortable for a lot of people
it's<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.699> I<00:00:50.790> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
it's not just as I want to make

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
it's not just as I want to make
chocolate<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.600> obviously<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.590> doing

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
chocolate that's obviously I'm doing

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.360 
chocolate that's obviously I'm doing
this<00:00:53.070> because<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.180> lot<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.629> fun<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.559> also

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
this because it's a lot of fun but also

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.360 
this because it's a lot of fun but also
because<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.059> business<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
because I think business is

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.510 
because I think business is
really<00:00:58.670> powerful<00:00:58.880> and<00:00:59.390> there's<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.630> lot<00:00:59.780> of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
really powerful and there's a lot of

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.860 
really powerful and there's a lot of
ways<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.730> business<00:01:02.060> can<00:01:02.210> give<00:01:02.360> back<00:01:02.570> because

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
ways the business can give back because

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.600 
ways the business can give back because
right<00:01:03.050> now<00:01:03.200> all<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.560> does<00:01:03.710> is<00:01:03.860> take<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.400> waste

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
right now all it does is take and waste

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.560 
right now all it does is take and waste
and<00:01:04.940> create<00:01:05.540> packaging<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.820> start<00:01:08.120> with<00:01:08.300> all

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
and create packaging to start with all

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.469 
and create packaging to start with all
our<00:01:08.720> packaging<00:01:09.229> biodegrades<00:01:10.240> so<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.390> was

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
our packaging biodegrades so that was

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.760 
our packaging biodegrades so that was
really<00:01:11.720> important<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:12.110> me<00:01:12.229> because<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.560> majored

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
really important to me because I majored

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.250 
really important to me because I majored
in<00:01:13.010> sustainable<00:01:13.490> development<00:01:13.640> and<00:01:14.300> I<00:01:14.900> would

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
in sustainable development and I would

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.450 
in sustainable development and I would
have<00:01:15.350> felt<00:01:15.380> like<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.619> hypocrite<00:01:15.950> if<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.220> didn't

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
have felt like a hypocrite if I didn't

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.280 
have felt like a hypocrite if I didn't
start<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:16.910> way<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:17.450> even<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.140> whole

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
start that way but even the whole

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.560 
start that way but even the whole
recycling<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:18.979> place<00:01:19.190> what<00:01:20.150> I<00:01:20.180> want<00:01:20.450> to

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
recycling in this place what I want to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.410 
recycling in this place what I want to
do<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.900> have<00:01:21.080> every<00:01:21.850> portion<00:01:22.850> of<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.060> chocolate

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
do is have every portion of a chocolate

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.020 
do is have every portion of a chocolate
bars<00:01:23.600> from<00:01:23.810> different<00:01:24.080> regions<00:01:24.440> go<00:01:24.950> toward<00:01:25.369> by

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
bars from different regions go toward by

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.840 
bars from different regions go toward by
the<00:01:26.090> reforestation<00:01:26.630> projects<00:01:27.560> or<00:01:27.740> social<00:01:28.700> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
the reforestation projects or social and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.530 
the reforestation projects or social and
environmental<00:01:29.320> problems<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.680> exist<00:01:31.280> and

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
environmental problems that exist and

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.609 
environmental problems that exist and
that's<00:01:32.540> another<00:01:32.780> reason<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.140> really<00:01:33.290> like<00:01:33.380> this

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
that's another reason I really like this

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.080 
that's another reason I really like this
business<00:01:33.800> because<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.340> revolves<00:01:35.000> around

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
business because it revolves around

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.940 
business because it revolves around
volume<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:35.930> more<00:01:36.110> chocolate<00:01:36.470> bars<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:36.740> sell

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
volume so the more chocolate bars I sell

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.640 
volume so the more chocolate bars I sell
the<00:01:37.070> more<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.250> can<00:01:37.460> get<00:01:37.580> back

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.350 

this<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.520> knowing<00:01:44.640> machine<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.180> built

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
this way knowing machine that we built

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.620 
this way knowing machine that we built
is<00:01:45.660> two<00:01:46.200> buckets<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.460> bicycle<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is two buckets it's a bicycle and a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
is two buckets it's a bicycle and a
shopback<00:01:50.270> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> our<00:01:51.630> unique<00:01:52.410> contraption

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
shopback this is our unique contraption
