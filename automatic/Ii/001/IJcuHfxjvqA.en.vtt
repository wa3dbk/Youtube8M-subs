while while it lives on the shelf at the
parks<00:00:40.320> house<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:41.399> will<00:00:41.550> eventually<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:42.510> cut

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
parks house this will eventually be cut

parks house this will eventually be cut
off<00:00:42.840> okay<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.309> ready<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.730> of

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
off okay so we get ready to do that of

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.729 
off okay so we get ready to do that of
course<00:00:45.180> will<00:00:45.450> remove<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
course will remove that but that's just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.680 
course will remove that but that's just
for<00:00:47.070> shipping<00:00:47.610> for<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.360> comes<00:00:48.539> off

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
for shipping for now so that comes off

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.720 
for shipping for now so that comes off
later<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.520> new<00:00:50.670> shock<00:00:52.160> got<00:00:53.160> two<00:00:53.370> bolts

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
later on the new shock got two bolts

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660 
later on the new shock got two bolts
here<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.870> there's<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.280> cap<00:00:56.280> nut<00:00:56.520> that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
here and then there's one cap nut that

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
here and then there's one cap nut that
comes<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> top<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.690> let's<00:00:58.500> talk<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
comes over the top and let's talk a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.529 
comes over the top and let's talk a
little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:59.039> about<00:00:59.250> how<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.059> actually<00:01:00.270> goes

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
little bit about how this actually goes

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
little bit about how this actually goes
together<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> top<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.070> get

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
together on the top because that can get

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.030 
together on the top because that can get
a<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.399> bit<00:01:02.629> confusing<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.619> there's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> set

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
a little bit confusing so there's a set

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.469 
a little bit confusing so there's a set
of<00:01:05.129> bushings<00:01:05.489> there's<00:01:05.700> actually<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of bushings there's actually two of

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
of bushings there's actually two of
these<00:01:08.000> call<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.119> cap<00:01:09.810> washers<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.710> then

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
these call them cap washers and then

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
these call them cap washers and then
there's<00:01:11.010> two<00:01:11.189> bushings<00:01:11.640> themselves<00:01:12.450> okay<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
there's two bushings themselves okay and

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.240 
there's two bushings themselves okay and
they're<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.710> different<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:14.130> either

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
they're actually different on either

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340 
they're actually different on either
side<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.880> has<00:01:15.000> got<00:01:15.150> like<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> small<00:01:15.689> ring<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
side this has got like a small ring here

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740 
side this has got like a small ring here
in<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.189> one<00:01:17.400> we've<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.060> larger<00:01:18.570> ring

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
in on this one we've got a larger ring

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.200 
in on this one we've got a larger ring
the<00:01:19.170> larger<00:01:19.500> ring<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.250> made<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:20.820> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the larger ring is going to made up to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.929 
the larger ring is going to made up to
this<00:01:21.540> piece<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.110> okay<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.369> when<00:01:23.759> everything

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
this piece here okay so when everything

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.440 
this piece here okay so when everything
is<00:01:24.150> put<00:01:24.360> together<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.869> goes<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:26.450> like

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
is put together it goes like this like

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.080 
is put together it goes like this like
so<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> we're<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> take<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.610> larger

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so then we're going to take the larger

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.380 
so then we're going to take the larger
piece<00:01:30.540> with<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.900> smaller<00:01:31.350> end<00:01:31.619> facing<00:01:32.159> up

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
piece with the smaller end facing up

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.660 
piece with the smaller end facing up
then<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.170> actual<00:01:34.430> suspension<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
then the the actual suspension on the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.760 
then the the actual suspension on the
car<00:01:35.880> goes<00:01:36.150> here<00:01:38.479> small<00:01:39.479> end<00:01:39.720> down<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.439> small

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
car goes here small end down so small

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.289 
car goes here small end down so small
into<00:01:41.040> small<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.640> meet<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.150> middle

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
into small and they meet in the middle

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.240 
into small and they meet in the middle
and<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.689> where<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> actual<00:01:43.619> suspension

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and that's where the actual suspension

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.420 
and that's where the actual suspension
would<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:45.439> place<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> cap<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.040> top<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:48.659> nut

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
would be place the cap on top the nut

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.950 
would be place the cap on top the nut
follows<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:51.509> how<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
follows that so that's how it's going to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.090 
follows that so that's how it's going to
end<00:01:52.049> up<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> car<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.070> course

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
end up in the car and then of course

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.240 
end up in the car and then of course
we're<00:01:53.490> bolted<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> lower<00:01:55.130> leave<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
we're bolted up to the lower leave the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.899 
we're bolted up to the lower leave the
a-frame<00:01:56.700> down<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> bottom<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> car

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
a-frame down in the bottom of the car

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.670 
a-frame down in the bottom of the car
what<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.060> car<00:02:00.270> also<00:02:00.450> has<00:02:00.630> two<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.469> when

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
what this car also has two is that when

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.440 
what this car also has two is that when
you<00:02:01.799> remove<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.460> old<00:02:02.610> shock<00:02:02.909> absorber

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
you remove the old shock absorber

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.440 
you remove the old shock absorber
there's<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> flexible<00:02:05.340> cup<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.000> comes<00:02:06.299> over

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
there's a flexible cup that comes over

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
there's a flexible cup that comes over
the<00:02:06.659> top<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.140> we're<00:02:07.259> going<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.409> actually<00:02:07.619> pull

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the top and we're going to actually pull

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.969 
the top and we're going to actually pull
that<00:02:08.220> off<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> other<00:02:09.379> shock<00:02:10.379> absorber<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that off of the other shock absorber and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.220 
that off of the other shock absorber and
put<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> new

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
put that on the new

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.440 
put that on the new
it<00:02:12.920> looks<00:02:13.069> kind<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.370> ratty<00:02:13.580> but<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.150> it's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
it looks kind of ratty but it is it's

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.850 
it looks kind of ratty but it is it's
there<00:02:14.659> for<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.840> purpose<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.409> keeps<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
there for a purpose and it keeps the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.160 
there for a purpose and it keeps the
shaft<00:02:16.190> clean<00:02:16.909> it<00:02:17.120> keeps<00:02:17.269> dirt<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.720> water<00:02:17.900> and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
shaft clean it keeps dirt and water and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.440 
shaft clean it keeps dirt and water and
so<00:02:18.349> forth<00:02:18.590> at<00:02:18.680> least<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> some<00:02:19.159> extent<00:02:19.519> off<00:02:19.730> of

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
so forth at least to some extent off of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.270 
so forth at least to some extent off of
the<00:02:20.569> shock<00:02:20.780> absorber<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.440> it's<00:02:21.860> a<00:02:21.980> part<00:02:22.190> that

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the shock absorber so it's a part that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.640 
the shock absorber so it's a part that
you<00:02:22.400> reuse<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.019> comes<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.349> with<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
you reuse and and it comes out with the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.860 
you reuse and and it comes out with the
old<00:02:24.680> shock<00:02:25.239> norse<00:02:26.239> here<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.629> is<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:28.870> the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
old shock norse here to is is that the

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.509 
old shock norse here to is is that the
way<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.349> configured<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.129> sort<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.430> at

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
way this is configured it's sort of at

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.970 
way this is configured it's sort of at
an<00:02:31.640> angle<00:02:31.940> right<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.019> way<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.200> kind<00:02:33.920> of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
an angle right and the way to kind of

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.460 
an angle right and the way to kind of
keep<00:02:34.129> track<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.849> is<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:38.079> it<00:02:39.079> goes<00:02:39.290> in

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
keep track of that is is that it goes in

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.289 
keep track of that is is that it goes in
a<00:02:39.650> teepee<00:02:40.129> so<00:02:40.310> if<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.489> is<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.670> center<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.090> the

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
a teepee so if this is the center of the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.170 
a teepee so if this is the center of the
car<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:42.049> goes<00:02:42.079> in<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.129> direction<00:02:43.310> okay

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
car it goes in in this direction okay

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.839 
car it goes in in this direction okay
and<00:02:45.110> that's<00:02:45.349> just<00:02:45.769> one<00:02:46.010> way<00:02:46.040> in<00:02:46.400> case<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:46.730> get

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
and that's just one way in case you get

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.089 
and that's just one way in case you get
kind<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.569> know<00:02:47.599> messed<00:02:48.379> up<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.709> terms<00:02:48.890> of

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
kind of you know messed up in terms of

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.220 
kind of you know messed up in terms of
which<00:02:49.760> way<00:02:49.940> did<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.269> actually<00:02:50.480> go<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:50.840> that's

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
which way did it actually go on that's

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.270 
which way did it actually go on that's
how<00:02:51.379> it's<00:02:51.560> going<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.739> go<00:02:51.829> if<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.099> can

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
how it's going to go if you can

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.550 
how it's going to go if you can
visualize<00:02:52.459> that<00:02:53.030> up<00:02:53.480> through<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.019> upper

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
visualize that up through the upper

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.750 
visualize that up through the upper
suspension<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.310> we're<00:02:55.459> going<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.640> go<00:02:55.730> ahead

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
suspension so we're going to go ahead

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.259 
suspension so we're going to go ahead
here<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.650> remove<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.340> shock<00:02:58.549> absorber<00:02:59.030> from

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
here and remove the shock absorber from

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.360 
here and remove the shock absorber from
the<00:02:59.420> passenger<00:02:59.690> side<00:03:00.200> now<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.680> I've<00:03:01.220> got<00:03:01.340> a

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
the passenger side now and I've got a

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.770 
the passenger side now and I've got a
couple<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.760> tools<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:02.209> that<00:03:02.239> help<00:03:02.540> me<00:03:02.660> do

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
couple of tools here that help me do

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.240 
couple of tools here that help me do
that<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.590> know<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.739> don't<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:03.980> need

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
that and you know you don't really need

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.559 
that and you know you don't really need
all<00:03:04.310> this<00:03:04.459> stuff<00:03:04.819> to<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.269> I<00:03:05.329> mean<00:03:05.450> some

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
all this stuff to do it I mean some

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.199 
all this stuff to do it I mean some
basic<00:03:05.840> hand<00:03:05.900> tools<00:03:06.170> I<00:03:06.709> have<00:03:07.340> lifted<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.910> car

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
basic hand tools I have lifted the car

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.030 
basic hand tools I have lifted the car
up<00:03:08.420> because<00:03:08.840> once<00:03:09.109> you<00:03:09.260> start<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.560> take<00:03:09.799> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
up because once you start to take the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.039 
up because once you start to take the
shock<00:03:10.310> absorber<00:03:10.760> apart<00:03:11.060> you<00:03:11.540> need<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.810> room

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
shock absorber apart you need the room

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.259 
shock absorber apart you need the room
to<00:03:12.769> pull<00:03:12.980> it<00:03:13.099> out<00:03:13.220> and<00:03:13.310> underneath<00:03:14.000> from

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
to pull it out and underneath from

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.030 
to pull it out and underneath from
underneath<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.720> car<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.170> things<00:03:15.410> have<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.769> to

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
underneath the car so things have to to

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.190 
underneath the car so things have to to
move<00:03:16.190> up<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.579> have<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> jack<00:03:17.359> stand<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.750> place<00:03:17.870> too

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
move up I have a jack stand in place too

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.289 
move up I have a jack stand in place too
because<00:03:18.349> I<00:03:18.590> don't<00:03:18.799> rely<00:03:19.099> on<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.700> floor

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
because I don't rely on just a floor

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.879 
because I don't rely on just a floor
jack<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.690> hold<00:03:20.870> the<00:03:20.989> car<00:03:21.200> up<00:03:21.380> we<00:03:21.530> always<00:03:21.650> have

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
jack to hold the car up we always have

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.979 
jack to hold the car up we always have
something<00:03:22.130> else<00:03:22.370> that's<00:03:22.579> rigid<00:03:23.060> holding<00:03:23.840> it

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
something else that's rigid holding it

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.289 
something else that's rigid holding it
up<00:03:24.799> off<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.190> ground<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:25.519> in<00:03:25.760> case<00:03:25.940> something

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
up off the ground so in case something

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.920 
up off the ground so in case something
on<00:03:26.450> falls<00:03:26.870> or<00:03:27.109> it<00:03:27.620> causes<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:28.040> problem<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.780> let's

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
on falls or it causes a problem so let's

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.479 
on falls or it causes a problem so let's
poke<00:03:30.079> the<00:03:30.200> camera<00:03:30.530> down<00:03:30.680> inside<00:03:31.099> here<00:03:31.370> and

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
poke the camera down inside here and

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.699 
poke the camera down inside here and
we'll<00:03:31.579> see<00:03:31.730> where<00:03:31.940> we're<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.540> target<00:03:33.200> nut<00:03:33.500> is

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
we'll see where we're the target nut is

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.150 
we'll see where we're the target nut is
to<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.040> top<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.459> shock<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.160> manage

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
to the top of the shock and if I manage

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.370 
to the top of the shock and if I manage
to<00:03:37.419> get<00:03:38.419> this<00:03:38.540> light<00:03:38.840> straightened<00:03:39.319> around

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
to get this light straightened around

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.720 
to get this light straightened around
i'm<00:03:39.590> going<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.769> use<00:03:39.859> this<00:03:39.950> ruler<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.400> kind<00:03:40.609> of<00:03:40.669> a

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
i'm going to use this ruler is kind of a

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.670 
i'm going to use this ruler is kind of a
pointer<00:03:41.120> that's<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.169> target<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.620> there

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
pointer that's the target right there

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.349 
pointer that's the target right there
that's<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.519> nut<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.849> i'm<00:03:43.970> going<00:03:44.090> to<00:03:44.150> try<00:03:44.269> and

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
that's the nut that i'm going to try and

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.430 
that's the nut that i'm going to try and
take<00:03:44.510> off<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:46.459> can<00:03:46.489> see<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.440> maybe

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
take off and you can see that the maybe

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.349 
take off and you can see that the maybe
you<00:03:48.560> can't<00:03:48.799> maybe<00:03:48.980> you<00:03:49.099> can<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.639> bushing<00:03:50.239> is

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
you can't maybe you can the bushing is

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.629 
you can't maybe you can the bushing is
squished<00:03:51.049> way<00:03:51.290> way<00:03:51.470> down<00:03:51.650> not<00:03:52.220> going<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.400> do<00:03:52.519> it

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
squished way way down not going to do it

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.220
