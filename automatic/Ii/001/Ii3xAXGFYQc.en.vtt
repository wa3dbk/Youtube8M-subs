00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:08.790
 Nissan's new notebook 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:15.059
 The two models in the compact car called so far notebook Tiida on top of the march is to Nissan 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:19.800
 There was an issue, but the introduction of this new note integrated the note teada 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.560
 Instead, this medalist who will test drive to the note today is the advanced note of the note 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.150
 When There covered by two of the basic model in addition to the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.020
 Yu Yu now line up 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:38.170
 Today is the packaging of the new notebook 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:38.170
 And I would like to try out what kind of fuel-efficient driving it is 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.719
 First of all it was this run that was impressive first 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:03.969
 That 1.2 liter mirror cycle pincher 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:09.820
 This is also but I engine that was investigated is if there is strength from the 1.5-liter par of trees 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:12.990
 Even if you just step on the slope lightly , you can climb the swissy 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:17.100
 And cvt is Takumitsu 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.490
 The speed and the ear of this enjeon 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.810
 I wonder if you say that there is no other 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:27.000
 But really that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:32.280
 I will also direct the run with this water vt 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.620
 Also happy feeling that Do thanks to Riniagan of vt between running this crisp 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.290
 I will 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.000
 There are actually two types of this run 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.980
 If eco Joint 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.390
 The supercharger won't work if you don't step on the accelerator a little 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.370
 Split and quiet a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:00.310
 Switch to driving mode and focus on fuel consumption 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:02.540
 When I enter the mode, I will drive on a mountain road with many uphills in the suburbs of this day. 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.590
 When it is like 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:10.569
 Spear the light is better to run in normal mode than in Komodo 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:15.160
 I think that it is good because there is a feeling that you are running as you expect 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:20.320
 Then that body will continue to extremely firm 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.980
 This body size is almost the same if you know the predecessor Tiida 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.560
 Also 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.810
 Seating position also to have also attached regulation Takada When was of course a petite person to is slightly higher 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.860
 This eyes little by where I am raising is but I do not say that until the minivan for 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:41.030
 There is a high impression 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:44.630
 Even if I'm doing that from such a position, my feet are firmly on the ground and that extra 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:50.500
 A car with high sex 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.500
 There is no such thing as the usual sense of role 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.220
 As expected 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.090
 You can also run where you want to run 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:05.970
 I was also very surprised by the room 's hardship 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.069
 I like the rear seat say say very wide Kedomo that front seat I know of course 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.360
 that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:20.550
 It's really bad feet but overhead space I know of course 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:23.380
 And even if your baby is doing well, you can use the stroller's a and b type 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.340
 Will fit sideways 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.510
 Golf bag too 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:35.510
 In that you can go to the vertical if you defeat the back seat 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.990
 I feel that it will be a compact car that can be used from family to leisure 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.500
 I will 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:44.560
 In order to enhance the texture of the after 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.819
 Do this um dashboard trim 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.620
 That 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:53.650
 It's a resin, so I'm new to this part 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:00.579
 The moment I touched a little was smooth 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:03.050
 Materials such contrivances as not Desa de Ano little cheesy glossy appearance is 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:07.430
 Seems to be used 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:10.940
 The maximum fuel efficiency of the notebook is 25.2 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:14.060
 What is this yearly competition for compact cars? 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:19.280
 I have the impression that I will become a curtain type 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:24.230
 Well at least already this note is idle stop and then 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:31.260
 Downsizing a constant 2 liter engine and then downsizing the transmission 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:36.360
 It is said that it is up to 25.2 by including various techniques that can be lightened 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:39.950
 I think that the fuel efficiency is great It is also equipped with a supercharger for this notebook. 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.310
 It says 100% eco-car tax reduction is Te 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.420
 This trap will also be helpless 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:52.200
 Well that kind of economics and necessity 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:56.760
 In terms of the latest model that combines the neighborhood there is no complaint no matter where it is really 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.760
 I felt the finish
