going to do is show you how to mix a
one<00:02:28.370> pound<00:02:28.670> cut<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.330> is<00:02:29.480> what<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> use<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:29.990> my

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
one pound cut this is what I use in my

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.590 
one pound cut this is what I use in my
shop<00:02:30.380> for<00:02:30.620> repairs<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.220> for<00:02:31.790> finish<00:02:32.060> work<00:02:32.270> if

shop for repairs and for finish work if

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.900 
shop for repairs and for finish work if
I<00:02:32.780> were<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.110> mix<00:02:33.350> one<00:02:33.920> pound<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.250> flakes<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.730> one

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
I were to mix one pound of flakes to one

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.850 
I were to mix one pound of flakes to one
gallon<00:02:35.180> of<00:02:35.240> alcohol<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.990> would<00:02:36.320> have<00:02:36.470> more<00:02:36.680> than

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
gallon of alcohol I would have more than

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.430 
gallon of alcohol I would have more than
I<00:02:36.950> could<00:02:37.100> use<00:02:37.370> before<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.390> goes<00:02:38.510> back<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.320> I'm

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
I could use before it goes back so I'm

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.900 
I could use before it goes back so I'm
going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> divide<00:02:39.920> those<00:02:40.100> proportions<00:02:40.430> down

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
going to divide those proportions down

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.690 
going to divide those proportions down
and<00:02:41.270> mix<00:02:41.510> 1<00:02:41.780> ounce<00:02:41.960> of<00:02:42.140> flakes<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:43.040> 8<00:02:43.220> ounces<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
and mix 1 ounce of flakes to 8 ounces of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.330 
and mix 1 ounce of flakes to 8 ounces of
alcohol<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.900> will<00:02:45.110> give<00:02:45.230> me<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.440> 1<00:02:45.680> pound<00:02:45.950> cut

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
alcohol this will give me a 1 pound cut

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.140 
alcohol this will give me a 1 pound cut
in<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.940> proportions<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.720> use<00:02:47.959> in<00:02:48.110> my<00:02:48.230> shop

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150

flakes dissolve quicker place them in a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.840 
flakes dissolve quicker place them in a
coffee<00:02:54.200> grinder<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:57.380> grind<00:02:58.370> them<00:02:58.550> into<00:02:58.730> a

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
coffee grinder and grind them into a

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.650 
coffee grinder and grind them into a
fine<00:02:59.090> powder

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
fine powder

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.960 
fine powder
I<00:03:01.450> then<00:03:02.450> place<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.959> mixture<00:03:03.370> into<00:03:04.370> a

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
I then place this mixture into a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.560 
I then place this mixture into a
container<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:06.590> has<00:03:06.910> liquid<00:03:07.910> measurements

of alcohol to the container I then place

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.350 
of alcohol to the container I then place
the<00:03:17.150> lid<00:03:17.360> on<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.850> allow<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.910> mixture<00:03:20.180> to

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
the lid on and allow the mixture to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.320 
the lid on and allow the mixture to
dissolve<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:21.530> could<00:03:21.739> take<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.950> day<00:03:22.190> or<00:03:22.310> two<00:03:22.340> if

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
dissolve this could take a day or two if

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.729 
dissolve this could take a day or two if
you<00:03:23.630> put<00:03:23.959> it<00:03:24.020> in<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.140> coffee<00:03:24.320> grinder

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
you put it in the coffee grinder

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.310 
you put it in the coffee grinder
sometimes<00:03:25.160> it<00:03:25.310> takes<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.580> little<00:03:25.730> less<00:03:26.230> but<00:03:27.230> you

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
sometimes it takes a little less but you

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.630 
sometimes it takes a little less but you
want<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.500> make<00:03:27.620> sure<00:03:27.650> it's<00:03:27.890> all<00:03:28.070> dissolved

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
want to make sure it's all dissolved

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.250 
want to make sure it's all dissolved

date that way I know how fresh the
shellac<00:03:37.070> is<00:03:38.530> you'll<00:03:39.530> notice<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:39.920> I'm<00:03:40.040> using

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
shellac is you'll notice that I'm using

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.100 
shellac is you'll notice that I'm using
pure<00:03:40.610> grain<00:03:40.820> alcohol<00:03:40.850> to<00:03:41.450> mix<00:03:41.630> my<00:03:41.780> shellac

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
pure grain alcohol to mix my shellac

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.660 
pure grain alcohol to mix my shellac
flakes<00:03:42.290> and<00:03:42.680> there's<00:03:42.950> some<00:03:43.100> reasons<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:43.489> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
flakes and there's some reasons for that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.449 
flakes and there's some reasons for that
one<00:03:44.330> it's<00:03:44.780> not<00:03:44.989> poisonous<00:03:45.500> denatured<00:03:46.310> alcohol

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
one it's not poisonous denatured alcohol

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.530 
one it's not poisonous denatured alcohol
gives<00:03:46.880> me<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.120> headache

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
gives me a headache

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.090 
gives me a headache
so<00:03:48.019> I<00:03:48.080> don't<00:03:48.140> even<00:03:48.410> like<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.739> my<00:03:48.830> shop

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
so I don't even like it in my shop

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.430 
so I don't even like it in my shop
second<00:03:50.060> if<00:03:50.180> there<00:03:50.330> happens<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.720> be<00:03:50.810> any<00:03:50.900> wax<00:03:51.230> in

your flakes a certain amount of that may

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.430 
your flakes a certain amount of that may
dissolve<00:03:53.390> into<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.780> denatured<00:03:54.320> alcohol

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
dissolve into the denatured alcohol

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.430 
dissolve into the denatured alcohol
giving<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.130> softer<00:03:55.640> finish<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.120> third<00:03:56.720> the
