 five years and that's where the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.750
 union tribes union spring 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.670
 religions and for us here it's all about 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.680
 It's because we need to unite because 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.870
 everything that separates is material that is 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.390
 material wanted violence we are 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.570
 tired of this we want to unite without 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.570
 Violence, love, that's it, officers.
