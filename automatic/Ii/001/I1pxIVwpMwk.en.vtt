00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:28.899
 Hi, it was said, it's fun, I was mainly dedicated to writing online or 

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:31.600
 about pop culture themes I write about 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.860
 in a mess games on me and my own website 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.630
 in writing many media so telecinco have voted cure 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.859
 in messages 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.020
 Altava j- in three works 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.430
 and well then what I dedicate myself and ovation to be in my house in front 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.760
 of the computer most of the time 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.290
 is the world number with 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.030
 see that there are a number of issues that nobody treated them even though they treated us like tide 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.100
 Prostate May 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.110
 stay with warped sense the smoke abraham ascoma referring to posse 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.959
 pop culture 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.479
 speaks many times of strange things that we are left 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.570
 you thought at that time you just remember had 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.580
 so when we start it's very easy to talk about any of 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.710
 these things already 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.840
 the coffin provides a 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.370
 number to dissipate more because there was not anything on the internet in that 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.570
 wikipedia era 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.880
 I had you tube 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.550
 we go for ten years now 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.890
 is now maybe when I see who 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.770
 in which the page has more personality 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.690
 mine the one of my collaborators of both all of that 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.600
 oo its revenue sand work is born in some cases 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.170
 and in the end that develop our obsessions in many cases and for the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.189
 people every time 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.840
 l like to see - on the internet because it has more visual content 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 We pursue in long articles although I have to admit that to me what 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.900
 I like it more but today it is 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.110
 the attack led to the xerez we do is yellow phobia locked with paco fox del 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.640
 program will propose a block is vicissitude and sordidness what we will see 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.760
 it will be more videos and madamas podcast 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.490
 and go back to the end reads a pretty less 80 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.160
 the right now is that a whole book next to lethal bulls to kill under 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.750
 the waters your book on sea musts 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.740
 and well that what it did not mean was only many hours of watching some movies 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.690
 I really run slabs of uron snakes octopuses and valuable things 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.239
 Milanese 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.239
 questioned many things operation or comics is something that in others of the 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:22.880
 themes 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.230
 January in the budget 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.980
 I also collected that though I am not a collector ogier concessive 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.939
 as I know many who have 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.319
 twose I even know people who have a floor directly whole to keep them 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.790
 plossu times is but I do like to buy from time to time especially 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.459
 rare titles you can not find on dvd 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.650
 or that they are not even on the internet in emule that I also like a lot 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:51.239
 prostitution action sex and violence 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.639
 what else do you want to make a movie 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.279
 carmen alborch quite but successful of the costs not only do not like to praise 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.309
 see a bit of 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:01.159
 I was glad he did the house 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.629
 You can also have a lot of film books and it's stitched 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.930
 still rare books even some signed by the authors he had of 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 locate them online or they are comandadas the book to return it to me 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:13.009
 budgets that I already had a lot 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:17.579
 much love of the series many times perham in collected josi fees by 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.549
 role of the 70s things like that 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.749
 also that here we never do facing the internal ones because you can 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:25.419
 get many things 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:28.419
 I robot with a little what is the illusion to discover something new 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.229
 Gaddafi not conventional film accounts more or less already know about him already 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:34.519
 knows what to expect 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.869
 but closer to more power movies more careless 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.219
 with a budget that encourages very rare or from strange countries that have a 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.229
 way of making movies different 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:50.609
 but to me mm returns a little to that illusion is innocence a portrait of a 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.289
 little and you do not know when you are discovering something that always fought 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:54.559
 prettier then 

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:55.480
 you face it as 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.570
 or good I have that world to discover sometimes a little as if you were a 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.739
 country or 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.349
 that this the candÃ¡n rests for the first time unfortunately there is much much 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.219
 pop culture that 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.080
 being little that we do not know or that directly or live because this 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.360
 it does not stop being from Spain end to end
