00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.509 
I'm not gonna admit one of the best ways
to<00:02:07.909> learn<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.720> map<00:02:09.049> is<00:02:09.259> first<00:02:10.099> learn<00:02:10.340> how<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
to learn a map is first learn how to

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.890 
to learn a map is first learn how to
camp<00:02:10.819> on<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.239> know<00:02:11.360> some<00:02:11.569> people<00:02:11.810> will

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
camp on it you know some people will

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.390 
camp on it you know some people will
tell<00:02:12.080> you<00:02:12.140> otherwise<00:02:12.530> they'll<00:02:12.830> say<00:02:12.980> run

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
tell you otherwise they'll say run

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.619 
tell you otherwise they'll say run
around<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.730> map<00:02:13.879> that's<00:02:14.030> how<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.269> learn<00:02:14.450> it

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
around the map that's how you learn it

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.550 
around the map that's how you learn it
well<00:02:15.230> not<00:02:15.769> really<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.549> know<00:02:16.959> when<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:17.989> got<00:02:18.260> when

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
well not really you know when I got when

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.559 
well not really you know when I got when
I<00:02:18.620> first<00:02:18.860> got<00:02:19.040> black<00:02:19.640> ops<00:02:19.909> when<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.150> first<00:02:20.420> got

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
I first got black ops when I first got

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.970 
I first got black ops when I first got
mono<00:02:20.840> more<00:02:21.049> four<00:02:21.230> three<00:02:21.260> one<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.709> first

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
mono more four three one of the first

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.199 
mono more four three one of the first
things<00:02:22.189> I<00:02:22.340> learned<00:02:22.489> how<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.700> do<00:02:22.909> was<00:02:23.090> that

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
things I learned how to do was that

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.300 
things I learned how to do was that
learned<00:02:23.420> how<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.629> camp<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.409> the<00:02:24.860> reason<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.129> did

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
learned how to camp and the reason I did

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.289 
learned how to camp and the reason I did
that<00:02:25.340> is<00:02:25.489> because<00:02:25.700> you<00:02:25.939> start<00:02:26.180> learning

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
that is because you start learning

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.910 
that is because you start learning
traffic<00:02:26.870> patterns<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.500> started<00:02:27.769> learning

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
traffic patterns you started learning

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.119 
traffic patterns you started learning
you<00:02:28.879> know<00:02:29.000> where<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.170> high-traffic<00:02:30.620> areas

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
you know where the high-traffic areas

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.190 
you know where the high-traffic areas
are<00:02:31.340> where<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:31.970> can<00:02:32.060> get<00:02:32.209> flanked<00:02:32.659> from<00:02:32.900> and

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
are where you can get flanked from and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.679 
are where you can get flanked from and
that<00:02:33.950> teaches<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.489> not<00:02:34.639> only<00:02:34.849> how<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.209> defend

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
that teaches you not only how to defend

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.720 
that teaches you not only how to defend
yourself<00:02:36.109> how<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.349> post<00:02:36.620> up<00:02:36.859> in

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
yourself how to post up in

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.570 
yourself how to post up in
you<00:02:38.090> know<00:02:38.349> let<00:02:39.349> people<00:02:39.620> come<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:40.459> it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
you know let people come to you but it

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.220 
you know let people come to you but it
also<00:02:40.700> lets<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.120> know<00:02:41.209> how<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.629> get<00:02:41.840> people<00:02:42.110> out

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
also lets you know how to get people out

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.259 
also lets you know how to get people out
of<00:02:42.409> those<00:02:42.500> spots<00:02:42.830> like<00:02:43.129> if<00:02:43.400> I'm<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.940> really

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
of those spots like if I'm in a really

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.759 
of those spots like if I'm in a really
good<00:02:44.390> spot<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.900> I'm<00:02:44.989> like<00:02:45.140> oh<00:02:45.290> yeah<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.650> is

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
good spot and I'm like oh yeah this is

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.740 
good spot and I'm like oh yeah this is
working<00:02:46.129> I<00:02:46.280> eventually<00:02:46.519> get<00:02:46.790> killed<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.330> know

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
working I eventually get killed I know

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.869 
working I eventually get killed I know
next<00:02:48.230> time<00:02:48.379> somebody's<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.159> spot<00:02:49.400> hey

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
next time somebody's in that spot hey

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.460 
next time somebody's in that spot hey
listen<00:02:50.299> I'm<00:02:50.420> gonna<00:02:50.510> do<00:02:50.750> what<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:50.989> did<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.319> me

did to me and that way you know I kind
of<00:02:58.280> double<00:02:58.610> my<00:02:58.700> learning<00:02:59.090> curve<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.230> see

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
of double my learning curve and you see

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.589 
of double my learning curve and you see
this<00:03:00.500> little<00:03:00.709> church<00:03:01.010> here<00:03:01.280> I'm<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.430> it's<00:03:02.420> kind

this little church here I'm in it's kind

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.240 
this little church here I'm in it's kind
of<00:03:02.660> pointless<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.260> very<00:03:03.470> low<00:03:03.680> traffic<00:03:03.739> I

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
of pointless it's very low traffic I

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.559 
of pointless it's very low traffic I
don't<00:03:04.370> really<00:03:04.489> see<00:03:04.700> too<00:03:04.730> much<00:03:05.000> action<00:03:05.239> other

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
don't really see too much action other

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.869 
don't really see too much action other
than<00:03:05.810> TD<00:03:06.650> and<00:03:06.799> Kill<00:03:06.980> Confirmed<00:03:07.010> domination

than TD and Kill Confirmed domination

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.369

that's<00:03:08.000> real<00:03:08.239> low<00:03:08.420> traffic<00:03:08.659> you<00:03:09.049> see<00:03:09.260> right

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
that's real low traffic you see right

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.990 
that's real low traffic you see right
there<00:03:09.409> I<00:03:09.560> get<00:03:09.739> killed<00:03:09.950> by<00:03:10.129> what<00:03:10.760> do<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:10.910> know

right<00:03:32.090> here<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.269> get<00:03:32.450> into<00:03:32.629> a<00:03:32.660> couple<00:03:32.870> long

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
right here I get into a couple long

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.140 
right here I get into a couple long
range<00:03:33.500> engagements<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:34.609> this<00:03:34.790> guy<00:03:34.940> right

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
range engagements like this guy right

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.000 
range engagements like this guy right
here<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.510> don't<00:03:35.959> stand<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.290> chance<00:03:36.349> picking<00:03:36.920> that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
here I don't stand a chance picking that

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.280
