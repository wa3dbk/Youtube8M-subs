00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.520 
because I like to go to run around fast
what<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.479> light<00:01:48.720> weight<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.290> usually

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
what I have light weight on it usually

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
what I have light weight on it usually
like<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:49.920> extreme<00:01:50.189> conditioning<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
like to use extreme conditioning to

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.910 
like to use extreme conditioning to
complement<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.770> run

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
complement it so not only can I run

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
complement it so not only can I run
faster<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> could<00:01:53.640> run<00:01:53.729> further<00:01:54.000> which

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
faster but I could run further which

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.179 
faster but I could run further which
means<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.290> come<00:01:55.470> around<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:55.860> side<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
means I can come around the back side of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.770 
means I can come around the back side of
enemies<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.579> lot<00:01:56.729> faster<00:01:57.180> than<00:01:57.299> most<00:01:57.570> other

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
enemies a lot faster than most other

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.990 
enemies a lot faster than most other
people<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.130> makes<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.369> easy<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> flank

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
people can so it makes it easy to flank

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
people can so it makes it easy to flank
people<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.810> them<00:02:00.930> from<00:02:01.079> behind<00:02:01.320> really

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
people and get them from behind really

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.050 
people and get them from behind really
quickly<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> know<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.460> this<00:02:02.579> gun

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
quickly you know with this gun

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
quickly you know with this gun
particularly<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.170> know<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.619> dinner<00:02:04.770> for

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
particularly you know it's a dinner for

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740 
particularly you know it's a dinner for
two<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.909> still<00:02:06.270> feels<00:02:06.479> really

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
two to it but it still feels really

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
two to it but it still feels really
strong<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> game<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.160> takes<00:02:08.340> out

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
strong in the game so it takes out

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.100 
strong in the game so it takes out
enemies<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.209> quickly<00:02:09.649> for<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:10.739> lethal<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
enemies really quickly for your lethal I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
enemies really quickly for your lethal I
recommend<00:02:13.110> using<00:02:13.319> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
recommend using the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.210 
recommend using the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
frag grenade and then for the tactical I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.020 
frag grenade and then for the tactical I
recommend<00:02:18.150> using<00:02:18.600> either<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.670> EMP<00:02:20.670> grenade

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
recommend using either the EMP grenade

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.730 
recommend using either the EMP grenade
or<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:23.540> trophy<00:02:24.540> system<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.020> depends<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.440> what

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
or the trophy system it depends on what

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.520 
or the trophy system it depends on what
you're<00:02:26.100> playing<00:02:26.930> EMP<00:02:27.930> grenades<00:02:28.200> your<00:02:28.320> best

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
you're playing EMP grenades your best

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
you're playing EMP grenades your best
for<00:02:28.740> like<00:02:29.150> really<00:02:30.150> objective<00:02:30.600> based<00:02:30.840> games

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
for like really objective based games

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.230 
for like really objective based games
because<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> lot<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.430> people<00:02:32.520> like<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.910> use

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
because a lot of people like to use

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.880 
because a lot of people like to use
stuff<00:02:33.510> like<00:02:33.600> claymores<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.470> bouncing

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
stuff like claymores and bouncing

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.820 
stuff like claymores and bouncing
Betties<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.420> c4<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:37.290> them<00:02:37.470> placed<00:02:37.680> in

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
Betties and c4 and have them placed in

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
Betties and c4 and have them placed in
areas<00:02:38.700> where<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.240> get<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> lot<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.630> foot

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
areas where you get a lot of foot

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.900 
areas where you get a lot of foot
traffic<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.530> throw<00:02:40.920> an<00:02:41.040> EMP<00:02:41.400> grenade<00:02:41.730> down

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
traffic so you throw an EMP grenade down

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
traffic so you throw an EMP grenade down
those<00:02:42.120> areas<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.870> would<00:02:43.050> destroy<00:02:43.140> all<00:02:43.470> those

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
those areas it would destroy all those

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.460 
those areas it would destroy all those
uh<00:02:43.670> devices<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.790> stuff<00:02:45.140> trophy<00:02:46.140> system

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
uh devices and stuff trophy system

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.840 
uh devices and stuff trophy system
really<00:02:46.590> works<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:46.950> good<00:02:47.100> for<00:02:47.280> objectives<00:02:47.760> if

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
really works for good for objectives if

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.790 
really works for good for objectives if
you<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.120> playing<00:02:48.390> inside<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.200> objective<00:02:49.650> if

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.530 
lot of c-4 thrown at you the trophy
system<00:03:02.520> works<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:02.850> well<00:03:03.000> because<00:03:03.300> it

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
system works really well because it

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.410 
system works really well because it
takes<00:03:03.780> out<00:03:03.990> two<00:03:04.020> different<00:03:04.830> ones<00:03:05.160> any<00:03:05.640> it

destroys two objects if you have two of
them<00:03:09.690> on<00:03:09.870> obviously<00:03:10.290> you<00:03:10.530> can<00:03:10.650> throw<00:03:10.830> one<00:03:11.040> out

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
them on obviously you can throw one out
