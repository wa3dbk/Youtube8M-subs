different ways in different heights all
the<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.930> through<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> space<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> most

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the way through the space the most

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.630 
the way through the space the most
affordable<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> doing<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.340> use

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
affordable way of doing this was to use

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.299 
affordable way of doing this was to use
plywood<00:00:57.230> we've<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.379> covered<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.100> in

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
plywood we've then covered that all in

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.029 
plywood we've then covered that all in
one<00:00:59.520> sort<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> liquid<00:01:00.239> process<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.469> paint<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
one sort of liquid process one paint a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
one sort of liquid process one paint a
metallic<00:01:02.489> Fleck<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.149> added<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
metallic Fleck that was added to that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.289 
metallic Fleck that was added to that
and<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.110> epoxy<00:01:04.500> resin<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.700> space<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and an epoxy resin so the space that you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.420 
and an epoxy resin so the space that you
work<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.350> miraculously<00:01:08.010> smooth

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
work on is kind of miraculously smooth

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.620 
work on is kind of miraculously smooth
and<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> underside<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.540> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and the underside is where you

people the plywood structure also

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
people the plywood structure also
allowed<00:01:18.990> us<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.439> wall<00:01:19.830> areas<00:01:20.159> where<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
allowed us to have wall areas where you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.340 
allowed us to have wall areas where you

could put books and items that actually
really<00:01:22.500> domesticate<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.430> spaces

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.350 

one<00:01:28.320> could<00:01:28.530> say<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.550> was<00:01:29.640> inherent<00:01:29.820> risk

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
one could say there was inherent risk

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.390 
one could say there was inherent risk
because<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.050> never<00:01:31.260> been<00:01:31.440> done<00:01:31.500> before<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
because it's never been done before and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370 
because it's never been done before and
we<00:01:32.460> had<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.300> journey<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.080> hope

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
we had to go on the journey and hope

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.500 
we had to go on the journey and hope
that<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.740> worked<00:01:35.010> but<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.880> overall<00:01:36.150> cost

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
that it worked but the overall cost

that it worked but the overall cost
equation<00:01:36.750> was<00:01:37.500> cheaper<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.640> standard

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
