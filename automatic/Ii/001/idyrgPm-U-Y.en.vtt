00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:12.269
 Welcome to a new battlefield 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 the silver mine became this budget 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.720
 practically added with e mobile and 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.930
 now extends the battlefields pool 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.609
 at 1 there is also another one 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.470
 Temple we put you in then 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.410
 another video before but now 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.880
 a quick look to mine and what your tasks 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.850
 this mine is as you see there are 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 mines and each of these 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
 Dare has some rangers you have 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 It just saw this red circle around 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.760
 the car around detects whether the car 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.469
 the alliance or horde heard the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.219
 works like it used to with the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.770
 flags was 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.379
 should get more folders or more 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.480
 alliances are in this circle 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.469
 will mines then just for the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.460
 alliance or for the horde counted that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.199
 is now very important here because you have to 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 Gather resources and these resources 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.150
 are collected over the mines wagons 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.740
 that means best in the beginning 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.520
 engage in smaller groups 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.290
 the mine because of itself always come in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.600
 the middle down with a lift 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.310
 and then try one of the and 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.280
 Depots these are these chambers like it 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.869
 just before the priest looks on 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 arrive and when they arrived there 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.020
 are the points on your account 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.570
 credited 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.799
 Of course, there are different things here 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.229
 long distances to one of these degradation 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.290
 and these ways could influence by 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.540
 he as seen before the part that is the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.659
 soft places can and thus the way 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.369
 the minis influenced once again in 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.189
 mines were yours like the one 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.470
 would not have to come downstairs anymore 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.930
 radius but you only have to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.850
 always stand when alliance 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.270
 player or just player of the other 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.399
 It is usually fractions around the car 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 so that you always fight in the middle 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.320
 where the whole come down because of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.780
 because every team tries right at the beginning 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.789
 because of so many 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
 to claim and who there 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.600
 of course the upper hand retains the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.600
 then wins even the go
