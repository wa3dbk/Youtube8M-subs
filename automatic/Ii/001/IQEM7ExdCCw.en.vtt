tissue<00:00:09.950> paper<00:00:10.309> flowers<00:00:10.610> I<00:00:11.389> was<00:00:11.929> looking<00:00:12.200> for

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
tissue paper flowers I was looking for

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.320 
tissue paper flowers I was looking for
different<00:00:12.650> ways<00:00:12.830> to<00:00:12.860> make<00:00:13.280> them<00:00:13.519> and<00:00:13.820> I<00:00:14.179> had

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
different ways to make them and I had

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.410 
different ways to make them and I had
found<00:00:14.510> one<00:00:14.900> where<00:00:15.769> you<00:00:16.279> needed<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:16.789> stamp<00:00:17.150> out

you had to buy machine and stamp out a
template<00:00:20.060> or<00:00:20.300> something<00:00:20.800> and<00:00:21.800> I<00:00:21.859> thought<00:00:22.130> you

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
template or something and I thought you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.950

something<00:00:24.380> different<00:00:24.529> and<00:00:25.070> it's<00:00:25.430> kind<00:00:25.640> of

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
something different and it's kind of

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:27.880 
something different and it's kind of
morphed<00:00:26.060> into<00:00:26.330> these<00:00:26.900> flowers<00:00:27.350> now<00:00:27.590> these

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
morphed into these flowers now these

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.200 
morphed into these flowers now these
flowers<00:00:28.310> I<00:00:28.430> did<00:00:28.670> with<00:00:30.519> with<00:00:31.519> pattern<00:00:31.970> paper

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
flowers I did with with pattern paper

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.369 
flowers I did with with pattern paper
because<00:00:32.509> I<00:00:32.599> wanted<00:00:32.809> to<00:00:32.899> see<00:00:32.989> how<00:00:33.109> that<00:00:33.170> would

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:33.379 
because I wanted to see how that would

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:34.779 
because I wanted to see how that would
look<00:00:33.409> and<00:00:33.769> it<00:00:34.010> actually<00:00:34.249> turned<00:00:34.670> out<00:00:34.729> pretty

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
look and it actually turned out pretty

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.160 
look and it actually turned out pretty
good

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
good

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.520 
good
this<00:00:36.409> one<00:00:36.620> was<00:00:36.800> striped<00:00:37.129> paper<00:00:37.460> and<00:00:38.289> this<00:00:39.289> one

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
this one was striped paper and this one

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.329 
this one was striped paper and this one
was<00:00:39.739> actually<00:00:39.949> like<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.399> fish<00:00:40.789> paper<00:00:41.829> so<00:00:42.829> those

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
was actually like a fish paper so those

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.590 
was actually like a fish paper so those
turned<00:00:43.579> out<00:00:43.729> better<00:00:43.879> than<00:00:43.969> I<00:00:44.149> thought<00:00:44.179> we're

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
turned out better than I thought we're

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.979 
turned out better than I thought we're
going<00:00:44.629> to<00:00:44.899> do<00:00:45.019> just<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.530> plain<00:00:46.749> plain<00:00:47.749> paper

square depending on your tissue paper

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.240 
square depending on your tissue paper
some<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:44.900> them<00:01:45.020> depending<00:01:45.530> on<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.740> size<00:01:45.950> may

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
some of them depending on the size may

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.710 
some of them depending on the size may
come<00:01:46.490> out<00:01:46.670> rectangular<00:01:47.330> but<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.600> really

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
come out rectangular but it really

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.870 
come out rectangular but it really
doesn't<00:01:47.960> matter<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:49.250> you're<00:01:49.370> going<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.640> just

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
doesn't matter and you're going to just

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.640 
doesn't matter and you're going to just
cut<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.360> circle<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.110> want<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.500> make<00:01:51.620> sure

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
cut a circle and you want to make sure

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.270 
cut a circle and you want to make sure
you<00:01:52.100> cut<00:01:52.460> along<00:01:53.120> every<00:01:53.750> edge<00:01:53.980> because<00:01:54.980> if<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
you cut along every edge because if you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.970 
you cut along every edge because if you
don't<00:01:55.490> part<00:01:56.150> of<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.330> might<00:01:56.510> stick<00:01:56.780> together

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
don't part of it might stick together

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.380 
don't part of it might stick together
where<00:01:57.980> it's<00:01:58.100> folded<00:01:58.520> so<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:58.820> want<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.150> avoid

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
where it's folded so you want to avoid

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.220 
where it's folded so you want to avoid
that<00:01:59.660> so<00:02:00.410> just<00:02:00.620> go<00:02:00.740> ahead<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.370> cut<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.840> circle

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
that so just go ahead and cut the circle

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.040 
that so just go ahead and cut the circle
and<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:04.580> does<00:02:04.760> not<00:02:05.000> have<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.690> perfect

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
and it does not have to be a perfect

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.919 
and it does not have to be a perfect
circle<00:02:07.149> kind<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.300> hold<00:02:08.510> the<00:02:08.630> tissue<00:02:08.840> paper

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
circle kind of hold the tissue paper

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.730 
circle kind of hold the tissue paper
together<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.619> little<00:02:09.800> bit<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:12.290> snaps<00:02:12.560> you

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
together a little bit the snaps you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:32.930 
together a little bit the snaps you
think<00:02:13.010> are<00:02:13.190> difficult<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.700> cut<00:02:13.880> there<00:02:14.090> either

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.300 

now<00:02:33.140> see<00:02:34.140> mine<00:02:34.319> is<00:02:34.349> not<00:02:34.650> even<00:02:35.129> remotely

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
now see mine is not even remotely

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.059 
now see mine is not even remotely
perfect<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.360> don't<00:02:37.290> even<00:02:37.470> think<00:02:37.860> twice<00:02:37.950> about

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
perfect so don't even think twice about

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.240 
perfect so don't even think twice about
that<00:02:38.720> go<00:02:39.720> ahead<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.319> fold<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.739> half<00:02:40.800> again

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
that go ahead and fold it in half again

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.869 
that go ahead and fold it in half again
and<00:02:42.000> now<00:02:42.870> what<00:02:43.050> you're<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.650> is

okay<00:03:21.959> once<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.590> cut<00:03:22.860> you'll<00:03:23.010> have<00:03:23.220> something

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
okay once you cut you'll have something

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.760 
okay once you cut you'll have something
like<00:03:23.940> this<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> shape<00:03:25.020> is<00:03:25.170> different

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
like this that the shape is different

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.110 
like this that the shape is different
don't<00:03:26.520> worry<00:03:26.670> about<00:03:27.349> open<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.440> up<00:03:29.000> just<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
don't worry about open it up just to

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.520 
don't worry about open it up just to
make<00:03:30.300> sure<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:30.870> how<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.050> want<00:03:31.319> it<00:03:31.380> to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
like here I might have a pedal that's

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.320 
like here I might have a pedal that's
too<00:03:35.670> thick

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
you're gonna want to do is fold it and

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.890 
you're gonna want to do is fold it and
you<00:04:46.190> want<00:04:46.400> it<00:04:46.460> to<00:04:46.580> be<00:04:46.730> where<00:04:47.000> it's<00:04:47.210> it's<00:04:47.540> like

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
you want it to be where it's it's like

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.210 
you want it to be where it's it's like
this<00:04:48.140> where<00:04:48.800> you<00:04:49.130> start<00:04:49.430> twisting<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:49.970> and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
this where you start twisting it and

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.630 
this where you start twisting it and
it's<00:04:52.220> down<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:52.880> middle<00:04:54.070> the<00:04:55.070> middle<00:04:55.370> of<00:04:55.520> it

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
it's down in the middle the middle of it

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.730 
it's down in the middle the middle of it
so<00:04:55.820> that<00:04:56.000> when<00:04:56.210> it's<00:04:56.390> upright<00:04:56.900> like<00:04:57.140> this<00:04:57.170> it's

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
so that when it's upright like this it's

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.090 
so that when it's upright like this it's
actually<00:04:58.240> you're<00:04:59.240> seeing<00:04:59.570> the<00:04:59.750> bead<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.590> they

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
actually you're seeing the bead so they

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.190 
actually you're seeing the bead so they
don't<00:05:01.280> make<00:05:01.370> sense<00:05:01.430> as<00:05:01.820> you're<00:05:01.970> doing<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.420> so

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
don't make sense as you're doing it so

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.910 
don't make sense as you're doing it so
twist<00:05:03.470> around<00:05:03.680> nice<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.700> tight<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.800> what

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
twist around nice and tight and what
