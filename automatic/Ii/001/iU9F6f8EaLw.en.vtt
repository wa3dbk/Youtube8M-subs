00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
gonna have the windows XP core captain

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.980 
gonna have the windows XP core captain
the<00:01:01.600> ramp<00:01:02.160> instead<00:01:03.160> of<00:01:03.520> the<00:01:04.449> hard<00:01:04.839> disk<00:01:05.310> so<00:01:06.310> it

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the ramp instead of the hard disk so it

restore before you do this okay and you
don't<00:01:25.990> know<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.500> is<00:01:26.679> look<00:01:27.009> at<00:01:27.160> my<00:01:27.490> system

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
don't know that is look at my system

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.540
