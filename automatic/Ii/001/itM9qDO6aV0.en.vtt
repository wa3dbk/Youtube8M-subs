00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.990

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.139

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.139
 to 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.730
 ah 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.940
 we are here in another video and this time I have 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.970
 decided then 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.699
 cosplay tutorial 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.490
 to see what comes out not everyone came up seeing a 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.860
 rawson video a very nice guy from 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.879
 street I did not know him at all one day 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.430
 Facebook 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.680
 cosplay came out I was watching a video and 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 it came out all a little fail the first 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.180
 attempt to make a cost 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.130
 and I did not dare I felt like it 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.540
 I can prove it is going to be all new like this 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.540
 of first and know how 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.850
 and we are going to work on this which is a 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.410
 power rangers helmet my page 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.580
 cosplay put under you can see 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.020
 more or less the entire process that has 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.470
 followed from the beginning from the 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.110
 cardboard structure the zeal giving 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.000
 paper and tail is the first case I make 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.220
 where this website has no form 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.950
 round should not that should be 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.299
 round 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.740
 all that and start with the practice 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.840
 they do things this is first let's go 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.159
 to give a base of protector 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.710
 lumet highlighted them 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.920
 they sell it buy january and merlin vale 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:37.090
 four euros and with this and to spare never 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.759
 but a good friend of mine who leads to 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.759
 the page family freak also down 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.580
 because he's an uncle who helped me a lot 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.560
 teaches many things 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.670
 and what did this discover me and what is the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.460
 idea to give protective helmet 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.630
 and when it has dried it will begin to paint 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.119
 with a metallic effect paint 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.460
 and then continue giving it another layer another 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.140
 painting another one of protective like that until 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.960
 let's see that we have one more result or 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550
 least of our pleasure as we are going to 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 start a little bit with the list of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.410
 materials that are needed to give the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.500
 protection 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.040
 good as first and most important the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.630
 Plastic protective product bloom after 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.970
 a couple of brushes a small one and 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.370
 big I do not know very well how it will spread 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.210
 and I have taken two sizes so that if one 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 It does not work well 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.490
 rob someone else and a glass to put the 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.830
 product in the glass and not have to walk 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.930
 with a boat so big or run the 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.060
 risk that we drop all the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.430
 first on the ground still protect well the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.140
 table on which we are going to work in 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.330
 this case by cardboard with paper of 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.740
 newspaper that we can keep everything 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.810
 that we want that we are not going to stain anything 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.760
 I have always been of agitan 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.080
 first let's read a little bit the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.080
 instructions that will not be too much 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:00.370
 Ready to use or diluted with water according to 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.040
 the needs of the applications 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:07.080
 Indicative dilution as sealer 1 with 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.270
 3 and varnish 1 with 1 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.760
 I suppose that one with three will be a part 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.580
 of water for three of product and one with 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.980
 one water and one product of all 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.710
 ways the family freak guy has 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.740
 said that as a protector you can use 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.870
 hair without water so I'm going to do it 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.870
 the case and let's try let's open it 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.430
 It does not look like it smudges a little 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.470
 good and like as curious of shit 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:42.470
 I have to read it or the plastic ono smells 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.409
 bad any good or the plastic is very 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.459
 important some paper to clean yourself 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.459
 hands after saving 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.930
 I do not know very well how the fuck 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.550
 and put the product in the glass like that more or 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.950
 less I suppose 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.770
 something tells me that the idea of â€‹â€‹the glass 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.930
 go to take for first feil ass you 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.730
 we're going to pull the pot because this is 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.730
 to start with the big one to see how 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.090
 com 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:00.500
 good as you see because we have given almost 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.500
 all over 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.720
 everything above so now we're going 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.740
 little bit more to the neck part of 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.740
 back and side 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.139
 Y 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.770
 we will give outside and inside there 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.360
 I know if we will give him and if we give him 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.360
 we will give one at the end 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.569
 this is starting to come out a bit already 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.629
 the potato 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:38.939
 in case because I did not know about newspaper and 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.939
 we're shitting the live 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.790
 ah 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.490
 ah 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.280
 I'm going to finish 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.230
 editing and removing all the jokes 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.580
 tacos and shits of mine 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.759

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.759

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.020
 and 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.010
 ah 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.730
 now it's time to let time pass 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.030
 and see how long it takes to dry 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.180
 and think about the next steps that 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.389
 it would be already you can paste the rubber pieces 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.389
 Eve 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.610
