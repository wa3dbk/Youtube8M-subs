started<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:30.539> away<00:00:30.689> diving<00:00:31.170> right<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
started right away diving right into the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
started right away diving right into the
gameplay<00:00:32.009> hopefully<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.149> can<00:00:33.329> close<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.750> out

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
gameplay hopefully we can close this out

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.229 
gameplay hopefully we can close this out
since<00:00:34.200> we're<00:00:34.350> leading<00:00:34.590> 3-2<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> series<00:00:35.280> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
since we're leading 3-2 in the series so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.060 
since we're leading 3-2 in the series so
my<00:00:36.390> game<00:00:36.450> plan<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.050> one<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.890> even

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
my game plan for this one if you even

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.440 
my game plan for this one if you even
want<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> call<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.730> was<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> didn't<00:00:39.420> want

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
want to call it that was I didn't want

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.670 
want to call it that was I didn't want
to<00:00:39.690> let<00:00:39.980> their<00:00:40.980> stars<00:00:41.840> just<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.960> damage<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.559> us

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to let their stars just do damage to us

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.580 
to let their stars just do damage to us
so<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> couldn't<00:00:44.129> let<00:00:44.629> Ricky<00:00:45.629> Rubio<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:46.379> damage

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so I couldn't let Ricky Rubio do damage

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619 
so I couldn't let Ricky Rubio do damage
in<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> pick-and-roll<00:00:47.129> because<00:00:48.030> he's<00:00:48.270> lethal

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
in the pick-and-roll because he's lethal

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.720 
in the pick-and-roll because he's lethal
there<00:00:48.989> as<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> passer<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.190> gotta<00:00:50.370> kind<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
there as a passer you just gotta kind of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.209 
there as a passer you just gotta kind of
sag<00:00:50.910> off<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.360> him<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.690> peck<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.260> itch<00:00:52.469> he<00:00:53.039> can

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
sag off of him a peck of itch he can

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.979 
sag off of him a peck of itch he can
definitely<00:00:53.430> play<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> post<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.690> as

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
definitely play the post really well as

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
definitely play the post really well as
well<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.410> Kevin<00:00:55.739> Love<00:00:55.949> he<00:00:56.219> was<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> biggest

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
well as Kevin Love he was the biggest

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
well as Kevin Love he was the biggest
focus<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> couldn't<00:00:57.750> let<00:00:57.960> him<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.289> open

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
focus for me I couldn't let him get open

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.920 
focus for me I couldn't let him get open
threes<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> just<00:01:00.090> couldn't<00:01:00.359> let<00:01:00.510> him<00:01:00.660> finish

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
threes and just couldn't let him finish

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.959 
threes and just couldn't let him finish
on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> block<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.100> he<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.609> definitely<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
on the block so he was definitely a

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.789 
on the block so he was definitely a
tough<00:01:03.120> player<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.449> guard<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.350> we'll<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
tough player to guard but we'll see if I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.350 
tough player to guard but we'll see if I
can<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> done<00:01:05.250> getting<00:01:05.909> dunks<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
can get it done getting dunks and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.179 
can get it done getting dunks and
everything<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:07.049> away<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> start<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.010> game

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
everything right away to start the game

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.730 
everything right away to start the game
but<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.520> are<00:01:08.640> actually<00:01:08.850> down<00:01:09.360> by<00:01:09.720> two<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:10.590> much

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
but we are actually down by two for much

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
but we are actually down by two for much
of<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> first<00:01:11.130> quarter<00:01:11.520> until<00:01:11.700> Burbank<00:01:12.630> got

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
of the first quarter until Burbank got

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
of the first quarter until Burbank got
that<00:01:12.990> dunk<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.380> go<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.770> then<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.280> tied<00:01:14.520> for

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that dunk to go and then it was tied for

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
that dunk to go and then it was tied for
most<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> rest<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.049> first<00:01:16.350> quarter<00:01:16.680> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
most of the rest of the first quarter so

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.969 
most of the rest of the first quarter so
it's<00:01:17.070> 27<00:01:17.700> 27<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> second<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:19.860> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
it's 27 27 in the second now one of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.219 
it's 27 27 in the second now one of
their<00:01:20.070> players<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> jumper<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.869> would

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
their players it's a jumper and so would

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.870 
their players it's a jumper and so would
they<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.530> up<00:01:22.680> by<00:01:22.830> two<00:01:22.890> once<00:01:23.250> again<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.759> was

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
they are up by two once again so it was

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
they are up by two once again so it was
a<00:01:23.909> neck-and-neck<00:01:24.180> game<00:01:24.770> just<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> way

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
a neck-and-neck game just all the way

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
a neck-and-neck game just all the way
but<00:01:26.549> Hibbert<00:01:26.880> not<00:01:27.210> grabbing<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.780> off<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.200> rim

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
but Hibbert not grabbing it off the rim

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.289 
but Hibbert not grabbing it off the rim
there<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.829> barely<00:01:29.009> fell<00:01:29.400> off<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.180> we

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
there just barely fell off and so we

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
there just barely fell off and so we
actually<00:01:30.420> finally<00:01:30.810> take<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> lead<00:01:31.590> midway

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
actually finally take the lead midway

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
actually finally take the lead midway
through<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> second<00:01:33.299> quarter<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.079> would

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
through the second quarter as I would

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
through the second quarter as I would
say<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> often<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.159> Kevin<00:01:35.880> Martin's<00:01:36.150> got

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
say I often do Kevin Martin's got

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.640 
say I often do Kevin Martin's got
something<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.689> say<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.200> though<00:01:37.439> he

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
something to say about that though he

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
something to say about that though he
had<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> crazy<00:01:38.009> game<00:01:38.340> as<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> guys<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:39.210> he<00:01:39.810> was

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
had a crazy game as you guys see he was

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.710 
had a crazy game as you guys see he was
in<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.320> threes<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.950> open<00:01:41.220> shots

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
in a lot of threes a lot of open shots

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.170 
in a lot of threes a lot of open shots
that<00:01:42.720> he<00:01:42.869> got<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.829> good<00:01:44.040> so

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
that he got that was not good so

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.499 
that he got that was not good so
possibly<00:01:45.180> my<00:01:45.390> focus<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.840> too<00:01:46.079> much<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:47.509> their

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
possibly my focus was too much on their

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.899 
possibly my focus was too much on their
star<00:01:49.259> players<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.920> Kevin<00:01:50.430> Martin<00:01:50.640> he<00:01:50.759> can

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
star players but Kevin Martin he can

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.249 
star players but Kevin Martin he can
definitely<00:01:51.270> knock<00:01:51.390> down<00:01:51.600> shots<00:01:51.869> Corey

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
definitely knock down shots Corey

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.340 
definitely knock down shots Corey
Brewers<00:01:52.649> well<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.479> go<00:01:54.659> up<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.990> some<00:01:55.140> free

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
Brewers well so they go up on some free

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010 
Brewers well so they go up on some free
throws<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.579> low<00:01:56.880> look<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> LOB<00:01:57.479> look

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
throws there and low look the LOB look

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.980 
throws there and low look the LOB look
at<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> LOB<00:01:59.390> things<00:02:00.390> were<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.810> there

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
at the LOB things were all good there

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.530 
at the LOB things were all good there
but<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.310> barely<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.270> lead<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
but we just barely have this lead and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.389 
but we just barely have this lead and
honestly<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> NBA<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.159> real

three-point<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.470> think<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:30.490> those<00:02:30.700> were<00:02:30.850> his

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
three-point I think so those were his

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.780 
three-point I think so those were his
only<00:02:31.120> points<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.620> it's<00:02:33.490> still<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
only points but it's still a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.340 
only points but it's still a
neck-and-neck<00:02:34.030> game<00:02:34.510> unfortunately<00:02:35.230> and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
neck-and-neck game unfortunately and

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.100 
neck-and-neck game unfortunately and
that's<00:02:35.440> not<00:02:35.650> what<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.830> want<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> happen<00:02:36.430> and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
what no one cut to the basket so he took

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.710 
what no one cut to the basket so he took
it<00:04:50.140> himself<00:04:50.200> again<00:04:50.860> for<00:04:51.790> the<00:04:51.880> easy<00:04:52.030> layup<00:04:52.330> so
