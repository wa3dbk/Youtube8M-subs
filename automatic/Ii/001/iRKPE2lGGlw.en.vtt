00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
it will be in like the coming days plus
on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.610> website<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> states<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
on the website it states that this is

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.260 
on the website it states that this is
the<00:00:55.379> first<00:00:55.620> time<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.190> paper<00:00:56.460> mario<00:00:57.030> game

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the first time in a paper mario game

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.150 
the first time in a paper mario game
where<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.660> will<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.899> no<00:00:58.170> experience<00:00:58.920> points

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
where there will be no experience points

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.040 
where there will be no experience points
so<00:00:59.699> i<00:00:59.760> guess<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.059> will<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:00.239> no<00:01:00.420> leveling<00:01:00.899> up

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so i guess there will be no leveling up

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.110 
so i guess there will be no leveling up
and<00:01:01.230> stuff<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.730> nevertheless<00:01:02.730> some

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
then the one with the wii u gamepad

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.059 
then the one with the wii u gamepad
whose<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> will<00:03:41.199> be<00:03:41.319> in<00:03:41.410> their<00:03:41.530> little<00:03:41.739> monkey

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.280 
whose I I will be in their little monkey
ball<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.489> trying<00:03:42.879> to<00:03:43.090> run<00:03:43.299> over<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.049> other

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
ball and trying to run over the other

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.869 
ball and trying to run over the other
players<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.069> it's<00:03:45.190> like<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.310> little<00:03:45.549> mini<00:03:45.699> game

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.099 
players so it's like a little mini game
they<00:03:46.030> can<00:03:46.180> play<00:03:46.329> with<00:03:46.449> your<00:03:46.599> friends<00:03:46.720> and

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
local multiplayer and stuff like that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.059 
local multiplayer and stuff like that
I'm<00:03:49.030> guessing<00:03:49.329> it's<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.540> wii<00:03:49.720> u<00:03:49.870> exclusive

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.379 
cave scene initially but then they'll
like<00:04:33.099> venture<00:04:33.669> off<00:04:33.789> into<00:04:33.969> two<00:04:34.240> different

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
like venture off into two different

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.240 
like venture off into two different
directions<00:04:34.960> since<00:04:35.469> they<00:04:35.650> have<00:04:35.800> two<00:04:36.039> different

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
directions since they have two different

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.550 
directions since they have two different
screens<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:37.030> this<00:04:37.629> really<00:04:37.840> reminds<00:04:38.289> me<00:04:38.469> of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
screens and this really reminds me of

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.869 
screens and this really reminds me of
like<00:04:38.590> split<00:04:39.039> screen<00:04:39.310> mode<00:04:39.520> where<00:04:39.759> you're

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
like split screen mode where you're

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.550 
like split screen mode where you're
playing<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.449> same<00:04:40.659> TV<00:04:41.080> screen<00:04:41.349> but<00:04:41.500> you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
playing on the same TV screen but you

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.290 
playing on the same TV screen but you
have<00:04:41.650> that<00:04:41.710> split<00:04:41.919> down<00:04:42.099> the<00:04:42.159> middle<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.639> you

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
have that split down the middle and you

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.550 
have that split down the middle and you
have<00:04:43.509> two<00:04:43.659> players<00:04:43.840> playing<00:04:44.169> and<00:04:44.319> stuff<00:04:44.439> like

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
have two players playing and stuff like

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.379 
have two players playing and stuff like
that<00:04:44.620> instead<00:04:45.400> of<00:04:45.430> just<00:04:45.639> playing<00:04:45.849> on<00:04:46.000> one<00:04:46.180> TV

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
that instead of just playing on one TV

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.059 
that instead of just playing on one TV
screen<00:04:46.780> you<00:04:46.900> now<00:04:47.080> have<00:04:47.289> those<00:04:47.469> two<00:04:47.680> screens

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
screen you now have those two screens

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:50.730 
screen you now have those two screens
this<00:04:48.610> could<00:04:48.789> like<00:04:49.030> stop<00:04:49.629> people<00:04:49.990> from<00:04:50.110> screen

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
this could like stop people from screen

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.649 
this could like stop people from screen
looking<00:04:51.129> and<00:04:51.310> stuff<00:04:51.520> like<00:04:51.699> that<00:04:51.759> so<00:04:52.509> that

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
looking and stuff like that so that

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.330 
looking and stuff like that so that
might<00:04:52.870> be<00:04:52.900> something<00:04:53.110> Nintendo<00:04:54.039> will<00:04:54.159> take

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
might be something Nintendo will take

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.920 
might be something Nintendo will take
advantage<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.909> lettuce<00:04:55.389> out<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:55.629> wait<00:04:55.810> and

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
if they ever do anything with the patent

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.629 
if they ever do anything with the patent
nevertheless<00:04:59.889> what<00:05:00.159> does<00:05:00.250> have<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.430> wait<00:05:00.550> and

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639
