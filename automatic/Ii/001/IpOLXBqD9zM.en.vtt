thing you keep in mind is that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.080 
thing you keep in mind is that
planetside<00:00:14.700> 2<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.529> not<00:00:16.529> optimized<00:00:17.460> at<00:00:17.820> all

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
planetside 2 is not optimized at all

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380 
planetside 2 is not optimized at all
because<00:00:18.600> it's<00:00:18.930> beta<00:00:19.260> stage<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.369> game<00:00:20.609> there

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
because it's beta stage the game there

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.560 
because it's beta stage the game there
is<00:00:21.539> actually<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.050> no<00:00:22.230> release<00:00:22.529> date<00:00:22.560> yet<00:00:22.800> again

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
date tomorrow maybe so we'll see for
that<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.329> yeah<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.690> game<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.020> not<00:00:34.230> optimized

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that but yeah the game is not optimized

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.860 
that but yeah the game is not optimized
all<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> meant<00:00:35.760> actually<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.510> mid-range

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
all it is meant actually for mid-range

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.250 
all it is meant actually for mid-range
systems<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.700> high<00:00:38.969> res<00:00:39.210> XO<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.110> means

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
systems and not high res XO that means

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.930 
systems and not high res XO that means
even<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> lower<00:00:41.280> graph<00:00:41.579> foot<00:00:41.820> in

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
even if you have a lower graph foot in

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
even if you have a lower graph foot in
this<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.329> problem<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:42.899> max<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
this your problem you will max out the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.760 
this your problem you will max out the
game<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.809> wanted<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> put<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> on

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
game so I just wanted to put this on

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.430 
game so I just wanted to put this on
content<00:00:47.309> as<00:00:47.520> continent<00:00:48.420> sa<00:00:48.570> mère<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
content as continent sa mère because the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.729 
content as continent sa mère because the
newest<00:00:49.710> planet<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.480> it's<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.690> open<00:00:52.110> planet

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
newest planet and it's an open planet

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.060 
newest planet and it's an open planet
with<00:00:53.070> snowy<00:00:53.820> terrain<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.260> might<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
with snowy terrain so I might get a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.189 
with snowy terrain so I might get a
little<00:00:56.370> bit<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.699> frames<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.170> I

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
little bit more frames on that so I

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.740 
little bit more frames on that so I
tried<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.739> fly<00:00:59.010> over<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.699> just<00:01:00.329> drop<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
tried to fly over and just drop the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
tried to fly over and just drop the
plane<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> battle<00:01:02.489> area<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
plane over to like a battle area just to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.370 
plane over to like a battle area just to
see<00:01:03.960> how<00:01:04.589> much<00:01:04.710> concern<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> oh<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.720> i'm<00:01:07.170> bout

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
to linda right here also perhaps lost my

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.039 
to linda right here also perhaps lost my
frames<00:01:10.830> per<00:01:11.040> second<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> 60<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.210> also<00:01:12.810> for

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
overclock pretty much you can go check

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.260 
overclock pretty much you can go check
it<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.590> key<00:01:35.250> play<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.460> using

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.120 
imsi power edition gtx 650ti it was
overclocked<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.810> i<00:01:43.469> really<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.039> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
overclocked and i really don't see a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.709 
overclocked and i really don't see a
different<00:01:44.549> world<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.000> fuck<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.539> seen

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
different world or fuck on be seen

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.529 
different world or fuck on be seen
especially<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.820> i<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.179> to<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.360> like

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
especially because i want to get like

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.429 
especially because i want to get like
five<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.259> ten<00:01:49.469> more<00:01:49.649> frames<00:01:50.869> but<00:01:51.869> i<00:01:51.929> still<00:01:52.229> get

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
five to ten more frames but i still get

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
five to ten more frames but i still get
those<00:01:52.649> massive<00:01:53.130> drop<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:53.700> things<00:01:54.149> are

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
those massive drop because things are

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.940 
those massive drop because things are
optimized<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.020> over<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.409> i'm<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
optimized and over here i'm kind of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.800 
optimized and over here i'm kind of
sneaking<00:01:56.219> behind<00:01:56.780> any<00:01:57.780> lines<00:01:59.899> and<00:02:02.270> yeah<00:02:03.270> using
