point sling really so you just it's
another<00:00:52.920> sling<00:00:53.250> attachment<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.850> almost

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
another sling attachment here almost

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000 
another sling attachment here almost
works<00:00:54.449> at<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> cutie<00:00:54.989> three<00:00:55.260> months<00:00:55.890> but

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
works at a cutie three months but

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.709 
works at a cutie three months but
without<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> cutie<00:00:57.559> um<00:00:58.559> yeah<00:00:59.480> it's<00:01:00.480> has<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
without the cutie um yeah it's has to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.799 
without the cutie um yeah it's has to
rely<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.050> some<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> my<00:01:01.379> real<00:01:01.800> covers<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.809> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
rely on some of my real covers here and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.149 
rely on some of my real covers here and
change<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.110> position<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.739> pressure

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
change the position of my pressure

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
change the position of my pressure
switch<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.610> i<00:01:05.640> could<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.540> chronic<00:01:06.810> begun

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
switch so i could see chronic begun

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.130 
switch so i could see chronic begun
since<00:01:07.470> i'm<00:01:07.650> left<00:01:07.860> handed<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:10.100> yeah<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.340> um

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
since i'm left handed and yeah and um

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.010 
since i'm left handed and yeah and um
the<00:01:13.140> gun<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.320> finally<00:01:13.799> wired<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.670> back

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the gun is finally wired to the back

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.910 
the gun is finally wired to the back
that's<00:01:16.020> why<00:01:16.140> i<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:16.350> buffer<00:01:16.650> tube<00:01:16.799> off

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that's why i have my buffer tube off

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
that's why i have my buffer tube off
here<00:01:17.130> i<00:01:19.729> just<00:01:20.729> wanted<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.150> give<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> simple

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
here i just wanted to give you a simple

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.340 
here i just wanted to give you a simple
fire<00:01:21.960> test<00:01:22.460> there's<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> old<00:01:23.970> CTR<00:01:24.630> stock<00:01:24.900> i'm

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
fire test there's the old CTR stock i'm

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.340 
fire test there's the old CTR stock i'm
still<00:01:25.650> using<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:27.650> all<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> plug<00:01:31.229> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
still using this all right so plug this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.749 
still using this all right so plug this
thing<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:33.079> 11.1<00:01:34.610> lithium<00:01:35.610> polymer

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
thing in the 11.1 lithium polymer

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.710 
thing in the 11.1 lithium polymer
battery<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:37.229> Hong<00:01:38.159> power<00:01:38.430> believe<00:01:39.180> its<00:01:39.329> bite

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
battery to Hong power believe its bite

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.280 
battery to Hong power believe its bite
energy<00:01:40.110> i'm<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.340> sure<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.729> um<00:01:42.420> yeah<00:01:43.020> let's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
energy i'm not sure but um yeah let's

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.340 
energy i'm not sure but um yeah let's
show<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:45.060> um<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.689> thing<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.110> fully

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
show you so um this thing is it fully

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.060 
show you so um this thing is it fully
charged<00:01:46.829> believe<00:01:48.740> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> charge<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:52.070> but

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
charged believe have to charge it but

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
charged believe have to charge it but
the<00:01:53.460> rate<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> fire<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.329> pretty<00:01:54.570> immense<00:01:54.840> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the rate of fire is pretty immense you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.820 
the rate of fire is pretty immense you
semi

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.040 

and<00:02:00.830> there's<00:02:00.980> a<00:02:01.040> lot<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:05.660> that<00:02:05.870> rate

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
and there's a lot of this is that rate

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.120 
and there's a lot of this is that rate
of<00:02:06.140> fire<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.350> crazy<00:02:07.010> right<00:02:08.200> luckily<00:02:09.200> for<00:02:09.470> me<00:02:09.590> KW

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
of fire is crazy right luckily for me KW

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.560 
of fire is crazy right luckily for me KW
these<00:02:10.220> internals<00:02:10.729> can<00:02:10.880> handle<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.240> light<00:02:11.390> pole
