and what people are telling you and how
we're<00:02:21.970> trying<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.360> increase<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.900> situational

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
we're trying to increase the situational

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.760 
we're trying to increase the situational
awareness<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:24.520> interoperability<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:26.050> so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
awareness with interoperability is so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.670 
awareness with interoperability is so
that<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> sailor<00:02:27.520> or<00:02:27.820> soldier<00:02:27.880> or<00:02:28.420> marine<00:02:28.720> or

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
that the sailor or soldier or marine or

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.949 
that the sailor or soldier or marine or
the<00:02:29.860> Coast<00:02:30.100> Guardsman<00:02:30.550> can<00:02:31.030> actually<00:02:31.480> take

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
the Coast Guardsman can actually take

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.770 
the Coast Guardsman can actually take
control<00:02:32.080> of<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.740> payload<00:02:33.100> himself<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:37.540> see

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
control of the payload himself to see

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.680 
control of the payload himself to see
exactly<00:02:38.230> what's<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.680> on<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.550> case<00:02:39.790> we

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
exactly what's going on in this case we

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.720 
exactly what's going on in this case we
can<00:02:40.840> identify<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.410> high<00:02:41.740> high<00:02:42.370> value

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
can identify the high high value

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.920 
can identify the high high value
individual<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.709> board<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.160> boat<00:02:45.930> it

individual and board the right boat it

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.290 
individual and board the right boat it
is<00:02:46.990> cool<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:47.890> now<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.310> an<00:02:48.430> imperative<00:02:48.700> you

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
is cool but now it's an imperative you

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.270 
is cool but now it's an imperative you

of proof of concept is showing that we

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.670 
of proof of concept is showing that we
can<00:03:01.060> we<00:03:01.390> can<00:03:01.540> go<00:03:01.690> back<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.019> what<00:03:02.170> we<00:03:02.320> what<00:03:02.650> we

have what we're living with today fix it

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.780 
have what we're living with today fix it
for<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.260> future<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:05.830> then<00:03:06.190> going<00:03:06.489> forward

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
for the future and then going forward

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.580 
for the future and then going forward
build<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.420> right<00:03:07.600> way<00:03:07.810> so<00:03:07.840> it's<00:03:08.230> an<00:03:08.320> open

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
build it the right way so it's an open

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.590 
build it the right way so it's an open
architecture<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:09.370> everybody<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:10.390> plug

architecture that everybody can plug

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.479 
architecture that everybody can plug
into<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.230> pull<00:03:11.440> out<00:03:11.620> up<00:03:11.800> and<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.220> common
