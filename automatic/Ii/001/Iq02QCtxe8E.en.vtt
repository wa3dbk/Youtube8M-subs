00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello welcome to qvc beauty i am 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.910
 there is one again today 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 I was very happy with the swatch party 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.230
 I 'm glad and so I have this time 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.289
 an entire lipstick range of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.930
 bern - this is the maxime lipstick 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.850
 palette with a total of five different 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.740
 colors but the palette is a bit 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.859
 divided differently and although she sees 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.630
 First of what I send out very much 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 find and here is just this 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 heat knowles lettering I find very 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.690
 Chic is really made smart here 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.559
 behind are color information also 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.329
 What's your name 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.070
 and if you turn it on then 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 It looks like this one man 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.690
 has such a mirror down here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.820
 and then these are just these hands 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.960
 and you can also exchange if 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.399
 So, you might want to be like you 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.110
 so much can be seen in here now 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.500
 drive so this range has room for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.600
 four cases and then there is one more 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 clou me here this little one 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.410
 flag and there is another 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 Single ride in here down here with the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 mirror and next to it a color and that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.320
 It's just great that you can do this 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.479
 I can change windows 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.790
 could be a thread now 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.130
 from this other a large range 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.720
 Take, for example, achieved 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.430
 any color i 'm just out here and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 then just change with this other 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 color for example then I just yes 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 this little by the just for example for 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.350
 on the way or if I am 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 maybe a little longer to travel 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.890
 I can then also this entire 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.990
 take palette and just the colors so 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.100
 exchange as I need it yes 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.180
 I find it really convenient and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.250
 Above all things there is still there 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.320
 such a lipstick brush with it and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.280
 yes, that 's pretty good, by the way 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.570
 I have it now, too 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.009
 used and he does not have any now 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.420
 So hair is lost for that too 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 really well but now it works 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.720
 first off with the colors or 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.970
 actually party in the lot and start 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.460
 I'm here with the right color 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.470
 that's such an apricot stone too 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.850
 swimmer share and I have here 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.710
 once again on the back of the hand 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 and maybe you can see that he is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.630
 I am not commenting very well now 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.549
 but found on the lips had this 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 shimmer proportion but quite strong so 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.670
 you can see that in any case if already 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.070
 So nothing is done, the must 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 surface a bit gentler so far 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.619
 apply less 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.720
 but otherwise it's really a lot 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.780
 beautiful apricot the next color is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 this one 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.640
 the unstoppable that's such a pink 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.370
 color has no shimmer proportion and 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.280
 yes I think the pigmented better 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.410
 as now, the apricot and halt 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.030
 such a typical pink so this range 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.319
 is a bit mixed anyway 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.340
 So it's not all in one 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.030
 direction of travel 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.560
 there is something about everything but red 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.780
 So I find myself in this range 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.980
 not now but yes so the peephole 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.510
 sometimes very nice then come 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.430
 We now have that color here that it 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.260
 the never observed that is a beautiful 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.420
 age pink tone of neither 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.530
 swimmer or guitar particle has the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.239
 I have down here also again 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.820
 slipped and yes I have to say that 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.709
 find such rosÃ© tones are yes 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.830
 always perfect for everyday life or too 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.360
 office if you just have nothing too strong 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.550
 but still wants to be well maintained 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.630
 then want to look like those are 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.550
 pink tones just perfect and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.440
 I think that's synonymous for every guy 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.390
 Therefore, I think that's how it should be 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.830
 a really nice everyday color too 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.330
 in this palette is then come in 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.340
 we now vigorously to the two quads 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.860
 nuances namely here once the raise 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.860
 the wall that 's such a nice raspberry 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.420
 sound like a hefty juicy bertone the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.579
 I'm fine and he has 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.980
 again mother of pearl shimmer so yes 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.810
 shimmer proportion and you can 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.070
 Incidentally, even so one can make the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.360
 also colors among each other 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.850
 bit of a mission so if you go now 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.500
 such a color takes no one 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.670
 has shimmer there you can as a talker yet 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.440
 put it on for example the 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.940
 apricot colors with slight shimmer 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.530
 then you have courage sometimes in this case 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.790
 Shine if you want to have that for 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.100
 example now for the evening if you still 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.540
 Let's go out so I think that is 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.890
 palette also very suitable that one 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.579
 so a little bit in it can mix so 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.140
 as you like 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.940
 Last but not least , we come to the song 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.100
 the way and that's a really nice one 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.170
 Bromberg said so right 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.459
 strong also from the color and the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.720
 I have the swatch and there again 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.780
 I have to say so I think that 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.829
 Order now with these off the 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.760
 lipstick brush was present 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:02.019
 That will not be quite evenly so 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.820
 it gets a bit spotty like that 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.440
 I bit grazing that it must be because 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.790
 invest a little more time 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.950
 I think so right now because of this 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.989
 dark color that's just fine 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.489
 looks uniform but otherwise is 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.310
 Of course the color is great and I have to 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.720
 say also from the comfort are these 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.859
 levels lipsticks or even now 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.459
 this palette is really nice here 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.590
 enjoyable 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.270
 that is again out of this - maxi 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.889
 but they are not like that now 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.690
 lipgloss that somehow still on the 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.669
 lips so tingle so that's what they do 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.949
 but I can not say now 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.930
 normal lipsticks just too 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.180
 pleasant are the wearing comfort and 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.680
 nice and nurturing and I find the range 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.300
 stop also so pretty so I think that's 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.949
 made very pretty by design and 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.449
 just that one too, this little one 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.099
 can have packages with you 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.050
 On the way, I also find it very convenient 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:45.220
 Yes, that 's it, write me down 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.259
 this palette now too 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.879
 interested and what colors you like that 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.919
 now found the most beautiful is from the 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.729
 palette and then i hope we see each other 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.729
 next time again
