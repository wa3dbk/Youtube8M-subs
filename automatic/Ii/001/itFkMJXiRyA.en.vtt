the second class we're going to talk

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.890 
the second class we're going to talk
about<00:00:19.550> operating<00:00:20.550> leverage<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.630> first

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
about operating leverage so this first

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.130 
about operating leverage so this first
video<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.789> first<00:00:24.119> class<00:00:26.930> in<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> last

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
video is for the first class in the last

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.109 
video is for the first class in the last
chapter<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:28.800> learned<00:00:29.010> how<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.460> breakeven

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
chapter we learned how to do breakeven

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.959 
chapter we learned how to do breakeven
for<00:00:30.300> companies<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:31.890> produce<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.730> sell<00:00:32.940> only

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
for companies that produce and sell only

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.950 
for companies that produce and sell only
one<00:00:33.450> product<00:00:34.190> most<00:00:35.190> companies<00:00:35.760> sell<00:00:36.480> more

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
one product most companies sell more

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.990 
one product most companies sell more
than<00:00:37.200> one<00:00:37.380> products<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.640> bring<00:00:38.820> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
than one products so we have to bring in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.030 
than one products so we have to bring in
the<00:00:39.180> idea<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:40.280> breakeven<00:00:42.170> using<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.620> idea<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the idea of breakeven using the idea of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.700 
the idea of breakeven using the idea of
sales<00:00:44.640> mix<00:00:45.000> now<00:00:45.300> sales<00:00:45.660> mix<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> relative

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
sales mix now sales mix is that relative

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.940 
sales mix now sales mix is that relative
percentage<00:00:47.930> in<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> company<00:00:49.680> sells

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
percentage in which the company sells

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
percentage in which the company sells
its<00:00:50.129> product<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> company's<00:00:51.570> unit<00:00:51.870> sales

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
its product so if a company's unit sales

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.229 
its product so if a company's unit sales
are<00:00:52.320> 80<00:00:52.500> percent<00:00:52.980> printers<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.699> 20<00:00:54.030> percent

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
are 80 percent printers and 20 percent

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.650 
are 80 percent printers and 20 percent
computers<00:00:55.110> its<00:00:55.350> sales<00:00:55.620> mix<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.250> 80/20<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
computers its sales mix is 80/20 and

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.709 
computers its sales mix is 80/20 and
this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.559> important<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.719> different

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this is important because different

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
this is important because different
products<00:01:01.350> have<00:01:01.620> different<00:01:02.160> contribution

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
products have different contribution

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.219 
products have different contribution
margins<00:01:04.880> companies<00:01:05.880> can<00:01:06.240> compute<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
margins companies can compute the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.980 
margins companies can compute the
break-even<00:01:07.650> sales<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.700> mix<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.270> two<00:01:09.750> or

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
break-even sales for the mix of two or

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.350 
break-even sales for the mix of two or
more<00:01:10.020> products<00:01:10.920> by<00:01:11.640> using<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.119> technique

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
more products by using a technique

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.840 
more products by using a technique
called<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> weighted<00:01:13.530> average<00:01:14.220> unit

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
called the weighted average unit

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
called the weighted average unit
contribution<00:01:15.299> margin<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.220> weighted

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
contribution margin that is the weighted

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.030 
contribution margin that is the weighted
average<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> contribution<00:01:19.020> margin<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
average of the contribution margin of

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.830 
average of the contribution margin of
all<00:01:20.280> products<00:01:21.030> weighted<00:01:21.960> by<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.840> percentage

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
all products weighted by the percentage

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.190 
all products weighted by the percentage
of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.470> sales<00:01:25.770> mix<00:01:27.619> for<00:01:28.619> example<00:01:28.710> Vargo<00:01:29.490> sells

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
of the sales mix for example Vargo sells

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.170 
of the sales mix for example Vargo sells
camcorders<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.520> television<00:01:32.520> sets<00:01:32.820> because

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
camcorders and television sets because

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
camcorders and television sets because
it<00:01:33.479> sells<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> products<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.680> following

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it sells to products and following

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.609 
it sells to products and following
amounts<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:36.119> hundred<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.450> fifty<00:01:36.900> one

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
amounts one hundred and fifty one

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.899 
amounts one hundred and fifty one
thousand<00:01:38.430> five<00:01:38.549> hundred<00:01:38.610> camcorders<00:01:39.450> 500<00:01:40.020> tvs

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
thousand five hundred camcorders 500 tvs

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.219 
thousand five hundred camcorders 500 tvs
therefore<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> sales<00:01:42.299> mix<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.840> add<00:01:42.990> these

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
therefore the sales mix you add these

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.950 
therefore the sales mix you add these
two<00:01:43.530> together<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:44.520> two<00:01:44.939> thousand<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.720> sell

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
two together is two thousand they sell

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.880 
two together is two thousand they sell
in<00:01:46.140> total<00:01:46.820> seventy<00:01:47.820> five<00:01:48.030> percent<00:01:48.890> camcorders

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
in total seventy five percent camcorders

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.280 
in total seventy five percent camcorders
15<00:01:50.640> divided<00:01:51.060> by<00:01:53.119> 2025<00:01:54.119> percent<00:01:54.659> TVs<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> now<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
15 divided by 2025 percent TVs so now in

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.490 
15 divided by 2025 percent TVs so now in
this<00:01:58.409> example<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.250> Vargo<00:01:59.729> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.259> sales

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this example for Vargo we have the sales

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.749 
this example for Vargo we have the sales
mix<00:02:01.740> 75<00:02:02.340> camcorders<00:02:03.119> 25<00:02:03.630> TV<00:02:04.110> now<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:05.159> look<00:02:05.460> at

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
mix 75 camcorders 25 TV now we look at

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.630 
mix 75 camcorders 25 TV now we look at
the<00:02:06.000> selling<00:02:06.420> price<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:07.140> camcorders<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.009> 500

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the selling price for camcorders is 500

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.160 
the selling price for camcorders is 500
the<00:02:08.729> variable<00:02:09.060> cost<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.420> 3<00:02:09.690> therefore<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the variable cost is 3 therefore the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.650 
the variable cost is 3 therefore the
contribution<00:02:10.770> margin

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
contribution margin

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.100 
contribution margin
is<00:02:11.930> 200<00:02:12.790> for<00:02:13.790> television<00:02:14.330> they<00:02:14.450> sell<00:02:14.690> for<00:02:14.870> more

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
is 200 for television they sell for more

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.380 
is 200 for television they sell for more
a<00:02:15.170> thousand<00:02:15.980> they're<00:02:16.490> variable<00:02:16.910> costs<00:02:17.270> are

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
a thousand they're variable costs are

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.750 
a thousand they're variable costs are
500<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.260> contribution<00:02:18.890> margins<00:02:19.310> buy<00:02:19.520> them

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
500 and contribution margins buy them

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.010 
500 and contribution margins buy them
and<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> see<00:02:20.270> these<00:02:20.450> products<00:02:20.870> have

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
and so you see these products have

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.550 
and so you see these products have
different<00:02:21.640> contribution<00:02:22.640> margins<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:24.140> fixed

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
different contribution margins the fixed

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.720 
different contribution margins the fixed
cost<00:02:24.830> is<00:02:25.250> common<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.330> both<00:02:26.440> products<00:02:27.440> both

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
cost is common to both products both

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.130 
cost is common to both products both
camcorders<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.760> tinu<00:02:29.180> fixed<00:02:29.540> costs<00:02:29.870> would<00:02:29.960> be

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
camcorders and tinu fixed costs would be

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.560 
camcorders and tinu fixed costs would be
the<00:02:30.260> building<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.610> electricity<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
the building and the electricity and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.530 
the building and the electricity and
then<00:02:32.840> stand<00:02:33.610> senior<00:02:34.610> management<00:02:35.120> things<00:02:35.360> like

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
then stand senior management things like

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.480 
then stand senior management things like
that<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.680> they're<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.980> same<00:02:37.190> for<00:02:37.370> both

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
that so they're the same for both

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.520 
that so they're the same for both
products<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.210> can't<00:02:38.720> divide<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.260> fixed

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
products so we can't divide the fixed

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.290 
products so we can't divide the fixed
cost<00:02:39.740> between<00:02:39.950> these<00:02:40.310> two<00:02:40.490> products<00:02:40.940> we<00:02:41.120> have

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
cost between these two products we have

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.000 
cost between these two products we have
to<00:02:41.510> use<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:42.440> sales<00:02:42.740> mix<00:02:44.380> now<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.620> we<00:02:45.770> have

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
to use the sales mix now that we have

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.970 
to use the sales mix now that we have
the<00:02:46.250> sales<00:02:46.550> mix<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.300> next<00:02:47.660> step<00:02:47.930> is<00:02:48.770> to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
the sales mix the next step is to

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.510 
the sales mix the next step is to
determine<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:51.260> weighted<00:02:51.770> average

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
determine the weighted average

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.600 
determine the weighted average
contribution<00:02:53.330> margin<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.770> to<00:02:54.830> do<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.280> we

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
contribution margin so to do that we

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.060 
contribution margin so to do that we
take<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.530> contribution<00:02:57.530> margin<00:02:57.680> for

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
take the contribution margin for

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.360 
take the contribution margin for
camcorders<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.240> 200<00:03:00.160> times<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
camcorders which is 200 times the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.350 
camcorders which is 200 times the
percentage<00:03:02.060> point<00:03:02.450> 7<00:03:02.930> 5<00:03:03.200> sales<00:03:03.890> percent<00:03:04.400> plus

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
percentage point 7 5 sales percent plus

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.810

the<00:03:05.510> contribution<00:03:05.780> margin<00:03:06.260> for<00:03:06.710> TV<00:03:07.280> which<00:03:07.640> is

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
the contribution margin for TV which is

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.190 
the contribution margin for TV which is
500<00:03:09.400> contribution<00:03:10.400> margin<00:03:10.670> per<00:03:10.700> unit<00:03:11.200> times

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
500 contribution margin per unit times

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.640 
500 contribution margin per unit times
the<00:03:12.380> percentage<00:03:12.980> point<00:03:13.250> 2<00:03:13.520> 5<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:15.320> answer

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
the percentage point 2 5 and the answer

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.690 
the percentage point 2 5 and the answer
we<00:03:15.800> get<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.390> weighted<00:03:17.390> average<00:03:17.600> unit

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
we get is a weighted average unit

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.720 
we get is a weighted average unit
contribution<00:03:19.700> margin<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.980> 275<00:03:21.980> dollars<00:03:24.730> then

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
contribution margin of 275 dollars then

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.970 
contribution margin of 275 dollars then
we<00:03:26.420> use<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:27.200> weighted<00:03:27.590> average

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
we use this weighted average

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.100 
we use this weighted average
contribution<00:03:28.730> margin<00:03:29.240> to<00:03:29.570> compute<00:03:29.990> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
contribution margin to compute the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.640 
contribution margin to compute the
breakeven<00:03:30.800> so<00:03:31.490> we<00:03:31.670> have<00:03:31.880> 275<00:03:32.810> as<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> way<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:33.410> add

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
breakeven so we have 275 as a way to add

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
breakeven so we have 275 as a way to add
the<00:03:33.830> contribution<00:03:34.459> margin<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:35.360> fixed<00:03:35.660> cost

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
the contribution margin the fixed cost

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.750 
the contribution margin the fixed cost
for<00:03:36.760> 275<00:03:37.760> thousand<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:40.160> weighted<00:03:40.459> average

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
for 275 thousand the weighted average

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.870 
for 275 thousand the weighted average
contribution<00:03:41.420> margin<00:03:41.750> per<00:03:41.900> unit<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.850> 275

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
contribution margin per unit is 275

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.880 
contribution margin per unit is 275
therefore<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.720> break-even<00:03:44.930> point<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.830> a

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
therefore the break-even point is a

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.780 
therefore the break-even point is a
thousand<00:03:46.670> units

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
thousand units

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.120 
thousand units
now<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.000> break-even<00:03:50.510> point<00:03:51.020> is<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.440> thousand

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
now that break-even point is a thousand

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.130 
now that break-even point is a thousand
units<00:03:52.520> of<00:03:52.670> both<00:03:53.239> products<00:03:55.480> okay<00:03:56.480> we<00:03:56.750> need<00:03:56.930> to

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
units of both products okay we need to

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.770 
units of both products okay we need to
sell<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.410> thousand<00:03:58.010> units<00:03:58.340> together<00:03:58.780> assuming

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
sell a thousand units together assuming

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.350 
sell a thousand units together assuming
the<00:03:59.870> sales<00:04:00.080> mix<00:04:00.350> is<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> same<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.880> therefore

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
the sales mix is the same so therefore

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.870 
the sales mix is the same so therefore
we<00:04:02.510> break<00:04:02.780> it<00:04:02.959> down<00:04:03.140> by<00:04:03.800> the<00:04:03.860> percentage<00:04:04.700> of

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
we break it down by the percentage of

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.620 
we break it down by the percentage of
the<00:04:04.970> sales<00:04:05.239> mix<00:04:05.800> thousand<00:04:06.800> units<00:04:07.250> kind<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.180> 75

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
the sales mix thousand units kind of 75

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.729 
the sales mix thousand units kind of 75
percent<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:09.140> must<00:04:09.350> sell<00:04:09.560> 750<00:04:10.430> camcorders<00:04:11.060> and

and that equals my fixed costs so that

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.910 
and that equals my fixed costs so that

we need the contribution margin ratio or
percentage<00:05:05.919> so<00:05:06.919> if<00:05:07.039> I<00:05:07.129> have<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.340> company<00:05:07.879> here

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
percentage so if I have a company here

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.600 
percentage so if I have a company here
kale<00:05:08.599> garden<00:05:09.050> supplies<00:05:09.469> it<00:05:09.710> has<00:05:09.860> indoor<00:05:10.219> plant

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
kale garden supplies it has indoor plant

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.339 
kale garden supplies it has indoor plant
and<00:05:10.879> outdoor<00:05:11.300> plants<00:05:11.719> there's<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.110> total

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:12.349 
and outdoor plants there's the total

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:16.600 
and outdoor plants there's the total
sales<00:05:13.449> so<00:05:14.449> you<00:05:14.509> can<00:05:14.749> see<00:05:14.990> the<00:05:15.560> total<00:05:15.830> sales<00:05:16.249> is

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
sales so you can see the total sales is

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.499 
sales so you can see the total sales is
a<00:05:16.849> million<00:05:17.509> and<00:05:17.719> they<00:05:18.379> sell<00:05:18.620> 200<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.490> or<00:05:19.699> 800

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
a million and they sell 200 and or 800

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.769 
a million and they sell 200 and or 800
outdoor<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:21.979> therefore<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.939> percentage<00:05:23.539> of

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779 
outdoor so therefore the percentage of

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:26.469 
outdoor so therefore the percentage of
sales<00:05:24.110> mix<00:05:24.469> as<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.710> first<00:05:25.069> step<00:05:25.279> get<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.240> sales

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
sales mix as a first step get the sales

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.980 
sales mix as a first step get the sales
mix<00:05:26.749> 20%<00:05:27.680> indoor<00:05:28.279> 80%<00:05:29.210> outdoor

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
mix 20% indoor 80% outdoor

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.179 
mix 20% indoor 80% outdoor
now<00:05:30.889> for<00:05:31.189> the<00:05:31.250> CMR<00:05:31.729> it's<00:05:32.210> simply<00:05:32.750> a

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:33.189 
now for the CMR it's simply a

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.459 
now for the CMR it's simply a
contribution<00:05:34.189> margin<00:05:34.639> as<00:05:34.819> a<00:05:35.539> percentage<00:05:36.199> of

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
contribution margin as a percentage of

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.519 
contribution margin as a percentage of
sales<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.729> so<00:05:38.689> therefore<00:05:39.199> the<00:05:39.349> contribution

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
sales and so therefore the contribution

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.089 
sales and so therefore the contribution
margin<00:05:40.009> ratio<00:05:40.569> for<00:05:41.569> indoor<00:05:41.990> plant<00:05:42.349> is<00:05:42.590> 80

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
margin ratio for indoor plant is 80

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:47.200 
margin ratio for indoor plant is 80
divided<00:05:43.580> by<00:05:44.020> 240<00:05:45.099> and<00:05:46.099> for<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.550> outdoor<00:05:46.909> plant

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
divided by 240 and for the outdoor plant

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.600 
divided by 240 and for the outdoor plant
it's<00:05:47.779> 30<00:05:48.219> so<00:05:49.219> on<00:05:49.939> a<00:05:50.569> combined<00:05:50.990> base<00:05:51.229> is<00:05:51.589> 32<00:05:52.370> but

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
it's 30 so on a combined base is 32 but

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.709 
it's 30 so on a combined base is 32 but
we<00:05:52.699> don't<00:05:52.939> need<00:05:53.210> that<00:05:53.270> combined<00:05:54.229> base<00:05:55.539> okay<00:05:56.539> to

00:05:56.709 --> 00:05:56.719 
we don't need that combined base okay to

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.719 
we don't need that combined base okay to
calculate<00:05:57.229> the<00:05:57.409> break-even<00:05:57.680> then<00:05:58.219> first<00:05:58.580> the

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
calculate the break-even then first the

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.790 
calculate the break-even then first the
way<00:05:58.819> that<00:05:58.999> I<00:05:59.089> was<00:05:59.240> contribution<00:05:59.900> margin<00:06:00.319> for

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
way that I was contribution margin for

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.510 
way that I was contribution margin for
the<00:06:00.889> indoor<00:06:01.219> plant<00:06:01.580> it<00:06:02.389> was<00:06:02.539> point<00:06:02.839> four<00:06:03.229> zero

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
the indoor plant it was point four zero

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.570 
the indoor plant it was point four zero
times<00:06:04.520> the<00:06:04.759> sales<00:06:04.969> mix<00:06:05.300> of<00:06:05.509> 20<00:06:05.870> percent

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
times the sales mix of 20 percent

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.649 
times the sales mix of 20 percent
contribution<00:06:07.580> margin<00:06:08.089> ratio<00:06:08.120> for<00:06:08.569> the

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
contribution margin ratio for the

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.670 
contribution margin ratio for the
outdoor<00:06:09.050> was<00:06:09.319> 0.3<00:06:10.009> 0<00:06:10.400> times<00:06:11.389> the<00:06:11.930> sales<00:06:12.259> mix<00:06:12.439> of

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
outdoor was 0.3 0 times the sales mix of

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.459 
outdoor was 0.3 0 times the sales mix of
80<00:06:13.419> so<00:06:14.419> we<00:06:14.539> get<00:06:14.719> a<00:06:14.899> weighted<00:06:15.349> average

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:15.469 
80 so we get a weighted average

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.260 
80 so we get a weighted average
contribution<00:06:15.949> margin<00:06:16.610> ratio<00:06:16.639> of<00:06:17.740> 0.32<00:06:19.270> now

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
contribution margin ratio of 0.32 now

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.139 
contribution margin ratio of 0.32 now
second<00:06:20.750> calculate<00:06:21.199> the<00:06:21.319> break-even<00:06:21.649> point

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:22.149 
second calculate the break-even point

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:24.639 
second calculate the break-even point
three<00:06:23.149> hundred<00:06:23.449> thousand<00:06:24.080> was<00:06:24.259> the<00:06:24.439> fixed

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:24.649 
three hundred thousand was the fixed

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:29.409 
three hundred thousand was the fixed
costs<00:06:25.389> so<00:06:26.389> I<00:06:26.419> divide<00:06:26.779> that<00:06:27.020> by<00:06:27.319> 0.32<00:06:28.310> and<00:06:28.610> I

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
costs so I divide that by 0.32 and I

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.329 
costs so I divide that by 0.32 and I
have<00:06:29.689> in<00:06:29.899> sales<00:06:30.680> dollars

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:31.339 
have in sales dollars

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:36.939 
have in sales dollars
I<00:06:31.550> must<00:06:32.419> produce<00:06:33.849> 937<00:06:34.849> thousand<00:06:35.649> five<00:06:36.649> hundred

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:36.949 
I must produce 937 thousand five hundred

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:41.110 
I must produce 937 thousand five hundred
dollars<00:06:37.550> in<00:06:37.789> sales<00:06:38.750> revenue<00:06:39.639> in<00:06:40.639> order<00:06:40.849> to

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
dollars in sales revenue in order to

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.769 
dollars in sales revenue in order to
break<00:06:41.330> even<00:06:41.539> so<00:06:42.789> with<00:06:43.789> the<00:06:44.029> break-even<00:06:44.509> sales

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:44.779 
break even so with the break-even sales

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:49.450 
break even so with the break-even sales
of<00:06:45.610> 937<00:06:46.610> in<00:06:46.939> sales<00:06:47.240> mix<00:06:47.389> of<00:06:47.539> 80/20<00:06:48.139> I<00:06:48.460> break

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
of 937 in sales mix of 80/20 I break

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.290 
of 937 in sales mix of 80/20 I break
that<00:06:49.729> down<00:06:50.649> twenty<00:06:51.649> percent<00:06:52.099> of<00:06:52.219> it<00:06:52.339> is<00:06:52.550> indoor

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
that down twenty percent of it is indoor

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:00.999 
that down twenty percent of it is indoor
so<00:06:54.169> 20%<00:06:54.529> times<00:06:55.539> 937<00:06:56.560> and<00:06:57.969> 80%<00:06:58.969> is<00:06:59.270> outdoor<00:07:00.020> so

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
so 20% times 937 and 80% is outdoor so

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:04.029 
so 20% times 937 and 80% is outdoor so
sales<00:07:01.460> mix<00:07:01.759> is<00:07:01.909> 50/50<00:07:02.599> the<00:07:03.379> weighted<00:07:03.709> average

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039

this is what I would be asking you to do

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:16.550 
this is what I would be asking you to do
is<00:07:12.120> calculate<00:07:13.070> the<00:07:14.070> break-even<00:07:15.080> given<00:07:16.080> or

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 
is calculate the break-even given or
