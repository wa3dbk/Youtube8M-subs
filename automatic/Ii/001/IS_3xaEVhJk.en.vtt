00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.640
 possible fast because I do not want it to last 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.760
 like 15 minutes this video and I have here 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.680
 my list because I can not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 memorize all those things although they are not 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.730
 about me it would take too long and already 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.160
 I'm going to start my favorite animal are the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 cats my favorite stuff are the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.649
 math I do not like bananas 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.350
 I took three years of French and still in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.940
 yes I can already speak I am very 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.760
 messy gives me a lot of laziness 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 comb my hair but I do it for you 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 that they look at me a little out of tune already in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.289
 our channel in blogs is to look at that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.680
 look combed i paint my nails minimum 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.600
 three times a week I'm addicted to your ex 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.879
 I love watching the shows is there I 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.489
 like to stay all night - watching 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.129
 shows and that and I love in the past 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 two months I bought three cell phones 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 They know that I had the samsung apps 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.220
 it is feasible that it is against water is not 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.560
 against water or anything like that so if 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.690
 you have to tell him to put a lot of water 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.810
 because I got sick when 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.930
 navia jamaica as I returned I bought 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.580
 another with the insurance and for this 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.759
 time was already angry with those 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.930
 cell phones so I bought another one new and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.369
 I already have the golden fibers iphone that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.350
 You saw the group on my blog 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.000
 what he decides when he teaches it but 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.550
 you are very good 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.770
 I had brakes for four years I'm the only one 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.780
 in the family with two names falling into 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.179
 montserrat I am the only one in the family 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 I do not like glasses very much 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.369
 read and almost always and that 90% of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.710
 the times I buy a new book 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.990
 I do it in a day I also like tea 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 coffee chocolate makes me sneeze 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.380
 but I still love them I have dread 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.799
 I love spiders 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.950
 fried as the frank feys company pits 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.770
 they are my weakness like chicken almost all 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.380
 the days before I could eat like 15 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.560
 wine chicken buffalo chicken salitas 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.070
 in one sitting he swallowed horrible each time 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.230
 as I use as five napkins as I 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.840
 clean the mouth I do not like to use those 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.670
 same napkins that is horrible 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 but it makes me sick and I always use a jet 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.770
 of napkins my first car of the 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.080
 that I bought it when I was 18 years old is 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.300
 very very strange that I sleep on an airplane 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.610
 that's why I do not like to travel, I like it 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.650
 get to the places but I hate the plane 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.080
 and all this I can never sleep 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.170
 I have had more than one perfume my collection 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.330
 right now I have cuchi flora before I had 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.400
 dolce gabbana I use it but I never 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.070
 I buy more than one I do not know much about music 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.230
 and I do not know complete the lyrics 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.660
 completely from any song of 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.460
 I liked tatiana a lot I do not know 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.670
 you know who I'm talking about 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.470
 but yes yes leave it below but I 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.380
 loved all that tatiana with the 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.380
 little stars and all that every time 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.390
 my house sold a man came as with 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.130
 cassettes and I bought myself a cassette 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.260
 of tatiana every time with a last sign 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.040
 When I was a girl, I cried when there was no 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.900
 school 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.359
 I really like school until now 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.890
 and I prefer to call people who 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.709
 send them a text I do not have patience 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.140
 to wait for a text response I 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.989
 I like to check that they answer me and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.769
 It is very difficult for me to get rid of my 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.489
 things are already my clothes my shoes 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.560
 of anything because I have like me 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.569
 agreement that I also had that day 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.970
 I had this dress because higÃ¼ey 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.159
 I 'm going to throw it if we had good 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.290
 moments or things like that I know it's bad 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.720
 because that's why I have so many clothes that 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.430
 I do not use much but it gives me sadness 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.319
 make me from it people think that 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.419
 I'm left-handed when they see me write 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.099
 although I write with my right they think 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:02.260
 I'm left-handed because he grabbed the pencil very 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.849
 rare grabbed as well kill me 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.299
 unthinkable that he was going to be left-handed from big 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.579
 and I am I do not know how it is said but it is that with 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.709
 my right is very rare that you shadow 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.900
 or let's take but anyway I 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.000
 I still buy those things and more were 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.919
 you say when I do not use them I would like to be 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.229
 brave and use them but watching that fuck 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.510
 funny i always lose my charles tex 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.490
 and I do not think I've ever finished one 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.979
 in all my life and every now and then 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.389
 and I'm lost I do not know anyone else steal 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.630
 When I do not have an idea where 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.030
 go 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.360
 I like to go out to eat in the street 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.110
 Before I could go partying until 6 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.660
 27 in the morning very bad and right now 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.789
 only endured until one of the 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.940
 tomorrow and from there I already go to my house to 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.940
 I'm terrible to throw a party 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.650
 tiptoe way from when I was 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.750
 I used to spend it at the doctor 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.970
 I was always sick or something because of 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.009
 style but I remember that I always 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.229
 I lived in the hospital I do not like when 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.909
 people throw trash on the floor and I 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.560
 I always end up picking up at two 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.680
 hard as I have a partner in my 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.199
 class that says because for that they pay to 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.940
 the people to pick up the trash but today 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.190
 I'm super fat that people say 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.169
 these things and that I picked it up and threw it 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.840
 the trash does not cost me anything I'm very 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.659
 sentimental although I almost always appear 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.030
 be strong the truth that is not not very 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:24.940
 difficult to make me now I feel that my laughter 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.699
 is very angry so they see my blogs and I 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.250
 they hear you laugh tell me why I 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:31.480
 I listen sometimes and I say oh my god I have 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.240
 the laughter of more in pause 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.280
 the world I do not like to handle my 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.580
 ultrasound when I was in the belly of 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.010
 my mom said he was going to be a man I'm not 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.620
 shy to talk to new people I 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.030
 like to talk so much that anyone 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.220
 I want to hear that you want to talk 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.100
 with me better for me I would like to move on 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.470
 Christmas in a place where there is snow 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.010
 He has never touched me and I hope one day to be able to 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.920
 make it my whole year holiday 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.960
 You are kevin on Thanksgiving I like it 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.450
 a lot because the family meets and there 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.570
 a stream of food and I really like it 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.700
 what we have more in common came and I am 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.580
 our love of food since 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.080
 I was little until I was 18 years old 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.530
 I wanted my career to be done 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.630
 for an accountant and now look at nothing 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.330
 see I have an accounting class and the 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.040
 I hate completely and the last thing is 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.000
 I did not think it was so difficult 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.610
 think 50 things about me but it was them 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.370
 I want to thank all of you 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.080
 I really like that you liked the 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.750
 previous video I did on the 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.270
 self-esteem I hope you have helped them 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.370
 make them think a little about what is 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.960
 the important thing in life and that is not 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.600
 important but 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.180
 yes, if they want to see another type of 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.830
 videos let me down probably the 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.810
 Monday is already going to be like outfits 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.789
 because of this is my channel 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.160
 mainly and a long time ago that 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:07:00.009
 I do not believe but that's my plan if 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.160
 they ask what I'm wearing too 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.750
 is it inside the one I brought in my video 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.479
 previous the one that has here as 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.060
 cobwebs and so also of jeans here 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.039

00:07:12.039 --> 00:07:17.979
 6 remain as it is is navy blue 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.720

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.150
 has lace on the bottom it also has the 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.000
 blue fabric and wine with this very sense 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:28.229
 nice and you can see that it comes to me like 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.950
 half of the leg and it 's nothing tight 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:36.670
