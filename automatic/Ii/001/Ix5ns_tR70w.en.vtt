which<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.130> white<00:01:29.400> too<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.740> honestly<00:01:31.740> this

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
which is white too and honestly this

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.140 
which is white too and honestly this
product<00:01:33.000> was<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.420> dead-on<00:01:33.659> match<00:01:33.860> for<00:01:34.880> my<00:01:35.880> color

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150

because<00:01:36.990> normally<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.890> hard<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.189> me

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
because normally it's really hard for me

to find even in high in foundations one
that<00:01:41.880> matches<00:01:42.140> so<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.649> impressed

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that matches so I was really impressed

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.600 
that matches so I was really impressed

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.959 
it with a primer without a primer and it
didn't<00:01:54.840> matter<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.380> didn't<00:01:55.680> didn't<00:01:56.310> set<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.820> my

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
didn't matter it didn't didn't set in my

didn't matter it didn't didn't set in my
pores<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.659> my<00:01:57.960> fine<00:01:58.170> lines<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:59.009> my

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
pores or my fine lines like my

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.120 
pores or my fine lines like my
expression<00:01:59.820> lines<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.360> things<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
expression lines and things like that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.459 
expression lines and things like that
but<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:03.600> lasted<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.250> heat<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.729> mean<00:02:06.469> we're

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
but it lasted with the heat I mean we're

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.520 
but it lasted with the heat I mean we're
on<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.710> is

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
on that is

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.130 
on that is
human<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.310> hot<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.940> figured<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:11.020> would

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
human and so hot I figured it would

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.780 
human and so hot I figured it would
probably<00:02:11.350> say<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.830> really<00:02:11.980> fast<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.640> it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
probably say it really fast and it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.230 
probably say it really fast and it
didn't<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.330> held<00:02:13.569> up<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.740> didn't<00:02:15.250> oxidized<00:02:15.880> I

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
didn't it held up it didn't oxidized I

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.059 
didn't it held up it didn't oxidized I
have<00:02:16.510> tend<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.050> have<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.200> problem<00:02:17.709> with<00:02:17.890> on

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
have tend to have a problem with on

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.309 
have tend to have a problem with on
finding<00:02:18.819> foundations<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.420> don't<00:02:19.720> oxidize<00:02:19.959> I

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
finding foundations that don't oxidize I

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.190 
finding foundations that don't oxidize I
guess<00:02:20.770> it's<00:02:21.069> because<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.640> my<00:02:22.510> face<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.170> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
guess it's because of my face is a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.130 
guess it's because of my face is a
little<00:02:23.290> oilier<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.250> I<00:02:24.580> guess<00:02:25.209> maybe<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.780> oils

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
little oilier and I guess maybe the oils

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.590 
little oilier and I guess maybe the oils
tend<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.800> break<00:02:26.980> down<00:02:27.300> whatever<00:02:28.300> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
tend to break down whatever the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.800 
tend to break down whatever the
foundation<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> made<00:02:29.560> out<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.739> so<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.370> ends<00:02:30.670> up

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
foundation is made out of so it ends up

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.059 
foundation is made out of so it ends up
almost<00:02:31.810> I'm<00:02:32.110> going<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.440> say<00:02:32.590> when<00:02:32.770> it<00:02:32.860> oxidizes

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
almost I'm going to say when it oxidizes

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.600 
almost I'm going to say when it oxidizes
it<00:02:33.760> kind<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.180> em<00:02:34.650> has<00:02:35.650> almost<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.220> an<00:02:36.340> orange

one shot to make it look right in I
tried<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:08.430> stippling<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.230> choose

my<00:03:11.440> fingertips<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.340> tried<00:03:12.700> using<00:03:12.940> and<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:14.140> damp

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
my fingertips I tried using and a damp

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.550 
my fingertips I tried using and a damp
cosmetic<00:03:15.160> sponge<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.140> honestly<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.410> best

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
cosmetic sponge and honestly the best

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.390 
cosmetic sponge and honestly the best
way<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.489> look<00:03:19.350> smooth<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.799> with<00:03:21.220> a

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
way to get it to look smooth is with a

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.710 
way to get it to look smooth is with a
damp<00:03:21.610> cosmetic<00:03:22.390> sponge<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:25.269> best<00:03:25.450> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
damp cosmetic sponge you the best I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.990 
damp cosmetic sponge you the best I
could<00:03:25.780> get<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.410> coverage<00:03:27.100> wise<00:03:27.370> was

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
could get with this coverage wise was

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.479 
could get with this coverage wise was
medium<00:03:28.600> coverage<00:03:29.019> because<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.440> felt<00:03:29.769> like<00:03:29.920> if<00:03:30.250> I

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
medium coverage because I felt like if I

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.580 
medium coverage because I felt like if I
got<00:03:30.640> too<00:03:30.880> much<00:03:31.030> product<00:03:31.390> it<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:32.079> looked

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
got too much product it just looked

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.039 
got too much product it just looked
thick<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:34.239> didn't<00:03:34.480> want<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.750> look<00:03:34.989> too

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
thick and I didn't want it to look too

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.190 
thick and I didn't want it to look too
thick<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.060> my<00:03:37.060> recommendation<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.870> if<00:03:37.930> you<00:03:38.140> use

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
thick so my recommendation is if you use

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.500 
thick so my recommendation is if you use
this<00:03:38.560> try<00:03:38.859> it<00:03:38.920> with<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.190> wet<00:03:39.489> cosmetic<00:03:40.209> sponge

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
this try it with a wet cosmetic sponge

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
this try it with a wet cosmetic sponge
and<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:41.350> was<00:03:41.560> how<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:41.739> got<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.959> best<00:03:44.170> coverage

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
and that was how I got the best coverage

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.780 
and that was how I got the best coverage
I<00:03:45.010> guess<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:46.209> best<00:03:46.420> look<00:03:46.750> with<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.340> um

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
I guess and the best look with it so um

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.500 
I guess and the best look with it so um
if<00:03:49.660> you're<00:03:50.350> looking<00:03:50.650> for<00:03:50.680> a<00:03:51.510> heavier

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
if you're looking for a heavier

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.569 
if you're looking for a heavier
foundation<00:03:53.200> which<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.620> tend<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.100> kind<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.400> need

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
foundation which I tend to kind of need

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.979 
foundation which I tend to kind of need
because<00:03:54.730> I<00:03:54.910> got<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> little<00:03:55.329> bit<00:03:55.570> of<00:03:55.600> scarring

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
because I got a little bit of scarring

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.289 
because I got a little bit of scarring
that<00:03:56.140> I<00:03:56.290> like<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.709> cover<00:03:56.890> up<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.400> don't<00:03:58.209> think

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
that I like to cover up I don't think

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.340 
that I like to cover up I don't think
this<00:03:58.660> one's<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.350> for<00:03:59.859> me<00:04:00.010> because<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.880> just<00:04:01.660> it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
this one's it for me because it just it

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.789 
this one's it for me because it just it
dries<00:04:02.620> too<00:04:02.950> quickly<00:04:03.220> in<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:04.720> can't<00:04:04.989> you<00:04:05.170> can't

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
dries too quickly in you can't you can't

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.220 
dries too quickly in you can't you can't
go<00:04:05.859> back<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.489> add

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
go back and add

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.410 
go back and add
anything<00:04:07.739> you've<00:04:08.099> got<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.670> chance<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:09.269> get

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420
