00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.000
Kryptonite has always had a long standing relationship with messengers.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.520
We have certain people who use our locks once, twice a year

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.670
and messengers fall into a category of
people that use our locks

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.030
20 times a day.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.300
They are the super users of our product.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.700
So they really put our locks to the test, so they're the ones that can give us the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.080
best feedback.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.620
You really get to be part of that design process with us.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.880
On this occasion this was route one,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.530
This was asking the people who use
our product the most

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.510
important questions about the usage of our products about security in New York.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.580
How do we make this better, what
makes sense

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:53.589
what do we need to learn from our end users
to make this better what are we missing?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.760
We wanted to make the meetings the most
valuable they could be

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.260
to the messengers and to ourselves to say, OK, what exactly do we want to learn and

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.520
what do we want to get out this.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.260
Kryptonite was interested in getting our
feedback

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.290
Like the brainstorming, the exchange of ideas

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.670
you know, the culmination of minds.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.060
We started looking at what the problems were 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.500
and how things could be better.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.880
I was really impressed with

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.820
the way the company listened to all
kinds of input and all kinds of ideas.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.000
Kryptonite brought in a lot of props
and

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.649
art supplies to kind of fuel our
creativity and I was really impressed by

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.750
how much I felt like Kryptonite really
wanted to get

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.840
our opinions and it's really wanted to
encourage

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.039
open discussion you know figure out how
to make a product that works.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.399
for messengers and then for everybody
that bikes.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.340
It's a good feeling that companies are
interested in your feedback

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.220
because what we're doing is putting products to
the extreme test.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.220
So we went and asked the
question, we spent a lot of time talking

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.440
to these guys and asking them

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.500
exactly what makes their life easier.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.860
To get that much feedback in one session and have to cull it down into something meaningful can be

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.290
a pretty big task.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.239
May have taken a little bit of this and a
little bit of that and putting things

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.030
together

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.340
that kind of made sense.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.500
What we did
is we came back we had some

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.730
brainstorming sessions that presented us
with about

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.980
30 different concepts.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.100
Once we analyze the results of that, that's what actually helped us get

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.319
to the exact products

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.839
that were going to make their life easier and quicker.
