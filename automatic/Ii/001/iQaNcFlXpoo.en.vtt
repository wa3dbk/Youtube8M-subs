ro<00:02:28.000> UX<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.290> don't<00:02:29.500> know<00:02:29.650> why<00:02:30.180> cuz<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.360> sounds

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
ro UX I don't know why cuz it sounds

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.470 
ro UX I don't know why cuz it sounds
like<00:02:31.780> ropes<00:02:32.140> or<00:02:32.470> something<00:02:32.769> but<00:02:33.489> it's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
like ropes or something but it's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.690 
like ropes or something but it's
basically<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:34.959> flour<00:02:35.319> and<00:02:35.650> butter<00:02:35.830> so

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
basically just flour and butter so

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.800
