to the students that I teach and I just

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.510 
to the students that I teach and I just
love<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.829> where<00:01:58.070> do<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.189> find<00:01:58.369> my

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
love that so where do I find my

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.120 
love that so where do I find my
inspiration<00:01:59.450> when<00:02:00.320> I'm<00:02:00.409> trying<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.680> design

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
inspiration when I'm trying to design

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.920 
inspiration when I'm trying to design
something<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.939> maybe<00:02:02.210> I'm<00:02:02.360> up<00:02:02.509> against<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
something and maybe I'm up against a

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.310 
something and maybe I'm up against a
deadline<00:02:04.329> it<00:02:05.329> can<00:02:05.479> be<00:02:05.570> very<00:02:05.750> distracting<00:02:06.079> to

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
deadline it can be very distracting to

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.600 
deadline it can be very distracting to
have<00:02:06.470> a<00:02:06.590> deadline<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.159> think<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.399> first

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
have a deadline so I think the first

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.100 
have a deadline so I think the first
thing<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.850> try<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.119> do<00:02:08.269> for<00:02:08.420> myself<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.869> try<00:02:09.049> to

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
thing I try to do for myself is try to

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.020 
thing I try to do for myself is try to
forget<00:02:09.530> about<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:10.009> deadlines<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.549> to

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
forget about the deadlines and to

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.430 
forget about the deadlines and to
remember<00:02:11.299> that<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.690> okay<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.049> make<00:02:12.380> mistakes

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
remember that it's okay to make mistakes

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.890 
remember that it's okay to make mistakes
and<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.430> usually<00:02:13.640> find<00:02:14.060> my<00:02:14.180> inspiration<00:02:14.750> in

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
and so I usually find my inspiration in

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.410 
and so I usually find my inspiration in
the<00:02:15.110> process<00:02:15.620> so<00:02:16.220> I'll<00:02:16.579> just<00:02:16.760> set<00:02:16.970> out<00:02:17.120> with<00:02:17.299> my

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
the process so I'll just set out with my

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.440 
the process so I'll just set out with my
goal<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.220> make<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.250> piece<00:02:19.579> maybe<00:02:19.940> two<00:02:20.209> pieces

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
goal and make a piece maybe two pieces

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.479 
goal and make a piece maybe two pieces
and<00:02:20.900> then<00:02:21.019> by<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> third<00:02:21.560> piece<00:02:21.829> I've<00:02:22.130> really

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
and then by the third piece I've really

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.670 
and then by the third piece I've really
got<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> sense<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.299> what<00:02:23.360> it's<00:02:23.750> about<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.530> it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
got a sense of what it's about but it's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.110 
got a sense of what it's about but it's
not<00:02:24.829> until<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:25.070> kind<00:02:25.340> of<00:02:25.400> get<00:02:25.579> your<00:02:25.730> hands

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
not until you kind of get your hands

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.240 
not until you kind of get your hands
into<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.630> design<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.410> into<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.829> making<00:02:28.070> of

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
into the design and into the making of

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.500 
into the design and into the making of
the<00:02:28.370> piece<00:02:28.579> that<00:02:28.820> I<00:02:28.850> feel<00:02:29.090> like<00:02:29.150> that<00:02:29.390> you

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the piece that I feel like that you

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.240 
the piece that I feel like that you
really<00:02:29.630> get<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.019> know<00:02:30.049> it<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:30.829> whether<00:02:31.040> I'm

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
really get to know it so whether I'm

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.950 
really get to know it so whether I'm
carving<00:02:31.730> waxes<00:02:32.329> and

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
carving waxes and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.900 
carving waxes and
sculpting<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.920> rabbit<00:02:34.280> or<00:02:34.400> something<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.850> don't

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
sculpting a rabbit or something I don't

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.490 
sculpting a rabbit or something I don't
get<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.270> know<00:02:35.390> what<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.720> gesture<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
get to know what the gesture of the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.110 
get to know what the gesture of the
rabbit<00:02:36.890> or<00:02:37.070> what<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.490> face<00:02:37.730> should<00:02:37.910> look<00:02:37.970> like

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
rabbit or what the face should look like

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.600 
rabbit or what the face should look like
until<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.630> try<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.740> that's<00:02:40.130> where<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.280> find<00:02:40.490> my

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
until I try it so that's where I find my

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.900 
until I try it so that's where I find my
inspiration<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.240> when<00:02:41.360> I'm<00:02:41.450> making<00:02:41.630> something

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
inspiration is when I'm making something

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.820 
inspiration is when I'm making something
if<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.180> was<00:02:44.330> a<00:02:44.360> type<00:02:44.660> of<00:02:44.690> food<00:02:45.230> what<00:02:45.650> would<00:02:45.770> I

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
if I was a type of food what would I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.770 
if I was a type of food what would I
want<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.190> be<00:02:46.490> well<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:50.000> I<00:02:50.180> wanted<00:02:50.450> people<00:02:50.630> to

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
want to be well if I wanted people to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.960 
want to be well if I wanted people to
like<00:02:51.140> me<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:51.680> suppose<00:02:52.070> I'd<00:02:52.400> be<00:02:52.550> chocolate

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
like me I suppose I'd be chocolate

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.340 
like me I suppose I'd be chocolate
because<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> lot<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.420> people<00:02:53.600> like<00:02:53.870> chocolate

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
because a lot of people like chocolate

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.260 
because a lot of people like chocolate
except<00:02:54.770> for<00:02:55.010> probably<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.700> people<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.150> get

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
except for probably the people that get

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.610 
except for probably the people that get
sick<00:02:56.540> if<00:02:56.720> they<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.930> chocolate<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.500> they

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
sick if they have chocolate but they

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.320 
sick if they have chocolate but they
probably<00:02:57.950> secretly<00:02:58.280> love<00:02:58.670> chocolate<00:02:59.060> anyway

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
probably secretly love chocolate anyway

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.970 
probably secretly love chocolate anyway
so<00:02:59.480> I'm<00:02:59.660> still<00:02:59.960> being<00:03:00.140> liked<00:03:00.440> for<00:03:00.800> being

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
so I'm still being liked for being

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.490 
so I'm still being liked for being
chocolate<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.520> that's<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:01.790> good<00:03:01.970> thing<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.690> if

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
chocolate so that's a good thing and if

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.680 
chocolate so that's a good thing and if
I<00:03:03.680> wanted<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.190> maybe<00:03:04.580> last<00:03:04.910> longer<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.540> have<00:03:05.660> a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
I wanted to maybe last longer and have a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.330 
I wanted to maybe last longer and have a
longer<00:03:05.930> life<00:03:06.200> I'd<00:03:06.380> probably<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.830> Brussels

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
longer life I'd probably be Brussels

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.980 
longer life I'd probably be Brussels
sprouts<00:03:07.640> because<00:03:07.970> let's<00:03:08.390> face<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.630> not

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
sprouts because let's face it not

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.690 
sprouts because let's face it not
everybody<00:03:09.290> likes<00:03:09.650> Brussels<00:03:10.070> sprouts

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
everybody likes Brussels sprouts

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.410 
everybody likes Brussels sprouts
nobody<00:03:11.540> says<00:03:11.750> hey<00:03:11.960> let's<00:03:12.200> go<00:03:12.320> get<00:03:13.420> Brussels

nobody says hey let's go get Brussels
sprouts<00:03:14.690> instead<00:03:14.900> of<00:03:15.170> hamburgers<00:03:15.410> or

sprouts instead of hamburgers or

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.140 
sprouts instead of hamburgers or
something<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.460> if<00:03:16.550> I<00:03:16.640> was<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.790> Brussels<00:03:17.120> sprout

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
something so if I was a Brussels sprout

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.670 
something so if I was a Brussels sprout
I<00:03:17.360> probably<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.900> pretty<00:03:18.140> decent<00:03:18.560> life

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
I probably have a pretty decent life

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.070 
I probably have a pretty decent life

super powers for that I want probably

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.190 
super powers for that I want probably
not<00:03:25.850> Wolverine<00:03:26.210> because<00:03:26.630> those<00:03:26.960> blades

annoying<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.240> was<00:03:29.480> trying<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.840> work<00:03:30.050> and

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.960 

Superman<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:33.800> just<00:03:33.950> always<00:03:34.160> busy<00:03:34.610> saving<00:03:34.790> the

Superman is just always busy saving the
world<00:03:35.060> and<00:03:35.450> stuff<00:03:35.570> so<00:03:35.990> I<00:03:36.260> probably<00:03:36.500> take<00:03:36.800> dr.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
world and stuff so I probably take dr.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.940 
world and stuff so I probably take dr.
Manhattan<00:03:37.880> from<00:03:38.060> The<00:03:38.240> Watchmen<00:03:38.800> he<00:03:39.800> could

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
Manhattan from The Watchmen he could

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.710 
Manhattan from The Watchmen he could
pretty<00:03:40.100> much<00:03:40.190> do<00:03:40.490> anything<00:03:40.820> he<00:03:41.090> wanted<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.660> it

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
pretty much do anything he wanted and it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.750 
pretty much do anything he wanted and it
was<00:03:41.810> pretty<00:03:41.990> cool<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.260> he<00:03:42.470> could<00:03:42.620> be<00:03:42.830> he

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
was pretty cool that he could be he

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.430 
was pretty cool that he could be he
could<00:03:43.790> clone<00:03:44.270> himself<00:03:44.660> he<00:03:44.840> could<00:03:44.990> just<00:03:45.140> change

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
could clone himself he could just change

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.570 
could clone himself he could just change
his<00:03:45.680> matter<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.130> he<00:03:46.220> could<00:03:46.340> be<00:03:46.430> multiple

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
his matter so he could be multiple

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.960 
his matter so he could be multiple
people<00:03:47.030> so<00:03:47.180> therefore<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:47.900> could<00:03:48.440> be<00:03:48.590> working

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
people so therefore I could be working

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
with a corona on a beach somewhere and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.810 
with a corona on a beach somewhere and
just<00:03:54.440> relaxing<00:03:54.980> and<00:03:55.130> I<00:03:55.250> think<00:03:55.490> that's<00:03:55.640> pretty

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
just relaxing and I think that's pretty

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.480 
just relaxing and I think that's pretty
awesome<00:03:55.940> as<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:56.330> superpower<00:03:56.780> all<00:03:57.740> right<00:03:58.070> okay

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
awesome as a superpower all right okay

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.700 
awesome as a superpower all right okay
so<00:03:58.550> if<00:03:59.150> Hollywood<00:03:59.540> made<00:03:59.870> a<00:03:59.900> movie<00:04:00.290> about<00:04:00.380> me

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
so if Hollywood made a movie about me

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.980 
so if Hollywood made a movie about me
for<00:04:00.920> some<00:04:01.160> reason<00:04:01.190> and<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.360> really<00:04:02.690> shudder

for some reason and I I really shudder

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.870 
for some reason and I I really shudder
to<00:04:03.200> think<00:04:03.230> what<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.830> reason<00:04:04.190> Hollywood<00:04:04.760> would

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
to think what the reason Hollywood would

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.800 
to think what the reason Hollywood would
have<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.180> reason<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.720> make<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:06.350> movie<00:04:07.040> about<00:04:07.070> me
