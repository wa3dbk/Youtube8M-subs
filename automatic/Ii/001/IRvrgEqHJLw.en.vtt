Hi! Today I'll test and review the Nike Hypervenom Phantom

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.700
That has been designed for agility, and for players as Neymar 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.700
But what innovations do Nike bring in this boot? I'm here for that! Join me!

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.500
For the upper Nike decided to use the Nike Skin. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.300
But it isn't a novelty because it was already used on the Bomba Finale II

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.400
In this boots it has been improved, and it feels like a second skin

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.300
Because it is made of only one piece, it's really flexible and it doesn't have stitches

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.700
On the internal part of the upper we find the dynamic support, which acts as the skeleton of the boot

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.700
The fit is a bit wider than the Vapor for example, and combined with the flexible upper it results in a adaptive boot

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.700
So I suggest you to go an half size down from your normal Nike size

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.700
The soleplate's material is the compressed nylon that gives a good combination beetween flexibility and reactivity

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:54.700
For the soleplate Nike use most conical studs and it gives a good idea of agility, and it excells in rotational movements

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700
Then, we find two bladed studs under the forefoot and it helps when you accelerate

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.200
Also, we find the split toe which, according to Nike it should give a better flexibility when changing direction

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.700
But, I don't think it works

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.300
The ball touch is excellent thank to the Nike Skin. It gives a barefoot felling thanks to his thin and one piece upper

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Also, we find the asymmetric lacing which gives a more large striking area 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.300
But, this features cause a defect

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.900
The defect I was saying you is the protection. Because of the thin upper, there isn't much protection on this boot

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.900
But, it's the price to pay if you want a boot like this

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.400
In terms of durability we can't say nothing bad about this boot

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.400
At the beginning the glue between the upper and soleplate looked a bit weak

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.400
But we've used this boot for over four months and they don't show any sign of use

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.300
We end this video giving a verdict about this boot

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.000
The Nike Hypervenom is different from any other boot I've tried. I've never seen something like the Nike Skin, which acts as a second skin

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.800
Also, we find the new soleplate that gives a perfect combination between flexibility and reactivity 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.300
And the conical studs are perfect for rotational movements

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.300
The only defect is the protection, because we can't find protection, but it isn't nothing that prevents you not to buy this boot

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.300
