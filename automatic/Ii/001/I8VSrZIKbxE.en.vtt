down these days not as aggressive as he
was<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:25.080> age<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.680> catching<00:00:25.890> up<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.369> him

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490

two<00:01:35.590> spawning<00:01:36.160> it's<00:01:37.000> kind<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.270> as<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> frame<00:01:37.690> of

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
two spawning it's kind of as a frame of

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.920 
two spawning it's kind of as a frame of
reference<00:01:37.899> that<00:01:39.300> little<00:01:40.300> male<00:01:40.479> there<00:01:40.780> is

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
that and of course the whole big guy

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.370 
that and of course the whole big guy
would<00:01:48.580> swing<00:01:48.970> over<00:01:49.119> there<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.539> could<00:01:49.750> see<00:01:50.229> the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
would swing over there you could see the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.930 
would swing over there you could see the
dramatic<00:01:50.500> difference<00:01:50.830> but<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.640> don't<00:01:51.820> know<00:01:51.880> if

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
dramatic difference but I don't know if

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.350 
dramatic difference but I don't know if
that's<00:01:52.119> going<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.330> happen

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that's going to happen

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.790 
that's going to happen
not<00:01:55.360> really<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.690> whole<00:01:55.930> lot<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.200> say<00:01:56.380> about<00:01:56.410> this

smaller male is right in front of it out

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.029 
smaller male is right in front of it out
he<00:04:27.310> doesn't<00:04:27.610> usually<00:04:27.729> allow<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:29.500> big<00:04:29.680> male<00:04:29.860> to

he doesn't usually allow the big male to
get<00:04:30.160> too<00:04:30.340> close<00:04:30.610> because<00:04:30.880> of<00:04:30.970> course<00:04:31.360> he<00:04:31.539> gets

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
get too close because of course he gets

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.870 
get too close because of course he gets
swallowed<00:04:32.080> up<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.470> about<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.740> second<00:04:33.370> there's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880

Alice for those of you who's wondering

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.659 
Alice for those of you who's wondering
who's<00:04:35.620> making<00:04:35.919> all<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.070> racket

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
who's making all the racket

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.840

so she'll make yet another Alice look up

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.120 
so she'll make yet another Alice look up
I<00:04:40.150> guess<00:04:40.900> she's<00:04:41.080> not<00:04:41.110> good<00:04:41.440> she<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.800> wants<00:04:42.070> a

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
I guess she's not good she just wants a

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.420 
I guess she's not good she just wants a
snack<00:04:42.780> she<00:04:43.780> likes<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.169> talk<00:04:44.380> that's<00:04:44.740> for<00:04:44.979> sure

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
snack she likes to talk that's for sure

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.540 
snack she likes to talk that's for sure
hanging<00:04:46.300> out<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:47.350> I'm<00:04:47.650> not<00:04:47.770> really<00:04:48.070> much<00:04:48.520> to

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
hanging out so I'm not really much to

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.310 
hanging out so I'm not really much to
say<00:04:48.910> just<00:04:48.940> a<00:04:50.550> nice<00:04:51.550> lazy<00:04:52.479> summer<00:04:53.229> afternoon

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
say just a nice lazy summer afternoon

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.440 
say just a nice lazy summer afternoon
the<00:04:54.070> sun's<00:04:54.310> kind<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.669> coming<00:04:54.940> in<00:04:55.090> and<00:04:55.120> I

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
the sun's kind of coming in and I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.469 
the sun's kind of coming in and I
thought<00:04:56.200> this<00:04:56.380> would<00:04:56.530> be<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:56.710> good<00:04:56.890> time<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.479> do

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
thought this would be a good time to do

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.290 
thought this would be a good time to do
a<00:04:58.510> short<00:04:58.870> video<00:04:59.080> on<00:04:59.289> the<00:04:59.650> on<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.580> device<00:05:01.000> so

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
a short video on the on the device so

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.600 
a short video on the on the device so
you<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.900> see<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.260> little<00:05:03.220> nail<00:05:04.410> underneath

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
you can see the little nail underneath

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.920 
you can see the little nail underneath
behind<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:07.690> big<00:05:07.870> guy

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
behind the big guy

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.249 
behind the big guy
but<00:05:09.710> there<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.460> can<00:05:10.580> kind<00:05:10.820> of<00:05:10.850> get<00:05:11.000> an<00:05:11.090> idea<00:05:11.259> he

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
but there you can kind of get an idea he

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.010 
but there you can kind of get an idea he
just<00:05:12.590> doesn't<00:05:12.860> let<00:05:12.949> him<00:05:13.100> get<00:05:13.250> too<00:05:13.430> close<00:05:14.020> which

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
just doesn't let him get too close which

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.529 
just doesn't let him get too close which
is<00:05:15.050> probably<00:05:15.470> pretty<00:05:15.710> smart<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:17.330> young

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
is probably pretty smart and the young

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.860 
is probably pretty smart and the young
guys<00:05:21.250> there<00:05:22.250> he<00:05:22.340> goes

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
guys there he goes

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.580 
guys there he goes
chasing<00:05:23.870> him<00:05:24.580> anyhow<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:27.110> guess<00:05:27.350> I'll<00:05:27.500> let

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
chasing him anyhow so I guess I'll let

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.900 
chasing him anyhow so I guess I'll let
you<00:05:27.740> go<00:05:27.889> there<00:05:28.160> wasn't<00:05:28.370> anything<00:05:28.639> too

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
you go there wasn't anything too

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.850 
you go there wasn't anything too
exciting<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:29.600> it<00:05:29.690> going<00:05:29.870> on<00:05:29.990> today<00:05:30.199> he's<00:05:30.560> like

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
exciting and it going on today he's like

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.400 
exciting and it going on today he's like
I<00:05:30.979> said<00:05:31.220> he's<00:05:31.370> a<00:05:31.400> lot<00:05:31.810> quieter<00:05:32.810> than<00:05:33.110> he<00:05:33.229> used

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
I said he's a lot quieter than he used

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.200 
I said he's a lot quieter than he used
to<00:05:33.560> be<00:05:33.620> a<00:05:33.979> just<00:05:34.430> catching<00:05:34.759> up<00:05:34.820> with<00:05:34.970> him<00:05:35.090> I

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
to be a just catching up with him I

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.300 
to be a just catching up with him I
think<00:05:35.650> it's<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.680> good<00:05:36.800> thing<00:05:36.979> I've<00:05:37.070> got<00:05:37.160> a

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
think it's a good thing I've got a

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.330 
think it's a good thing I've got a
couple<00:05:37.580> of<00:05:37.789> his<00:05:37.940> progeny<00:05:38.590> that<00:05:39.590> I'm<00:05:39.740> raising

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
couple of his progeny that I'm raising

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.540 
couple of his progeny that I'm raising
for<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.270> day<00:05:41.960> I'm<00:05:42.259> afraid<00:05:42.410> that's<00:05:42.919> probably

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
for the day I'm afraid that's probably

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.210 
for the day I'm afraid that's probably
closer<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:44.210> coming<00:05:44.930> then<00:05:45.289> not<00:05:45.530> coming<00:05:45.919> that<00:05:46.039> he

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 
closer to coming then not coming that he

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.550 
closer to coming then not coming that he
might<00:05:46.430> I<00:05:46.970> might<00:05:47.660> come<00:05:47.930> down<00:05:47.960> here<00:05:48.229> one<00:05:48.349> day<00:05:48.530> and
