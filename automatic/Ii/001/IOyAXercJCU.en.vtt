can ride anywhere from an extra 10 20 a
week<00:04:08.730> depending<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.510> I'm<00:04:09.600> doing<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:10.890> write

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
week depending on what I'm doing I write

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.220

a<00:04:11.490> fixed<00:04:11.790> gear<00:04:11.850> I'll<00:04:12.570> do<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.780> review<00:04:12.990> on<00:04:13.110> that

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
a fixed gear I'll do it review on that

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.500 
a fixed gear I'll do it review on that
bicycle<00:04:13.380> too<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:14.670> yeah<00:04:14.880> I'm<00:04:15.000> looking<00:04:15.300> away

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
bicycle too so yeah I'm looking away

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.570 
bicycle too so yeah I'm looking away
from<00:04:15.540> minimum<00:04:16.290> of<00:04:16.500> 50<00:04:16.710> miles<00:04:16.890> upward<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.430> about

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
from minimum of 50 miles upward to about

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.350 
from minimum of 50 miles upward to about
70<00:04:17.940> miles<00:04:18.260> per<00:04:19.260> week<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.800> a<00:04:19.860> bicycle<00:04:20.100> so<00:04:20.550> really

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
70 miles per week on a bicycle so really

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.070 
70 miles per week on a bicycle so really
thinking<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.660> is<00:04:21.720> going<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.900> be<00:04:21.960> a<00:04:21.989> good

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
thinking this is going to be a good

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.430 
thinking this is going to be a good
investment<00:04:22.440> if<00:04:25.640> I<00:04:26.870> had<00:04:27.870> to<00:04:27.960> buy<00:04:28.050> one<00:04:28.200> brand<00:04:28.410> new

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
investment if I had to buy one brand new

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.890 
investment if I had to buy one brand new
I<00:04:28.530> think<00:04:28.590> I<00:04:28.770> might<00:04:28.920> go<00:04:28.950> with<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.400> 67<00:04:29.900> it

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
I think I might go with the be 67 it

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.760 
I think I might go with the be 67 it
does<00:04:31.110> have<00:04:31.290> coil<00:04:31.860> springs<00:04:32.220> here<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.910> rear

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.690 
and a clothes pin style spring in the
front<00:04:37.200> but<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.950> will<00:04:38.100> work<00:04:38.190> for<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.520> first

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
front but this will work for the first

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.480 
front but this will work for the first
time<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.860> give<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:40.920> about<00:04:41.040> a<00:04:41.130> couple<00:04:41.370> months

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
time so give it about a couple months

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.660 
time so give it about a couple months
and<00:04:41.730> see<00:04:41.850> what<00:04:42.000> I<00:04:42.030> think<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:43.520> let<00:04:44.520> me<00:04:44.610> know

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670
