further away players will technically
lag<00:01:07.290> with<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.490> they're<00:01:08.820> too<00:01:08.970> far<00:01:09.150> away

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
lag with you but they're too far away

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.410 
lag with you but they're too far away
for<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.810> matter<00:01:09.930> great<00:01:10.740> puzzle<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:12.000> basic

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.340 
but even a developer himself admits it's
useless<00:02:11.560> it's<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.370> eye<00:02:12.489> candy<00:02:13.080> but<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.230> is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
useless it's just eye candy but it is

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.540 
useless it's just eye candy but it is
pretty<00:02:15.750> also<00:02:16.750> as<00:02:16.989> the<00:02:17.020> island<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.920> big<00:02:18.190> you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
pretty also as the island is so big you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.000 
pretty also as the island is so big you
can<00:02:18.819> get<00:02:19.000> vehicles<00:02:19.300> at<00:02:19.660> bunkers<00:02:20.110> but<00:02:20.680> they<00:02:20.860> are

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
can get vehicles at bunkers but they are

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.070 
can get vehicles at bunkers but they are
strictly<00:02:21.430> transport<00:02:22.000> as<00:02:22.150> they<00:02:22.569> do<00:02:22.630> not<00:02:22.810> run

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
strictly transport as they do not run

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
quite a few areas occasionally you will

quite a few areas occasionally you will
see<00:02:35.769> a<00:02:35.800> few<00:02:36.010> bugs<00:02:36.340> like<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> floating<00:02:37.300> vehicle

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

the<00:02:41.500> game<00:02:41.709> just<00:02:41.980> keeps<00:02:42.220> me<00:02:42.610> coming<00:02:42.850> back<00:02:43.110> it's

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
the game just keeps me coming back it's

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.600 
the game just keeps me coming back it's
incredibly<00:02:44.560> simple<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.069> generally<00:02:45.489> just

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
incredibly simple and generally just

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.360 
incredibly simple and generally just
very<00:02:45.880> fun<00:02:46.180> also<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.319> major<00:02:47.530> gripe<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:48.010> do<00:02:48.069> have

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
very fun also one major gripe I do have

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.100 
very fun also one major gripe I do have
with<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.670> game<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.660> cannot<00:02:49.870> walk

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
with this game is that you cannot walk

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.750 
with this game is that you cannot walk
forward<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.709> strafe<00:02:50.980> at<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> same<00:02:51.430> time

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
forward and strafe at the same time

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.170 
forward and strafe at the same time
meaning<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.840> can't<00:02:53.050> move<00:02:53.140> diagonally<00:02:54.180> also

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
meaning you can't move diagonally also

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.910 
meaning you can't move diagonally also
it's<00:02:55.360> worth<00:02:55.540> mentioning<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.470> developer

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
it's worth mentioning that the developer

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.830 
it's worth mentioning that the developer
spends<00:02:57.220> a<00:02:57.250> lot<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.489> time<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> game<00:02:58.239> playing

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
spends a lot of time in the game playing

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900 
spends a lot of time in the game playing
or<00:02:59.140> just<00:02:59.200> observing<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.100> often<00:03:00.549> listens<00:03:00.819> to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
is updated very frequently so while it's

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.949 
is updated very frequently so while it's
not<00:03:06.250> much<00:03:06.489> now<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.390> being<00:03:07.720> developed

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
not much now it is being developed
