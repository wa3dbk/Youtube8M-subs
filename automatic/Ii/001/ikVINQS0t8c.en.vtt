00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.509
 in addition to the sect or on 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 fund - raisers by us in 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.480
 the June edition 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.349
 of health jasper I talk to myself about the 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.000
 difference that we make in the magazine 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.640
 between fundraisers 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.989
 and the walkers in front of the fort of the people 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.939
 leave seiplo stats with the 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.700
 left that goes beyond me and understand their 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.879
 reminders about fundraisers 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.879
 except that in the magazine we really do 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.789
 the distinction between fund dealers 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.590
 and scraper from since for new 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.809
 magazine 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.070
 if there is a pin that sticks out at the end 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 ballast if at the end of the plan 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 automatically we call on a 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.940
 fundraiser so if from a store 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.380
 where you read background scrapers in a 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.120
 article 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.480
 Well it really refers to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.660
 only role is with branches like those 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.649
 which exceed or by cons if you 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.329
 read are not fund dealers and 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.790
 their know-how than any reference to 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:16.770
 ten little leads it's worth this guy 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:20.880
 there who are sliding who in English to 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.079
 do that is called debate by worker 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.780
 call them the walkers before 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.179
 civilized bottom walkers that made 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.049
 really salacious on the water or a 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.969
 says lets like seloger com like the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.889
 scrapers make rocks come down on 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.409
 do not see much of it anymore and it exists 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.880
 still sounded what is done 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.369
 the day before by one like the scrapers of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.990
 bottom but without the pin back so 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.709
 if in the store to civilize 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.630
 bottom-up merchants it's referring to either 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:52.770
 enough last laugh feels revenge or 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.929
 yet the fund as walkers map 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.939
 that where we leave seven walkers the 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.770
 according to the species of plumbers we 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.439
 let's just double the fundraiser 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.749
 actually the bottom liberator 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.580
 communication in the Arctic in 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.800
 Arctic question all about 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.209
 Meme it background scrapers there is an insult and 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.920
 that he has a little bit different in the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.950
 false bottom merchant is that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.510
 water it can be really sinful 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.370
 almost vertically very very 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.810
 slowly 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.120
 let's make it just the last 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.319
 of the spit that will graze the bottom 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.269
 so we see that make sure that theirs 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.519
 and leaves them are almost under 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.900
 the craft very slowly and that 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.970
 wants it's flowers and the bottom like that 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.650
 with the mud of toil the only way 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.769
 so we almost never cling to 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.670
 bottom and then we're still just at 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.230
 the right height to capture the walleye 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.370
 so this is this capsule is unfair 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.110
 to make a difference 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.090
 coop understand that when you read 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.280
 background scrapers from a store to do 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.129
 reference to those with the pin that as soon 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.709
 speak here never to speak of a walker 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.970
 of funds was really the sinkers 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:05.000
 as it is often khoudi that one 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.959
 fund called walkers or at 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.049
 type plan like the scrapers of 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.560
 force to the pin that shares actually 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.599
 I missed 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.450
 six models from here that are scary 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.579
 their meat is drunk and then kiki that I 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.790
 find very precise 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.470
 it's more like a blonde walker and seven 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.120
 male cross-country walkers because he 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.910
 really need the pin that will exceed 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.310
 really use it that way 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.810
 with theirs far enough from watercraft to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.310
 trolling with theirs that they 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.410
 consider has nothing she phonak 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.359
 this one what we can be removed from 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.000
 plants removed from the wrath in 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.870
 add it so it's a city oger it 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.419
 use quite often 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.099
 and then sometimes something too that I 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.329
 do that is with the background scrapers 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.000
 those who have the pin that forces 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.730
 as sure I added it or joints of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.959
 weights on the spit like that we 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.980
 pay the pins with a crowbar 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.290
 many settings that happened to me 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.299
 to need you after every crisis 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.030
 we need to be several to 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.340
 reach the depth so desire 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.799
 here are enough small capsules for 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.540
 clarify the difference between scrapers 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.620
 walkers funds and funds in the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.620
 good slice store
