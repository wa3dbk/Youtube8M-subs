 bipartisanship there is revolution and for a while 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.520
 and for a while so let's see this 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.520

 good night antonio congratulations 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.180
 good the entrance in the parliament of 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.770
 Brussels was almost going safe but 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.470
 Of course this is not an entry, this is a 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.170
 I entered a surprise you imagined 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.000
 five parliamentarians good we 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.400
 we said from the beginning that we do not 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.350
 we were going to put ceiling we were seeing 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.830
 that the illusion played on our side 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.910
 we were filling the acts and we were 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.890
 listening to people telling us that 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.230
 we were excited politically the same from 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.840
 the year 82 in any case I want to do 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.580
 a call to calm and mourning is 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.920
 true that the caste parties have 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.630
 received a serious electoral corrective 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.640
 but we still have not been able to meet 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.190
 our goal for now we have not 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.820
 could overcome them electorally that was 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.710
 our goal apart companions 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.730
 unfortunately for now the objectives 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.730
 we ask ourselves 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.740
 but I think that inside all this 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.870
 location report the surprise of 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.630
 we can in Spain the phrase with which 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.150
 ripped the companion for now the 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.030
 objectives have not been achieved I think 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.070
 that says a lot not only for 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.960
 Europe but for latin america and for 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.970
 the whole continent because good someone 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.550
 he released those words a few 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.800
 years I think they were climbed in 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.410
 the collective memory of many people the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.900
 man follow live pedro plus himself and a 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.790
 ghost travels the world the ghost 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.470
 of chavismo and in europe they walk 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.330
 desperate and the opposition people 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:04.190
 here it stays I'll tell you look at me 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.190
 that mirror that we go through Spain 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.890
 because this one like that Spanish is liking 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.890
 cut out all people 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:19.039
 next we will see in summary the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.039
 complaints presented
