00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello and welcome soon 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.849
 It finally reached the 24 hour stream 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.790
 goes online and that's exactly what I want 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.059
 Now put them on friday 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.070
 29 for a very simple reason that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 my parents still on this weekend 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 just so are I and about 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.670
 one day earlier so that's about 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.019
 actually exactly one day earlier 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.220
 Write my last exam and then 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.359
 me quasi with the stream yes somehow 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 it is always so that I myself 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.770
 so that a little reward 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.320
 wellstream is also a lot of fun 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.120
 and it's wonderfully easy yes you can 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.300
 say so 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.329
 The whole thing will start at 16 o'clock 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 Fridays and then logically to 16 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.110
 go on Saturdays 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.420
 We will be very happy in the course of this time 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.550
 very very very many guests welcome 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.590
 allowed 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 well a bit over the top though 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.899
 no matter you will see i will do it here 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.049
 Definitely synonymous in the video pack 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:05.869
 and yes, we are quite gambling 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.650
 many different things 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.560
 I actually wanted it a bit 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.869
 but specify a bit more precisely 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.369
 lately i have myself 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.780
 tried with those with my guests the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.930
 then a little rest in Trier 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.220
 keep this and not quite 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 So agree on what they are now 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 exactly want to gamble and I think so 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.299
 then you can be a bit spontaneous 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.869
 decide 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.130
 yes, what kind of guests can we look forward to 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.060
 I can now even imagine at the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.439
 say it during that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.210
 probably already in the background 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:38.520
 somehow running from 17 o'clock drago is us 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.700
 welcome and with drago we will 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.009
 most likely a bit yes 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.509
 unfortunately no multi player games play 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.299
 because drago just a shit 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.020
 Internet has 17 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.009
 on friday is clear with yes there I will 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 probably a bit in time 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.479
 emperor gamble and 83 a bit over 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.799
 me limp and just enjoyed us 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.740
 with his margins comments or something 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.310
 from 22 o'clock we are allowed to herring 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.140
 looking forward 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.119
 incredibly, 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.640
 the first time on a channel that I 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.480
 Do something with yearlings together 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.990
 I'm looking forward to it anyway 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.970
 on it and with herring have no idea 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.230
 we are not quite so 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.350
 agreed what exactly we do now 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.360
 in the first place probably either 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:30.270
 a little bit of gambling or one together 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.560
 a bit like depending on the truck itself 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.450
 then, of course, definitely offer 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.700
 yes, then first a little 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.540
 enter idle phase 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.190
 most likely, though 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.690
 Also not there is a guest who wants 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.080
 is not quite evidently because he 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.660
 not sure if he is going to the 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.489
 time or on the day at all 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.000
 That's why we are allowed to go there first 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.519
 bit distance from and maybe 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.620
 maybe not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:02.790
 if so, this guest would be around 2 o'clock 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.260
 I guess as well be otherwise from 6 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.610
 We are allowed to watch with corn 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.190
 satisfied 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.180
 and yes what should I do with cord 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.660
 actually what I always with 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.519
 cowpox bit of flashgames here and 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.680
 maybe bomberman or something 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.260
 if you can see it then probably 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.190
 also call a bit into the net clearly 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.750
 will probably be a bit longer 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.190
 be there as the others with the others 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.110
 I always have two so much 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.019
 said three hours I think that is 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.190
 for the alright and for me too and 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.650
 we will not therefore be 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:37.079
 probably not two more than one 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.269
 guest at the same time inside and then 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.290
 Kordel will be ours then in any case 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.670
 a little longer happy 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.829
 that's going to happen now, too 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.299
 wrong but okay maybe yes 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.459
 you do not know exactly 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:51.120
 in the primetime of six to eleven o'clock 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.420
 where the primetime is actually three to 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.530
 It should be four o'clock and yes I am 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.290
 curious how many then actually 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.540
 But there I am give you the tip 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.980
 does not make too much of it dependent 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.420
 but if you feel that you 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.769
 then sleep and share 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.090
 look at you the next day 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.700
 Nonetheless, I find that natural 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.989
 cool if you stay that way and so 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.610
 the last guest we still 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.970
 allowed to receive 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.109
 on Saturday afternoon then still for the 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.350
 mambo will be last few hours 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.060
 yes, then from 13 clock will be there 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.950
 and probably also to the end 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.730
 maybe not quite until the end though 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.820
 I 'm assuming that 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:35.190
 many familiar faces and herring 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.070
 as a new known face, hopefully 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.470
 you do not know exactly 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.900
 and yes I'm curious what do you think 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.310
 I hope you are longer term 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.310
 but as I said if it is you 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.630
 breaks down then rather penn and 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.070
 and so on 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.140
 Anyway, I'm really happy 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.250
 that could be exactly in the breaks 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.130
 Now also mention it will be 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.540
 give a few breaks 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.190
 for a break no one will be there 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.560
 because I simply eat myself 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.740
 must or whatever 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.290
 or maybe well I know 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.220
 yes those are for a break the 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.990
 Of course, there will be another 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.370
 there will also be times where stop no 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.830
 guest in it is where i'm a bit 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.930
 alone in it and then we will 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.580
 depending on how far I am with drago 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.810
 may have come emperor 3 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.540
 continue to button 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.900
 could rock in any case 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.930
 she still misses the hard mode 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.650
 bailey the rally part and 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.850
 probably what is 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.630
 probably if still time 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.160
 remains 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.810
 depending on I do not know how long the 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.820
 break will not actually stretch 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.270
 depending on how much time you can spend 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:49.620
 we sit down again vvv vvv me 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.250
 hope you have enough vs i know it 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.860
 not exactly 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.350
 yes yes as I said I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.280
 I will open stream link and chat link 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.210
 every case here again the 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.970
 pack bonds 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.240
 probably also short again 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:09.900
 awake and memorial video on friday 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.120
 upload yourself and will hopefully 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.780
 a great day or two great days 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.729
 I'm looking forward to you and me 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.100
 itself, of course, is clear on mine 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:23.540
 guests thanks to his well-balanced 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.540
 but it will be fine until then
