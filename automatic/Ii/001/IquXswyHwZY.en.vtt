00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 Hello UTB Mariana and today's 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:12.809
 video will be on request as a replacement 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.799
 make a replacement hands gave us a zone 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.520
 there is a zone of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.359
 This is one of the few firms in which 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.119
 joint of hands and feet and consists of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.769
 the two parts of the brush itself 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.500
 years or 100 you of such a ball 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.469
 such a replacement ball happens all 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.219
 still not here with not very well brush 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.860
 all of this mechanism 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.040
 so let's say that for this you will need 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.480
 Vienna you will need here either a pencil 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.500
 can be used 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.850
 but due to the fact that it is covered with paint 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.000
 undesirable because it can 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.730
 you can paint the plastic itself 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 use a regular brush like this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 but from the fact that she is still varnish 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 covered you are also not the best option 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.780
 what i use is this here 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 my opinion is ideal for a replacement 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.260
 these are the sticks from the Chinese 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.670
 ordinary chopsticks from a chinese restaurant 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.680
 here they are not covered with wood 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.950
 in general, ideally they are here and I use 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.490
 just means that how it all 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.060
 happens in order to replace need 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.240
 to max out to make it visible 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.240
 gum and under gum 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.479
 shove a wand 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.600
 to fix the gum on the composition 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:52.820
 here she fixed after that 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:57.020
 remove the brush itself then remove the ball and 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.020
 show them already take off the hook 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:12.750
 take off the water 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:20.950
 the very way first lego them hook 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:23.290
 under the gum sign zinku me 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:30.510
 quite tight so there are some 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:41.950
 difficulties so now we put on the ball and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:50.769
 then we put on the brush now we take out 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:55.470
 wand thats her brush is wearing nothing here 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:58.150
 complex do not have on your company which 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.010
 brushes consist of disturbance even earlier 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.560
 easier there are no such balls 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.709
 will be there just kiss crochet same 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.410
 kiss the very wand you set 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.329
 under the gum as they could max to the maximum 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.720
 devotes pulling out gum 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.280
 Substitute the stick Remove the brush but 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.579
 it basically there will need no brush 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.340
 change stop for example change with 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.280
 flat on heel back principle 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.940
 very similar so that's what i said 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:33.340
 nothing complicated here so no 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.430
 be afraid here all all today's video 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.340
 what was requested to do on application 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:43.530
 Thank you all for watching. I hope you 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.530
 handy for now
