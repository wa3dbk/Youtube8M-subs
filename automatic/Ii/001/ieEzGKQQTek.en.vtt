areas in this map words close quarters
great<00:00:27.240> for<00:00:27.359> SMGs<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.439> there's<00:00:28.619> also

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
great for SMGs but there's also

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679 
great for SMGs but there's also
long-range<00:00:29.640> areas<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.029> are<00:00:30.150> pretty<00:00:30.420> good

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
long-range areas which are pretty good

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.780 
long-range areas which are pretty good
for<00:00:31.019> assault<00:00:31.470> rifles<00:00:31.830> but<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.340> set<00:00:32.520> thing<00:00:32.669> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
for assault rifles but the set thing is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.270 
for assault rifles but the set thing is
in<00:00:33.210> Morrow<00:00:33.719> for<00:00:33.780> three<00:00:33.960> MOS<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> maps<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:35.070> all

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
in Morrow for three MOS the maps are all

in Morrow for three MOS the maps are all
close<00:00:35.520> quarters<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.180> why<00:00:36.410> SMGs<00:00:37.410> roll<00:00:37.649> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
