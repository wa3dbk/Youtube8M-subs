a memory and the longer the more extent

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490

so just because I've done damage doesn't

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.469 
so just because I've done damage doesn't
mean<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.900> should<00:01:31.770> continue<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.000> stay<00:01:33.210> out<00:01:33.390> in

several<00:02:37.920> features<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.280> are<00:02:38.430> suspicious

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
several features that are suspicious

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.449 
several features that are suspicious
first<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> all<00:02:40.380> we<00:02:40.500> look<00:02:40.650> at<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.920> talked<00:02:41.340> about

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
first of all we look at we talked about

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.570 
first of all we look at we talked about
the<00:02:41.640> abcdes<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:43.319> looking<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.130> suspicious

shows multiple different colors and you

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.400 
shows multiple different colors and you
can't<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.209> measure<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.690> diameter<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.260> if

that you can have that is an example of

that you can have that is an example of
a<00:03:33.180> melanoma<00:03:33.900> as<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.079> can<00:03:34.200> see<00:03:34.320> it's<00:03:34.500> very

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
a melanoma as you can see it's very

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.819 
a melanoma as you can see it's very
asymmetrical<00:03:35.459> has<00:03:36.000> multiple<00:03:36.660> colors<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:37.230> lot

of<00:03:37.980> border<00:03:38.280> irregularity<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.970> looks<00:03:39.120> quite

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
of border irregularity it looks quite

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.750 
of border irregularity it looks quite
large<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.799> probably<00:03:41.100> was<00:03:41.340> changing<00:03:41.730> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
large and it probably was changing the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.670 
large and it probably was changing the
time<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.359> that<00:03:42.540> one's<00:03:42.720> an<00:03:42.900> obvious<00:03:43.410> one<00:03:43.650> for

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
time and that one's an obvious one for

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.430 
time and that one's an obvious one for
me<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.579> look<00:03:44.970> at<00:03:45.239> okay<00:03:45.600> and<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.019> have<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> few

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
me to look at okay and we have a few

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.900 
me to look at okay and we have a few
more<00:03:46.620> two<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.100> we're<00:03:47.190> going<00:03:47.280> to<00:03:47.370> put<00:03:47.519> up<00:03:47.609> not

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
more two that we're going to put up not

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.729 
more two that we're going to put up not
so<00:03:48.090> often<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.540> one<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.840> not<00:03:48.989> so<00:03:49.230> obvious<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
so often that one is not so obvious to

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.960 
so often that one is not so obvious to
me<00:03:49.829> but<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.130> that<00:03:50.340> melanoma

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
me but is that melanoma

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.569 
me but is that melanoma
that's<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.239> melanoma<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:52.440> we<00:03:52.739> see<00:03:53.070> lesions<00:03:53.430> all

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
that's a melanoma and we see lesions all

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.460 
that's a melanoma and we see lesions all
the<00:03:53.700> time<00:03:53.880> in<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> office<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.660> are<00:03:54.900> that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
the time in the office that are that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.530 
the time in the office that are that
don't<00:03:55.739> look<00:03:55.950> like<00:03:56.069> much<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:57.180> sometimes

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
don't look like much and you sometimes

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.120 
don't look like much and you sometimes
are<00:03:57.660> surprised<00:03:58.019> at<00:03:58.170> melanoma<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:59.010> have<00:03:59.100> a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
are surprised at melanoma but we have a

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.090 
are surprised at melanoma but we have a
very<00:03:59.600> strict<00:04:00.600> set<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.810> rules<00:04:01.079> would<00:04:01.230> go<00:04:01.410> by<00:04:01.590> as

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
very strict set of rules would go by as

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.550 
very strict set of rules would go by as
far<00:04:02.459> as<00:04:02.609> some<00:04:02.850> when<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.450> take<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.109> sample<00:04:04.410> or

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
far as some when to take a sample or

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.380 
far as some when to take a sample or
biopsy<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.010> melanoma<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.060> clearly

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
biopsy of melanoma and this clearly

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.789 
biopsy of melanoma and this clearly
that's<00:04:06.870> clearly<00:04:07.109> that's<00:04:07.350> what<00:04:07.500> we<00:04:07.620> call<00:04:07.769> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
that's clearly that's what we call a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.349 
that's clearly that's what we call a
nodular<00:04:08.340> melanoma<00:04:08.819> which<00:04:08.940> is<00:04:09.060> one<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.239> the

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
nodular melanoma which is one of the

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.000 
nodular melanoma which is one of the
most<00:04:09.450> dangerous<00:04:09.870> types<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.769> kind<00:04:10.950> of

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
most dangerous types it's the kind of

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.440 
most dangerous types it's the kind of
melanoma<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.519> instead<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.970> spreading

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
melanoma that instead of spreading

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.569 
melanoma that instead of spreading
outward<00:04:13.139> it<00:04:13.290> tends<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.590> go<00:04:13.739> downward<00:04:14.370> and

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
outward it tends to go downward and

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.190 
outward it tends to go downward and
that's<00:04:14.819> when<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.180> can<00:04:15.269> get<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:15.780> blood<00:04:16.019> vessel

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
that's when it can get to a blood vessel

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.509 
that's when it can get to a blood vessel
or<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> lymph<00:04:16.650> node<00:04:16.829> and<00:04:17.130> be<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.340> most

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
or a lymph node and be the most

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.949 
or a lymph node and be the most
dangerous<00:04:17.789> is<00:04:18.030> there<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.269> certain<00:04:18.510> part<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
dangerous is there a certain part of the

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.529 
dangerous is there a certain part of the
body<00:04:19.229> where<00:04:19.620> melanoma<00:04:20.160> tends<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:21.060> surface

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
body where melanoma tends to surface

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.420 
body where melanoma tends to surface
most<00:04:22.289> melanomas<00:04:22.620> actually<00:04:23.039> occur<00:04:23.250> on<00:04:23.340> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
most melanomas actually occur on the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.870 
most melanomas actually occur on the
trunk

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
trunk

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.850

but<00:04:24.840> there's<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.050> rising<00:04:25.410> incidence<00:04:25.770> of

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
but there's a rising incidence of

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.630 
but there's a rising incidence of
melanoma<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.670> legs<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.300> women<00:04:28.640> the

melanoma on the legs in women the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.970 
melanoma on the legs in women the
packaged<00:04:30.270> chests<00:04:30.540> are<00:04:30.810> more<00:04:31.350> common<00:04:31.680> in<00:04:31.800> men

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
packaged chests are more common in men

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.980 
packaged chests are more common in men
but<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.030> can<00:04:33.120> occur<00:04:33.330> anywhere<00:04:33.570> on<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.840> body

actually this is called a CRO acryl
indigenous<00:04:39.480> melanoma<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.200> that's<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.500> term

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
indigenous melanoma and that's a term

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.890 
indigenous melanoma and that's a term
for<00:04:41.370> melanoma<00:04:41.670> that<00:04:41.820> occurs<00:04:42.150> on<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.420> hands<00:04:42.780> or

it's<00:06:26.040> important<00:06:26.520> to<00:06:26.730> be<00:06:27.600> aware<00:06:28.200> of<00:06:28.350> the<00:06:28.440> Sun<00:06:28.620> is

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
it's important to be aware of the Sun is

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.260 
it's important to be aware of the Sun is
you<00:06:28.860> might<00:06:29.010> tell<00:06:29.190> them<00:06:29.340> about<00:06:29.490> some<00:06:29.760> things<00:06:29.970> if

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
you might tell them about some things if

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.450 
you might tell them about some things if
I<00:06:30.420> really<00:06:30.750> have<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:30.990> make<00:06:31.170> sure<00:06:31.320> picture<00:06:31.770> or

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
I really have to make sure picture or

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.980 
I really have to make sure picture or
something<00:06:32.640> like<00:06:32.820> that<00:06:32.880> but<00:06:33.210> primarily<00:06:33.630> I'll

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
something like that but primarily I'll

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.540 
something like that but primarily I'll
just<00:06:34.410> talk<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.770> them<00:06:34.860> and<00:06:35.040> tell<00:06:35.160> them<00:06:35.190> and<00:06:35.400> they

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
just talk to them and tell them and they

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.460 
just talk to them and tell them and they
most<00:06:35.729> of<00:06:35.790> them<00:06:35.940> know

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
most of them know

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.320 
most of them know
just<00:06:36.680> like<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:36.980> they<00:06:37.220> already<00:06:37.820> know<00:06:38.030> they

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
just like you they already know they

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.970 
just like you they already know they
already<00:06:38.480> feel<00:06:38.690> bad<00:06:38.840> about<00:06:39.170> it<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:39.590> so<00:06:39.770> it's

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
already feel bad about it and so it's

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.800 
already feel bad about it and so it's
like<00:06:40.130> something<00:06:40.460> they<00:06:40.580> they<00:06:40.790> love<00:06:41.390> the<00:06:41.570> Sun<00:06:41.780> I

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
like something they they love the Sun I

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.270 
like something they they love the Sun I
mean<00:06:42.080> there<00:06:42.470> have<00:06:42.620> been<00:06:42.740> some<00:06:42.920> studies<00:06:43.070> that

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
mean there have been some studies that

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.010 
mean there have been some studies that
show<00:06:43.460> that<00:06:43.490> Sun<00:06:43.880> does<00:06:44.030> produce<00:06:44.240> endorphins<00:06:44.690> in

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
show that Sun does produce endorphins in

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.330 
show that Sun does produce endorphins in
the<00:06:45.110> body<00:06:45.260> so<00:06:45.560> it<00:06:45.650> may<00:06:45.770> produce<00:06:46.010> a<00:06:46.190> good

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
the body so it may produce a good

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.950 
the body so it may produce a good
feeling<00:06:46.700> and<00:06:46.910> so<00:06:47.090> you<00:06:47.600> know<00:06:47.660> we<00:06:47.750> have<00:06:47.870> an

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
feeling and so you know we have an

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.450 
feeling and so you know we have an
understanding<00:06:48.020> as<00:06:48.560> to<00:06:48.590> why<00:06:48.800> people<00:06:48.860> do<00:06:49.310> enjoy

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
understanding as to why people do enjoy

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.370 
understanding as to why people do enjoy
it<00:06:49.880> we<00:06:50.600> try<00:06:50.750> to<00:06:50.810> steer<00:06:51.080> them<00:06:51.110> in<00:06:51.260> the<00:06:51.320> right

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
it we try to steer them in the right

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.230 
it we try to steer them in the right
direction<00:06:51.620> if<00:06:51.980> they<00:06:52.190> are<00:06:52.700> going<00:06:52.940> to<00:06:53.000> be<00:06:53.090> some

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
direction if they are going to be some

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.240 
direction if they are going to be some
worships<00:06:53.620> worshipers<00:06:54.620> we<00:06:54.740> just<00:06:54.920> tell<00:06:55.070> them<00:06:55.190> to

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.250 
worships worshipers we just tell them to

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.700 
worships worshipers we just tell them to
watch<00:06:56.030> the<00:06:56.210> Sun<00:06:56.390> be<00:06:57.020> careful<00:06:57.410> at<00:06:57.470> certain

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
watch the Sun be careful at certain

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.930 
watch the Sun be careful at certain
hours<00:06:57.770> of<00:06:57.950> the<00:06:58.040> day<00:06:58.100> especially<00:06:58.310> the<00:06:58.700> peak

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
hours between 10:00 and 4:00 okay if you

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.280 
hours between 10:00 and 4:00 okay if you
can<00:07:01.100> run<00:07:01.310> through<00:07:01.520> quickly<00:07:01.670> for<00:07:02.180> us<00:07:02.330> the<00:07:02.990> UV

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
can run through quickly for us the UV

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.590 
can run through quickly for us the UV
index<00:07:03.320> what<00:07:04.280> what<00:07:04.520> does<00:07:04.640> that<00:07:04.670> mean<00:07:05.150> give<00:07:05.510> me

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.600 
index what what does that mean give me

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.510

the<00:07:05.690> next<00:07:05.990> week<00:07:06.110> ago<00:07:06.410> yeah<00:07:06.800> the<00:07:07.010> yummiest<00:07:07.310> was

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
the next week ago yeah the yummiest was

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.560 
the next week ago yeah the yummiest was
