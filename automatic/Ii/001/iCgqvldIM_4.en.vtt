00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.180
 Welcome, for example, check this month with daimler-chef ki-moon 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.950
 Christian Schmitz and that is Iris Förster Voss Seckendorff 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.740
 really expensive 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.519
 times one percent free2play MMOG s so many are above all alone 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 in the optics yes that comes from China of manufacturer should bring brings each 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.029
 The idea that he needs two or three such players is just now 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.769
 Principle of the Ems to delete 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.269
 is relatively trimmed for accessibility so you even have your car 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.560
 The system resources invited so naughty children more accessible percent 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.539
 and on the other hand, this is again on group and their view 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.940
 which one rather turned to professionals 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.820
 inconsistent as I think 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.340
 less to the whole optics that has to these ORF but now he has known 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.370
 Fantasy is here with the vampires 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.059
 in the end, the class sang Euro 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.539
 and it is about stone humans as almost a bit alternate beings though 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.940
 well-known injured because not forgive and visually like me 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.010
 also find drug use slightly inclined like oh hurt fact I think that has 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.060
 everyone on the property moves to the field 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.080
 for Dario game but not just bad 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.710
 5 so handle 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.890
 go through it 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.410
 yes this is a Battlestar Galactica Online Kan also the TV series Danger 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.720
 that they never saw but not on 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.899
 For many, the Regular Series speech and citizen have the best value 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.130
 that's basically the prelude to believe one's competition 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.549
 Proofs in the browser open suspect what is allowed on the preview and 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.180
 May be on the gamigo that is now the perfect Bigpoint 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.390
 However, where should the game where the template is on is the game 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.460
 it will not do it justice 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.840
 just because he does not catch the same thing, so she's right 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.990
 you are now on the galactic path Gera Peter has become lifelike 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.460
 reconstructed here in the region is also around 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.660
 but unfortunately there is far too little background explains atmosphere it 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.090
 Do not focus on tackling boring mission then 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.070
 fly out and shoot friends and Austrian Japan knows all this 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.350
 At least the Mass Effect 2 has been so much fun and fun 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.790
 Percent Oct need to invest money the game is out of tune to be able to do it otherwise 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.830
 So my life is endless 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.910
 you hold on very fast 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.430
 also fully from the first DLC for New Vegas now synonymous for the PC right 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.180
 Sir 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.470
 we have everything on-site arrangements dinner own stand-alone story 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.490
 when you are ready 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.529
 after the legendary for amateurs had 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:15.500
 I do not even think so 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.069
 once removed from all equipment 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.709
 However, the way is self-directed, however, not to balance 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.140
 gone over because a martial arts will be enough will be great 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.500
 rewards on the other hand if you are not in this DLC with so little Hecking 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.879
 Enter mission 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.189
 then the goal is on and for another steadily expanding dead end Dr 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.559
 So Zetsches story animated companion you put the page 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:38.210
 gets 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.860
 but equality is still very weak and with ten euros too 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.180
 comparatively expensive for van Gaal on one because it is not very much 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.199
 is extensive 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.359
 that was much cheaper Kostelic 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.359
 the last word the vehicle came in 2005 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.719
 "It's still exciting percent that wow developers have 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.269
 Insanely much plugged in the game is so in the FX on the norm 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.979
 Criticism that it is almost unrecognizable correctly 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.529
 underwater volcano multiplayer-map you can do it alone and Cörmigk 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:09.469
 Play matches that can work very well 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.410
 the makers of units for the five people who are already in it 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.290
 and five more are planned 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.230
 the company's project that there is more with the campaign 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.010
 should be available immediately 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.129
 not so bad 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.280
 because there is also people there we are where there is a renunciation of the 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:27.419
 seeks to be right that can already leading goal 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.099
 Rojas Fahrtweg fans know that there are not many good games at Arber 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.550
 probably one of the better ones 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.760
 and crashed head-on into duty a selection of LifeSize's word for 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.609
 obviously took place 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.220
 Last but not least for all 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.640
 back to Central Europe the Middle Ages before such an old one 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.490
 play classics today say nice young 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.560
 this is the dream hotel - 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.810
 and based on Bornholm right this is a browser based little player 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.650
 however, a bit bigger and too epic and encompass the world 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.409
 the view as the original one later with 7 out of them wanted others 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.629
 he gets together or against each other and it is even more complex yes but you 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.610
 There are lots of unlocking lots of exploring new buildings 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.299
 discover that is really motivating that's always there what to do 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.209
 the test on the matter it is such a game what you what you always side by side 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.079
 Back out she was building the building there for a while then can usually take 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.959
 Tend to be something else will always look again but 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.849
 You should do that too, because if you do not handle it in bulk for days 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.620
 then also quickly after shows and what the free-to-play so very much as 

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.590
 that you have to buy there maps packages 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.830
 and thus to the rise 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.310
 such a dealer this was short and crisp years imprisonment 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.729
 Revue companies are supposed to take over or Jenson
