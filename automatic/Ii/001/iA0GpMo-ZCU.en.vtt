can<00:04:55.720> understand<00:04:56.590> why<00:04:56.889> not<00:04:57.160> understand<00:04:57.970> the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
can understand why not understand the

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.270 
can understand why not understand the
logic<00:04:58.690> trust<00:04:59.139> me<00:04:59.200> I<00:04:59.260> do<00:04:59.320> understand<00:05:00.010> it

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
logic trust me I do understand it

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.750 
logic trust me I do understand it
because<00:05:00.820> you<00:05:01.600> know<00:05:01.780> like<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:02.919> said<00:05:02.979> that<00:05:03.340> races

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
because you know like I said that races

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.129 
because you know like I said that races
are<00:05:03.880> mentally<00:05:04.270> slow<00:05:04.450> they<00:05:04.900> are

are mentally slow they are

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.710 
are mentally slow they are

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
and so you would never understand their

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.719 
and so you would never understand their
logic<00:05:07.930> and<00:05:08.560> I<00:05:08.620> know<00:05:08.680> somebody<00:05:09.190> will<00:05:09.400> you<00:05:09.490> mean
