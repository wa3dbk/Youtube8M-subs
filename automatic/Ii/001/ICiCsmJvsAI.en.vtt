00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:11.250
 as on the cc cream that I have 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.080
 using a while ago and that I'm 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.180
 very enchanting and that you already know all 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.100
 the ones that follow me that I love and it's the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.990
 cc cream of boil yang 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.789
 I bought him in sephora or if the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.640
 They sold elsewhere but if it costs 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.850
 38 euros is expensive yes but my opinion is 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.900
 It's worth spending that money 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.850
 good to say is that I buy it for 38 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.550
 euros 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.020
 for less when I have 20% I take advantage 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.450
 to buy it, never buy it at 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.000
 original price and plus or minus 20% 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:46.750
 Well, it goes for around 30 euros, so 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.550
 I see it so crazy the price say 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:55.090
 is that the argor brand is no longer a brand 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.860
 Asian and is a cc cream with a spf 45 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.600
 that the truth is that it is one of the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.230
 I have seen that it has higher 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:06.520
 super good and good really this 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.159
 product is a product that I would say that 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.840
 is aimed at people who do not 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.310
 we have many imperfections because 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.850
 Sincerely does not cover does not cover 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.340
 imperfections worth me luckily now 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.420
 I have a fairly clean skin and I do not 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:29.130
 I have imperfections, I do not have pimples 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.759
 and that's why I use it basically and if I have 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.740
 some imperfection covered her with 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 corrector because either if you have 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.509
 many imperfections this serves us 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.460
 obviously but if you have some granite 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.950
 some little thing that you can cover with a 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.780
 corrector because this is going great and if not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.490
 you have imperfections the truth that the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.880
 I recommend 100% who makes this cc 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.300
 cream that I have seen that other 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.300
 times or bb king's that I've tried 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.060
 is that it is totally of these that are 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.960
 white and then adapt to your 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.740
 skin color these there are many many 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.600
 but there are quite a few I have tried the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.750
 baby of l'oréal 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.060
 and it's the same it's soft and then it's supposed 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.550
 that fits your color and has two 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.840
 tones the middle and the dark I think it is 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.730
 the clear and the medium something like that and to me the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.950
 time of cream de l'oréal 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.310
 it seemed to me like a bird of rhythm and 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.250
 economic and that was going pretty well but 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.270
 it adapted to my color 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.580
 and what happens here in the boil is already 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.970
 only one there is no middle tone or tone 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 dark or anything like that is just one and it 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.230
 perfectly adapts to the color and is that 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.210
 I can assure you 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.400
 one hundred percent have that color that 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.489
 you have to adapt 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.689
 because I say it despite being a brunette 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.579
 in winter I get very very white and 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.670
 in summer I get very very dark because 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.590
 I'm brunette 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.560
 I have used it both in winter and in 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.140
 summer and it suits my color totally 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.700
 So that is a point that I value 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.180
 very much of a product 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.629
 of makeup because I up to now 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.819
 it is very difficult to find your tone is very 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.709
 difficult it happens that some 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.959
 brand have your tone but it is very difficult 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.760
 no and I up to now had not 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.349
 finding himself needed something like this 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.819
 a cc that imparts to any tone of 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:45.000
 skin because in addition but then came the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.099
 summer and had to change base of 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.750
 cream makeup or whatever because 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.030
 the other half very clear because it was from 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.920
 summer and that's what we usually do with 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.410
 make-up base we take one more 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.870
 dark for winter and another lighter 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.380
 for summer because that with this has been 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.900
 finished you already have one and point and good 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.400
 as properties that is in the first 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.140
 part that I love is that that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.450
 adapts to any type of skin and what 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.319
 I assure one hundred percent 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.350
 and as properties I tell you what to see 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.459
 I have mixed skin good if skin 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.459
 mixed and 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.400
 and tell you that there is not a part that I have 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.780
 more fat and the part of vicar where 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.900
 I have more fat is in the area of ​​the 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.870
 nose and that is where I have that is where 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.320
 I have more open pores then I do not 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.690
 he does not do anything to me or that's what I say 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.610
 sincerely that I wear this alone and 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.560
 after several hours, they come out 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.889
 shines because then I have the hairs very 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.379
 open and it's normal 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:54.639
 so if you want a cc that is for 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:57.340
 oily skin you understand 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.949
 very greasy skin because this is going to 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.800
 Serve for dry skin 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.300
 I see it quite juice if it is skins 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.430
 dry is fine I do not have dry skin 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.460
 I can not tell you if it goes well or not 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.090
 it's fine but it's not for nothing 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.800
 and it hydrates pretty well and I do not 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.120
 I would recommend both if you have the skin 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.830
 dry as normal skin 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.250
 if you have mixed 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:29.350
 and you have to help with some test 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:31.300
 or cream that helps prevent them from coming out 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.840
 shines what is it that I do the area and 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.060
 he has made me another cream previous to this 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.830
 to avoid shining 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:43.120
 then that 's the only downside that could 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.120
 give this product but despite 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.700
 that I use it because it is that it is not 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.830
 that I have all the oily skin and 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.280
 then more what I love too 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.870
 is that you use this product without 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.760
 have thrown anything you do not need to 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.560
 eches me the creams you made me because 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.040
 is used to throwing creams before 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.620
 of this but it is quite hydrating and not 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.960
 you would need to cream yourself because it is 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:12.710
 a cc cream and the baby cream as you know 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.180
 it's a two for one let's say 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.930
 that make makeup and cream to the 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.419
 time 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:22.949
 so when I did this 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:26.130
 both with cream or cream without me 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.530
 Leaves a super-healthy face 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.720
 super did not risk to get up with 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.449
 the tired face with a tad of 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.539
 dark circles with each dream you put them and 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:38.669
 It gives you a good- looking appearance that 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:42.240
 besides another point apart from art this 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.280
 aspect is that you do not notice that you are 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.870
 makeup that is what I like 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.759
 that you can not tell if you're just serious 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.889
 because then I put on powders and that but 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.810
 If there are days that I wear, it only makes 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:52.500
 cycling and you do not notice that you are 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.599
 makeup 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.550
 that's another thing that I love and good 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:58.229
 and that's why it does not work for people who 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.259
 have many obvious imperfections 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:03.090
 but you have only a little aspect 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:04.380
 very good face and it does not show that 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.560
 you wear makeup because it is that 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.080
 fuses perfectly with the color of 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.750
 Our skin 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:14.629
 and good thing is that I can not say anything else 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.819
 that in addition if you are a bit to 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:20.419
 back for the price tell you how it goes 

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:22.460
 very much, this is the new one that 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:24.680
 I bought recently because I had 20% of 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.340
 sephora but I have this still I think that 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.770
 more than 6 months I think more than 6 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.289
 months because it was before summer 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.319
 before summer I picked it up I do not know if 

00:07:33.289 --> 00:07:40.120
 would be March or so be more than six months 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.120
 and I still have left 

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:44.689
 almost finished but I still have to know that 

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:48.379
 It spreads a lot and I dress all 

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:50.869
 the days so it's going to last a lot and 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:52.669
 nothing that I recommend you I recommend 

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:54.799
 clint shelves that ye may try to me 

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:57.079
 love is my opinion is what I 

00:07:54.799 --> 00:07:59.269
 you asked and the truth is that nothing 

00:07:57.079 --> 00:08:01.459
 I want is that the brand has not 

00:07:59.269 --> 00:08:04.489
 gifted left is because I bought it 

00:08:01.459 --> 00:08:06.109
 I want and nothing but I hope that I have 

00:08:04.489 --> 00:08:09.519
 liked the video and we see ourselves as 

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:09.519
 always in the next video see you later
