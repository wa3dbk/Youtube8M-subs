get them inside your circle and how many
is<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.560> once<00:01:59.829> every<00:02:00.310> flag<00:02:00.549> is<00:02:00.700> collected<00:02:01.090> that

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
is it once every flag is collected that

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:04.959 
minute counts down so there's a little

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:06.359 
minute counts down so there's a little
timer<00:02:05.229> but<00:02:05.499> yeah<00:02:05.679> well<00:02:05.829> we'll<00:02:06.039> go<00:02:06.130> over<00:02:06.159> the

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
timer but yeah well we'll go over the

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.700 
timer but yeah well we'll go over the
game<00:02:06.459> type
