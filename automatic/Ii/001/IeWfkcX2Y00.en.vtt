first<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.549> get<00:01:14.640> tricky<00:01:14.820> at<00:01:15.149> times<00:01:15.180> but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
first it can get tricky at times but

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
first it can get tricky at times but
that's<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.350> boosters<00:01:16.740> also<00:01:17.100> come<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.399> handy

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that's when boosters also come in handy

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.910 
that's when boosters also come in handy
to<00:01:17.909> slow<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.240> time<00:01:18.600> give<00:01:19.110> hints<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.680> even

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
to slow down time give hints and even

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160 
to slow down time give hints and even
more<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.399> is<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.579> nice<00:01:20.789> touch<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.450> there's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
more which is a nice touch and there's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
more which is a nice touch and there's
even<00:01:22.469> a<00:01:22.530> league<00:01:22.740> mode<00:01:22.979> where<00:01:23.219> you<00:01:23.250> can

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
even a league mode where you can

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.249 
even a league mode where you can
challenge<00:01:23.640> players<00:01:23.969> all<00:01:24.240> over<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.780> world<00:01:24.990> in

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
challenge players all over the world in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
I wish there are more options that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.800 
I wish there are more options that
didn't<00:01:31.409> require<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.189> many<00:01:32.520> coins<00:01:32.909> but<00:01:33.509> over

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
didn't require so many coins but over

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
didn't require so many coins but over
