00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello today i would like to 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.780
 tell about the assembly 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.210
 do-it-yourself and concert subwoofers 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.340
 how to do it right and the best 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.619
 so that everything was a little bit 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.880
 an hour passed and tell about the saw how 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.510
 mark that how clearly everything was to 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:30.300
 avoid all sorts 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:34.140
 uneven pilaf as on logic yes that is 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:39.500
 usually when you saw usually and 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.500
 drank thing happens right left goes 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:52.350
 arbitrary it turns out to the light 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:57.680
 drank blanks can see what's here 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.750
 just a board costs well 18 plywood 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 you're just standing perfect 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 almost 90 degrees where the monument 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:16.590
 Screw my tightened threw it all 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:21.920
 the case and drove so to speak further here saw 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.920
 let's say drank too 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:34.340
 you put a little here alone 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.759
 millimeter that's perfect for it 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.759
 smooth pego 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.899
 I changed my mind did not come up with this spied 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:53.020
 also on the Internet did so fast 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:56.079
 hand and put together a piece goes plywood want here 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.159
 here he is here just carry clamps 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:04.329
 patent of plywood there intelligible from the side subs 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.390
 by a little more you do it 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.989
 drank to you about watching him 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.200
 there was a little more where the saw blade 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 something like this and earplugs even 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.739
 also some kind of plywood like any 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.620
 here is no door trim here was in 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.209
 put 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.079
 put stuck twisted 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.940
 what did not work out I turned emphasis 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:37.690
 for saw yes that is when we substitute it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.560
 peaceful and them goes perfectly straight part 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.950
 fell asleep there literal code 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.609
 Pavel drinker then drive that is first 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:54.299
 she was a little more screwed this 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:57.579
 she dried everything framed once and he 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.510
 walked and turned out perfectly smooth 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.510
 ruler 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.239
 clog it when the disc is trained this 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:21.489
 that's the joke i mean there is plywood 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:24.040
 so do not be so cut off here I outlined here 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:31.919
 the mark here is not necessary to allow 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.720
 hence 310 charted charted line of this 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:37.750
 We put it here with me 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.829
 I fixed as approximately 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.120
 understand the shot exactly straight perfect 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:49.360
 exactly that is, and saw but what's the catch 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.560
 that is, well, everything is clear all the same 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.709
 remember one thing that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.090
 when you saw the disk has the same thickness 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:03.620
 somewhere two and a half millimeter three 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:07.230
 different disks are and the finishing side 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.260
 it will always come from the other side 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.590
 measured that is, if you turn 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.000
 let's say the noise by the other side 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.789
 this label, that is, there will be a part already 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.509
 which we need less already on 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.830
 millimeter 2 3 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:34.130
 that is, you should always remember it here. 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:44.340
 This is followed too here sawed too 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:46.800
 the assembly will be clear in the second part 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.669
 there I will show that how 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.669
 do the right thing
