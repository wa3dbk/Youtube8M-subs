 I bring three achievements easy milestones so that 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.009
 those of rich in extinction mode not 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.840
 I know why strangely in the achievements of 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.610
 extinction ' come as secret achievements 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.740
 but good gentlemen are three are very 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.330
 easy the first of them is urbanite 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.340
 is to get to the city maybe you 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.250
 they have already done the second one is also 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.110
 bloody hut that says goes up 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.730
 the cabin that is also for that already 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.530
 It's not so easy but if it's still 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.780
 being easy and the third one is like the 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.150
 secret that sometimes to the best that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.129
 It costs a little to discover is to kill 50 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.290
 aliens with the electric fences and 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.870
 the fire traps in a game this 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.940
 let's say the secret achievement but good 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.670
 I'm going to give you some tips on what 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.920
 we talked talking about what we talked about and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.710
 we see the gameplay that is very father 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.720
 gentlemen and good gentlemen let's start with 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.640
 the achievements or rather with the gameplay 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.199
 I'm going to explain I 'm going to give you some tips 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.840
 some opinions on this mode 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.310
 extinction and good let's begin gentlemen and 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.250
 good gentlemen what we are seeing is 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.260
 a little bit of the gameplay of how 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.830
 is the achievement of urbanite that is to reach 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.290
 the city 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.880
 and what is it easy enough to destroy 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.470
 the three hives and extract the support 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 aerial to destroy the hive 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.730
 big on the wall that does not let you through 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.410
 to the city and well I tell you that the 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.080
 extinguishing mode I have been liking 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.950
 I've been playing it a lot with 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.619
 the clan we are raising levels 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 of a single player is crap like that is 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.579
 the extinction mode is a crap from a 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.909
 single player but already playing with friends 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.250
 it's fun is very addictive has 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.770
 I quite liked why I do not know why 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.560
 I know if it's due what 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.929
 wrong or been being improved governed 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.000
 in multiplayer mode but in the mode 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.560
 extinction as we take you are 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 playing with the clan you have to climb 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.329
 levels is something that needs to be clarified is 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.670
 like the multiplayer mode because you have to 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.039
 rise of levels there are prestige 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.170
 prestige are 30 levels in each 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.269
 prestige are 5 prestige each 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.209
 prestige gives you a relic the relic 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:18.170
 is that the level of difficulty goes up 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.170
 to the game because it takes away you do not fit 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.370
 they are things that later and that arrives 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.470
 because if he's insane obviously 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.090
 it still did not reach that level but hey 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.950
 but thus demonstrating there are also achievements 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.599
 according to the relics are 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.579
 pending to the channel since I will give them a 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.530
 survival guide to extinction that 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.660
 will be very good then no more than 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.010
 merchan c of the block absolutely everything 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.650
 but good gentlemen 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.780
 to which he is commenting mode 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.870
 extension of an opportunity 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.360
 it is very good to imagine that it is the way 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.730
 extension is an old one that is not 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.740
 precisely the one that you like but that is 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.170
 very good vibes and you are pulling the fart 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.070
 then you have to go grabbing there 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.050
 go playing 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.090
 it was very addictive that we see how 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.710
 will achieve the achievement of urbanite that is 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.870
 move to the southern city and the three 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.320
 storms and the big wall another one of those 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.040
 things go things and good in what we went through 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.230
 the next gameplay that is to 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.599
 what is it called to go to the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.120
 cabin that I'm going to cut in the cabin 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.250
 because there we have fought this we are at 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.280
 point of achieving it and in itself pointed but 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.840
 something happens many disconnections do not know by 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.790
 what but good gentlemen 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.370
 the point is good right now I'm going to 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.049
 explain how to get or give a few 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.970
 tips to achieve the achievement of 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.280
 all means that says in a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.280
 single game in one we have to kill 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.750
 50 to someone with traps if they have 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.120
 fixed if they have played the game mode 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.870
 there are a lot of electric traps there 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.060
 fire traps and already the helicopter 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.950
 helicopter I think I also do not know if you 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.959
 tell it here in this part of the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.579
 city ​​is in the little house in the middle there 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.159
 a top part and it looks like a 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.310
 screen a computer there active 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.659
 the helicopter is 6000 it seems 6000 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.700
 of money is to keep getting into 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.040
 little bit so that when the 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.689
 things get difficult that there 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.030
 companions lying down or that are us 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.750
 mother I'm activating the helicopter to 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.760
 come 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.530
 obviously the helicopter can not be 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.060
 Activate 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.410
 when it 's knocking down these are the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.630
 large hives because it says that the 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.160
 airspace is already busy but without 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.620
 However, for the other hives, 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.630
 small if it's a big help besides 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.720
 that tells you for the achievement good that 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.730
 I think anyway in the traps 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.889
 of fire and electric traps we 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.690
 they do a lot for how we're going to do this 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.600
 achievement to make it easier for us 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.760
 gentlemen at the beginning of the game there 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.190
 I think a four - seater is 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.230
 weapons specialist or obviously he 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.730
 they go to armament and that's where it comes 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:52.970
 as a home how to equip let's say all 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.740
 your weapons your advantages and the classes that 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.470
 is the main thing as I commented 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.780
 first they have to go to the armament 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.360
 choose your class there is the kind of 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.490
 weapons specialist tank class 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.229
 the engineer class and the kind of 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.380
 doctor to make this achievement that is 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.590
 kill 50 aliens with traps let's 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.360
 equip the engineer class because 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.479
 gentlemen good the engineer is 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.470
 specialist in improving the drill 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.020
 fixing more quickly 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.000
 he is also the trap specialist 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.620
 this means gentlemen good to 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.870
 We will cost us the traps 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.720
 cheaper in addition to that they will last 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.390
 more are going to kill more and we're also going to 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.380
 have the advantage that by activating the 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.510
 traps go when they hurt aliens 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.190
 We will be recovering money which 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:44.060
 will practically make us 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.560
 traps are free for us this 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.240
 It is also very important not only for 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.880
 the achievement but for the team always 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.580
 has to try to stop a 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.040
 engineer on the team since the 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.350
 traps and they do a lot of unemployment though 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.330
 they think they do little harm if they do 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.330
 very much unemployment at the time of extraction 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.290
 but good gentlemen remember that the 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.910
 key to this secret achievement that is by 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.430
 all means is simply to be 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.950
 activating all all the traps 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.710
 the electric and the fire is very 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.810
 easy it's worth it, besides that good 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.370
 your companions to eye also with the 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.410
 connective traps the traps warns him 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.960
 of your companions as they also 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.420
 they can damage the traps and it has happened to me 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.220
 that are scorched electrocuted 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.230
 many of the classmates and also they 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.780
 have burned then there's that you have to 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.520
 change little if you lock yourself in the 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.770
 trap for that is the joke so that 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.780
 reach the fifty dead aliens 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.750
 by traps in a single game that is 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.270
 basically where the difficulty lies 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.250
 of this achievement here you can not bring them 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.170
 because I do not know what the fuck happened with that 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.030
 achievement of simply disappeared I lost 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:53.630
 the video but good gentlemen here is 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.160
 part is already to open the achievement of this 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.830
 the bloody cabin that is obviously 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.020
 move on to the cabins after that 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.150
 only the escape will remain 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.520
 approximately I will bring it to you 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.169
 we are raising the level to obtain 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.889
 the beautiful weapons 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:12.050
 to achieve this trophy this achievement and 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.120
 good gentlemen that has been everything see you 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.680
 in the next one there you see look there you see 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.020
 who is the pro of the clan who is the 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.090
 only one that remained alive and good gentlemen 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.800
 here is the helicopter so that when 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.050
 want to activate what you see in a 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.669
 very delicate situation like the one 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.080
 It was good mine not so much because I already 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.150
 it was the last thing we had finished but 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.469
 good gentlemen this has been all I hope 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.270
 in the survival guide for 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.889
 extinguish in my channel remember to leave me 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.539
 its like your comments that it has 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:37.639
 similar in extinction mode to me if it has 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:39.139
 liked a lot of people do not like it for 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.060
 for what he wants to replace he wants 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:42.740
 replace zombies but it 's something 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.330
 different and it's very entertaining and 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.699
 addictive so I recommend that you 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.110
 play like I produced pretty good 

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.060
