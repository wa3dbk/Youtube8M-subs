you<00:01:38.009> could<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.369> everything<00:01:39.060> looks<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> same

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you could see everything looks the same

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.600 
you could see everything looks the same
but<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> only<00:01:40.079> difference<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.220> set

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
but the only difference that you set

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.270 
but the only difference that you set
there<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> people<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:44.189> know

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
there is for the people that you know

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
there is for the people that you know
really<00:01:44.490> pay<00:01:44.700> attention<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> color<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
really pay attention is the color of the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.280 
really pay attention is the color of the
LEDs<00:01:46.140> when<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.310> red<00:01:47.490> LED<00:01:47.909> version<00:01:48.720> my

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
LEDs when I do the red LED version my

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.899 
LEDs when I do the red LED version my
frequency<00:01:49.619> counter<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.009> gonna<00:01:50.159> tell<00:01:50.399> me<00:01:50.520> what

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
frequency counter is gonna tell me what

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
frequency counter is gonna tell me what
the<00:01:51.000> frequency<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.840> transmitter

you wonder why it says 302 point three

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.389 
you wonder why it says 302 point three
oh<00:02:00.210> three<00:02:00.540> oh<00:02:00.780> three<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.770> one<00:02:01.979> here<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.369> a

thirty-four megahertz remote control so

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
thirty-four megahertz remote control so
no<00:02:06.899> wonder<00:02:07.229> why<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.920> remote<00:02:08.190> controls

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
no wonder why these two remote controls

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.010 
no wonder why these two remote controls
are<00:02:08.670> incompatible<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.599> learn<00:02:09.780> from

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
are incompatible and will not learn from

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.280 
are incompatible and will not learn from
one<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.590> another<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:11.430> happens

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
one to another this happens

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.449 
one to another this happens
I can't<00:02:12.560> even<00:02:12.650> begin<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.980> tell<00:02:13.189> you<00:02:13.219> how<00:02:13.310> many

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
I can't even begin to tell you how many

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.949 
I can't even begin to tell you how many
times<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.879> week<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.269> this<00:02:14.450> could<00:02:14.629> be<00:02:14.750> easily

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
times a week and this could be easily

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.770 
times a week and this could be easily
avoided<00:02:15.230> if<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.799> just<00:02:16.010> asked<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.120> when<00:02:17.629> you're

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
avoided if you just asked so when you're

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.809 
avoided if you just asked so when you're
buying<00:02:17.989> remote<00:02:18.349> controls<00:02:18.739> don't<00:02:19.489> bind

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
buying remote controls don't bind

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.149 
buying remote controls don't bind
because<00:02:19.969> of<00:02:20.329> what<00:02:20.480> they<00:02:20.569> look<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:20.950> buy<00:02:21.950> them

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
because of what they look like buy them

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.220 
because of what they look like buy them
because<00:02:22.310> they<00:02:22.700> what<00:02:23.000> they<00:02:23.150> work<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.689> okay<00:02:24.079> if

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
because they what they work like okay if

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.410 
because they what they work like okay if
