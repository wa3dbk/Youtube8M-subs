difficult weapon a weapon that doesn't

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.440 
difficult weapon a weapon that doesn't
really<00:00:44.280> work<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.230> and<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> is

this is true because when you master

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.100 
this is true because when you master
weapon<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.050> not<00:00:52.350> really<00:00:53.329> easy<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.660> handle

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
weapon that's not really easy to handle

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.830 
weapon that's not really easy to handle
you're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:58.789> immensely<00:00:59.840> more

you're going to have a immensely more

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.100 
you're going to have a immensely more
easy<00:01:02.750> let's<00:01:03.750> say<00:01:03.960> way<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.979> handling<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
easy let's say way of handling the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.950 
easy let's say way of handling the
amines<00:01:07.110> weapon<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.600> put<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.750> into

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
amines weapon so put this into

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.250 
amines weapon so put this into
perspective<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:12.420> most<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
perspective what I do in in most of the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.910 
perspective what I do in in most of the
games<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.180> require<00:01:15.180> aiming<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.140> mean

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
games that require aiming I mean

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.280 
games that require aiming I mean
generally<00:01:17.310> use<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.000> semi-automatic<00:01:18.479> weapons

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
generally use the semi-automatic weapons

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.320 
generally use the semi-automatic weapons
and<00:01:20.810> those<00:01:21.810> weapons<00:01:22.320> tell<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.520> shoot<00:01:24.060> more

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and those weapons tell you to shoot more

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.950 
and those weapons tell you to shoot more
than<00:01:24.390> once<00:01:24.600> in<00:01:26.210> sequence<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.360> order<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.750> kill

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
than once in sequence in order to kill

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710 
than once in sequence in order to kill
somebody<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.490> won't<00:01:29.700> get<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.390> shot<00:01:30.659> so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
somebody so you won't get a one shot so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.929 
somebody so you won't get a one shot so
sniper<00:01:31.350> rifles<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> question

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
sniper rifles are out of the question

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
sniper rifles are out of the question
because<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.659> shot<00:01:33.900> weapons<00:01:34.320> don't<00:01:34.950> really

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
because one shot weapons don't really

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.100 
because one shot weapons don't really

hand the m14 also has the great

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.360 
hand the m14 also has the great
advantage<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.330> has<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.470> lot<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.830> bullets

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
advantage that it has a lot of bullets

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.430 
advantage that it has a lot of bullets
so<00:02:28.610> if<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:29.000> manage<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.480> do<00:02:29.780> well<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.140> can<00:02:30.290> have

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
so if you manage to do well you can have

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.120 
so if you manage to do well you can have
a<00:02:31.450> long<00:02:32.450> game<00:02:32.920> initially<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.100> are<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.520> to

the<00:03:12.410> semi-automatic<00:03:13.100> weapon<00:03:13.790> one<00:03:14.330> is<00:03:14.570> your

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the semi-automatic weapon one is your

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.010 
the semi-automatic weapon one is your
trigger<00:03:15.020> finger<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:17.000> second<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.600> keeping

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
trigger finger and the second is keeping

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.040 
trigger finger and the second is keeping
your<00:03:18.200> aim<00:03:18.380> very<00:03:18.410> stable<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> target<00:03:19.670> so
