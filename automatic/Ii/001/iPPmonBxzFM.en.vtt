00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.279
 I'm here tobi is here that's it 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.140
 returns the photo app of the week on 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.300
 Friday welcome 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.360
 today as promised or as of you 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
 wanted the times app for android the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.240
 we would like to look at it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.060
 I grab my galaxy s 51's 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 app is called the cross part apes 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.410
 files labs how to do that too 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 pronounce and we go directly 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.070
 not to waste time and money 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.570
 not so much in front of the app to talk like 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.570
 tobi that cares normally 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.460
 So what I have about the story so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.379
 when you start the app that looks quite 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.100
 just as there are not many 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.500
 adjust 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.879
 At least not much in the app itself 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.289
 in the surface itself a condition 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.360
 gives small town that makes her directly 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.250
 There you also shoot sooner 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.539
 you'll see everything flash directly 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.059
 English unfortunately but that the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.559
 best rated app gives the same store 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.820
 with the functions you can you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.410
 On the stand will be automatically 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.340
 should go if he already has moderate 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.240
 should be switched off or 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.040
 should be turned on 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:13.650
 then you can have one more here 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.810
 use whole effects like aqua or m 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.729
 bus or what else is there so a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.680
 so little so do not instagram more 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.110
 within filters you just like that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 peace of mind can pack exactly in advance 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.220
 then choose again as he does then 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.450
 light should now set here 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.369
 prefer cloudy work of daylight 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.500
 or just automatically and a few more 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 others so the quartier white balance 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.770
 as in the loud digital camera or a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.420
 mirror reflex camera you can then 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.100
 adjust where I am right now if he is 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.700
 Outside pages are possible you can ask 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.829
 So I really wanted one and one 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.540
 and how to recognize it 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.950
 my stories use that as well 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.509
 the rescuers continue 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.750
 then you can still adjust like that 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.640
 focus is set to know if he 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.229
 should be consistent in the video if 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.939
 you take a video you do 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.700
 automatically a video directly from 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.890
 the recording 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.940
 or whether always per image should remain so 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.790
 and then there is the possibility 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.550
 here to adjust the video resolution 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:23.290
 So highest lowest or just to the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.880
 different gradings and here 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.500
 you could watch the video so 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.260
 the reservation here is the gallery 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.540
 with the already created videos here 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.420
 You do not see much except that I am there 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.629
 have tried a bit in the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.160
 editorial with us and up here 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:45.160
 her right video to last about 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.630
 I think that's partly what I think 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.970
 got a bit short 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.019
 exactly if you ask now how can 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.150
 to hire now 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:56.319
 how long the video will be and with what 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.750
 distance the pictures are made then 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.549
 there is no setting here 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.180
 but now skipped the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.430
 setting not now the setting 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.510
 to adjust just how many pictures he 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.160
 yes should do 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.680
 so how many seconds pass then 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.910
 the next picture makes it short 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.209
 I start the whole is 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.440
 all a bit higher one now 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.709
 lake because that's not my name, then 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.810
 one says if freistaates has looked 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.980
 the recording and then takes about 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.299
 So you can adjust settings for how long 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.000
 It should take until he starts five 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.180
 seconds 10 seconds 20 36 seconds though 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.230
 An open start immediately 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.910
 I do not need the option so often 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 and right now a score of 0 1 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.639
 seconds that means he does each 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:44.049
 tenth of a second now automatically 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:45.850
 picture and there looks down 33 2 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:49.269
 minutes we have two seconds now 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.760
 two seconds three seconds exactly 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.489
 of course to show you the whole time 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.040
 almost in one end times in one 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.500
 product final result is now quite time 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.400
 briefly a subnetwork topic just became 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.430
 has created 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.739
 there we are again and so if that is 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.440
 Result like I said that is 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.720
 now the version we recorded 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.190
 have with the free version 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.049
 the full version with just a bit 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.010
 more adjustment options also the 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.870
 Possibility one entitled 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.540
 how many pictures taken per second 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.160
 should be in the video costs two euros 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.570
 21 and then comes without advertising and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.210
 if you take a look here 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.030
 Regular updates are also available 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.910
 two last one was on 6 9 10 13 bit 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.410
 Longer ago but the app works and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.820
 it just like the ios app without 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.919
 to use problems they do not have 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.039
 can and did detect errors 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.960
 of 239 people with an average of 4.4 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.979
 star rated what you can see 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.930
 can let because the android community 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.280
 already tends to be tough on apps 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.470
 So come on a bit of advertising 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.240
 if the function is not correct they are 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.949
 evaluation again very quickly bad 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.360
 but that seems like a very good product 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.610
 to be and also the free one 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.960
 version is relatively easy to use 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.180
 as I said always have more features 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.860
 you just have to be 21st 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.870
 spend what but and reasonable 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.840
 Price for the function we find 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.240
 yes friends offered here 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.669
 was now the counterpart to a ssd 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.199
 we introduced you two weeks ago 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.669
 i hope we respectively 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.949
 Of course you have that one now 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.360
 little insight has used and tell 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.070
 can we okay but were us now 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.750
 also or wlan the usual wants the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.190
 but rather if you 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.139
 the app shop phone then tells us 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.849
 simply block in the comments to this but 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.770
 these apps are constantly used or like that 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.210
 app finds and if that was worth it 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.620
 the app ready to load 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.250
 please in the comments I'm curious 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.870
 to answer your combo how to do so 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.250
 always want to say now and 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.599
 then of course if you have the video 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.690
 Please , give your thumbs up 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.910
 subscribed to the channel then as always the 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.470
 other opponent channels and of course 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.310
 everything else in the description until 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.310
 next time's fine
