00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.049
 now all kids how are you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.139
 well let's start with the second 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.180
 part of the guide of the magician fairén pvp in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.400
 this second part we will play as 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.279
 always four points talents and glyphs 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.530
 reform and equipment adding one more 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.520
 which will be setups 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:31.620
 without more let's start with talents that 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.320
 is the first point so let's give it 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.740
 cane good if you remember in the reverse 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 that we had to make talents we had 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:45.880
 improved flash two fingers and arsonists 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.800
 two fingers worth and apart from that we had 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.140
 a point only in adjusting better to what 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.450
 that I did not remember in sands instead 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.970
 we have two fingers in adjusting better to two 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.380
 and three of three in firepower this goes 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.020
 to be the four talent points that 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.420
 we had here 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 in as much in the branch declared as in 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.040
 frost we have the same talents two 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.800
 against two improved ice 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.170
 penetrating is to say three in the 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.870
 penetrating the centrists and two in with 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.940
 not to say improved 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.850
 they have no more are very 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.130
 easy and they are the minimum changing this 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.350
 only lens so without laughing we 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.750
 let's move on to the next part that 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.700
 it's good glyphs guys we're here 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.040
 in glyphs and as you can see the changes 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.630
 main is that we remove the glyph from 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.250
 dragon breath if I'm not wrong and 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.280
 we remove the glyph of pig iron armor 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.920
 and we put the tap of 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.250
 magician's armor and the armor glyph 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.720
 of hoar frost wood 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.450
 apart from which tapping assholes you are going to go 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.120
 doing the same thing adds a plus that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.340
 is that regenerates is 2% of mana and the 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.950
 of the module of magicians regenerates is 20% 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.010
 more than mana this is done for how 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.390
 you have two months stuck back it's worth 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.040
 I can still have something of 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 mana regeneration since if you put yourself 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.210
 the glyph of magician's armor 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.470
 to hit a little more and you giles go to 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.510
 suffer more 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.310
 and you know are the only changes that 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.319
 let's do and I think they are the most 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.780
 important 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.730
 If you have any doubt as to why 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 you want me to put it more tell me and you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.359
 I put it in the comment I create another 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.510
 small video explaining the most and 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.069
 putting a sand in the background and I teach it 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.959
 it's worth more than anything 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.049
 but you're only clear then we leave it 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.049
 pass good without more we will not ally 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.719
 let's move on to the next point that is 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.879
 reforms good guys as you see already 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.639
 we are here in reforms and we are going to 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.250
 say of this section I personally 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.810
 I would not touch anything as I said in the guide 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.859
 of old age people 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.720
 speed to me personally I do not 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:55.090
 inspires a lot of confidence in a twin 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.310
 and have a little left and a little bit of 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.860
 critical either so I would continue 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.750
 voting to go full critical and I think that 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.690
 It is the best option you can choose 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.270
 right now 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.430
 without more let's go we will not touch this 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.890
 subject as it is more than clear so 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.930
 let's move on to the next point that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.549
 it comes to be equipment 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.439
 good guys here we are in 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.659
 equipment and let's say that 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.700
 this section the most important thing is that 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.829
 we have the whole set a temple worth saving 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.090
 one piece I would not advise several 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:29.459
 tve pieces since to indecent arrate 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.430
 because people hit a lot and you can 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.650
 do incredible damage so ideally 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.239
 would go full pp with all spices to 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.219
 pvp or have a pv item which if you choose 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.900
 the option to have a pv item because I 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.450
 I would say it was the mind badge 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.930
 corrupt since it goes so hell to 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.569
 sands 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.269
 another change that I would make would be the gems 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.019
 of the critical intellect would put intellect 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.329
 temper in some like this we increase a 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.920
 little bit our temper and we can 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.750
 correct a bit is to bring 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.870
 instinctively corrupt although we do not 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.980
 increase a lot but it can help us 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.769
 increase a little bit can help us 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.900
 is the other option you have is to go to 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.379
 beat sacks plan as I do 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.600
 that I continue with my topics of interest 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.270
 critical voucher 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.340
 touching the subject of enchantments I 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.860
 would carry the same rvg except two 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.230
 changes that we would in boots and 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.620
 chest in boots we would put the 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.780
 Enchantment that increases your expertise 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.690
 if I'm not wrong and the speed of 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.470
 movement and in the front we would put more 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:41.350
 40 of temper I think it's worth it would be the 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.320
 last the only two changes in what 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.440
 it comes to enchantments so without 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.600
 more to finish the guide let's play 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.790
 quickly another point that will be the 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.040
 stats that we can carry in sand 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.130
 good guys let's look up to 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.840
 the mushrooms that we can use the 12 2 as 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.850
 you know is half broken so I 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.800
 I would say play ice road game a game 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.660
 You have to do it very well because 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.569
 you have agreements that you are not frost you lose 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.119
 some other advantage in that 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.159
 in those stages but you gain others all 

00:05:11.119 --> 00:05:15.589
 it has its bad part and its good part 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:18.770
 you can also play with chicken next 

00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.330
 counted pri is with what it is worth you can 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.149
 play several stages you can also play 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.919
 with druids instead of chickens of life 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:27.319
 hitler that combi goes very well 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.330
 you have two very many that 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.389
 it works as a motherfucker you can also 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.369
 bring a pri is discipline to the side 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.439
 ok all these stages are pretty 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:38.770
 good and you already have me in 13 3 that are 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.379
 very similar all too 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.660
 good in 13 3 the meals that we should 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:46.800
 use is fire 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.949
 Chamín is worth the rest 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:54.500
 easy chicken this and fire chicken shovel 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:58.590
 even after putting the typical rpm 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.440
 you can also play with fire shadow pri 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.259
 is fight which is the same as in 12 2 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.270
 and he hitler always as a prisoner a 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:12.900
 Chami would be ideal, and in 565 I would 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.849
 combi that I have tried has been a combi 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:20.960
 very gross we had to hitler a 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:24.050
 chami hitler and a paladin and we were chicken 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.850
 faith and sp the truth that a combi that 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.250
 I gave you to go to five and die 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.490
 five at a time and of course it's a very 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.169
 beast but 505 you see I have not 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.729
 played a lot I have not played in 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.340
 General sands without much more than 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.720
 backwards is what I have concentrated most 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.639
 but the stages that you have tried and with the 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.590
 people who have spoken are stages that 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.530
 better work right now to my point 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.180
 from beautiful to knit green to some 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.440
 other people 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.599
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.400
 this little guide how you have seen is more 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.560
 short that the trip since in adr 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.240
 old age we touch more points than here not 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.729
 we have touched since we already had 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.110
 touched before so I do not expect anything 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:05.889
 have liked the video remember of the 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:05.889
 live on board sesame side video goodbye
