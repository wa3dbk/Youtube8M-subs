 true passion is betis and although I

 years with my brother Carlos I've been 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.640
 going to the field to try to understand 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.759
 that feeling that emotion always saw 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.800
 enrique who did not finish understanding 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.660
 with my brother Carlos I have seen him as 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.660
 Beti was downgraded while everything 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.090
 around me they cried inconsolably with 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.240
 my brother Carlos avoided how he resurrected 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.579
 the team and went back to the first division 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.319
 with my brother Carlos the lively and 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.560
 suffered while playing against 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.349
 barcelona the real madrid the valencia and 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.390
 the athletic that the rating the málaga with 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.450

 dribbling passes and shots on goal 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.269
 with my brother Carlos I have seen the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.819
 worst times we thought about 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.400
 that we were going down again and with my 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.100
 brother I touched the sky with my hands 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.100
 to see how our team marked in the 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.799
 last minute against the eternal rival 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.440
 how the betis could be better as the 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.360
 Betis grew up in the face of adversity as 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.910
 the petismo and regis were not only the eleven 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.910
 players who ran in the field but 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.450
 that the Betis the Betis was much more for 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.760
 me the betis the betis is my brother 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.860

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.930
 those airplanes and buses when we 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.299
 we moved to each of the stadiums 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 to each of the cities really 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.210

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.100
 the betis are all those who laugh 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:25.180
 that we encourage that we sing that we suffer 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.060
 that we enjoy that we shout because only in

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.410
 of chicken the heart accelerates and 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.080

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.770
 your voice merges with that of 50 thousand 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.120
