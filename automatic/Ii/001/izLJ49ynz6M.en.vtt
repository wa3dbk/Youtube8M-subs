at some characters who frequent now and
this<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.420> joy<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> joy<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.770> kind<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.760> think

well yeah so she has the floating
ability<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.710> carries<00:00:50.010> over<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> toy

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
ability you know carries over in the toy

box<00:00:50.670> people<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> jump<00:00:52.110> under<00:00:52.680> double

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
box people be a jump under double

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:04.219 
box people be a jump under double
jumping<00:00:57.739> or<00:00:58.739> maybe<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.100> even<00:00:59.250> just<00:01:03.110> but<00:01:04.110> she

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
jumping or maybe it's even just but she

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.200 
jumping or maybe it's even just but she
has<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> sparkle<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.119> I'm

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
has a lot of the sparkle and I'm

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.060 
has a lot of the sparkle and I'm
confusing<00:01:06.630> because<00:01:06.900> especially<00:01:07.770> with<00:01:07.950> these

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
confusing because especially with these

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.710 
confusing because especially with these
inside<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.460> characters<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.150> there's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
inside out characters because there's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.380 
inside out characters because there's
stuff<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> toy<00:01:10.979> box<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.880> know<00:01:12.000> what

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
stuff in the toy box that you know what

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.870 
stuff in the toy box that you know what
isn't<00:01:12.689> necessarily<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.890> character<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.700> them

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
isn't necessarily in character for them

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.480 
isn't necessarily in character for them
you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> place<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.530> like<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you know that's a place that like you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.530 
you know that's a place that like you
know<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.670> terms<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> certain<00:01:18.420> flight

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
know in terms of like a certain flight

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.080 
know in terms of like a certain flight
mechanics<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.140> stuff<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
mechanics and stuff that you have to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
mechanics and stuff that you have to
kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.330> have<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.080> toy<00:01:22.229> box

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
kind of have in the toy box

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.440 
kind of have in the toy box
it<00:01:22.740> doesn't<00:01:23.070> make<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.430> everything<00:01:24.119> work

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it doesn't make kind of everything work

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
it doesn't make kind of everything work
and<00:01:24.960> mesh<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
and mesh and that's actually one of the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.070 
and mesh and that's actually one of the
things<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> think<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> cool<00:01:27.810> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
things that I think is kind of cool this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.250 
things that I think is kind of cool this
time<00:01:28.290> around

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
time around

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.160 
time around
this<00:01:29.470> is<00:01:29.590> because<00:01:29.950> we<00:01:30.240> played<00:01:31.240> with<00:01:31.509> what<00:01:31.990> it

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
this is because we played with what it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.520 
this is because we played with what it
really<00:01:32.380> means<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.920> be<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.759> play<00:01:34.060> set<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:35.380> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
really means to be a play set in the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.120 
really means to be a play set in the
past<00:01:35.740> they<00:01:35.920> were<00:01:36.009> always<00:01:36.070> these<00:01:36.820> open<00:01:37.240> world

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
past they were always these open world

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.830 
past they were always these open world
mission<00:01:39.130> you<00:01:39.729> know<00:01:39.850> you<00:01:39.909> get<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.299> mission<00:01:40.540> from

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
mission you know you get a mission from

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.690 
mission you know you get a mission from
a<00:01:40.930> character<00:01:41.380> out<00:01:41.409> in<00:01:41.619> the<00:01:41.680> world<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.580> go

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
a character out in the world you go

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.740 
a character out in the world you go
completed<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:44.770> time<00:01:44.950> around<00:01:45.750> inside

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
completed and this time around inside

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.930 
completed and this time around inside
out<00:01:46.899> by<00:01:47.020> setting<00:01:47.290> specific<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.890> very<00:01:48.460> much<00:01:48.670> a

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
out by setting specific is very much a

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.969 
out by setting specific is very much a
new<00:01:49.299> type<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.600> experience<00:01:50.229> where<00:01:50.470> it's<00:01:50.680> not

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
new type of experience where it's not

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.440 
new type of experience where it's not
based<00:01:51.190> on<00:01:51.310> mission<00:01:51.610> givers<00:01:51.880> it's<00:01:52.060> not<00:01:52.210> like

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
based on mission givers it's not like

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.580 
based on mission givers it's not like
that<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.960> we<00:01:53.049> were<00:01:53.140> able<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.320> bring<00:01:53.500> a

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
that so we were able to bring a

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.380 
that so we were able to bring a
different<00:01:53.890> style<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.190> game<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:55.030> Disney

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
different style of game to Disney

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.930 
different style of game to Disney
infinity<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:57.130> which<00:01:57.250> case<00:01:57.430> we<00:01:57.610> were<00:01:57.700> able<00:01:57.759> to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
infinity in which case we were able to

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.120 
infinity in which case we were able to
introduce<00:01:58.390> some<00:01:58.659> different<00:01:59.049> mechanics<00:01:59.530> that

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
introduce some different mechanics that

then slam them on the ground open toe

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.530 
then slam them on the ground open toe
box<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.950> we<00:02:27.100> we<00:02:27.519> felt<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.030> was<00:02:28.150> more

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
box so we we felt that it was more

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.210 
box so we we felt that it was more
important<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.930> preserve<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.620> ability<00:02:30.040> for

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
important to preserve that ability for

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.960 
important to preserve that ability for
everyone<00:02:30.549> in<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:30.970> toy<00:02:31.150> box<00:02:31.890> whereas<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
everyone in the toy box whereas in the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.150 
everyone in the toy box whereas in the
inside<00:02:34.209> out<00:02:34.360> it's<00:02:35.079> never<00:02:35.290> competitive<00:02:35.890> it's

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
inside out it's never competitive it's

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.610 
inside out it's never competitive it's
always<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.670> mean<00:02:36.970> probably<00:02:37.480> figure<00:02:38.260> out<00:02:38.350> some

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
always I mean probably figure out some

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.560 
always I mean probably figure out some
emergent<00:02:39.160> way<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.459> competitively<00:02:40.180> play<00:02:40.360> yeah

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
emergent way to competitively play yeah

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.360 
emergent way to competitively play yeah
but<00:02:41.049> but<00:02:41.320> it's<00:02:41.440> all<00:02:41.620> about<00:02:41.860> helping<00:02:42.280> each

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
but but it's all about helping each

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.300 
but but it's all about helping each
other<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.739> are<00:02:44.769> some<00:02:45.010> differences

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
other and so there are some differences

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.530 
other and so there are some differences
and<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.850> I<00:02:45.880> think<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.180> brings<00:02:46.359> something

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
and I and I think that brings something

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.530 
and I and I think that brings something
special<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.109> dizzy<00:02:47.579> this<00:02:48.579> time<00:02:48.760> around<00:02:48.910> where

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
special to dizzy this time around where

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.390 
special to dizzy this time around where
we<00:02:49.570> can<00:02:50.170> play<00:02:50.410> with<00:02:50.560> what<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.859> really<00:02:50.980> means<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
we can play with what it really means to

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.610 
we can play with what it really means to
nail<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> specific<00:02:52.959> type<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.109> game

those things that was felt that you know

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.119 
those things that was felt that you know
so<00:06:02.219> iconic<00:06:02.519> to<00:06:02.969> the<00:06:03.689> inside<00:06:04.409> our<00:06:04.559> characters

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
so iconic to the inside our characters

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.639 
so iconic to the inside our characters
that<00:06:05.759> you<00:06:06.479> know<00:06:06.599> that<00:06:06.869> they're<00:06:07.289> gonna<00:06:07.409> have

00:06:17.329 --> 00:06:17.339 
like there's that simpkinson to-20 box

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.249 
like there's that simpkinson to-20 box
where<00:06:17.610> i<00:06:17.849> just<00:06:18.059> pick<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:18.449> color<00:06:18.479> team<00:06:18.929> and<00:06:19.199> you

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
where i just pick the color team and you

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.629 
where i just pick the color team and you
do<00:06:19.379> like<00:06:19.529> a<00:06:19.559> bit<00:06:19.769> of<00:06:19.800> paint<00:06:21.949> so<00:06:22.949> is<00:06:23.279> there<00:06:23.490> a<00:06:23.519> way

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
do like a bit of paint so is there a way

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.820 
do like a bit of paint so is there a way
to<00:06:23.669> mechanics<00:06:24.419> using<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.469> inside<00:06:25.709> out

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.169 
to mechanics using the inside out
characters<00:06:26.189> and<00:06:26.369> your<00:06:26.459> orbs<00:06:26.729> it's

but that's pretty cool idea yeah they
can<00:06:30.959> certainly<00:06:31.259> use<00:06:31.319> the<00:06:31.800> diffuse<00:06:32.189> inator

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:32.459 
can certainly use the diffuse inator

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.350 
can certainly use the diffuse inator
which<00:06:32.699> is<00:06:32.849> that<00:06:33.089> gun<00:06:33.749> that<00:06:33.779> allows<00:06:34.110> you<00:06:34.229> to<00:06:34.289> pan

which is that gun that allows you to pan
with<00:06:36.360> those<00:06:36.569> characters<00:06:36.929> but<00:06:37.110> no<00:06:37.199> that's

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
with those characters but no that's

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:49.849
