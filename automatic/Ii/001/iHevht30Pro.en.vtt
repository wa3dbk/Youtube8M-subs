00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.110 
when I saw I saw him online but I wasn't
totally<00:03:27.349> sure<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:28.130> how<00:03:28.750> they'd<00:03:29.750> look<00:03:30.849> on<00:03:31.849> my

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
totally sure on how they'd look on my

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.349 
totally sure on how they'd look on my
face<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.870> color<00:03:33.109> but<00:03:34.069> yeah<00:03:34.790> it's

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
face and the color but yeah it's

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.770 
face and the color but yeah it's
definitely<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.959> statement<00:03:36.530> you're<00:03:37.130> not<00:03:37.340> gonna

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
definitely a statement you're not gonna

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.120 
definitely a statement you're not gonna
you<00:03:38.780> know<00:03:38.980> and<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.340> hard<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.880> match<00:03:41.480> to

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
you know and it's hard to match to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.009 
you know and it's hard to match to
clothing<00:03:43.130> as<00:03:43.280> well<00:03:46.750> black<00:03:47.750> matches

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
clothing as well black matches

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.750 
clothing as well black matches
everything<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.950> gray<00:03:49.099> matches<00:03:49.489> everything

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
everything and gray matches everything

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.440 
everything and gray matches everything
but<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.359> know<00:03:50.389> a<00:03:50.780> lot<00:03:51.139> of<00:03:51.169> these<00:03:51.380> orange<00:03:51.919> tight

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
but you know a lot of these orange tight

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.849 
but you know a lot of these orange tight
highlighted<00:03:53.450> colors<00:03:53.810> are<00:03:53.959> coming<00:03:54.230> in<00:03:54.319> styles

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
highlighted colors are coming in styles

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:01.659 
highlighted colors are coming in styles
so<00:03:55.780> it<00:03:56.780> might<00:03:56.959> be<00:03:57.019> easier<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.889> match<00:04:00.519> I'm<00:04:01.519> going

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:01.669 
so it might be easier to match I'm going

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.110 
so it might be easier to match I'm going
