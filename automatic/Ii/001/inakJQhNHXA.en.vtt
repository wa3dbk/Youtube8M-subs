00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello dear come back on mine 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.670
 Thank you for joining us again 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.040
 Today I have a food diary for you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.450
 yes I'll show you what I'm talking about today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 The days are I have you among other things 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.190
 at instagram asked if you can see that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.260
 I want what I eat because before that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.300
 Some had requested so I have 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.189
 long delayed because me 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 frankly a bit embarrassing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.369
 show you what I eat because of that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.980
 not the healthiest thing of all 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 healthiest i am eating extreme 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 irregularly , I also have the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.290
 I had vacation days so I always had 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 had time to show you what i like 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.739
 make me and I had time to cook 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.180
 if you can call that cooking 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.250
 and I was very ashamed 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.829
 in between to record everything 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.420
 I can note that I confirm 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.489
 Unfortunately, my ass is not under 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.129
 I usually eat control 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.960
 three times a day so - the whole 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.460
 snacks in between but if I 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.920
 vacation then I usually stand like that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.960
 at 11 or and 12 on and that is then 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 ever had a breakfast lunch 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.820
 I usually eat very relatively 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.920
 a lot of breakfast and then I am mostly 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.350
 by the evening and then there's already 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 dinner very briefly to mine 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 priorities so i need them 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.119
 fruits a day 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.640
 I really need something with 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.570
 vegetable in the day and I like to eat 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.250
 potatoes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.229
 but you will see that I often 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.820
 So I was so lazy im 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.530
 Peel potatoes so I hate 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.250
 potatoes but I love it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.549
 to eat 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.960
 potatoes potatoes fries 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.320
 potato porridge everything on potatoes love 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 I have good morning today as always 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.150
 Myself with sunflower seeds and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.009
 a bit of cinnamon and cranberries 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.130
 strawberries that my mother brings me 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.049
 There is a sequel to the world and me 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540
 Holiday is really the best time 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.490
 for dinner there is a bit white 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.829
 with fun vegetables where I'm a bit 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.140
 have done pure meat and so on 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.250
 Peas and carrots and so that was easy 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.229
 from the freezer 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.550
 but the teens were fresh to it 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.020
 a few chopsticks and tears the clouds 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.850
 it's my breakfast again 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.410

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:16.220

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:18.350
 by the way, yes, that too cinnamon 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.790
 unfortunately not the nice shot 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.030
 when you clear a photo 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.290
 The food was my dinner was a 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.460
 unfortunately nothing right because of that 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.780
 lately you're sorry i dont you 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.560

 Ocado with salmon ham and two trust 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.340

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.260
 do it again but I have today 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.360
 still do not feel like it and it is 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.740
 too early even if it is already 12 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.590
 somehow this is too early for me 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.750
 avocado and bread so eat here eats 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.520
 a banana because we are so much 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.320
 Often I ate the half and 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.270
 party half one for the kitchen if it is 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.880

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.270
 there is now a band so the asians 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.090

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.489
 that is no reason there third is 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.920

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.230
 with leaves zucchini and here so 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.790
 Crab meat is full of vitamins 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.180

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.690
 loved that too good morning that is 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.970
 My breakfast might be 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.280
 should wonder what with the avocado bread 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.830
 I was from yesterday 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.360
 then before I ate the dinner 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.910
 So have a snack in between 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.770
 between the banana 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.650
 and I have the dinner again 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.320
 stuck and actually I'm so he 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.060
 the sweet breakfast but I still have 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.280
 no new life that's why it is now 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.500
 bread and offered and a bit 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.330
 salt that's my dinner now 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.220
 I've made potatoes I love yes 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.180
 potatoes but I'm always so woman 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.920
 to peel the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.050
 if it was up to me I would 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.180
 every day I eat potatoes 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.200
 here made even more fun so I'm in 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:15.300
 The formula 1 came a bit 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.510
 then meat and then the asparagus 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.640
 the leek onions and that's it 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.430
 goat cream cheese and a bit of butter 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.020
 I took margarine but with 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.450
 butter tastes even better i have 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.870
 again she in there got me the 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.310
 sunflower seeds in cranberries 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.530

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.680

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.360
 two chocobos left 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.460
 cut in. I realized I am 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.520
 so he told the cells of this breakfast 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.680
 but sometimes I need a bit 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.840
 variety 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.700
 that's complicated with me today 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.880
 after I punish it a bit of that 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.850
