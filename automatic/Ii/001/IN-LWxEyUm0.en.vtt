set to start with the exact same pattern

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.890 
set to start with the exact same pattern
as<00:00:41.260> the<00:00:41.290> Josephine<00:00:42.220> underbust<00:00:42.670> corset<00:00:43.120> except

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
as the Josephine underbust corset except

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.450 
as the Josephine underbust corset except
this<00:00:44.199> one<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.530> little<00:00:44.710> bit<00:00:44.890> shorter<00:00:45.250> in<00:00:45.370> the

this one is a little bit shorter in the

center front and it cuts up higher over
the<00:00:47.080> hips<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:47.830> this<00:00:48.040> would<00:00:48.159> be<00:00:48.250> better<00:00:48.400> for

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
the hips so this would be better for

for the circumferential measurements of

this corset the waist is 22 inches I

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.789 
this corset the waist is 22 inches I
measure<00:01:22.149> the<00:01:22.509> top<00:01:22.750> edge<00:01:23.020> or<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.409> under<00:01:23.649> bust

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
measure the top edge or the under bust

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.760

iliac<00:01:27.130> crest<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.609> about<00:01:27.820> 31<00:01:28.180> inches<00:01:28.659> so<00:01:29.320> this

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
iliac crest is about 31 inches so this

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.260 
iliac crest is about 31 inches so this
is<00:01:30.039> the<00:01:30.130> main<00:01:30.280> reason<00:01:30.429> that<00:01:30.549> I<00:01:30.670> can't<00:01:31.000> close

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
is the main reason that I can't close

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.149 
is the main reason that I can't close
this<00:01:31.479> corset<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:31.929> the<00:01:32.020> back<00:01:32.170> now<00:01:32.649> I<00:01:32.679> do<00:01:32.859> see<00:01:33.130> a

this corset in the back now I do see a

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.249 
this corset in the back now I do see a
discrepancy<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.659> measurements<00:01:35.140> between

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
discrepancy in the measurements between

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.740 
discrepancy in the measurements between
this<00:01:35.649> corset<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:36.250> my<00:01:36.670> Isabella<00:01:37.240> Josephine

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
this corset and my Isabella Josephine

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.300 
this corset and my Isabella Josephine
corset<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.229> was<00:01:38.350> made<00:01:38.530> over<00:01:38.829> three<00:01:39.070> years

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
corset that was made over three years

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.330 
corset that was made over three years
ago<00:01:39.460> because<00:01:40.329> that<00:01:40.630> was<00:01:40.750> an<00:01:40.960> actual<00:01:41.350> one<00:01:42.130> size

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
ago because that was an actual one size

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.489 
ago because that was an actual one size
smaller<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.850> was<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:42.999> size<00:01:43.270> 20<00:01:43.659> but<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.320> still

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
smaller that was a size 20 but it still

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.429 
smaller that was a size 20 but it still
measures<00:01:44.799> 31<00:01:45.399> in<00:01:45.609> the<00:01:45.640> rib<00:01:45.909> cage<00:01:46.179> and<00:01:46.479> it<00:01:47.289> was

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
measures 31 in the rib cage and it was

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.020 
measures 31 in the rib cage and it was
very<00:01:47.770> large<00:01:48.039> in<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.280> hips<00:01:48.429> I<00:01:48.549> believe<00:01:48.789> it<00:01:48.909> was

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
very large in the hips I believe it was

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.899 
very large in the hips I believe it was
33<00:01:49.479> inches<00:01:49.749> in<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.990> Ailey<00:01:50.140> AK<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.590> 36<00:01:51.429> at<00:01:51.670> the

33 inches in the Ailey AK and 36 at the

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.469 
33 inches in the Ailey AK and 36 at the
below<00:01:52.479> hip<00:01:52.719> area<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.189> I'm<00:01:54.520> not<00:01:54.850> sure<00:01:55.060> why<00:01:55.270> there

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
below hip area so I'm not sure why there

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.599 
below hip area so I'm not sure why there
is<00:01:55.630> that<00:01:55.869> sort<00:01:56.170> of<00:01:56.200> discrepancy<00:01:56.530> it<00:01:57.039> might<00:01:57.490> be

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
is that sort of discrepancy it might be

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.489 
is that sort of discrepancy it might be
that<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.090> newer<00:01:58.299> I'm<00:01:58.719> not<00:01:59.020> sure<00:01:59.200> if<00:01:59.350> they

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
that this is newer I'm not sure if they

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.289 
that this is newer I'm not sure if they
had<00:01:59.740> made<00:01:59.950> their<00:02:00.219> silhouettes<00:02:00.640> less<00:02:00.789> curvy<00:02:01.179> or

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
had made their silhouettes less curvy or

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.690 
had made their silhouettes less curvy or
anything<00:02:01.539> they<00:02:02.289> say<00:02:02.469> that<00:02:02.619> they<00:02:02.710> didn't<00:02:03.039> but<00:02:03.399> I

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
anything they say that they didn't but I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.149 
anything they say that they didn't but I
simply<00:02:04.689> noticed<00:02:05.289> that<00:02:05.439> there<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.829> change

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
simply noticed that there is a change

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.760 
simply noticed that there is a change
nevertheless<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:07.179> do<00:02:07.240> find<00:02:07.630> that<00:02:07.929> Isabella's

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
nevertheless I do find that Isabella's

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.620 
nevertheless I do find that Isabella's
standard<00:02:09.340> sized<00:02:09.520> corset<00:02:10.000> still<00:02:10.240> give<00:02:10.420> me<00:02:10.600> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
standard sized corset still give me a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.270 
standard sized corset still give me a
lot<00:02:10.929> more<00:02:11.140> room<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.650> ribcage<00:02:11.860> area

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
lot more room in the ribcage area

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.330 
lot more room in the ribcage area
compared<00:02:13.240> to<00:02:13.420> other<00:02:13.900> off-the-rack<00:02:14.620> brands<00:02:15.190> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
compared to other off-the-rack brands I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.780 
compared to other off-the-rack brands I
find<00:02:16.030> that

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
find that

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.640 
find that
our<00:02:16.909> author<00:02:17.060> AK<00:02:17.360> brands<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.930> much<00:02:18.439> smaller

our author AK brands have a much smaller

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.890 
our author AK brands have a much smaller
ribcage<00:02:19.310> however<00:02:19.909> I<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.150> like<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.599> silhouette

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
ribcage however I do like the silhouette

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.690 
ribcage however I do like the silhouette
that<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.290> course<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> gives<00:02:21.859> me<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.489> how

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that this course it gives me I like how

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.520 
that this course it gives me I like how
the<00:02:22.760> ribcage<00:02:23.120> is<00:02:23.450> a<00:02:23.480> little<00:02:23.719> bit<00:02:23.840> conical<00:02:24.349> and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the ribcage is a little bit conical and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.160 
the ribcage is a little bit conical and
the<00:02:25.310> hips<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:26.030> short<00:02:26.420> as<00:02:26.540> they<00:02:26.659> are<00:02:26.840> they<00:02:27.109> do

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the hips as short as they are they do

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.199 
the hips as short as they are they do
have<00:02:27.439> a<00:02:27.469> little<00:02:27.709> bit<00:02:27.829> of<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.219> roundness<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:29.030> them

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
have a little bit of a roundness to them

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.780 
have a little bit of a roundness to them
so<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.200> would<00:02:30.469> consider<00:02:30.829> this<00:02:31.129> almost

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
so I would consider this almost

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.089 
so I would consider this almost
bordering<00:02:32.239> on<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.689> wasp<00:02:32.930> waist<00:02:33.230> silhouette<00:02:33.829> I

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
bordering on a wasp waist silhouette I

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.610 
bordering on a wasp waist silhouette I
find<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.939> picture<00:02:35.329> that<00:02:35.689> isabella<00:02:36.140> uses

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
find that the picture that isabella uses

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.559 
find that the picture that isabella uses
for<00:02:36.859> the<00:02:36.950> standard<00:02:37.340> sized<00:02:37.519> Victorian<00:02:38.120> corset

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
for the standard sized Victorian corset

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.750 
for the standard sized Victorian corset
on<00:02:38.659> the<00:02:38.780> website<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.560> doesn't<00:02:39.890> really<00:02:40.010> do<00:02:40.370> it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
on the website it doesn't really do it

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.839 
on the website it doesn't really do it
justice<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:41.659> think<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.579> this<00:02:43.579> silhouette

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
justice I think that this silhouette

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.369 
justice I think that this silhouette
that<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.180> course<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.569> gives<00:02:44.720> me<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.139> a<00:02:45.170> lot

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
that this course it gives me is a lot

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.750 
that this course it gives me is a lot
more<00:02:45.560> dramatic<00:02:46.010> than<00:02:46.129> what<00:02:46.189> it<00:02:46.400> actually

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
more dramatic than what it actually

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.569 
more dramatic than what it actually
shows<00:02:46.969> on<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.329> website<00:02:47.859> it's<00:02:48.859> possible<00:02:49.430> that

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
shows on the website it's possible that

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.550 
shows on the website it's possible that
the<00:02:49.760> model<00:02:50.090> was<00:02:50.299> just<00:02:50.510> wearing<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:51.109> corset

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
the model was just wearing a corset

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.530 
the model was just wearing a corset
that's<00:02:51.739> a<00:02:51.859> one<00:02:52.099> or<00:02:52.310> two<00:02:52.489> sizes<00:02:52.939> too<00:02:53.150> big<00:02:53.359> for

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
that's a one or two sizes too big for

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.679 
that's a one or two sizes too big for
her<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:55.220> gives<00:02:55.519> her<00:02:55.669> a<00:02:55.730> very<00:02:56.150> mild

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
her and it gives her a very mild

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.750 
her and it gives her a very mild
silhouette<00:02:57.349> whereas<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.099> one<00:02:58.310> I<00:02:58.340> think<00:02:58.519> it

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
silhouette whereas this one I think it

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.270 
silhouette whereas this one I think it
gives<00:02:58.879> an<00:02:59.180> actual<00:02:59.810> impressive<00:03:00.319> silhouette<00:03:00.739> so

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
gives an actual impressive silhouette so

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.069 
gives an actual impressive silhouette so
here's<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.730> Victorian<00:03:02.359> underbust<00:03:02.750> laying

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
here's the Victorian underbust laying

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.199 
here's the Victorian underbust laying
flat<00:03:03.379> so<00:03:03.769> for<00:03:04.129> the<00:03:04.189> materials<00:03:04.609> of<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:04.939> I

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
flat so for the materials of this I

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.819 
flat so for the materials of this I
believe<00:03:05.480> there<00:03:05.629> are<00:03:05.750> three<00:03:06.139> main<00:03:06.349> layers<00:03:06.379> to

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
believe there are three main layers to

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.890 
believe there are three main layers to
this<00:03:06.950> corset<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.849> fashion<00:03:08.209> fabric<00:03:08.359> is<00:03:08.689> this

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
this corset the fashion fabric is this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.309 
this corset the fashion fabric is this
plain<00:03:09.230> black<00:03:09.650> satin<00:03:10.069> fabric<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:11.169> corset<00:03:12.169> has

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
plain black satin fabric the corset has

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.140 
plain black satin fabric the corset has
an<00:03:12.470> inter<00:03:12.709> liner<00:03:12.919> of<00:03:13.189> cotton<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.730> then<00:03:13.879> on<00:03:14.060> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
an inter liner of cotton and then on the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.000 
an inter liner of cotton and then on the
inside<00:03:14.299> it<00:03:14.720> seems<00:03:15.169> to<00:03:15.290> have<00:03:15.439> this<00:03:15.620> cotton

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
inside it seems to have this cotton

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.159 
inside it seems to have this cotton
twill<00:03:16.250> except<00:03:16.819> it<00:03:17.030> has<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.209> bit<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.629> pinstripe

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
twill except it has a bit of a pinstripe

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:19.839 
twill except it has a bit of a pinstripe
so<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.650> at<00:03:19.069> first<00:03:19.280> I<00:03:19.430> thought<00:03:19.579> this<00:03:19.700> was

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
so I at first I thought this was

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.460 
so I at first I thought this was
actually<00:03:20.060> cotija<00:03:20.569> but<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.810> think<00:03:21.109> it's<00:03:21.260> still

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
actually cotija but I think it's still

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.339 
actually cotija but I think it's still
just<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:22.190> driller<00:03:22.609> or<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> twill<00:03:23.479> so<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.199> is

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
just a driller or a twill so this is

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.080 
just a driller or a twill so this is
what<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.650> isabella<00:03:25.069> corset<00:03:25.430> retag<00:03:25.790> looks

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
what the isabella corset retag looks

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.059 
what the isabella corset retag looks
like<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:26.780> can<00:03:26.870> also<00:03:26.989> see<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.530> size<00:03:27.769> and

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
like and you can also see the size and

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.460 
like and you can also see the size and
the<00:03:28.849> cleaning<00:03:29.329> instructions<00:03:29.659> for<00:03:30.409> the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
the cleaning instructions for the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.869 
the cleaning instructions for the
patterning<00:03:30.889> of<00:03:30.979> this<00:03:31.159> corset<00:03:31.459> as<00:03:31.609> I<00:03:31.699> said

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
patterning of this corset as I said

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.449 
patterning of this corset as I said
before<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.329> is<00:03:32.379> extremely<00:03:33.379> similar<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.799> the

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
before it is extremely similar to the

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.930 
before it is extremely similar to the
isabella<00:03:35.209> josephine<00:03:35.900> corset<00:03:36.500> except<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.430> has

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
isabella josephine corset except it has

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.789 
isabella josephine corset except it has
maybe<00:03:38.449> a<00:03:38.599> couple<00:03:38.930> of<00:03:39.079> tweaks<00:03:39.290> here<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.620> there

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
maybe a couple of tweaks here and there

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.349 
maybe a couple of tweaks here and there
but<00:03:40.099> for<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.310> most<00:03:40.340> part<00:03:40.549> is<00:03:40.790> extremely

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359 
but for the most part is extremely

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.599 
but for the most part is extremely
similar<00:03:41.569> so<00:03:42.139> it's<00:03:42.319> a<00:03:42.379> six<00:03:42.590> panel<00:03:42.859> pattern<00:03:43.220> one

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
similar so it's a six panel pattern one

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.699 
similar so it's a six panel pattern one
two<00:03:43.970> three<00:03:44.359> mix<00:03:44.659> the<00:03:44.810> front<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.349> then<00:03:45.440> four

two three mix the front and then four
five<00:03:45.949> six<00:03:46.190> mix<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.699> back<00:03:46.909> there's<00:03:47.449> a<00:03:47.569> lot<00:03:47.780> of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
five six mix the back there's a lot of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.689 
five six mix the back there's a lot of
room<00:03:48.169> for<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.889> curve<00:03:49.069> of<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.280> hip<00:03:49.489> over

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
room for the curve of the hip over

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.360 
room for the curve of the hip over
panels<00:03:50.540> three<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.900> four<00:03:51.229> there<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.889> on

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
panels three and four there and on

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.039 
panels three and four there and on
panels<00:03:52.729> five<00:03:52.909> and<00:03:53.120> six<00:03:53.359> there<00:03:53.569> seems<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.870> be<00:03:53.959> a

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
panels five and six there seems to be a

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.990 
panels five and six there seems to be a
lot<00:03:54.349> of<00:03:54.470> room<00:03:54.620> drafted<00:03:55.129> for<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.430> under<00:03:55.819> bust

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
lot of room drafted for the under bust

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.149 
lot of room drafted for the under bust
area<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.510> rib<00:03:56.690> cage<00:03:56.930> here<00:03:57.349> at<00:03:57.500> panels<00:03:57.949> five

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
area the rib cage here at panels five

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.069 
area the rib cage here at panels five
and<00:03:58.340> six<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:58.879> for<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.209> construction<00:03:59.599> method

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
and six and for the construction method

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.750 
and six and for the construction method
this<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.349> the<00:04:00.680> sandwich<00:04:01.069> method<00:04:01.250> just<00:04:01.639> like

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
this is the sandwich method just like

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.939 
this is the sandwich method just like
the<00:04:02.090> isabella<00:04:02.540> josephine<00:04:03.049> corset<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:03.889> you

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
the isabella josephine corset so you

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.819 
the isabella josephine corset so you
basically<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.699> flat<00:04:04.970> line<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.629> satin<00:04:06.229> to<00:04:06.500> a

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
basically you flat line the satin to a

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.879 
basically you flat line the satin to a
strong<00:04:07.519> interlining<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.780> make<00:04:09.109> this<00:04:09.409> entire

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:09.889 
strong interlining you make this entire

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.610 
strong interlining you make this entire
layer<00:04:10.639> at<00:04:11.000> one<00:04:11.329> time<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:11.959> make<00:04:12.409> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
layer at one time and you make the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.189 
layer at one time and you make the
entire<00:04:13.009> lining<00:04:13.669> layer<00:04:13.849> at<00:04:14.060> one<00:04:14.239> time<00:04:14.540> and<00:04:14.780> then

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.199 
entire lining layer at one time and then

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.319 
entire lining layer at one time and then
you<00:04:15.290> put<00:04:15.470> them<00:04:15.620> together<00:04:15.799> you<00:04:16.250> lock<00:04:16.759> stitch<00:04:17.060> it

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
you put them together you lock stitch it

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.149 
you put them together you lock stitch it
at<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.750> seams<00:04:18.079> and<00:04:18.380> then<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.590> make<00:04:18.739> boning

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
at the seams and then you make boning

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:21.039 
at the seams and then you make boning
channel<00:04:19.489> so<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.820> bones<00:04:20.060> are<00:04:20.359> sandwiched<00:04:20.900> in

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
channel so the bones are sandwiched in

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.960 
channel so the bones are sandwiched in
between<00:04:21.079> the<00:04:21.440> two<00:04:21.739> strong<00:04:22.099> cotton<00:04:22.729> layers

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
between the two strong cotton layers

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.850 
between the two strong cotton layers
this<00:04:23.599> course<00:04:23.840> it<00:04:23.960> does<00:04:24.110> have<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.320> waist<00:04:24.590> tape

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
this course it does have a waist tape

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.500 
this course it does have a waist tape
sandwiched<00:04:25.310> between<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.789> two<00:04:25.820> layers<00:04:26.000> so

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
sandwiched between the two layers so

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.629 
sandwiched between the two layers so
it's<00:04:26.690> invisibly<00:04:27.200> stitched<00:04:27.500> one<00:04:28.099> inch<00:04:28.340> wide

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
it's invisibly stitched one inch wide

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:29.360 
it's invisibly stitched one inch wide
and<00:04:28.909> it<00:04:29.060> goes

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
and it goes

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.370 
and it goes
through<00:04:29.460> all<00:04:29.750> panels<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.900> corset<00:04:31.350> just

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
through all panels of the corset just

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.140 
through all panels of the corset just
right<00:04:31.889> from<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.160> front<00:04:32.340> there<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:32.970> back

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
right from the front there to the back

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.090 
right from the front there to the back
so<00:04:33.660> if<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.900> hold<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.199> on<00:04:34.350> an<00:04:34.470> angle<00:04:34.590> here<00:04:34.979> you

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
so if I hold it on an angle here you

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.700 
so if I hold it on an angle here you
might<00:04:35.310> be<00:04:35.340> able<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.850> see<00:04:36.210> a<00:04:36.419> slight<00:04:36.960> outline<00:04:37.440> of

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
might be able to see a slight outline of

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.260 
the tape going across the bias binding
is<00:04:40.260> simply<00:04:40.560> matching<00:04:40.949> blacks<00:04:41.190> on<00:04:41.430> its<00:04:41.970> machine

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270

see<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.360> whole<00:06:33.570> lot<00:06:33.780> of<00:06:33.810> splits<00:06:34.229> the<00:06:34.680> ones<00:06:34.860> that

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
see a whole lot of splits the ones that

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.580
