00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.680
 hi to all these fsb are today 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.539
 we find ourselves for a new tutorial 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.080
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.570
 hutu end rather the location of the club 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.029
 of golf then one to do this you have 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.940
 already in front of you just go back to this 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.270
 place then directly guessed it is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 or 1 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 this is the most likely place for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.020
 of course find a golf club that's 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.180
 just golf then you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.520
 can see that the golf is on the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.350
 high of life so in this great 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.610
 zoned 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.539
 then what are you going to do you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 go to the entrance to the gulf and 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:58.500
 you're coming right here and you're going 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.910
 start a round of golf so you 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.470
 do it directly as in c1 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:11.040
 you can spend all that here we wait 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.710
 that here and here you can that the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.470
 part will start and I already I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.020
 already has a golf club 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.479
 then here you have the club 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.020
 of golf you can leave directly 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.170
 the part where this time obliged to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 stay to do the part 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 So here I am and then if 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 you do l2 if you are on ps3 you 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.000
 go in vollard these weapons if so in 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.540
 down and you will be able to see that you 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.590
 have the golf club 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.210
 So, of course, as usual I 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 could not leave the video without 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.060
 have you done a little test we will 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.840
 find a nice person who wants 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840
 to be massacred 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.960
 that's him 100 and I feel he 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.960
 wants serene sacred 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:22.450
 to see what it gives is not bad and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:25.330
 a second of course for the road and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.700
