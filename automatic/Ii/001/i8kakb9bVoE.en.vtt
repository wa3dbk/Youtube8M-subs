thing you'll notice right away needs a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.450 
thing you'll notice right away needs a
little<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.440> work<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.830> doesn't<00:00:16.980> have<00:00:17.220> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
little bit of work it doesn't have the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.870 
little bit of work it doesn't have the
glass<00:00:17.730> on<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.230> dirty<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.880> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
glass on it it's kind of dirty and the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.800 
glass on it it's kind of dirty and the
manifold<00:00:21.840> where<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.880> water<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.150> antifreeze

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
manifold where the water or antifreeze

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.269 
manifold where the water or antifreeze
would<00:00:25.050> normally<00:00:25.439> come<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.160> it's

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
would normally come in and out of it's

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.220 
would normally come in and out of it's
been<00:00:26.400> cut<00:00:26.699> off<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> needs<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.810> get<00:00:28.170> an

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
been cut off so that needs to get an

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.910 
been cut off so that needs to get an
extension<00:00:28.699> soldered<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.849> there<00:00:30.740> it's<00:00:31.740> pretty

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
extension soldered on there it's pretty

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
extension soldered on there it's pretty
it's<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.700> cold<00:00:33.149> clear<00:00:33.480> day<00:00:33.510> today<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.050> it's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's a cold clear day today so it's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's a cold clear day today so it's
about<00:00:35.450> 15<00:00:36.450> 20<00:00:36.630> degrees<00:00:37.020> Fahrenheit<00:00:37.370> but<00:00:38.370> it's

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about 15 20 degrees Fahrenheit but it's

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.790 
about 15 20 degrees Fahrenheit but it's
sunny<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.510> I've<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.170> propped<00:00:40.590> up

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
sunny and I've just got this propped up

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290 
sunny and I've just got this propped up
in<00:00:40.920> my<00:00:41.070> garage<00:00:41.129> I've<00:00:41.610> been<00:00:41.730> there<00:00:41.940> about<00:00:42.120> an

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
in my garage I've been there about an

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.670 
in my garage I've been there about an
hour<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.550> no<00:00:44.550> glass<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.170> yet<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> came

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
hour and no glass on this and yet I came

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
hour and no glass on this and yet I came
out<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.160> put<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.489> hand<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.879> feel<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
out here to put my hand and feel it and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.889 
out here to put my hand and feel it and
right<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.440> pretty<00:00:49.920> darn<00:00:50.280> warm

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
right here that's pretty darn warm

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.889 
right here that's pretty darn warm
actually<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.730> press<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.030> hand<00:00:54.480> firmly

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
actually if I press my hand firmly

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.240 
actually if I press my hand firmly
against<00:00:55.379> there<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:55.649> probably<00:00:55.949> about<00:00:56.100> as

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
against there that's probably about as

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
against there that's probably about as
long<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.760> want<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:56.969> hold<00:00:57.120> my<00:00:57.180> hand<00:00:57.270> there

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
long as I want to hold my hand there

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
long as I want to hold my hand there
guess<00:00:57.840> warm<00:00:58.079> real<00:00:58.829> fast<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.059> funny<00:01:00.300> thing

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
guess warm real fast and the funny thing

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
guess warm real fast and the funny thing
was<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.320> noticed<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.280> side<00:01:03.920> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
was I noticed that on this side it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.670 
was I noticed that on this side it
seemed<00:01:05.339> even<00:01:05.610> warmer<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.409> let's<00:01:07.409> turn

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
seemed even warmer that's let's turn

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.710 
seemed even warmer that's let's turn
enough<00:01:07.890> started<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.549> burned<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.090> hand<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
enough started I burned my hand if I

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.130 
enough started I burned my hand if I
hold<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.229> there<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.619> long<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.869> thing

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
hold it on there that long so this thing

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.050 
hold it on there that long so this thing
is<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.530> putting<00:01:13.740> out<00:01:14.070> quite<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> bit<00:01:14.820> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is really putting out quite a bit of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
is really putting out quite a bit of
heat<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.479> I've<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.140> garage<00:01:16.350> here

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
heat now I've got in my garage here

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
heat now I've got in my garage here
because<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.189> somewhat<00:01:17.549> out<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.909> wind<00:01:18.150> if

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
because it's somewhat out of the wind if

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.420 
because it's somewhat out of the wind if
this<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.470> breeze<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.770> heat

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this was out in the breeze the heat

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
this was out in the breeze the heat
would<00:01:20.520> get<00:01:20.700> carried<00:01:20.970> away<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.960> too<00:01:22.020> quick<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
would get carried away way too quick to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010 
would get carried away way too quick to
collect<00:01:22.979> any<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.729> also<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> end<00:01:24.479> here<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
collect any but also on the end here you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.270 
collect any but also on the end here you
can<00:01:25.560> see<00:01:25.770> there's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:27.080> there's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.280> foam

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
can see there's a there's a foam

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.109 
can see there's a there's a foam
insulation<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.259> reflective

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
insulation in here it's it's reflective

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
insulation in here it's it's reflective
this<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.299> all<00:01:33.450> copper<00:01:33.900> those<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.829> beers<00:01:35.100> all

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this is all copper those are beers all

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.670 
this is all copper those are beers all
copper<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.180> pipe<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> all<00:01:36.960> copper<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
copper the pipe here is all copper and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.460 
copper the pipe here is all copper and
if<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.159> look<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> top<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.210> see<00:01:39.479> again

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
if you look in the top you can see again

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.289 
if you look in the top you can see again
on<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.799> end<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.310> copper<00:01:41.729> pipe<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
on this end it is copper pipe but it is

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
on this end it is copper pipe but it is
cut<00:01:42.540> short<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.020> gonna<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.500> solder<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
cut short so I'm gonna have to solder a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.100 
cut short so I'm gonna have to solder a
little<00:01:44.759> short<00:01:44.970> extension<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> union<00:01:45.810> on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
little short extension or a union on

little short extension or a union on
there<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.409> something

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
there or something

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
there or something
the<00:01:47.700> insulation<00:01:48.090> doesn't<00:01:48.600> look<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the insulation doesn't look like it's in

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.510 
the insulation doesn't look like it's in
bad<00:01:49.140> condition<00:01:49.799> though<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.399> it

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
bad condition though I don't think it
