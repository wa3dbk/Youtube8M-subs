if you put up a simple little area like

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.499 
if you put up a simple little area like
this<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.470> gives<00:01:43.680> your<00:01:43.950> cat's<00:01:44.430> areas<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.410 
and as you can see by allowing the cats
to<00:02:07.560> bounce<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.580> are<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.060> getting<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.899> much

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
maximizing the point of the weapon which

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.070

is<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.390> bouncing<00:02:16.840> cats<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.900> would

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
is the bouncing cats I think this would

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.170 
is the bouncing cats I think this would
work<00:02:20.110> pretty<00:02:20.500> well<00:02:20.680> against<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.459> moon<00:02:21.670> Lord<00:02:21.940> I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
work pretty well against the moon Lord I

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.870 
work pretty well against the moon Lord I
haven't<00:02:22.630> tested<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.110> personally<00:02:23.740> yet<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.760> I'd

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
haven't tested it personally yet but I'd

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.120 
haven't tested it personally yet but I'd
be<00:02:25.030> interested<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.630> try<00:02:25.930> even<00:02:26.770> just<00:02:27.010> this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
be interested to try even just this

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.490 
be interested to try even just this
simple<00:02:27.790> setup<00:02:28.300> I've<00:02:28.480> got<00:02:28.690> here<00:02:28.959> against<00:02:29.350> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
simple setup I've got here against it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.280 
simple setup I've got here against it
and<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.790> yeah<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.510> meow<00:02:31.870> me<00:02:32.080> in

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
and so yeah this is the meow me in

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.620 
and so yeah this is the meow me in
action<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:33.790> you're<00:02:33.940> gonna<00:02:34.060> use<00:02:34.240> it<00:02:34.450> make<00:02:34.600> sure

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
action if you're gonna use it make sure

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.600 
action if you're gonna use it make sure
you're<00:02:34.900> using<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.260> melee<00:02:35.590> set<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.190> get<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.430> most

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
you're using a melee set to get the most

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.090 
you're using a melee set to get the most
out<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:37.150> because<00:02:38.020> I<00:02:38.140> noticed<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> damage

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
out of it because I noticed the damage

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.880 
out of it because I noticed the damage
seems<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.640> come<00:02:39.880> from<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:41.410> extreme

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
seems to come from the the extreme

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.070 
seems to come from the the extreme
bounces<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.580> gets<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.330> so<00:02:43.570> much<00:02:43.810> the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
bounces it gets and not so much the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.890 
bounces it gets and not so much the
