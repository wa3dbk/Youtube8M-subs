00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.240
 I reproduced it 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.240
 Ikegami's Japanese commentary included 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.410
 I will explain this time 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.039
 That word 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.039
 I can hear and explain to everyone 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.719
 First of all, I have not seen it recently 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.279
 Recently, for example, I was in the factory 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 US-oriented to avoid price increases in iso 140 0012 types of products 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.739
 If you 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.280
 I'm sorry 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.280
 To the same school 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.579
 Sound likely 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.920
 Lottery 1 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.600
 Opened in Korea for work to say that the rest 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
 The world competition 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.720
 If the suspicion is settled 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.110
 It is this way 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290
 The member is the criminal 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.740
 Recently, for example, in a factory 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.890
 44,000 people in iso14000 city 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.730
 If we join and have an effect, I hope that the meeting will run 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.000
 To the same school 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.010
 Former British Prime Minister 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 English lottery 1 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.400
 Effort to try to say that you are getting the rest 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.810
 In the world beyond, the number of samples dominates from the attached first shot 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.180
 There was also a scene to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.630
 iso stands for this 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.240
 There is a story that there is an improvement company 4 standard 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 Nation 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.300
 First residential area contribution in July 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.770
 I will be free 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.780
 So what are you doing? 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.690
 Entry-type products 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.230
 Let's decide the international standard 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.480
 For example 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.500
 I bought Meiji from High America 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.990
 If you try to enter Japan's screw hole 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.310
 I do not enter Meiji 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.799
 It will be troubled when it comes to anything when high 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.829
 If you make the same standard anywhere in the world 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.400
 You will be able to use it 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.640
 I did this in Japan too 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.020
 It is this 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.990
 8 strong 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.000
 jis Standard Japanese Industrial Standard 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.130
 Show a lot of pieces 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.690
 The rest of Japan Industrial Standards Japan 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.690
 Iihara is rising only in each size 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.159
 If it is full time 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:20.239
 Articles can be used in any company 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.199
 decided 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.199
 It was decided that internationally it is vomiting 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.669
 I do not think in the palette 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:33.029
 iso is shorthanded here, power and unimo unimo recognition 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.250
 In the language of each country 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.250
 The order will be added after this 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.219
 Let's standardize this as it becomes yk 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.540
 How to 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.729
 In Greek when we do an event 

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:50.939
 Greeting 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.160
 With the Middle East 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.439
 Acting because there is an incoming word 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.019
 In Greek style 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.519
 iso auto 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.059
 Let's call 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.299
 Because we standardize various things, the name of this organization is also 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.299
 If the name is standardized to become iso 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.719
 Price 1.2 billion yen 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:10.989
 In Vietnam stock 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.409
 Mr. Hayashi 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.239
 Low interest rate 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.239
 Seventy thousand people were stabbed 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.549
 Safety of cosmetics such as refunds 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.959
 In some cases, such as strict, become a number country 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.660
 This is especially interesting 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.600
 This is a very happy thing. 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.930
 The back of the first place 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.030
 It is a curtain made in Japan 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.090
 If you look at this, go to the emergency exit instead of trying to stand 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.549
 Tara 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.089
 iso is this, let's make it a global standard 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.340
 It looks like this when you look at the world 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.440
 Well, London in Australia 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.609
 If it rains, I will go abroad 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.119
 It is soa emergency situation that 3 people can understand at a glance 

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:08.859
 It is important 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.290
 In urbantool 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.969
 Not only products 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.349
 Corporate environmental efforts 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.120
 Also about the way of quality control 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.479
 It was such 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.479
 Excuse me 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.669
 Recently corporate signs and 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:25.900
 Seen in 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.090
 It is a figure such as iso9001 or 14,000 people 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.039
 If it is iso9001 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.219
 It is quality 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.469
 Arima-style saying how good good quality is made 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.379
 If you are mass producing heavy goods 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.290
 It will not come out of unnecessary items, so the incidence rate of defective products 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.270
 I know how much I can get along with this 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.580
 The heel of 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.880
 In high school 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.150
 Reference value because it was told that the soaring price is taking iso14000 position 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.449
 I also take school year after year 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.749
 As high school, I do not take out Nepali garbage as much as possible 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:05.620
 Or trying to 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.720
 Or I'm doing something properly 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.820
 Such a school that everyone made hard 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.930
 Went and sent 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.919
 But it was done with such a face or something that was awful 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.030
 It is not for me to talk with the supporters to attack like this 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.030
 6 minutes 7 pieces 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.860
 The content was prepared for environmental issues at the front left 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:30.990
 He is like that 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.389
 Kameda Konan and priced property there would not be one player 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.319
 It is not cool 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.490
 I feel the quality of one product 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.870
 The second suit advanced the group 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.020
 iso compliant 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.949
 Yusuke Shimizu 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.370
 Firms address issues and the farm is one week after the race 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.000
 Rested and struggled with customers and consumers with sufficient batting average of 36 minutes and 3 seconds 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.199
 Appealing peace now 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.629
 There is no intention of remaining 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.370
 If you say I'm taking iso9001 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.930
 To the factory of the company here 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.509
 It will be like Hanshin that the goods are not of quality 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:07.370
 Or 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.360
 If you take 140001 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.819
 Our company is environmentally friendly 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:12.660
 So 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.849
 Traders Securities is the only company with 14,000 positions 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:21.330
 I think that the final battle of the deal will be quick 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.539
 I want the productivity of the individual that the branches will spread 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:26.450
 Isn't it 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.590
 Apply for the same loan and its certification body 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.919
 The certification body of about 50 has a review. 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.409
 To take iso9001 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:38.679
 It is necessary to improve it by all means 

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:39.860
 Because you will 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.800
 According to it 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.380
 I have to do it properly 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.760
 It is Kyoro-chan that can not get a seal of yeah 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.369
 It seems that you can get an attachment 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.499
 I get a request, but it becomes too modest with the side 

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:51.460
 May be 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.039
 This time, about 3 times in this 3rd year 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:56.899
 If you check if you are 

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:58.460
 Anning royal party 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.460
 Easy-to-use commentary in various fields 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:04.169
 The staff is 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.150
 It's becoming a business essential 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.150
 Until 27th 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.270
 I did not get in touch 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.270
 This kind of result is again 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:19.149
 Figure 1 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:21.860
 Mr. Arakawa has changed
