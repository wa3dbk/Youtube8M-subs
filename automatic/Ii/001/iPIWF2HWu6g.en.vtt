00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
control alright so as you can see that's

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.880 
control alright so as you can see that's
just<00:00:35.460> me<00:00:35.760> sprinting<00:00:36.300> normally<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:37.350> with

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just me sprinting normally there with

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.180 
just me sprinting normally there with
double<00:00:38.820> tapping<00:00:39.030> w<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.559> hold<00:00:40.800> shift

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
double tapping w but if I hold shift

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.049 
double tapping w but if I hold shift
down<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> double<00:00:42.930> tap<00:00:43.110> w

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
down now I don't have to double tap w

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.010 
down now I don't have to double tap w
let<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.180> get<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:48.570> works<00:00:48.840> out

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
let me get it right like so it works out

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.680 
let me get it right like so it works out
a<00:00:49.079> lot<00:00:49.140> better<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.940> left<00:00:50.940> shift<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> lot

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
a lot better and left shift is a lot

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.180 
a lot better and left shift is a lot
easier<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.079> press<00:00:52.350> down<00:00:52.410> than<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.980> default

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
easier to press down than the default

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.760 
easier to press down than the default
which<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.969> left<00:00:54.180> control<00:00:54.750> because<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
which would be left control because I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.599 
which would be left control because I
can<00:00:56.039> leave<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.489> little<00:00:56.789> finger<00:00:57.289> on<00:00:58.289> left<00:00:59.250> shift

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
can leave my little finger on left shift

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.869 
can leave my little finger on left shift
as<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.120> WASD<00:01:00.989> around<00:01:01.440> which<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.430> why<00:01:02.579> it'll<00:01:02.789> be

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
as I'm WASD around which is why it'll be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.609 
as I'm WASD around which is why it'll be
easier<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.019> sneak<00:01:04.350> I'll

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
easier and then if I want to sneak I'll

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.420 
easier and then if I want to sneak I'll
have<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.040> move<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.020> left<00:01:07.020> control<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
have to move over to left control so

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.870 
have to move over to left control so
hopefully<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:10.049> guys<00:01:10.229> can<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:11.130> left

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
hopefully you guys can see that left

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
hopefully you guys can see that left
shift<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.479> easier<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:12.990> sprinting

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
shift would be easier for sprinting

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
shift would be easier for sprinting
since<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.040> just<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.340> passive<00:01:14.760> key<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.210> don't

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
since it's just a passive key you don't

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.330 
since it's just a passive key you don't
have<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> strain<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.500> finger<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.979> grab<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have to strain your finger to grab it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.620 
have to strain your finger to grab it
