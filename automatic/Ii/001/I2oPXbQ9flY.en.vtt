00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.739
 Listen to me 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.629
 Three years on top of that 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.699
 I have one new page going 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.539
 It is important before the end of the auction 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.589
 As an alternative water source 4 points in the early stage not to use so much 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.560
 Display can be done 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.380
 It is said that I was in charge of next year 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.519
 The amount is estimated anyway 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.520

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.000
 Before lending 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 I refuse such troublesome things 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.640

 Evolving Challenges 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.470
 I wanted to visit so much 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.360
 I have not met a guest and have a guest read a demo 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.420
 Or hit point 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.100
 I think Osaka to cheertek Shin-chan 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.950
 But inflation has progressed in the statement 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.270
 I started to do it again 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.930

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930

 Just launched after the week 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.960
 There is no excuse, though 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230
 It was narrowed down to these two people 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.210
 Jackie Chan that doesn't lift too much 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.570
 Seriously, we are aiming for a simplified version of the hunger kit. 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.270
 The product in question is a voice of change and confusion 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.250
 Talk back to product portfolio limits

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.210
 I'm writing 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.340
 Continue to the first part 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.670
 May test 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.960
 That made a big hit 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 But retired 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340

 In fact, I have also heard it once 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.259
 It is said that we are paying attention to our fluorescent tubes 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.479

 From the final stage level 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.260
 I just wondered where 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.969
 Mr. Ichiro and he has been doing it 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.969
 So it is not so I went to 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.829

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.139
 Because the second point is bitten, it retreats to Matic 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.959
 Area designation that was not dated one day 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.959
 The district people's song came close 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:46.249
 I finished it quite clearly 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.699
 Germany can not read single words 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.699

 I may not believe it 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.699
 I heard the radio and thought 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.089
 Is the mercury lamp actually quite lonely? 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.159

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.549
 I don't need to go to the mountain alone It was 1 yen alone 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.699
 I'm saying 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:22.339

 I was not able to make a successful bid in the breeding farmer 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.219
