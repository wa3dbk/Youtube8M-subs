00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
over Japan's working and they said

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.739 
over Japan's working and they said
they're<00:00:54.729> still<00:00:54.909> not<00:00:54.999> gonna<00:00:55.179> do<00:00:55.329> it<00:00:55.449> just<00:00:55.690> yet

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
they're still not gonna do it just yet

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.299 
they're still not gonna do it just yet
they<00:00:55.960> have<00:00:56.050> nothing<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.379> announce<00:00:56.589> just<00:00:57.069> yet

they have nothing to announce just yet

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.549 
they have nothing to announce just yet
I'm<00:00:57.850> thinking<00:00:58.120> they're<00:00:58.449> saving<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:58.929> because<00:00:59.199> I

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
I'm thinking they're saving it because I

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.379 
I'm thinking they're saving it because I
think<00:00:59.799> it's<00:01:00.069> fair<00:01:00.190> to<00:01:00.249> say<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.489> Vita<00:01:01.239> will

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:01.389 
think it's fair to say that Vita will

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:02.879 
think it's fair to say that Vita will
see<00:01:01.479> a<00:01:01.510> price<00:01:01.780> cut<00:01:01.960> this<00:01:02.139> year<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.530> really<00:01:02.799> don't

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
see a price cut this year I really don't

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.770 
see a price cut this year I really don't
think<00:01:03.010> they<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.249> go<00:01:03.460> through<00:01:03.639> all<00:01:03.789> 2013<00:01:04.629> at

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
think they can go through all 2013 at

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.090 
think they can go through all 2013 at
the<00:01:04.809> same<00:01:05.080> price<00:01:05.350> point<00:01:05.590> with<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:05.890> same

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
the same price point with the same

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.650 
the same price point with the same
expensive<00:01:06.610> memory<00:01:06.850> card<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.330> think<00:01:07.420> it<00:01:07.630> is

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
expensive memory card so I think it is

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.000 
expensive memory card so I think it is
safe<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:07.930> say<00:01:08.140> we'll<00:01:08.320> see<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.470> price<00:01:08.680> cut<00:01:08.860> this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
safe to say we'll see a price cut this

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.680 
safe to say we'll see a price cut this
year<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.790> was<00:01:09.820> just<00:01:09.940> a<00:01:10.120> matter<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.330> one

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
year that was just a matter of one

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.630 
year that was just a matter of one
obviously<00:01:11.380> one<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.560> my<00:01:11.680> guesses<00:01:11.890> would<00:01:12.130> be<00:01:12.220> III

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
obviously one of my guesses would be III

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.860 
obviously one of my guesses would be III
that<00:01:12.760> would<00:01:12.880> be<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:12.970> great<00:01:13.210> place<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.540> do<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.750> so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
that would be a great place to do it so

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.930 
that would be a great place to do it so
it's<00:01:14.020> like<00:01:14.170> hey<00:01:14.350> we're<00:01:14.740> showing<00:01:14.890> ps4<00:01:15.550> here's
