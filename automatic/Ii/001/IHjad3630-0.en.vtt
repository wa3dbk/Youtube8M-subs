00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.979
 in my mind 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello welcome to another video more than 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.940
 antlers my name is juan and the day of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.639
 today I bring you a video of what 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.760
 are the applications that I use for 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.590
 edit my photos in instagram and sometimes 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.689
 they have asked me for twitter and for me 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.400
 instagram that percent follow me how 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.619
 I do it to edit fly or to put 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.930
 certain all certain filters that do not 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.240
 come properly on instagram indeed 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.460
 I generally do not use the filters 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.320
 instagram not because they are ugly I do not know why 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 what in those applications there is as much 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.980
 more variety then I'm going to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.079
 talk about the ones that I use so that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.270
 you also use them already what 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.640
 I have to specify that I do not know if these 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.710
 exist for other cell phones but in my 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.760
 case I have an iphone then you are 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 applications, you can find them 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.070
 in the app store but in the others I think 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.809
 that some if they come as for android 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 but I'm not too sure 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 the set that I have of applications 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.280
 each one has a certain specialty 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.289
 actually yes obviously they all have 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 like filters and all that but one does not 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.399
 is used for some things in 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 specific and others for another then 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.330
 I'll explain how that four are 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.080
 express that is really a very good 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.300
 application 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.670
 It is very heavy so it actually 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.530
 I use for example to correct 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.930
 red eyes that suddenly also in the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.810
 photographs or for example if you have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.490
 some bonfire too big or if you 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740
 comes a granite or something 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
 you can use this application has 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.950
 many filters and has others and very few 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.850
 father but for and what I recommend 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.070
 use it is for that correction of eyes 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.990
 some houndstooth that you have some 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.090
 I heard some granite I use that 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.790
 because it has that option that allows you 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 correct some mistakes in the skin the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.380
 application number 2 is one that I 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.290
 he recommended in fact malena tics arts that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.090
 in which what I use it 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.520
 It is generally to create effects by 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.650
 clear example that the blur 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.290
 also some filters that this has 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.090
 application are very parents and especially 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.940
 also what I use is a stick 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.490
 school or the mosaics that have several 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.470
 photographs I use it a lot for that 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.230
 lights effects also come 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.000
 has effects like putting masks 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.620
 in your photographs the mask is like 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.810
 this layer that you put on top 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.830
 photograph that can be with a circle 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.020
 a triangle like that 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.820
 it's also working very well for that 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.370
 the next application that I use is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.890
 after life that the truth afterlife does not 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.070
 comes a video of the bid and de ibáñez 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.080
 this has cost I downloaded it and said 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.290
 well I'll download it to see how 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.060
 it works and I really liked your filters and 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.730
 another of the things that I liked the most 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.490
 is that you have the option to have 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.650
 these white stripes or any 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.360
 color or some texture in photos of 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.430
 instagram as we can remember in 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.920
 instagram only accepts the format of 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.130
 pictures then this application we 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.340
 help to quickly put those stripes 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.990
 to make a picture of your photograph and in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.780
 the personal the filters that they have in 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.690
 this application I really like it 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.910
 I recommend them and the next one is naps and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.910
 in fact this application I like 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.180
 very much if it is also very very heavy and 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.760
 the google develops and snap if what you 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.920
 will help are things like very technical 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.360
 I like them a lot because in 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.950
 you can actually correct for example if 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.840
 come out with some more shadow in your 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.430
 photograph something like this you can correct 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.620
 directly on it 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.450
 area for example raise the sharpness to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.359
 that looks like something with more texture 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.459
 then this is done as along with 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.500
 photoshop express are like the most 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.209
 techniques again like you take 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.040
 a while as in understanding him because he is not 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.420
 as fast as instagram or the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.569
 others is like you have to 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.700
 throw a little more learning to the 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.439
 application but the truth is very father 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.569
 because it makes you look your pictures 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.760
 super professionals these are the 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.530
 main applications that I use for 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.870
 my instagram and you can tell me 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.060

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.400
 follow me minister so that they see and tell 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.230

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.000
 you use are measure you do not know that I 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.200
 I prefer this application if you 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.480
 they have an application that they want me 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.459

 download and tell them payment if it's true 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.180
