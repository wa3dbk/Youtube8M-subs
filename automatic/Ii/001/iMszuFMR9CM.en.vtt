get it done and the reason you cannot
get<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> wrong<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.750> never<00:02:07.619> done

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
get it wrong is because it is never done

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.639 
get it wrong is because it is never done
so<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.970> stand<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.660> contrasting<00:02:10.170> place

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so when you stand in a contrasting place

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
so when you stand in a contrasting place
where<00:02:10.950> something<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.489> manifested

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
where something is manifested

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.990 
where something is manifested
you're<00:02:12.510> not<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:13.110> pleased<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.800> no<00:02:14.460> problem

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
you're not that pleased with no problem

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600 
you're not that pleased with no problem

experience it is your life experience
that<00:02:32.760> gives<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.240> your<00:02:33.420> knowing<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.990> see

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that gives you your knowing you see

there is nothing that you cannot achieve

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470 
there is nothing that you cannot achieve
because<00:02:37.410> your<00:02:38.100> environment<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.970> caused<00:02:39.210> you

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
because your environment is caused you

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.680 
because your environment is caused you
to<00:02:39.600> walnut<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.200> source<00:02:40.590> always<00:02:41.430> says<00:02:41.880> yes<00:02:42.330> but

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
to walnut and source always says yes but

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.350 
to walnut and source always says yes but
you've<00:02:43.620> got<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.950> find<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.250> way<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.670> becoming<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
you've got to find a way of becoming a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.210 
you've got to find a way of becoming a
vibrational<00:02:45.990> match<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.830> you<00:02:46.890> can't

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
vibrational match to that and you can't

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.640 
vibrational match to that and you can't
keep<00:02:47.490> looking<00:02:48.060> at<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.600> absence<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.290> what<00:02:49.500> you

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
keep looking at the absence of what you

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.070 
keep looking at the absence of what you
want<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.280> be<00:02:50.670> a<00:02:50.700> vibrational<00:02:51.420> match<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.660> what

want and be a vibrational match to what

you want you've got to find a way to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.720 
you want you've got to find a way to
change<00:02:54.510> your<00:02:54.870> personal<00:02:55.320> perspective<00:02:56.040> we

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
change your personal perspective we

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
change your personal perspective we
think<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.330> might<00:02:57.480> be<00:02:57.690> helpful<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.320> you

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
think that it might be helpful if you

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.150 
think that it might be helpful if you
would<00:02:58.680> acknowledge<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:59.990> 99%<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.010> is

would acknowledge that 99% of it is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.430 
would acknowledge that 99% of it is
complete<00:03:02.610> before<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.120> see<00:03:03.330> any<00:03:03.360> evidence<00:03:04.110> so

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
complete before you see any evidence so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.740 
complete before you see any evidence so
while<00:03:04.950> no<00:03:05.160> evidence<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.790> turned<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.300> wouldn't

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
while no evidence is turned up wouldn't

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.570 
while no evidence is turned up wouldn't
it<00:03:06.780> be<00:03:06.959> just<00:03:06.990> as<00:03:07.410> easy<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.830> think<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.430> you're

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
it be just as easy to think that you're

it be just as easy to think that you're
on<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.850> way<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.450> than<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:10.050> you're

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
on the way to it than to think you're

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.920 
on the way to it than to think you're
not<00:03:10.260> on<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.620> way<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:11.130> except<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.090> you've
