00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.170
 and play on google is back this 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.080
 last come back to receive my choice 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.620
 of the generalist college la vaz vaz e 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 to study 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.080
 so how would I forget advertising? 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.119
 Working, it's from here to here how much 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.630
 Nothing much has changed and nothing has changed. 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.599
 lance arrived in the social leap 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.199
 centered on bank or bank people 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 It provides that seems to work with band 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:37.140
 Let it go, and I'll turn it around. 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.520
 It was true at first so when I was 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.980
 younger I used to do the keyboard and sing 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 then I've sung several festivals 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 I thus sing in the triangle 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.739
 Only the child, that's when I need it. 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379
 I grew up and started dancing to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.500
 street dance always involved with art and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.039
 music but it was not any profession 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.739
 so one day I was working at 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.040
 bank still I said people I think 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.619
 I like this thing I travel a lot 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 management delay for example the text goes 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.380
 playing in Brasilia was installed there in the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.490
 brazilia theater then began thus to put 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.369
 The interest 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 Then one day I decided to take the course 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.320
 first course and then the first I 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.840
 I already gave a presentation and have already begun to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.460
 other things to come I dropped one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.020
 aesthetic clinic I had 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.329
 facial esthetics abandon and solve 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 kick the bucket there I did several others 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.670
 courses and then it was 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.610
 It's as easy as people find it 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 nekounam of a dj life because it has 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.090
 many courses everything changes all the time 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.250
 inside and technology as you adapt 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.310
 this universe is so abundant 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.190
 Look is is such an existing thing and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.280
 have to incorporate and you're done 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.800
 especially the DJ is the person you like 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.800
 electronic music the dj anyway 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.840
 he is always aware because it is not 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.729
 Brazilian culture to music 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.110
 electronics then everything that comes from outside 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.720
 so we have to always be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.480
 connected on what's rolling in the scene 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.510
 world and then I have the programs 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.040
 I'm already very aware it's with 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.620
 information about electronic music 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.110
 songs that are really going on the scene 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.600
 I bring all this to the programs and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 then I'm using social networks as 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.050
 I learned how everyone else in this 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.510
 using the same has to incorporate and you 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.420
 He started doing the healing program as 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 it was a different experience, it's not much 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.440
 different there already I do not even know how many 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.709
 years since he is confused by the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.739
 Dance floor program is wonderful to 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.400
 It was incredible, even my 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:56.160
 flowers and there is one that is how I play 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.140
 live and have webcam is that people can 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.950
 keep track of at home you know how she 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.350
 culture 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.810
 so the crowd can follow at home and 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.970
 This was amazing for me. 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 hence the other program he came up with 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.680
 I was invited to do only that I 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.720
 I rely heavily on technology because I 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.380
 I'm not going to lisbon to present the program 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.000
 huh 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.769
 I do everything in the program is not black 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.400
 that is a production program 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.560
 musical, and then I record the bass voice or 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.940
 I really want to record and then I 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.010
 I give them to you, it's all technological and you 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.140
 where is present 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.780
 various social networks like you 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.760
 admin so many profiles so many accounts 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.129
 because you have health 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.370
 you have to produce the same content is 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.680
 truth is good is not actually have 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.599
 many people who work in the same 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.640
 means that I do not matter much 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.799
 cloud boston solution and from time to time 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.680
 when it's okay really is not a 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.299
 thing that has to be done but I eat 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.700
 the work with musical production also 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.859
 I like to put everything there that I 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.790
 I spent the night doing nothing, so it's 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.769
 remix mashup I always try to leave my 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.560
 sets there for the crowd to follow 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.450
 is still rolling then current 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.000
 my concern about the sound of cloud is 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.000
 sometimes it's bigger than my own 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.200
 blog that has inside the site wants 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.229
 information even about music 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.440
 electronics know in this age of the internet is 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.270
 that this modern universe without reading 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.210
 people suffer a lot from the issue of 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.699
 copyrights because people by 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.280
 example 17 may go down and touch a 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.240
 party on it is not every time you deal 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.510
 thereby 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.169
 Look, it's your thinking, not single and not 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.970
 bet on messi so i do not care 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.669
 with this it is time for the song 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.250
 usually the dj plays what the producer 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.320
 You did it, so it was not what I did all 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.810
 those songs or those remixes 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.120
 then that that 7 that usually 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.639
 I just thought that the song was 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.349
 made for the world itself and I know 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.440
 messages that I do in the brain are 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.180
 used are differentiated and if I 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.340
 stop to think that someone will touch 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.229
 In a party, they pass me by already. 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.690
 this happened it was not one or two 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.370
 Sometimes but I stop to think I stop. 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.310
 to post and there 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.650
 and it was not and is not the issue of 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.600
 competition is because despite being a 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.669
 work you have a 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.669
 competition with others by dieyson 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.190
 know the beauties that go out to the yacht 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.600
 right now, and I'll tell you what 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.040
 this issue 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.710
 Look, it's Bruno, it's very, this is complicated. 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.949
 this part, not with the others 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.110
 djs that take the scene seriously not I am 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:41.120
 very light, there you know I think 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.430
 space for everyone because I 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.590
 I think you know that, are you sure? 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.960
 Do you know who works a lot? 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.880
 time to wonder if it 's the other 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.740
 is doing something then is going 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.110
 Work, then I do not care much. 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.150
 with real competition but not the fake 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.440
 de geisiel I do not support not me 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.840
 represents 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.479
 I think lousy do not think all ex 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.150
 baby be the sucker of money I'll never 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.460
 I saw him in fact no ex bbb playing 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.910
 But I understand that this has given a good 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.949
 analyzed as such but also has no 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.139
 that prejudice does not know 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.330
 I think that everything is human being, I 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:18.979
 I think we learn if we want 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.530
 learn and if you have to do a job 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.919
 Seriously, I support the super cool. 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.560
 now if it's fake then the benfica will not 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.860
 Support is meant for us to close all 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.860
 dj 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:37.780
 and hey, I do not know if every day the cat does not 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:40.270
 but I think when you work it's with 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.050
 people like that I think you have to give 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:47.020
 one right I've been bad bad is think about what 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.950
 you will invest what you will do and 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.560
 it is 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.110
