is and I'm going to go into detail on

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.240 
is and I'm going to go into detail on
how<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.969> exactly<00:00:12.450> set<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.900> up<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:14.009> let's<00:00:14.160> get

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
how to exactly set it up so let's get

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.780 
how to exactly set it up so let's get
started

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
started

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.849 
started
the<00:00:15.030> first<00:00:15.269> things<00:00:15.480> first<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:15.960> your<00:00:16.170> new

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the first things first are your new

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.269 
the first things first are your new
streaming<00:00:17.190> PC<00:00:17.580> specs<00:00:17.910> ah<00:00:18.289> now<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.740> big<00:00:19.980> thing

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
streaming PC specs ah now the big thing

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.160 
streaming PC specs ah now the big thing
about<00:00:20.430> your<00:00:20.760> streaming<00:00:21.060> PC<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.020> only

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
about your streaming PC is that the only

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470 
about your streaming PC is that the only
thing<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:22.590> does<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> encode<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.390> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
thing it really does is encode so it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.939 
thing it really does is encode so it
takes<00:00:24.660> footage<00:00:24.990> from<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.289> main<00:00:25.529> gaming

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
takes footage from your main gaming

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980 
takes footage from your main gaming
computer<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.699> compress<00:00:27.449> not

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
computer and then it compress not

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
computer and then it compress not
compress<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.500> encodes<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> sends

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
compress it encodes it and then it sends

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.830 
compress it encodes it and then it sends
it<00:00:29.970> off<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> Internet

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it off the Internet

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.069 
it off the Internet
so<00:00:31.679> for<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.219> one<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.750> recommend<00:00:33.750> having<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
so for this one I recommend having a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.979 
so for this one I recommend having a
high<00:00:34.649> end<00:00:34.829> quad<00:00:35.190> core<00:00:35.520> or<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.910> high<00:00:36.149> end<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.600> core

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
high end quad core or in high end a core

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.950 
high end quad core or in high end a core
also<00:00:37.260> AMD<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.579> Intel<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.840> your

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
also AMD or Intel it's really your

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
also AMD or Intel it's really your
choice<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.620> gonna<00:00:40.770> suggest<00:00:41.010> anything

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670

i5 2500 K it's a pretty standard one is
a<00:00:48.510> pretty<00:00:48.690> good<00:00:48.870> CPU<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.710> sure<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.789> can

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
a pretty good CPU and it can sure it can

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
a pretty good CPU and it can sure it can
encode<00:00:51.210> footage<00:00:51.570> easily<00:00:51.899> ah<00:00:52.100> now<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> really

make<00:00:54.989> sure<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.379> CPU<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
make sure that your CPU and a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.830 
make sure that your CPU and a
motherboard<00:00:56.699> combo<00:00:57.270> are<00:00:57.329> really<00:00:57.570> good<00:00:57.719> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
motherboard combo are really good you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869 
motherboard combo are really good you
have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.109> research<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> by<00:00:59.250> yourself

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
have to research on it by yourself

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
have to research on it by yourself
to<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.539> what<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> best<00:01:00.870> combo<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.250> memory

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
to see what the best combo is the memory

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
to see what the best combo is the memory
doesn't<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:02.910> matter<00:01:03.120> I'll<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:04.260> should

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
doesn't really matter I'll you should

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
doesn't really matter I'll you should
have<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.850> pretty<00:01:06.000> much<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> requirement<00:01:06.240> that

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
have it's pretty much a requirement that

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.390 
have it's pretty much a requirement that
8<00:01:06.869> gigabytes<00:01:07.350> don't<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.920> any<00:01:08.070> less<00:01:08.220> than

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
8 gigabytes don't have any less than

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
8 gigabytes don't have any less than
that<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.150> can<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.470> up<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
that you can go more it's really up to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
that you can go more it's really up to
you<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.280> gigabytes<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> sweet<00:01:12.990> spot

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you but a gigabytes like the sweet spot

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.890 
you but a gigabytes like the sweet spot
make<00:01:14.220> sure<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:14.790> power<00:01:15.000> supply<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.540> at

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
you wanna you know it doesn't hurt to go

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.399 
you wanna you know it doesn't hurt to go
silver<00:01:25.619> either<00:01:25.979> uh<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.900> that's<00:01:28.110> pretty<00:01:28.259> much

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
so uh the problem is that if you have a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320 
so uh the problem is that if you have a
USB<00:02:58.400> microphone<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.970> one<00:03:00.090> I'm<00:03:00.180> using

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
USB microphone like the one I'm using

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.690 
USB microphone like the one I'm using
right<00:03:00.450> now<00:03:00.860> you're<00:03:01.860> going<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.130> to<00:03:02.280> buy<00:03:02.430> an

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
right now you're going to have to buy an

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.650 
right now you're going to have to buy an
audio<00:03:03.090> compressor<00:03:03.720> uh<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.700> controls<00:03:06.180> all<00:03:06.300> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
audio compressor uh it controls all the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.070 
audio compressor uh it controls all the
audios<00:03:07.020> from<00:03:07.230> everything<00:03:07.680> they<00:03:08.190> range<00:03:08.550> from

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
audios from everything they range from

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.740 
audios from everything they range from
$150<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.160> $60<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:12.090> will<00:03:12.210> have<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.480> choose<00:03:12.630> them

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
$150 to $60 you will have to choose them

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
$150 to $60 you will have to choose them
by<00:03:12.840> your<00:03:12.990> own<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.380> don't<00:03:13.620> have<00:03:13.740> any<00:03:13.890> experience

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
by your own I don't have any experience

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.010 
by your own I don't have any experience
with<00:03:14.430> them<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.970> because<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.540> don't<00:03:15.600> stream

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
with them out because I don't stream

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.200 
with them out because I don't stream
with<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.260> USB<00:03:16.680> headset<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.310> much<00:03:17.460> simpler<00:03:17.970> to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
with a USB headset it's much simpler to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.030 
with a USB headset it's much simpler to
use<00:03:18.240> a<00:03:20.060> microphone<00:03:21.060> splitter<00:03:21.510> one<00:03:22.320> other<00:03:22.620> way

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
use a microphone splitter one other way

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
use a microphone splitter one other way
that<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.610> stream<00:03:24.300> your<00:03:24.360> audio<00:03:24.780> without

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that you can stream your audio without

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.340 
that you can stream your audio without
any<00:03:25.740> like<00:03:26.220> hardware<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.120> using<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.960> chat

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
any like hardware is using a chat

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.310 
any like hardware is using a chat
service<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.100> I'm<00:03:29.280> gonna<00:03:29.400> explain<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.940> later

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
service and I'm gonna explain that later

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.170 
service and I'm gonna explain that later
so<00:03:31.320> if<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.650> have<00:03:31.800> all<00:03:31.980> these<00:03:32.130> parts<00:03:32.580> these<00:03:32.940> two

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
so if you have all these parts these two

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.980 
so if you have all these parts these two
basic<00:03:33.540> parts

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
basic parts

know<00:04:41.220> how<00:04:41.370> to<00:04:41.460> do<00:04:41.610> this<00:04:41.699> stuff<00:04:41.880> I'm<00:04:42.030> assuming

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
know how to do this stuff I'm assuming

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.700 
know how to do this stuff I'm assuming
you<00:04:42.449> know<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.630> basics<00:04:42.990> of<00:04:43.050> streaming<00:04:43.410> and

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
you know the basics of streaming and

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.779 
you know the basics of streaming and
you're<00:04:43.919> just<00:04:44.039> going<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.190> set<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:44.460> up<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.759> make

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
you're just going to set it up to make

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.550 
you're just going to set it up to make
it<00:04:45.240> source<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.720> stuff<00:04:45.870> uh<00:04:46.350> now<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.990> part<00:04:49.350> with

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
it source and stuff uh now the part with

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.140 
it source and stuff uh now the part with
the<00:04:49.590> audio<00:04:49.949> comes<00:04:50.220> in<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.759> audio<00:04:51.030> is

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
the audio comes in the audio is

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.790 
the audio comes in the audio is
surprisingly<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.810> most<00:04:51.930> complicated<00:04:52.380> thing

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
surprisingly the most complicated thing

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.469 
surprisingly the most complicated thing
the<00:04:53.070> video<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.430> not<00:04:53.610> that<00:04:53.759> complicated

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
the video is not that complicated

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.510 
the video is not that complicated
uh<00:04:54.509> so<00:04:55.440> like<00:04:55.620> I<00:04:55.710> said<00:04:55.770> there<00:04:56.039> are<00:04:56.070> three<00:04:56.160> ways

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
uh so like I said there are three ways

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.360 
uh so like I said there are three ways
either<00:04:56.880> using<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.509> 3.5<00:04:58.050> millimeter<00:04:58.620> Jack<00:04:59.190> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
either using a 3.5 millimeter Jack to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.089 
either using a 3.5 millimeter Jack to
split<00:04:59.639> your<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:01.080> split<00:05:01.440> oh<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.830> not<00:05:01.889> even

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
split your to split oh it's not even

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.850 
split your to split oh it's not even
here<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.599> 3.5<00:05:03.599> millimeter<00:05:03.810> Jack<00:05:04.259> to<00:05:04.440> split<00:05:04.740> your

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
here a 3.5 millimeter Jack to split your

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.129 
here a 3.5 millimeter Jack to split your
microphone<00:05:05.400> audio<00:05:05.690> buying<00:05:06.690> an<00:05:06.870> audio

microphone audio buying an audio

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.740 
microphone audio buying an audio
compressor<00:05:07.680> which<00:05:08.430> is<00:05:08.580> probably<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.449> thing

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
compressor which is probably the thing

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.240 
compressor which is probably the thing
that's<00:05:09.930> going<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.110> produce<00:05:10.289> the<00:05:10.919> best<00:05:11.130> quality

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
that's going to produce the best quality

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.310 
that's going to produce the best quality
ah<00:05:11.880> or<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:13.710> can<00:05:13.889> chat<00:05:14.610> over<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:15.389> voice
