 ingenious the appearance something new what 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.200
 first thing we're going to do is grab a 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.170
 Paw and we're going to start like you 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.409
 want a membership cut in 4 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.920
 so it's completely considered 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:58.280
 dad let's grab butter 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.259
 and we're going to put a piece here and another 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.500
 piece but we will try to 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.500
 smear 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.100
 If elsewhere 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.630
 so that the potato is not going to stick 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.610
 so when so grabbed a 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.610
 fork and we're going to put cream 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.260
 a little cream and the ingredients that 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.560
 you want me to put it to this 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.000
 because these sausages 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.000
 how to put kitchen 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.410
 true 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.160
 A) Yes 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.260
 now we are going to put little salt but 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.349
 this is going to be done in the whole plaza 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.349
 nothing else in the middle we put salt 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.510
 a little pepper 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.870
 ground pepper 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.220
 it's a ball 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.610
 be well covered and ready so we have 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.250
 that cover it completely good now 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.100
 for those who do not have an oven like me 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:30.980
 I do not have or not because we are going to use a 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.170
 keep this pot to use steam 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.090
 As you can see I already have enough potatoes 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.269
 prepared 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.269
 in lists then I'm going to pour water 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.760
 ah 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.920
 the lid 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.870
 and I start to put them 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.330
 this is going to make it work as if 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.790
 out an oven 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.550
 so it does not matter what in the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.340
 little borrowed just the only thing that goes 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.260
 to happen here is that it's going to melt the 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:20.450
 yellow cheese and it's going to melt the cheese 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:24.440
 so white goes out then now just what 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.160
 so we cover it and put it on fire but 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.920
 low heat and little softly as 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.640
 we leave half an hour to be 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.470
 consuming the water and start doing the 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.300
 good medicine function and 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.540
 We just finished 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.129

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.220

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.420
