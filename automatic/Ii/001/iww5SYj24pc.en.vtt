 We have to record this video. 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.230
 the government is with you and not 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.269

 load that red lezinho direct 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.769
 is charging and the LEDs instead of 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.570
 left on day to be on and stopped 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.360
 with my smartphone 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.739
 he has this directional here as in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.019
 words in colleague Andrew with 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.360
 Circular copamar surface could not 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:07.049
 fail to mention names the start button 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.940
 select action buttons here and back 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:16.580
 the triggers are and found the phone has to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.660
 stay on top of the arm here and put it 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.920
 I'll try to do it without 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.920
 mess up my camera 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.350
 nor does it have beauty to function in which 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.500
 all dead men with functional logic 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.420
 you need a native hotel app 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.460
 here it is indicating that my 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.679
 device is already connected 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.030
 and in the games tab 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.310
 it will show a series of games 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.200
 compatible games are not all games that 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.179
 are compatible so I'll give a 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.329
 Look here but there's plenty of stuff. 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.740
 including some simulators to the games 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.469
 which you can download again through 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.420
 android market just give it a little bit 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.990
 here it can direct direct to 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.640
 the store on google you download 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.420
 so I'm going to show that it matters not to be 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 some games now 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:22.400
 I did not have to do anything here. 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:24.080
 game pro it run only died in 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.000
 I even played when I went down to say that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.430
 had been developed by fia by law 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.590
 what is that sony smartphone that already 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.020
 comes 11 11 game pad couples them but they 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.970
 they work without charge I screamed I was 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.740
 dying enough more worried 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.740
 in talking about the apparatus that he judges 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.069
 the train of the plant that likes 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.069
 kick your pretty taste 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:09.750
 I hit the start here. 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.750
 game options I'm going to get out of it 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.400
 I did not find it very funny. 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.459
 ok from the veil and if it's easier it's another game 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.530
 very cool that I really like 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.060
 only as a josh to show how 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.209
 what happens and I already had 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.400
 used it on the asus transformer tablet 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.349
 with a common usb joystick 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.260
 I 'll show you the game is a game 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.000
 of very cool platform well the disk the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.080
 yes I think the best time example 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.080
 showed that its necessary movement 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.050
 I'll talk to you here 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.830
 the game such europe under snow so attached 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:03.670
 so keg is not too tired not 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.620
 modifies a lot of phone weight it 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:11.190
 set that is more or less a weight 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.190
 an important game and that's pretty cool 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.350
 also does not have a very large gap 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.049
 between the smartphone screen and the 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.040
 even appear to be 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.080
 one thing only 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.280
 and how his arm is well regulated and 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.190
 it ends up being compatible with a 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.980
 wide variety of 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.590
 smartphones have counties with more 84 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.220
 physical and all of it fit here in a 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.220
 if it's for me 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.900
 mental pride 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.460
 Ok I can with all the end puts but not 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.690
 It's so cool right then with a little 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.690
 environmental physical buttons 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.010
 the opi 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.380
 I think the best looking game and this game 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.380
 that the 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:03.250
 So that's it, yes I can when I play 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:05.800
 hit it just open the game must have 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.350
 failed in sisu wearing caps or a 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.160
 all extended action buttons 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:14.320
 automatically turns out to be very practical 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:19.600
 it only has a legal will not mind 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:25.150
 very good cast is even compatible 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:27.010
 and for this you have so much in your own 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.380
 account application on site 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:35.400
 also they show several options then 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:40.630
 go there good and see which one shares 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:45.930
 again the following here in the 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.930
 settings also including you can 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.010

 you come here because the changes following the 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.370
 game tel when the smartphone 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.230
 he was eventually recognized as a 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.540
 keyboard can sometimes 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.040
 you can not digital something 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.960
 usually if you need it for example 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.790
 find a mathematician 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:07.390
