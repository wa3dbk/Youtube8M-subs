00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.830
 each 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.590
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.570
 new video of tricks I am by mt 10 and today 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.550
 I 'm going to teach you how to pass routes 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.320
 automatic on the map of origins is 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.540
 easy enough we just go to the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 church we mount in the tank we give 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.760
 squared or x in xbox and we wait 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.590
 to arrive at the first station one 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.400
 Once it arrives let's call it again 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.210
 to the tank and we're going to go this way 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.949
 until we get to the side of the m-40 and go 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 to wait for the tank to pass through 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.250
 our side be careful with the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 new update that have gotten a 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.629
 patch to kill us the tank if 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.080
 it hits us so we're waiting for it 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.350
 around here we wait for it to happen and when 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.720
 is going on we went up behind 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 if you look at the two lights you are 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.890
 they must be on they are off 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.470
 that's because the tank has been 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 stayed as played and well now what 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.549
 only thing that we will have to do is wait 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.500
 to have the tank parked in the church 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.750
 when 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.910
 we leave the ejected in xbox or the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 square in play 3 for when they leave 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.350
 maps in front of this machine where it 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.750
 start the tank here you see how it is 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 coming the tank I already left the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.729
 X and I keep shooting the law 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.620
 we stop pressing x since if 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.560
 let's go then we'll get the trick and 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.540
 we wait for the tank to refuel 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.620
 no report that we can not stop 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.140
 press the X 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.600
 and nothing else that is resting can you 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.250
 release and since the tank is activated 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.690
 will be as active but not really 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.000
 moves like the movement does that 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.940
 it moves but it does not move and as you see 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.130
 activates the fire from the sides and from 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.480
 back and now what we will do is make the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.700
 trick that you have patched here that 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.200
 it's just the same but we have to 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.090
 go throwing little by little to 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.670
 ahead until they let us lie down and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.770
 pull us back this will create a zombie 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.590
 confusion and all the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.200
 zombies on the right side of the tank 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.840
 As you can see, all will come 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.640
 for here even the panzer and good the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.790
 fire will burn it and kill them 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.440
 so we will pass automatic rounds and good 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.480
 this has been the trick I hope that I have 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.700
 served that you liked here I offer 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.790
 how come all the zombies do 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.310
 here and kill the fire is worth and nothing else 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.860
 I hope you liked it, commented like 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.980

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.530

 laughs heard
