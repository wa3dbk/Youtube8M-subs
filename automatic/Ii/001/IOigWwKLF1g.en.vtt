00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
building you should probably have um so

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.279 
building you should probably have um so
uh<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:26.189> then<00:00:26.340> also<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:26.730> tips<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.750> efficiency

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
uh and then also some tips on efficiency

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.810 
uh and then also some tips on efficiency
so<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.400> always<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.810> many

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
so that you always have as many

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.440 
so that you always have as many
different<00:00:34.610> because<00:00:35.610> there's<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:35.820> many<00:00:35.910> timers

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
different because there's so many timers

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.549 
different because there's so many timers
in<00:00:36.480> this<00:00:36.690> game<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.020> important<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
in this game it's important to

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.940 
in this game it's important to
constantly<00:00:38.010> have<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.809> plate<00:00:40.320> spinning<00:00:40.739> in

constantly have the plate spinning in

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.530 
constantly have the plate spinning in
every<00:00:41.340> single<00:00:41.489> way<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> i<00:00:42.270> will<00:00:42.300> get

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
into exactly what i mean by that towards

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000 
into exactly what i mean by that towards
the<00:00:44.100> end<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.489> video<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.059> first<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.870> 10<00:00:46.860> by

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the end of this video so first a 10 by

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.400 
the end of this video so first a 10 by
10<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> very<00:00:48.600> important<00:00:49.020> strategy

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
10 this is a very important strategy

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250 
10 this is a very important strategy
that<00:00:49.860> i<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.309> learn<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.940> took<00:00:51.360> quite<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.140> bit

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
that i did not learn it took quite a bit

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.600 
that i did not learn it took quite a bit
end<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.590> game<00:00:52.739> on<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.010> guess<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.550> we

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
end of the game on my guess is if we

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.830 
end of the game on my guess is if we
just<00:00:53.789> picked<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> game<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.600> started

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
just picked up the game and started

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.779 
just picked up the game and started
playing<00:00:54.989> without<00:00:55.260> following<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.129> shadowed<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
playing without following a shadowed you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
playing without following a shadowed you
got<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.090> did<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.270> same<00:00:57.480> thing<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:57.930> fret<00:00:58.530> not

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
got you did the same thing but fret not

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
got you did the same thing but fret not
it's<00:00:59.399> easier<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.030> when<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.270> first<00:01:00.480> start

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
it's easier to do when you first start

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
it's easier to do when you first start
the<00:01:00.840> game<00:01:00.989> but<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.890> impossible<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.820> after

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
the game but not impossible to do after

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.250 
the game but not impossible to do after
your<00:01:04.019> put<00:01:04.739> some<00:01:05.150> some<00:01:06.150> real<00:01:06.689> time<00:01:06.930> into<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
your put some some real time into the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.520 
your put some some real time into the
game<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.250> what<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.820> 10<00:01:09.030> x<00:01:09.119> 10<00:01:09.299> 10<00:01:09.630> x<00:01:09.720> 10<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
game so what is 10 x 10 10 x 10 is a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.410 
game so what is 10 x 10 10 x 10 is a
strategy<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:12.060> where<00:01:12.840> there<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:14.420> empire

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
strategy or where there are empire

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.140 
strategy or where there are empire
quests<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.080> reward<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:16.860> building<00:01:17.310> 10

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
quests that reward you for building 10

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050 
quests that reward you for building 10
farms<00:01:18.630> 10<00:01:18.930> mines<00:01:19.200> 10<00:01:19.650> logging<00:01:20.009> camps<00:01:20.430> 10

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
farms 10 mines 10 logging camps 10

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.820 
farms 10 mines 10 logging camps 10
villas<00:01:21.450> 10<00:01:21.689> barracks<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.850> tim<00:01:23.850> kouris<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.830> 10

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
villas 10 barracks and tim kouris and 10

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.600 
villas 10 barracks and tim kouris and 10
I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.509> them<00:01:27.600> so

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
I think that's it that's all of them so

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.080 
I think that's it that's all of them so
but<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.970> want<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.299> balanced<00:01:32.090> economy

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
but if you want a balanced economy

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.520 
but if you want a balanced economy
obviously<00:01:33.509> you're<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:33.960> gonna<00:01:34.049> build<00:01:34.259> ten<00:01:34.409> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
obviously you're not gonna build ten of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.289 
obviously you're not gonna build ten of
them<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.860> there's<00:01:34.979> only<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.400> believe<00:01:35.729> 25

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
them because there's only I believe 25

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.260 
them because there's only I believe 25
so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.350> obviously<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> kind<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
so you obviously have to kind of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.480 
so you obviously have to kind of
prioritize<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> other<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
prioritize one of the other but so I

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.830 
prioritize one of the other but so I
have<00:01:41.759> done<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.030> for<00:01:42.240> all<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.570> except

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
have done this for all of them except

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
have done this for all of them except
for<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> quarries<00:01:43.409> want<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.770> right<00:01:43.920> now<00:01:43.950> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
for the quarries want to do right now is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.649 
for the quarries want to do right now is
build<00:01:44.909> 10<00:01:45.450> quarries<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:47.090> because<00:01:48.090> line<00:01:48.329> 42

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
build 10 quarries so because line 42

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560 
build 10 quarries so because line 42
seconds<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> free<00:01:49.799> upgrade<00:01:50.570> I'm

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
seconds and you get the free upgrade I'm

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.410 
seconds and you get the free upgrade I'm
gonna<00:01:51.689> get<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.079> more<00:01:52.500> quarries<00:01:53.070> going

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.810 

so<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:58.450> have<00:01:58.780> four<00:01:59.109> quarries<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.950> now<00:02:00.399> i<00:02:00.759> am

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
so I have four quarries and now i am

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.400 
so I have four quarries and now i am
lips<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:03.000> didn't<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.090> free<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.960> now<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.410> out

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
lips I didn't it free and now I and out

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.589 
lips I didn't it free and now I and out
of<00:02:08.560> space<00:02:08.769> what<00:02:09.459> do<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.670> well<00:02:10.209> I've<00:02:10.360> got<00:02:10.509> to

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
of space what do I do well I've got to

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.750 
of space what do I do well I've got to
destroy<00:02:10.750> some<00:02:11.470> other<00:02:11.650> buildings<00:02:12.099> or<00:02:12.280> actually

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
destroy some other buildings or actually

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.190 
destroy some other buildings or actually
I<00:02:12.790> have<00:02:13.030> five<00:02:13.239> chords<00:02:13.629> because<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.900> had<00:02:14.019> one

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I have five chords because I had one

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.130 
I have five chords because I had one
from<00:02:14.440> before<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:14.920> didn't<00:02:15.190> destroy<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.110> I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
from before that I didn't destroy so I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.570 
from before that I didn't destroy so I
am<00:02:17.590> going<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.040> destroy<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:19.360> or<00:02:19.810> deconstruct<00:02:20.769> my

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
am going to destroy my or deconstruct my

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.789 
am going to destroy my or deconstruct my
lowest<00:02:22.540> level<00:02:22.900> mines<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:26.019> only<00:02:26.200> costs

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
lowest level mines and it only costs

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.309 
lowest level mines and it only costs
time<00:02:27.129> and<00:02:27.299> a<00:02:28.299> little<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.630> efficiency

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
time and a little bit of efficiency

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.170 
time and a little bit of efficiency
because<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:32.069> can<00:02:33.069> very<00:02:33.280> easily<00:02:33.370> rebuild<00:02:34.030> them

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
because you can very easily rebuild them

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.759 
because you can very easily rebuild them
and<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.720> would<00:02:34.840> just<00:02:34.930> recommend<00:02:35.110> doing<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.560> to

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
and I would just recommend doing this to

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.819 
and I would just recommend doing this to
your<00:02:35.860> lowest<00:02:36.130> level<00:02:37.530> resource<00:02:38.530> gathering

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
your lowest level resource gathering

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.319 
your lowest level resource gathering
tiles<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:41.260> after<00:02:41.380> deconstructing<00:02:42.280> all<00:02:42.489> these

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
tiles so after deconstructing all these

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.259 
tiles so after deconstructing all these
low-level<00:02:43.720> minds<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.099> putting<00:02:45.400> cores<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:46.030> top

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
low-level minds and putting cores on top

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.270 
low-level minds and putting cores on top
of<00:02:46.450> there<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.810> I'm<00:02:50.709> going<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.950> eventually

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
of there and I'm going to eventually

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.440 
of there and I'm going to eventually
replace<00:02:51.670> these<00:02:52.470> destroyed<00:02:53.470> minds<00:02:54.280> with<00:02:55.030> mines

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
replace these destroyed minds with mines

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.819 
replace these destroyed minds with mines
eventually<00:02:56.049> so<00:02:56.230> basically<00:02:56.680> I'm<00:02:56.799> just

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
eventually so basically I'm just

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.340 
eventually so basically I'm just
building<00:02:57.730> these<00:02:58.000> quarries<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:59.049> get<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
building these quarries to get the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.319 
building these quarries to get the
challenge<00:02:59.829> of<00:02:59.920> completing<00:03:00.489> our<00:03:00.609> of<00:03:00.880> creating

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
challenge of completing our of creating

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.990 
challenge of completing our of creating
ten<00:03:01.569> quarries<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.200> then<00:03:03.010> destroying<00:03:03.819> them

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
ten quarries and then destroying them

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.039 
ten quarries and then destroying them
putting<00:03:04.239> them<00:03:04.359> back<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.600> what<00:03:04.720> they<00:03:04.840> should

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
putting them back to what they should

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.479 
putting them back to what they should
have<00:03:05.079> been<00:03:05.170> initially<00:03:05.530> or<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.130> they<00:03:06.280> should

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
have been initially or what they should

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.680 
have been initially or what they should
be

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690

very similar process can be done with uh
let's<00:03:44.060> see<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:45.590> barracks<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.310> hospitals<00:03:46.820> and

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
let's see the barracks the hospitals and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.630 
let's see the barracks the hospitals and
the<00:03:47.030> villas<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:48.290> have<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.530> build<00:03:48.980> ten

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
the villas you have to build ten

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.390 
the villas you have to build ten
barracks<00:03:50.540> ten<00:03:50.930> hospitals<00:03:51.290> in<00:03:51.590> ten<00:03:51.830> villas<00:03:52.190> and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
barracks ten hospitals in ten villas and

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.690 
barracks ten hospitals in ten villas and
then<00:03:53.620> because<00:03:54.620> there's<00:03:54.770> not<00:03:54.860> enough<00:03:54.920> tiles<00:03:55.430> to

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
then because there's not enough tiles to

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.370 
then because there's not enough tiles to
do<00:03:55.880> all<00:03:56.030> that<00:03:56.060> on<00:03:56.240> this<00:03:56.600> space<00:03:56.930> you're<00:03:57.350> going

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
do all that on this space you're going

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.080 
do all that on this space you're going
to<00:03:57.530> destroy<00:03:58.100> them<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.340> replace<00:03:58.790> them<00:03:59.030> with

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
to destroy them and replace them with

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.170 
to destroy them and replace them with
most<00:03:59.630> likely<00:03:59.960> villas<00:04:00.380> as<00:04:00.590> well<00:04:00.800> so<00:04:01.460> I<00:04:01.730> would

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
most likely villas as well so I would

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.410 
most likely villas as well so I would
have<00:04:02.330> won<00:04:02.690> Academy<00:04:03.140> 14<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.160> after<00:04:04.700> going

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
have won Academy 14 so after going

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.700 
have won Academy 14 so after going
through<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.840> building<00:04:06.290> 10<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.650> then

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
through this building 10 and then

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.440 
through this building 10 and then
destroying<00:04:07.070> and<00:04:07.250> replacing<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.790> process<00:04:08.240> I

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
destroying and replacing the process I

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.310 
destroying and replacing the process I
would<00:04:09.200> recommend<00:04:09.320> having<00:04:10.180> um<00:04:11.180> i<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:12.020> three
