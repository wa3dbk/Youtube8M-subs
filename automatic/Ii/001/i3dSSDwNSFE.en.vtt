00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.260 

hey<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:01.829> I'm<00:00:02.340> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> show<00:00:02.760> you<00:00:02.790> how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.000> do

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey so I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.499 
hey so I'm going to show you how to do
some<00:00:03.600> easy<00:00:03.990> auto<00:00:04.319> leveling<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.859> FFT<00:00:05.310> so<00:00:06.150> the

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
some easy auto leveling and FFT so the

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.360 
some easy auto leveling and FFT so the
setup<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.049> usually<00:00:07.410> come<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.560> mendala<00:00:07.980> Plains

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
setup is usually come to mendala Plains

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.250 
setup is usually come to mendala Plains
because<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.300> easy<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.690> calculate

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
because it's really easy to calculate

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.480 
because it's really easy to calculate
the<00:00:10.620> height<00:00:11.570> prime<00:00:12.920> calculations<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.040> make<00:00:14.160> do

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the height prime calculations to make do

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.790 
the height prime calculations to make do
a<00:00:14.519> lot<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.730> frog<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.179> toting<00:00:15.570> since<00:00:15.929> basically

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
a lot of frog in toting since basically

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.620 
a lot of frog in toting since basically
you<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:16.920> need<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.400> two<00:00:17.640> or<00:00:18.119> three

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
you just need them on two or three

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.900 
you just need them on two or three
thirty<00:00:19.350> threes<00:00:19.650> but<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.250> lot<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.460> -<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
thirty threes but just a lot of - and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150 
thirty threes but just a lot of - and
other<00:00:21.150> people<00:00:21.449> won't<00:00:21.539> get<00:00:21.720> hit<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.890> just

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
other people won't get hit so you just

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.839 
other people won't get hit so you just
leave<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:23.519> bad<00:00:23.760> guy<00:00:24.029> laughs<00:00:24.269> frog<00:00:25.080> them<00:00:25.849> break

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
leave one bad guy laughs frog them break

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.849 
leave one bad guy laughs frog them break
is<00:00:27.000> tak-tek<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.140> one<00:00:28.400> speed<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> one<00:00:30.859> power

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
is tak-tek is one speed is one power

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.110 
is tak-tek is one speed is one power
break<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.340> own<00:00:32.460> guys<00:00:33.380> that<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
break your own guys that one I

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.430 
break your own guys that one I
accidentally<00:00:36.120> left<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:38.120> Hydra<00:00:39.120> bag<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.899> her<00:00:40.050> but

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
accidentally left a Hydra bag on her but

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
accidentally left a Hydra bag on her but
regardless<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.430> low<00:00:41.610> attack<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.090> basically

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
regardless it's low attack so basically

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.850 
regardless it's low attack so basically
just<00:00:46.550> arithmetics<00:00:47.550> height<00:00:47.940> prime<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.620> towed

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
just arithmetics height prime and towed

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:11.359 
just arithmetics height prime and towed
them

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.770 

seven<00:01:12.369> white<00:01:12.549> there<00:01:12.820> because<00:01:13.299> got<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.479> buzzer

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
seven white there because got a buzzer

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.230 
seven white there because got a buzzer
come<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.460> they<00:01:15.640> might<00:01:15.820> as<00:01:15.880> well<00:01:15.939> just<00:01:16.030> move

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
come so they might as well just move

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.969 
come so they might as well just move
your<00:01:16.420> other<00:01:16.810> guys<00:01:17.049> up<00:01:17.500> on<00:01:17.680> this<00:01:17.830> before

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
your other guys up on this before

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:37.440 
your other guys up on this before
platform<00:01:25.049> quiz<00:01:26.049> Erica

so<00:01:53.770> now<00:01:53.890> there's<00:01:54.070> going<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.250> go<00:01:54.369> attack<00:01:54.640> the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
so now there's going to go attack the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.230 
so now there's going to go attack the
computer<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:56.200> we<00:01:56.380> use<00:01:56.500> doing<00:01:56.829> anything<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
computer that we use doing anything so

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.639 
computer that we use doing anything so
have<00:01:58.390> your<00:01:58.539> other<00:01:58.659> two<00:01:58.810> guys<00:01:58.960> at<00:01:59.200> this<00:01:59.350> four

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
have your other two guys at this four

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.249 
have your other two guys at this four
level<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.460> go

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.570 

so<00:02:08.259> we'll<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.619> have<00:02:08.709> fun<00:02:09.009> attacking<00:02:09.429> that

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
so we'll just have fun attacking that

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.690 
so we'll just have fun attacking that
guy<00:02:09.700> over<00:02:09.849> and<00:02:10.000> over<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.269> get<00:02:10.420> JP<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:12.160> for<00:02:12.580> your

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
guy over and over and get JP so for your

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.979 
guy over and over and get JP so for your
other<00:02:12.849> people<00:02:13.300> what<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.540> want<00:02:13.599> to<00:02:13.810> do<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:13.930> you

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
other people what you want to do is you

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.199 
other people what you want to do is you
want<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.200> stone<00:02:14.470> one<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:15.940> having<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
want to stone one so just having the

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.890 
want to stone one so just having the
height<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.480> multiple<00:02:16.840> four<00:02:18.599> turn<00:02:19.599> them<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
height of multiple four turn them to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:45.470 
height of multiple four turn them to
stone

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.460 

probably<00:02:46.480> get<00:02:46.570> yourself<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:46.960> on<00:02:47.110> this<00:02:47.230> three

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
probably get yourself up on this three

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.750 
probably get yourself up on this three
platform<00:02:48.060> then<00:02:49.060> basically<00:02:49.980> afterwards<00:02:50.980> cast

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
platform then basically afterwards cast

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.030 
platform then basically afterwards cast
don't<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.570> height<00:02:52.900> three<00:02:53.230> stones<00:02:53.770> throw

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
don't the height three stones throw

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.760 
don't the height three stones throw
yourself<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.210> just<00:02:55.750> let<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.020> bill<00:02:56.230> on

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
yourself and then just let it bill on

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.450 
yourself and then just let it bill on
yourself<00:02:57.310> that's<00:02:58.270> it
