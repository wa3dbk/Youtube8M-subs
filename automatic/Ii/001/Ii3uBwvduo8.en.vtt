00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.520
 hello guys I'm gabi very well let's see the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.959
 ms 60 I'm so glad to see this weapon of 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.270
 back because it's always been 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.279
 characterized by giving a touch of 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.699
 domination and power in the field of 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.310
 battle 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.890
 clear when you compare it against others 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.230
 light machine guns but let's see how 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.240
 get it to unlock the need 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.119
 complete the devil's mission of dust 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.790
 and for this you need first place 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.180
 keep up with health be level 10 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.969
 have a gallon anti vehicle and this one 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.340
 get to destroy two vehicles in addition 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.710
 to eliminate five vehicles on the map 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.809
 from gulf of oman can destroy it how 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.829
 It hits you want with a helicopter 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.440
 as an engineer by 11-4 with another tank 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.890
 as you want and can be any 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.260
 vehicle from jeeps to boats all 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.079
 this matters to me if you do it in one 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.960
 round or can not be spaced so 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.030
 if you want to take your time and well 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.150
 that you have it you will see that you have a look 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.390
 iron absolutely frightening and that 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.670
 it will cost you a little work to kill 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.610
 but everything will improve when you have 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.830
 first look what is the holographic and 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.200
 here the magic begins you'll see that 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.380
 as you use it, you will notice things 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.810
 interesting and that is machine gun 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.000
 light is completely different to all 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.160
 what you have tried in the first 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.140
 instance chicken and I think that already 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.750
 we had tried something similar the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.970
 We felt like the picnic and decided to see 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.610
 the statistics we realized that 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.070
 they are practically the same but with the 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.280
 difference that the m60 is substantially 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.610
 better than the app and chemistry has lower 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 dispersion your bullets travel further to 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.220
 this we add that it has a cadence 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.830
 of 570 bullets per minute which means 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.259
 which is the slowest light machine gun 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.590
 of the whole game but it has a damage of 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:09.780
 34 points to 8 meters and 25 points 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:14.170
 up to 75 meters if you listened well 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.510
 25 points to 75 meters this is amazing 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.459
 because it tells us that this weapon will be a 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.780
 little limit in closed spaces by the 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.240
 cadence like 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.850
 in other videos if there is someone with a 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.800
 biggest cadence weapon simply 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.530
 will lose the battle unless you are 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.090
 someone super precise and I managed to give a 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.840
 shot in the head and another in the chest 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.880
 which could not happen very often 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.590
 but when you change to medium distances 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.170
 you realize it's like a knife 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.569
 hot in butter simply 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.340
 goes through absolutely everything that is 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.400
 in sight but there is a detail 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.580
 important you have to watch the backspace 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.019
 although it is a setback that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.860
 apparently it's quite strong and that 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.959
 kick everywhere is not all bad 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 there is a law in vargas that tells us to 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.620
 Higher rate of cumulative regression 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.069
 it's worse but here's a detail 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.450
 interesting the cadence returns 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.660
 basically in one the negative effect of 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.840
 reprocess in this weapon you ask 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.390
 why good the cadence is low what 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.640
 It means that between bullet and bullet has 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.739
 a longer time of rest that the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.739
 opportunity to recover faster 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.870
 good as long as you shoot with a 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.290
 adequate technique but if you want to be the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.450
 plus 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.840
 within the control you will have to try 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.519
 go for very leisurely shots something that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.159
 it's not my micro bursts 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.379
 we are talking about maximum two shots 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:40.359
 at one time or from an inclusive bullet per bullet 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.129
 because this will give time to the weapon of 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.819
 rest between the shots and the 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.560
 you'll come back incredibly stable so 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.319
 Every time you meet the enemy 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.810
 you'll have to think about that same shot 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.109
 per shot does not exceed the limit and you will see 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.030
 that simply fall like clear flies 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.340
 has 100 bullets available in the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.560
 charger but be careful because by very 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.930
 exciting is all this will come the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.060
 moment that you have to recharge and that 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.939
 recharge is the slowest of the entire game 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.739
 are 7.8 seconds of eternity that 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.739
 you will have to be protected for 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.599
 avoid being like a duck in the water and 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.269
 well we can see two configurations 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.489
 for the weapon given that this weapon 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.039
 It really is bad in close encounters 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.169
 then we will avoid the laser because 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.120
 It is true that you have it, you know that 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.099
 the high-cadence weapons are going to 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.740
 destroy and the laser will give you away 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.280
 distance so let's prepare the weapon 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.620
 for me 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.889
 the distances we have several ways that 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.290
 they have to do with shooting style 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.450
 if you stop and shoot the enemy 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.790
 then your best option is the ace 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.490
 angled and the muzzle brake this for 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.889
 be more stable the weapon the angle handle 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.600
 reduces the recoil of the first shot and 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.790
 the muzzle brake also reduces the 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.130
 vertical process but if you feel that 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.560
 you can link more bullets giving a 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.690
 slightly longer burst could you 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.450
 change the thick handle to prevent 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.220
 have more dispersion in your shots if 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.169
 you are a person who when shooting 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.419
 moves laterally while 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.220
 face the enemy then your best 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.470
 option is the muzzle brake and in the 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.510
 economic will improve your aim in 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.090
 movement and it will not rise as much to the 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.400
 be firing though to be honest 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.350
 in these two modes we do not worry 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.050
 much for the dispersion since we will be 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.240
 shooting practically bullet by bullet and 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.790
 will not give the gun time to take that 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.479
 Negative aspect will simply remain 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.520
 neutralized try it as we say and 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:39.280
 You will see that this weapon could be better 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.920
 than any rifle td or dmr 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.300
 like a butcher's knife 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.730
 destroying skin and muscle for everyone 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.730
 sides is simply one of the best 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:52.570
 if not the best to ml of all the 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.930
 fire the 124 do not cry but it's the 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.639
 true so keep this data in mind 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.610
 gives the right space between 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.860
 shots and manages to control it at the moment 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.730
 in which you achieve it you will see that it is a 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.040
 damn demon for curiosities or me 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.340
 It manages to be very good work with a measure 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.950
 3.5 so I recommend you to 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.530
 occupy that place the laser put the 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.480
 look at 2 x for those faraway enemies 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.780
 that with the tac tac tac tac tac 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.060
 shot will fall like flies and good 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.530
 guys that was our guide and 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.880
 recommendations of the m 60 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.950
 remember to comment in the area of 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.110
 comments how it was and what was it 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.180
 they used guys remember to subscribe 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.760
 to the channel if they are not we have networks 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.560
 Facebook social networks and twitter am gabi 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.560
 and I say goodbye with a kiss 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:14.169
 I'm a friend of mine, I want to make my friend 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:14.169
 mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
