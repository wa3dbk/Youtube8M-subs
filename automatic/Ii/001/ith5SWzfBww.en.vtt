container all stainless steel blade

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
container all stainless steel blade
design<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:36.030> as<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> propeller<00:00:36.960> blade<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.230> like

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
design and as a propeller blade I like

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
design and as a propeller blade I like
the<00:00:37.559> propeller<00:00:37.890> blade<00:00:38.190> because<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.030> basically

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the propeller blade because it basically

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.600 
the propeller blade because it basically
allow<00:00:39.899> us<00:00:40.050> produce<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.530> drop<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
allow us produce to drop in and then the

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
allow us produce to drop in and then the
propeller<00:00:41.969> blade<00:00:42.180> comes<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.570> hit<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> so

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
propeller blade comes and hit it so

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
propeller blade comes and hit it so
things<00:00:43.590> don't<00:00:43.739> necessarily<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.030> top

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
things don't necessarily right up on top

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.060 
things don't necessarily right up on top
and<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:46.050> blended<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.590> definitely<00:00:46.980> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and not get blended so definitely a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
and not get blended so definitely a
really<00:00:47.640> good<00:00:47.910> design<00:00:48.210> let's<00:00:48.780> go<00:00:48.930> over<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
really good design let's go over the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040 
really good design let's go over the
base<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:49.829> quick<00:00:50.899> some<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
base here really quick some of the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.689 
base here really quick some of the
features<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> basis<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> she<00:00:53.219> has<00:00:53.340> cord

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
features on the basis that she has cord

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.100 
features on the basis that she has cord
storage<00:00:53.969> built<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.719> bottom<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
storage built into the bottom of the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.950 
storage built into the bottom of the
base<00:00:55.289> has<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> rubber<00:00:56.309> feet<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.820> nice<00:00:57.390> cooling

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
base has a rubber feet a nice cooling

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.110 
base has a rubber feet a nice cooling
fan<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.739> blender<00:00:59.609> base<00:00:59.730> has<00:00:59.940> some

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
fan in it this blender base has some

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.060 
fan in it this blender base has some
nice<00:01:00.270> weight<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.020> another<00:01:01.680> feature<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
nice weight to it another feature I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.060 
nice weight to it another feature I
really<00:01:02.460> like<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.439> has<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> reset

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
really like is a the back it has a reset

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100 
really like is a the back it has a reset
button<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.549> other<00:01:05.729> blenders<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.479> this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
button and other blenders in this

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.700 
button and other blenders in this
category<00:01:07.830> don't<00:01:08.700> exactly<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.290> reset

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
category don't exactly have this reset

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.890 
category don't exactly have this reset
button<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:10.979> example<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.580> Vitamix<00:01:12.090> basically

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
button for example the Vitamix basically

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.330 
button for example the Vitamix basically
if<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.049> overheats<00:01:13.350> it'll<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.979> shut<00:01:14.189> itself

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
if it overheats it'll just shut itself

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.700 
if it overheats it'll just shut itself
off<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> won't<00:01:15.479> work<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.320> basically<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
off and it won't work it's basically a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
off and it won't work it's basically a
thermal<00:01:17.130> overload<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.390> basically

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
thermal overload in there it basically

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
thermal overload in there it basically
won't<00:01:19.049> work<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.439> another<00:01:19.619> half<00:01:19.920> hour<00:01:20.130> an<00:01:20.369> hour

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
won't work for another half hour an hour

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.730 
won't work for another half hour an hour
until<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:21.000> cools<00:01:21.240> itself<00:01:21.509> off<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.930> always<00:01:22.560> for

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
until it cools itself off and always for

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.109 
until it cools itself off and always for
fun<00:01:22.920> when<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.220> happens<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.610> my<00:01:23.700> Vitamix

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
fun when that happens in my Vitamix

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640 
fun when that happens in my Vitamix
actually<00:01:24.360> put<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> freezer<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.619> chill

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
actually put it in the freezer to chill

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
actually put it in the freezer to chill
out<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.790> mean<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
out if you know what I mean and then it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
out if you know what I mean and then it
will<00:01:27.720> actually<00:01:27.810> start<00:01:28.110> working<00:01:28.170> faster<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
will actually start working faster and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
will actually start working faster and
when<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.100> gets<00:01:29.189> cold<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> omega<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
when it gets cold but with the omega you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.090 
when it gets cold but with the omega you
won't<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.259> problem<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.799> leave

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
won't have that problem you just leave

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.429 
won't have that problem you just leave
pop<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:32.549> back<00:01:32.759> in<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.180> you're<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
pop this back in and you're up and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.380 
pop this back in and you're up and
running<00:01:34.740> again<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> difference<00:01:36.180> between

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
running again so the difference between

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
running again so the difference between
the<00:01:36.900> three<00:01:37.140> different<00:01:37.290> models<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:38.070> basically

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the three different models are basically

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
the three different models are basically
the<00:01:38.939> controls<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.720> front<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.140> all<00:01:40.290> have

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the controls on the front they all have

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.980 
the controls on the front they all have
the<00:01:40.560> same<00:01:40.740> exact<00:01:41.130> 2<00:01:41.369> horsepower<00:01:41.880> motor<00:01:42.420> but

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the same exact 2 horsepower motor but

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.630 
the same exact 2 horsepower motor but
the<00:01:43.079> control<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.740> different<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the control is a bit different so the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
the control is a bit different so the
controls<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.299> winter's<00:01:45.600> basically<00:01:45.960> have

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
controls on this winter's basically have

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.830 
controls on this winter's basically have
an<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.619> off<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.220> hyna<00:01:47.520> low<00:01:47.790> very<00:01:48.420> simple

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
an on and off and a hyna low very simple

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
an on and off and a hyna low very simple
and<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.020> easy<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and very easy to use this would be the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550 
and very easy to use this would be the
entry<00:01:50.670> level<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.299> as<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.720> go<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
entry level so as you go up in the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
entry level so as you go up in the
features<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.460> go<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.090> price<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
features they go up in price but you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.819 
features they go up in price but you
know<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.170> they're<00:01:55.290> basically<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> same

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
know but they're basically the same

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
know but they're basically the same
machine<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.210> extra

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
machine is just do you want these extra

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.870 
machine is just do you want these extra
features<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.320> personally<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.399> next<00:01:59.729> one

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
features I personally like this next one

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
features I personally like this next one
right<00:02:00.030> here<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.960> favorite<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.860> has

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
right here it's my favorite it has

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
right here it's my favorite it has
basically<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.460> pulse<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:04.380> has<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
basically a pulse and it also has a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.469 
basically a pulse and it also has a
variable<00:02:05.040> speed<00:02:05.460> control<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.180> ramp

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
variable speed control so you can ramp

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.779 
variable speed control so you can ramp
up<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.659> speed<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.259> then<00:02:07.950> an<00:02:08.069> on-off<00:02:08.489> switch

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
up your speed and then an on-off switch

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.809 
up your speed and then an on-off switch
and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> top<00:02:09.360> line<00:02:09.660> model<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.140> be<00:02:10.319> 2500<00:02:11.310> model

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and the top line model to be 2500 model

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.360 
and the top line model to be 2500 model
has<00:02:12.180> basically<00:02:12.749> a<00:02:12.870> built-in<00:02:13.650> timer<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.249> this

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
has basically a built-in timer so this

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.280 
has basically a built-in timer so this
will<00:02:14.519> automatically<00:02:15.060> shut<00:02:15.390> itself<00:02:15.450> off<00:02:15.930> after

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
will automatically shut itself off after

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.619 
will automatically shut itself off after
a<00:02:16.499> predetermined<00:02:16.950> amount<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.670> time<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.299> also

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
a predetermined amount of time it also

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.780 
a predetermined amount of time it also
has<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:18.959> variable<00:02:19.439> speed<00:02:19.650> control<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.249> that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
has that variable speed control and that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.179 
has that variable speed control and that
on/off<00:02:21.420> switch<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.439> they<00:02:22.560> all<00:02:22.739> operate<00:02:22.889> the

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
on/off switch so they all operate the

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.239 
on/off switch so they all operate the
same<00:02:23.370> they<00:02:23.519> have<00:02:23.639> exactly<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.150> same<00:02:24.269> craft

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:25.249 
same they have exactly the same craft

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.619 
same they have exactly the same craft
and<00:02:26.249> today<00:02:26.879> what<00:02:27.030> I'm<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.269> show<00:02:27.359> you<00:02:27.450> is

and today what I'm going to show you is
one<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:27.959> blender<00:02:28.439> torture<00:02:28.920> tests<00:02:29.459> what<00:02:29.939> I

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
one of my blender torture tests what I

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.819 
one of my blender torture tests what I
like<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.269> do<00:02:30.389> on<00:02:30.420> blenders<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.959> really<00:02:31.260> working

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
like to do on blenders is really working

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.410 
like to do on blenders is really working
out<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.250> put<00:02:32.459> them<00:02:32.549> through<00:02:32.700> their<00:02:32.730> their

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
out and put them through their their

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.240 
out and put them through their their
hardest<00:02:33.870> jobs<00:02:34.230> that<00:02:34.379> they'll<00:02:34.530> ever<00:02:34.709> do<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
hardest jobs that they'll ever do and

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.979 
hardest jobs that they'll ever do and
here's<00:02:35.519> one<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.849> them<00:02:35.969> so<00:02:36.480> what<00:02:36.599> I<00:02:36.629> have<00:02:36.840> today

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
here's one of them so what I have today

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.860 
here's one of them so what I have today
is<00:02:37.139> I<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.409> some<00:02:37.620> whole<00:02:38.189> flax<00:02:38.730> seeds<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.540> flax

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
is I have some whole flax seeds now flax

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.569 
is I have some whole flax seeds now flax
seeds<00:02:40.079> are<00:02:40.200> really<00:02:40.409> high<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:40.680> omega-3<00:02:41.370> fatty

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
seeds are really high in omega-3 fatty

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.729 
seeds are really high in omega-3 fatty
acids<00:02:42.060> they're<00:02:42.480> really<00:02:42.689> healthy<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.290> us<00:02:43.530> and

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
acids they're really healthy for us and

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.619 
acids they're really healthy for us and
really<00:02:43.799> good<00:02:44.250> most<00:02:44.700> people<00:02:44.969> don't<00:02:45.180> eat<00:02:45.419> enough

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
really good most people don't eat enough

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.659 
really good most people don't eat enough
omega-3<00:02:45.840> fatty<00:02:46.560> acids<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.069> that's<00:02:47.189> why<00:02:47.310> flax

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
omega-3 fatty acids and that's why flax

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.879 
omega-3 fatty acids and that's why flax
seeds<00:02:47.939> are<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.299> beneficial<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.680> problem

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
seeds are so beneficial but the problem

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.429 
seeds are so beneficial but the problem
is<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.250> flax<00:02:50.549> seeds<00:02:50.819> are<00:02:50.939> so<00:02:51.209> hard<00:02:51.659> if<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.290> just

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
is the flax seeds are so hard if we just

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.750 
is the flax seeds are so hard if we just
put<00:02:52.620> these<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.859> our<00:02:52.949> mouth<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.129> try<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> chew

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
put these in our mouth and try to chew

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.189 
put these in our mouth and try to chew
them<00:02:53.879> up<00:02:53.969> you<00:02:54.389> know<00:02:54.510> we'd<00:02:54.659> probably<00:02:54.870> swell

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
them up you know we'd probably swell

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.869 
them up you know we'd probably swell
them<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:55.590> then<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:55.859> literally<00:02:56.310> see<00:02:56.549> them<00:02:56.639> come

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
them and then we literally see them come

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.189 
them and then we literally see them come
out<00:02:56.969> the<00:02:57.150> other<00:02:57.239> end<00:02:57.359> and<00:02:57.629> when<00:02:58.079> they're

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:58.199 
out the other end and when they're

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.599 
out the other end and when they're
coming<00:02:58.439> out<00:02:58.500> hold<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.919> other<00:02:59.040> end<00:02:59.099> guess<00:02:59.430> what

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
coming out hold the other end guess what

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.280 
coming out hold the other end guess what
you're<00:02:59.760> not<00:02:59.790> getting<00:03:00.150> any<00:03:00.540> nutrition<00:03:01.109> out<00:03:01.260> of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
you're not getting any nutrition out of

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.349 
you're not getting any nutrition out of
that<00:03:01.469> so<00:03:01.949> we<00:03:02.040> need<00:03:02.189> to<00:03:02.310> break<00:03:02.639> up<00:03:02.669> these<00:03:03.000> flax

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
that so we need to break up these flax

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.420 
that so we need to break up these flax
seeds<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.840> blender<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.859> a<00:03:04.889> great<00:03:05.219> way<00:03:05.370> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
seeds and the blender is a great way to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.830 
seeds and the blender is a great way to
do<00:03:05.639> just<00:03:05.669> that<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.389> we're<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.659> go<00:03:06.810> ahead

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
do just that so we're going to go ahead

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
do just that so we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:07.079> take<00:03:07.260> off<00:03:07.439> this<00:03:07.650> top<00:03:07.949> here<00:03:08.250> dump<00:03:08.969> in<00:03:09.120> these

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
and take off this top here dump in these

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.530 
and take off this top here dump in these
flexees<00:03:11.659> put<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.750> top<00:03:12.959> back<00:03:12.989> on<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:14.540> we're

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
flexees put the top back on and we're

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.759 
flexees put the top back on and we're
going<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.689> turn<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.049> blender<00:03:16.199> on<00:03:16.379> I'm<00:03:16.650> going

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
going to turn the blender on I'm going

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.499 
going to turn the blender on I'm going
to<00:03:16.859> start<00:03:17.069> off<00:03:17.159> on<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.400> low<00:03:17.669> speed<00:03:17.729> first<00:03:18.299> you

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:18.509 
to start off on a low speed first you

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.449 
to start off on a low speed first you
can<00:03:18.629> see<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.470> know<00:03:19.560> how<00:03:19.769> it's<00:03:19.949> running<00:03:20.159> and

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
can see you know how it's running and

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.649 
can see you know how it's running and
then<00:03:20.519> we're<00:03:20.669> just<00:03:20.699> going<00:03:20.939> to<00:03:21.000> crank<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.479> up<00:03:21.599> to

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
then we're just going to crank it up to

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.360 
then we're just going to crank it up to
the<00:03:21.840> high<00:03:22.049> speed<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.799> we're<00:03:23.040> going<00:03:23.159> to<00:03:23.189> see

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
the high speed and we're going to see

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.699 
the high speed and we're going to see
these<00:03:23.489> whole<00:03:24.000> flax<00:03:24.389> seeds<00:03:24.659> literally<00:03:25.500> get

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
these whole flax seeds literally get

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.179 
these whole flax seeds literally get
Paul<00:03:26.069> rise<00:03:26.370> into<00:03:26.729> flax<00:03:27.180> meal<00:03:28.139> right<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:28.919> front

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
Paul rise into flax meal right in front

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.289 
Paul rise into flax meal right in front
your<00:03:29.340> eyes<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.669> let's<00:03:29.819> go<00:03:29.939> ahead<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.269> that

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
your eyes so let's go ahead and do that

your eyes so let's go ahead and do that
real<00:03:30.599> quick<00:03:30.629> turn<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.590> on<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.430> that's<00:03:32.609> running

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
real quick turn it on so that's running

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.909 
real quick turn it on so that's running
at<00:03:33.030> low<00:03:33.239> speed<00:03:33.569> barely<00:03:34.139> spinning<00:03:34.590> them<00:03:34.680> around

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
at low speed barely spinning them around

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:43.790 
at low speed barely spinning them around
but<00:03:35.549> watch<00:03:35.759> this<00:03:36.030> will<00:03:36.239> crank<00:03:36.509> it<00:03:36.689> up<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.810> high

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.850 

countering<00:03:44.800> those<00:03:45.070> buggers<00:03:45.460> yeah

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.780 

alright<00:03:51.860> so<00:03:52.069> we'll<00:03:52.160> go<00:03:52.310> ahead<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.489> turn<00:03:52.670> it

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
alright so we'll go ahead and turn it

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.850 
alright so we'll go ahead and turn it
off<00:03:52.879> it<00:03:53.060> was<00:03:53.150> just<00:03:53.540> done<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:53.810> quick<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.650> that

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
off it was just done that quick and that

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.650 
off it was just done that quick and that
easy<00:03:55.190> we're<00:03:55.790> going<00:03:55.879> to<00:03:55.970> go<00:03:56.060> ahead<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.269> dwell

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
easy we're going to go ahead and dwell

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.449 
easy we're going to go ahead and dwell
that's<00:03:57.080> actually<00:03:57.349> a<00:03:57.560> really<00:03:57.620> good<00:03:57.890> job<00:03:58.220> that

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
that's actually a really good job that

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.699 
that's actually a really good job that
actually<00:03:58.489> does<00:03:58.879> better<00:03:59.180> than<00:03:59.239> my<00:03:59.450> Vitamix<00:04:00.080> so

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
actually does better than my Vitamix so

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.280 
actually does better than my Vitamix so
look<00:04:00.890> at<00:04:00.980> this<00:04:01.010> that's<00:04:01.700> nice<00:04:02.060> flax<00:04:02.510> meal<00:04:02.720> this

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
look at this that's nice flax meal this

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.320 
look at this that's nice flax meal this
is<00:04:03.470> really<00:04:03.680> easily<00:04:04.190> digestible<00:04:04.849> now<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.209> the

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
is really easily digestible now that the

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.259 
is really easily digestible now that the
shells<00:04:05.629> off<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.230> other<00:04:06.379> thing<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:06.590> once<00:04:06.950> you

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
shells off the other thing is once you

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.850 
shells off the other thing is once you
grind<00:04:08.269> these<00:04:08.420> up<00:04:08.630> into<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.900> powder<00:04:09.200> like<00:04:09.560> this

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
grind these up into a powder like this

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.800 
grind these up into a powder like this
you<00:04:10.430> need<00:04:10.580> to<00:04:10.730> use<00:04:10.970> this<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.450> know<00:04:11.540> within<00:04:11.690> the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
you need to use this you know within the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.300 
you need to use this you know within the
next<00:04:12.019> couple<00:04:12.170> days<00:04:12.590> if<00:04:12.769> not<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:13.099> need<00:04:13.190> to

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
next couple days if not you need to

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.620 
next couple days if not you need to
store<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.580> in<00:04:13.640> an<00:04:13.730> airtight<00:04:13.880> container<00:04:14.209> in

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
store it in an airtight container in

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.360 
store it in an airtight container in
your<00:04:14.780> fridge<00:04:15.050> and<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.620> definitely<00:04:15.890> use<00:04:16.220> it

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
your fridge and I definitely use it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.219 
your fridge and I definitely use it
within<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.700> week<00:04:16.910> once<00:04:17.329> you<00:04:17.690> break<00:04:17.900> this<00:04:18.049> open

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
within a week once you break this open

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:19.930 
within a week once you break this open
basically<00:04:18.680> you're<00:04:18.799> allowing<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.250> oxygen<00:04:19.820> to

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
basically you're allowing the oxygen to

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.480 
basically you're allowing the oxygen to
hit<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:20.989> know<00:04:21.079> omega-3<00:04:21.709> fatty<00:04:21.950> acids<00:04:22.370> and

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
hit the you know omega-3 fatty acids and

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.219 
hit the you know omega-3 fatty acids and
that's<00:04:22.669> what<00:04:23.060> oxidizes<00:04:23.720> so<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:23.900> want<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.110> use

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
that's what oxidizes so we want to use

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.590 
that's what oxidizes so we want to use
this<00:04:24.350> as<00:04:24.530> quickly<00:04:25.280> as<00:04:25.490> possible<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.180> i'll
