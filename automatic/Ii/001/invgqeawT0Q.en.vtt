00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
shelf chatbots

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.620 
shelf chatbots
and<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:20.400> were<00:00:20.520> running<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:20.970> our<00:00:21.119> laptops

and we were running it on our laptops
for<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> different<00:00:22.500> project<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.699> were

for a different project and we were

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.250 
for a different project and we were
curious<00:00:24.000> about<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.750> happened<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.080> we

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
curious about what would happened if we

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.980 
curious about what would happened if we
just<00:00:25.470> put<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.160> laptops<00:00:26.430> together<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.359> let

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
just put these laptops together and let

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.349 
just put these laptops together and let
them<00:00:28.080> talk<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.380> each<00:00:28.560> other<00:00:29.060> so<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.330> a

but<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.690> am<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> robot

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
but I am a robot

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.660 
but I am a robot
yes<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.420> cleverbot<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.340> available<00:00:41.340> online

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
yes I know cleverbot is available online

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.330 
yes I know cleverbot is available online
it's<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.030> chat<00:00:42.239> bot<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.719> based<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.340> previous

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
it's a chat bot that's based on previous

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's a chat bot that's based on previous
conversations<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> has<00:00:45.510> had<00:00:45.719> with

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
conversations that it has had with

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.430 
conversations that it has had with
humans

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
humans

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.779 
humans
so<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.710> actually<00:00:46.829> been<00:00:47.070> online<00:00:47.219> since<00:00:47.430> uh

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
so it's actually been online since uh

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.110 
so it's actually been online since uh
since<00:00:48.469> 1997<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> since<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> believe<00:00:50.969> it's

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
since 1997 and since then I believe it's

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
since 1997 and since then I believe it's
had<00:00:51.270> over<00:00:51.480> 65<00:00:52.079> million<00:00:52.410> conversations<00:00:52.770> with

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
had over 65 million conversations with

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.819 
had over 65 million conversations with
humans<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.930> during<00:00:54.930> these<00:00:55.020> conversations<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
humans and during these conversations is

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
humans and during these conversations is
essentially<00:00:56.340> learning<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:56.969> people<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
essentially learning what people like to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.580 
essentially learning what people like to
talk<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.039> our<00:00:59.219> theory<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.730> that

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
talk about so so our theory is that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
talk about so so our theory is that
often<00:01:01.590> when<00:01:01.739> people<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.309> lines<00:01:02.550> talking

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
often when people are on lines talking

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
often when people are on lines talking
to<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.270> chat<00:01:03.539> bot<00:01:04.129> they<00:01:05.129> themselves<00:01:05.339> are

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to this chat bot they themselves are

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.770 
to this chat bot they themselves are
fairly<00:01:06.119> argumentative<00:01:07.020> together<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.189> reports

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
fairly argumentative together in reports

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
fairly argumentative together in reports
I'm<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> robot<00:01:10.470> I'm<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.700> unicorn<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.450> you
