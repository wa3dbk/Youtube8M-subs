00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
I think it's a bottom one maybe it's the

I think it's a bottom one maybe it's the
one<00:01:52.240> every<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.509> don't<00:01:52.689> know<00:01:52.840> there's<00:01:53.079> some<00:01:53.259> hint

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
one every I don't know there's some hint

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:01.340 
one every I don't know there's some hint
somewhere<00:01:56.969> if<00:01:57.969> it's<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.209> top<00:01:58.420> one<00:01:59.549> dang<00:02:00.549> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
somewhere if it's the top one dang it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.039 
somewhere if it's the top one dang it
no<00:02:02.350> wonder<00:02:02.649> if<00:02:02.740> it's<00:02:02.890> even<00:02:03.219> like<00:02:03.750> same<00:02:04.750> or

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
no wonder if it's even like same or

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.660 
no wonder if it's even like same or
anything<00:02:05.259> I<00:02:05.500> don't<00:02:05.679> know<00:02:05.799> what<00:02:06.459> if<00:02:06.549> it's

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
anything I don't know what if it's

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.330 
anything I don't know what if it's
random

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.460 

does<00:02:13.340> waste<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.790> lot<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.000> time<00:02:14.120> though<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:15.080> I

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
does waste a lot of time though so I

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.620 
does waste a lot of time though so I
can't<00:02:15.920> really<00:02:16.040> mess<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.490> too<00:02:16.820> much<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.330> thought

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
can't really mess up too much I thought

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.850 
can't really mess up too much I thought
maybe<00:02:17.810> I'd<00:02:18.290> be<00:02:18.410> lucky<00:02:21.610> here<00:02:22.610> we<00:02:22.700> go

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.670 

we're<00:02:25.340> supposed<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.550> go<00:02:25.700> faster<00:02:26.210> though<00:02:26.680> come

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
we're supposed to go faster though come

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.730
