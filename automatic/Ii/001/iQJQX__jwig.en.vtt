00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
have been revealed we have two new

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
have been revealed we have two new
resonator<00:00:18.210> monsters<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.840> were<00:00:18.960> revealed

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
resonator monsters that were revealed

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
resonator monsters that were revealed
and<00:00:19.619> then<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> new<00:00:20.039> form<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.460> red<00:00:20.640> dragon

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and then a new form to red dragon

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.580 
and then a new form to red dragon
Archfiend<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.420> knew<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.810> guess<00:00:22.230> sort<00:00:22.470> of

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
Archfiend like I knew I guess sort of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.779 
Archfiend like I knew I guess sort of
level<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> seems<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.490> heaps

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
level up because it seems like heaps

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.099 
level up because it seems like heaps
getting<00:00:24.060> new<00:00:24.150> forms<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.840> one

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
getting new forms that are like one

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.870 
getting new forms that are like one
level<00:00:25.410> above<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> level<00:00:26.580> 10

its one effect once per turn if there is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
its one effect once per turn if there is
a<00:00:41.579> synchro<00:00:42.000> monster<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.480> field<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.870> can

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
a synchro monster on the field you can

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.150 
a synchro monster on the field you can
sort<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.230> summon<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.530> card<00:00:43.739> from<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.100> hand

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
sort of summon this card from your hand

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
sort of summon this card from your hand
when<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.059> card<00:00:45.239> sent<00:00:45.450> from<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.690> field<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
when it's card sent from the field to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
when it's card sent from the field to
the<00:00:46.020> Graveyard<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.250> add<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.520> resonator

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
the Graveyard you can add on resonator

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.209 
the Graveyard you can add on resonator
monster<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.570> your<00:00:48.899> graveyard<00:00:48.960> except<00:00:49.860> cinco

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
monster in your graveyard except cinco

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639

and resonator add it to your hand so
yeah<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.239> course<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.660> able<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
yeah with this of course you're able to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.569 
yeah with this of course you're able to
if<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> synchro<00:00:56.190> monster<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.489> can

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
if you have a synchro monster you can

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.099 
if you have a synchro monster you can
special<00:00:56.820> summon<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.210> easily<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> your<00:00:57.930> side<00:00:58.079> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
special summon it easily to your side of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
special summon it easily to your side of
the<00:00:58.199> field<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.710> basically<00:00:59.129> go<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the field and then basically go like a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.939 
the field and then basically go like a
level<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.539> which<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.410> cool<00:01:01.800> idea

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
level up which is kind of a cool idea

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.470 
level up which is kind of a cool idea
because<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.370> does<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.000> running<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.329> like

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
because it does kind of running of like

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.789 
because it does kind of running of like
what<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.809> saw<00:01:03.989> from<00:01:04.110> exceeds<00:01:04.500> where<00:01:04.650> they're

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
what we saw from exceeds where they're

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.350 
what we saw from exceeds where they're
kind<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> ranking<00:01:05.309> up<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.150> kind<00:01:06.299> of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
kind of ranking up that's what kind of

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.850 
kind of ranking up that's what kind of
seems<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:06.570> jack<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.080> doing<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
seems like jack is doing with the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.020 
seems like jack is doing with the
synchro<00:01:08.159> monster<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:08.880> seeing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
synchro monster you know we're seeing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
synchro monster you know we're seeing
all<00:01:09.180> kinds<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.479> different<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:10.140> know<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.380> had

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
all kinds of different you know we had

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.990 
all kinds of different you know we had
like<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> level<00:01:10.950> nine<00:01:11.070> red<00:01:11.310> dragon<00:01:11.580> Archfiend

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
like a level nine red dragon Archfiend

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.130 
like a level nine red dragon Archfiend
and<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> know<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.720> course<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> new

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and then you know of course the new

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.170 
and then you know of course the new
level<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.560> level<00:01:14.040> man<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.580> now<00:01:14.909> there's<00:01:15.000> gonna

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
level a level man and now there's gonna

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.460 
level a level man and now there's gonna
be<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> level<00:01:15.540> 10<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.110> almost<00:01:16.320> like

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
be a level 10 so it's almost like

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.200 
be a level 10 so it's almost like
they're<00:01:16.590> leveling<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.400> well<00:01:17.640> which<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
they're leveling up as well which is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.460 
they're leveling up as well which is
kind<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> cool<00:01:18.689> idea<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.320> new

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
kind of a cool idea and these new

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
kind of a cool idea and these new
resonators<00:01:19.979> are<00:01:20.130> basically<00:01:20.460> helping<00:01:20.880> doing

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
resonators are basically helping doing

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
resonators are basically helping doing
that<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.470> easy<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> special<00:01:23.580> summon

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that and just easy to special summon

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.999 
that and just easy to special summon
tuner<00:01:24.150> monsters<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
tuner monsters then you can go for the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.160 
tuner monsters then you can go for the
next<00:01:26.280> levels<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.700> everything<00:01:27.030> seems<00:01:27.990> very

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
next levels and everything seems very

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.600 
next levels and everything seems very
useful<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.829> also<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.189> think<00:01:29.369> these<00:01:29.460> new

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
useful and also i think these new

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.920 
useful and also i think these new
resonators<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.479> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.780> very

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
resonators are actually going to be very

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
resonators are actually going to be very
helpful<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.549> red

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
helpful if you do want to go for red

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
helpful if you do want to go for red
Nova<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.840> wondering<00:01:33.990> still<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
Nova and I'm kind of wondering still I

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.990 
Nova and I'm kind of wondering still I
mean<00:01:34.710> yeah<00:01:34.860> we've<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> lot<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.759> new<00:01:35.850> forms

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
mean yeah we've had a lot of new forms

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
mean yeah we've had a lot of new forms
to<00:01:36.240> red<00:01:36.360> dragon<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> wondering<00:01:37.710> if

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to red dragon I'm kind of wondering if

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800 
to red dragon I'm kind of wondering if
we<00:01:38.189> could<00:01:38.520> still<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.150> new<00:01:39.450> form<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
we could still see like a new form of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
we could still see like a new form of
red<00:01:40.049> Nova<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.650> well<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> know<00:01:41.400> something<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
red Nova as well you know something that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
red Nova as well you know something that
would<00:01:41.909> require<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.840> two<00:01:43.049> tuner<00:01:43.380> monsters<00:01:43.770> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
would require a two tuner monsters and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
would require a two tuner monsters and
then<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.549> course<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> new<00:01:45.030> red<00:01:45.780> dragon<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
then of course the new red dragon and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
then of course the new red dragon and
then<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.310> because<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.970> resonators

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
then go for it because these resonators

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.490 
then go for it because these resonators
that<00:01:48.720> we're<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> talk<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.229> are

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
that we're going to talk about are

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.539 
that we're going to talk about are
pretty<00:01:49.770> easy<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.979> bring<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.340> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
pretty easy to bring you out and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.980 
pretty easy to bring you out and
everything<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.090> Ahmed<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.689> makes<00:01:51.840> sense

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
everything and Ahmed kind of makes sense

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.080 
everything and Ahmed kind of makes sense
and<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.159> even<00:01:53.310> able<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
and also this one is even able to a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
and also this one is even able to a
target<00:01:54.540> resonator<00:01:55.079> monster<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.350> your

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
target resonator monster in your

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.990 
target resonator monster in your
graveyard<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.310> add<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> your<00:01:56.759> hands

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
graveyard and then add it to your hands

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.999 
graveyard and then add it to your hands
so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> get<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> recycle<00:01:57.899> too<00:01:58.290> seems

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
so you kind of get to recycle too seems

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.980 
so you kind of get to recycle too seems
like<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.189> gonna<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.369> very<00:01:59.399> useful<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.210> yeah

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
like it's gonna be very useful and yeah

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.240 
like it's gonna be very useful and yeah
I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.469> gonna<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.649> very<00:02:01.860> useful<00:02:01.920> for

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I think it's gonna be very useful for

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980 
I think it's gonna be very useful for
you<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:03.060> bring<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.420> all<00:02:03.570> their<00:02:03.689> forms

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you know bring it out all their forms

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
you know bring it out all their forms
red<00:02:04.229> dragon<00:02:04.590> after<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.520> we<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.820> chained

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
red dragon after that we have chained

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
red dragon after that we have chained

summon while there is a synchro monster
on<00:02:14.659> the<00:02:14.689> field<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.079> can<00:02:15.200> special<00:02:15.470> summon<00:02:15.500> one

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
on the field you can special summon one

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.410 
on the field you can special summon one
resonator<00:02:16.250> monster<00:02:16.579> from<00:02:16.670> your<00:02:16.730> deck<00:02:16.879> except

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
resonator monster from your deck except

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.839 
resonator monster from your deck except
chain<00:02:17.599> resonator<00:02:18.049> this<00:02:18.950> card<00:02:19.189> pretty<00:02:19.760> much

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
chain resonator this card pretty much

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.069 
chain resonator this card pretty much
just<00:02:19.879> has<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> simple<00:02:20.420> effect<00:02:20.780> where<00:02:20.959> you're

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
just has a simple effect where you're

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.690 
just has a simple effect where you're
able<00:02:21.200> to<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.530> course<00:02:21.769> normal<00:02:22.069> summit<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.489> get

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
able to a course normal summit and get

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.130 
able to a course normal summit and get
another<00:02:22.970> resonator<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.629> special<00:02:23.900> summon<00:02:23.930> it

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
another resonator you special summon it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.780 
another resonator you special summon it
from<00:02:24.290> your<00:02:24.409> deck<00:02:24.590> except<00:02:25.220> another<00:02:25.459> chain

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
from your deck except another chain

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.819 
from your deck except another chain
resonator<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.230> have<00:02:27.379> two<00:02:27.530> tuner

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
resonator and then you have two tuner

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.289 
resonator and then you have two tuner
monsters<00:02:28.129> on<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.280> field<00:02:28.340> resonator<00:02:28.909> tuners

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
monsters on the field resonator tuners

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.270 
monsters on the field resonator tuners
and<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.349> course<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.620> already<00:02:30.769> have<00:02:31.040> a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
and then of course you already have a

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.069 
and then of course you already have a
synchro<00:02:31.640> monster<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.000> field<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.750> that's

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
synchro monster on the field so that's

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.149 
synchro monster on the field so that's
what<00:02:33.230> kind<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.500> makes<00:02:33.650> me<00:02:33.739> think<00:02:33.950> that<00:02:34.040> they

00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:34.159 
what kind of makes me think that they

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.199 
what kind of makes me think that they
are<00:02:34.190> kind<00:02:34.400> of<00:02:34.430> making<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.700> little<00:02:34.819> easier<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
are kind of making a little easier to

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.330 
are kind of making a little easier to
bring<00:02:35.450> out<00:02:35.599> red<00:02:35.780> nova<00:02:35.810> as<00:02:36.260> well<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:36.890> making<00:02:37.129> me

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
bring out red nova as well as making me

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.890 
bring out red nova as well as making me
think<00:02:37.549> that<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:37.879> could<00:02:38.030> see<00:02:38.269> like<00:02:38.480> another

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
think that we could see like another

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.020 
think that we could see like another
form<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.799> red<00:02:39.950> Nova<00:02:40.189> because<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.609> course<00:02:40.819> in

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
form to red Nova because of course in

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.330 
form to red Nova because of course in
this<00:02:41.180> universe<00:02:42.049> or<00:02:42.379> whatever<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.829> dimension

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
this universe or whatever this dimension

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.270 
this universe or whatever this dimension
a<00:02:43.489> jack<00:02:44.239> doesn't<00:02:44.540> have<00:02:44.870> red<00:02:45.079> /<00:02:45.379> or<00:02:45.560> majestic<00:02:46.129> or

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
a jack doesn't have red / or majestic or

new<00:02:53.359> red<00:02:53.569> dragon<00:02:53.900> Archfiend<00:02:54.200> cards<00:02:54.409> anyway

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
new red dragon Archfiend cards anyway

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.920 
new red dragon Archfiend cards anyway
you<00:02:54.739> can<00:02:54.859> just<00:02:55.040> use<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.519> card<00:02:55.849> too<00:02:56.090> so<00:02:56.780> it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
you can just use that card too so it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.180 
you can just use that card too so it
seems<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.349> gonna<00:02:57.440> be<00:02:57.560> useful<00:02:57.859> again

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
seems like it's gonna be useful again

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.520 
seems like it's gonna be useful again
kind<00:02:58.489> of<00:02:58.549> simple<00:02:58.790> effect<00:02:59.120> but<00:02:59.450> yeah<00:02:59.989> I<00:03:00.170> think

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
kind of simple effect but yeah I think

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.690 
kind of simple effect but yeah I think
this<00:03:00.650> could<00:03:00.859> actually<00:03:01.010> help<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.459> out<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.670> I

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
this could actually help it out and I

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.309 
this could actually help it out and I
can't<00:03:01.879> wait<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.030> see<00:03:02.329> how<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.989> all<00:03:03.079> going

talk about which is the new form of hot
red<00:03:12.470> dragon<00:03:12.859> I<00:03:12.950> guess<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:14.180> a<00:03:14.209> hot<00:03:14.629> red

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
red dragon I guess and that is a hot red

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.680 
red dragon I guess and that is a hot red
dragon<00:03:15.079> Archfiend<00:03:15.470> below<00:03:16.129> I<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:17.269> don't<00:03:17.599> really

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
dragon Archfiend below I I don't really

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.970 
dragon Archfiend below I I don't really
know<00:03:17.840> how<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:17.989> pronounce<00:03:18.169> that<00:03:18.349> last<00:03:18.590> word<00:03:18.769> I

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
know how you pronounce that last word I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.009 
know how you pronounce that last word I
think<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.400> kind<00:03:19.639> of<00:03:19.669> right<00:03:19.879> but<00:03:20.209> yeah<00:03:20.720> I'm

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
think that's kind of right but yeah I'm

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.960 
think that's kind of right but yeah I'm
sure<00:03:21.199> a<00:03:21.230> butcher<00:03:21.620> did<00:03:21.769> honestly<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:22.579> sorry<00:03:22.879> if

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
sure a butcher did honestly so sorry if

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.599 
sure a butcher did honestly so sorry if

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
your graveyard in defense position so

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:51.819 
your graveyard in defense position so
basically<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.109> just<00:03:51.290> kind<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.500> seems<00:03:51.680> like<00:03:51.739> a

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
basically this just kind of seems like a

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.979 
basically this just kind of seems like a
setup<00:03:52.099> card<00:03:52.489> really<00:03:53.180> you<00:03:53.329> know<00:03:53.419> you<00:03:53.480> use<00:03:53.780> it

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
setup card really you know you use it

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.349 
setup card really you know you use it
bring<00:03:54.409> out<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.739> red<00:03:55.370> demon<00:03:55.699> which<00:03:55.849> i<00:03:56.060> guess<00:03:56.329> is

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
bring out a red demon which i guess is

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.360 
bring out a red demon which i guess is
any<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.169> i<00:03:57.409> think<00:03:57.859> that<00:03:57.980> could<00:03:58.069> work<00:03:58.129> with

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
any of the i think that could work with

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.309 
any of the i think that could work with
any<00:03:58.609> of<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:59.030> red<00:03:59.329> dragon<00:03:59.540> so<00:03:59.840> that<00:03:59.930> means<00:04:00.109> even

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
any of the red dragon so that means even

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.869 
any of the red dragon so that means even
I<00:04:00.560> think<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.859> original<00:04:01.250> where<00:04:01.609> dragon

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
I think the original where dragon

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:02.830 
I think the original where dragon
Archfiend<00:04:02.209> would<00:04:02.299> work<00:04:02.449> with<00:04:02.569> that<00:04:02.720> as<00:04:02.810> well

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
Archfiend would work with that as well

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.839 
Archfiend would work with that as well
if<00:04:03.260> I'm<00:04:03.889> not<00:04:04.010> mistaken<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:04.489> could<00:04:04.639> be<00:04:04.730> mistaken

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
if I'm not mistaken I could be mistaken

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.280 
if I'm not mistaken I could be mistaken
on<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.299> because<00:04:05.449> the<00:04:05.540> translations<00:04:06.079> could

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
on that because the translations could

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.420 
on that because the translations could
be<00:04:06.379> a<00:04:06.409> little<00:04:06.560> weird<00:04:06.769> on<00:04:06.919> that<00:04:07.040> sense<00:04:07.220> it's<00:04:07.340> a

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
be a little weird on that sense it's a

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.460 
be a little weird on that sense it's a
red<00:04:07.639> Damon<00:04:07.819> instead<00:04:08.659> of<00:04:08.720> like<00:04:08.900> red<00:04:09.169> dragon

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
red Damon instead of like red dragon

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:19.219 
get to tuner monsters same level from

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:21.020 
get to tuner monsters same level from
your<00:04:19.340> deck<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.729> graveyard<00:04:20.419> in<00:04:20.599> defense
