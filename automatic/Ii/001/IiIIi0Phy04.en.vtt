00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.039 

okay<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.240> maybe<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:32.899> want<00:01:33.079> it<00:01:33.109> like<00:01:33.320> that<00:01:33.609> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the X and the y are to move it over so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:56.870 
the X and the y are to move it over so
maybe<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.670> want<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:47.810> top<00:01:48.380> left

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:09.190 

so<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> at<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> top<00:01:58.530> left<00:02:01.880> that's<00:02:03.259> good

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.050 

you<00:02:10.200> kinda<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> adjust<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you kinda have to adjust it

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.670 
you kinda have to adjust it
oh<00:02:14.510> well<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:16.370> guess<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.580> because<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:19.410> first

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
oh well I guess it's because the first

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.960 
oh well I guess it's because the first
person<00:02:20.100> controller<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:22.069> out<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.550> terrain

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
person controller is out of this terrain

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.229 
person controller is out of this terrain
view<00:02:25.130> so<00:02:26.130> let's<00:02:26.660> check<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.959> now<00:02:29.000> yeah<00:02:30.000> so

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
view so let's check on it now yeah so

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.530 
view so let's check on it now yeah so
it's<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:31.110> little<00:02:31.319> bit<00:02:31.410> better<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.390> just

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's a little bit better so you just

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.259 
it's a little bit better so you just
want<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.110> mess<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.650> little<00:02:34.830> bit<00:02:35.010> um<00:02:35.280> she

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
want to mess with it a little bit um she

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.960 
want to mess with it a little bit um she
get<00:02:36.750> what<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.170> want<00:02:40.190> cuz<00:02:41.190> sometimes<00:02:41.459> it's

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
get what you want cuz sometimes it's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:51.699

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.589 

so<00:02:52.400> now<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.700> you've<00:02:53.120> set<00:02:54.049> everything<00:02:55.599> you

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
so now that you've set everything you

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.420 
so now that you've set everything you
set<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> depth<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.500> 15<00:02:58.010> and<00:03:00.430> everything's

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
set the depth of 15 and everything's

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.569 
set the depth of 15 and everything's
good<00:03:03.939> so<00:03:04.989> that<00:03:05.989> it's<00:03:06.409> all<00:03:06.890> good

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
good so that it's all good

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.209 
good so that it's all good
make<00:03:08.120> sure<00:03:08.329> it's<00:03:08.689> not<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.989> child<00:03:09.379> of<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.069> main

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
make sure it's not a child of the main

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.640 
make sure it's not a child of the main
camera<00:03:10.599> it's<00:03:11.599> a<00:03:11.750> child<00:03:12.019> of<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.200> first-person

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
camera it's a child of the first-person

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.020 
camera it's a child of the first-person
controller<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.829> once<00:03:15.829> you<00:03:15.980> get<00:03:16.129> into<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.489> game

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:25.599 

it<00:03:20.030> should<00:03:20.870> work<00:03:21.139> out<00:03:21.700> as<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:23.629> can<00:03:23.810> see<00:03:24.370> in<00:03:25.370> the

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
it should work out as you can see in the

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.420 
it should work out as you can see in the
map<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:26.900> can<00:03:26.959> see<00:03:27.109> everything<00:03:27.680> is<00:03:27.919> rotating

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
map you can see everything is rotating

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.619 
map you can see everything is rotating
as<00:03:28.970> I<00:03:29.329> rotate<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.980> it's<00:03:31.129> following<00:03:31.700> the<00:03:31.879> guy

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.050 

good<00:03:35.629> so<00:03:36.109> worked<00:03:36.530> just<00:03:37.310> takes<00:03:37.609> a<00:03:37.760> little<00:03:37.879> bit
