00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:19.890
 software has been working for 24 today 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.509
 around the topic kern or cameras and movies 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.380
 I have camcorder on the cam 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.970
 sony 637 and I have a microphone for that 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.519
 Got the whole thing to bring 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.510
 and I would like to introduce that 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:36.129
 the microphone is the ec m ms d 1 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.010
 Regional differences 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.809
 different variants of that now 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.760
 this variant there are a few types 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.750
 leg and I I want one right at the 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.530
 the beginning of this microphone can be in the west 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.930
 bought some from my girlfriend 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.850
 unfortunately I need an adapter for it 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.039
 push is adapter schuberth in this 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.440
 video also introduce where he is 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:09.820
 finds and where the cheapest 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:11.470
 source of income for it is we start with 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.689
 The packaging is unspectacular 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.400
 here is the whole microphone installed 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.600
 there are a few behind here 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.090
 little things and I will now 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.299
 So imagine this is it 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.009
 come here to this microphone 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.390
 I want you guys now but 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 that's what the core product is about 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.899
 is included 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.299
 otherwise this windscreen comes 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.170
 that's not really 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.790
 professional 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.560
 I already think about another one 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.189
 to bring that brings a bit 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.840
 but what about the wind, I think now 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.049
 very personally yes there are better 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.939
 Products 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.680
 but maybe I will again 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.079
 Imagine if I agree 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.369
 buy additional decisions 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.110
 otherwise there is only this little one 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.280
 pocket in which the microphone is extremely 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.729
 good and practical 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.430
 shot around he is not catching well 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.409
 we with the microphone on and the head 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.990
 high we can with this microphone three 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.600
 different positions of this button 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.330
 That's what it's like once he stands there 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.230
 now we can do it all at 90 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.060
 set to degrees and to 120 degrees 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.370
 that is the spectrum in which this device 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.220
 records 90 degrees if you are special 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.230
 a person fix volt i use in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.090
 the last videos also always 90 degrees 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.840
 then fixate on a person and you 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.820
 perfect clear tone picture is 120 degrees 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.100
 then something for that 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.340
 wider range then you can 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.510
 several people or groups starting with 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.350
 and you have to see how you take it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.560
 the back are then also the 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.209
 Batteries in it very simple with so 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.250
 Click here and click here 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.530
 the small batteries inside the otherwise 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.019
 cable is a bit rougher 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.110
 and not so cheap that's really 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.660
 it is beautiful so so, how such a small 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.190
 thin net dom cocked extremely 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.709
 pleasant and fairness even smaller 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.090
 a clicker so you can get those too 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.340
 one can click if one then here on 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.120
 camcorder has and that even a small one 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.070
 turn lock and the vehicle to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.739
 microphone 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.269
 since the turn-lock eccentric da that 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.120
 for my camcorder for example not 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.950
 does not fit what's really nice there 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.359
 one assumes that the book fits 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.790
 but not so bad 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.620
 there is this adapter school there 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.180
 There are a lot of different ones when 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.430
 he always loses the time of sony buying 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.829
 30 euro los I have the now at Amazon 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.730
 I think was shot for ten euros 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.440
 becomes quite cheap for easy 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.959
 turn lock here and me only 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.640
 I will not bring you down there 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.560
 of course additionally post 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.209
 as well as the microphone as a microphone 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.100
 is with others straight in the offer costs 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.700
 just under 70 euros and bring you completely 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.290
 nice good value otherwise there is 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.690
 So to say more to the product now 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.430
 I would like to introduce you shortly 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.620
 the extent to which the differences in the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.260
 Recording are with the star on the microphone 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.400
 with the extra microphone and the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.400
 different angles 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.820
 now you are not going to do that 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:22.400
 standard microphone what about the c30 e 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.840
 grown is the 5.1 sound we have 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.650
 Insert the time now for you to 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.150
 others also now we have the whole thing 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.930
 once transferred to the other 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.000
 microphone 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.080
 we noticed that in the whole 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.030
 unfortunately not running 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.490
 works price of had to be 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.260
 stop video frequency once and then 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.010
 start a new video around the microphone 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.389
 So do not use plug and play 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.050
 you have to corner me now 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.229
 hear better than last time with the 5.1 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.520
 standard microphone 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.070
 now you are listening to only two 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.400
 channels and often 90 degrees set 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.229
 120 degrees then you would stop now 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.340
 but it will be bigger 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.510
 you just listen to me now and 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.169
 Now it continues with the conclusion of 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.300
 last time 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.229
 Otherwise the article is already great 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.229
 get your post
