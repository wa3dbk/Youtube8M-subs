00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.660
 Compared with the same year I think 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.129
 I will be following well together 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.049
 but 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.570
 After all that's it as it is 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.349
 for 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.070
 For example 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.760
 The former did this but it is not good 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.399
 At first we play against it 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:26.859
 It is to the person of the other party 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.650
 that 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.650
 Please ask-I'm talking about you 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.470
 I think it is good 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.730
 Large 8 quite common problems are covered, for example 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.610
 Well, I have something to say that I put on a line 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 Is that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.280
 My line is on the line of the next person 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.329
 For example 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.300
 It is also before 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.830
 It is Alan, but at that time I collect it as it is 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.620
 It is okay though I said before or after that 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.379
 It feels like the capital high x x 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.400
 Also Nine is comfortably 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.550
 I think I can do that next 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.059
 Maoh 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.059
 If you keep that much at least so much Mom's 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 Because they are the same people who did the same fishing 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.070
 Don't get in trouble 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 I think 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.190
 Well I love color line violence 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.540
 We use, but the merit of that world 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.320
 Because there are some 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260
 Well first of all that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.299
 Good luck per fish name 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.280
 Miyoshi 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.440
 It is that 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.100
 One is full load 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.170
 A proper bird's eye 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.330
 Oh no one else's let me have my own line 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.900
 As it is 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.620
 That's easy to understand 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.070
 That's when the very fish sideways 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.170
 It means that I can not accept it 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.600
 I can see it well 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.710
 There is a place that can be used 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.640
 so 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.650
 In the case of a large red flower, it is basically changed as well 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.960
 Approach that 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.770
 The line also looks good 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.670
 For example this is 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.220
 that 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.680
 mylong- 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310
 -I'm coming 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.190
 It is easier to see the previous nine with changes to nine 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.349
 For example 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.139
 It was like orange 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.109
 That orange is not 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.109
 Otsuka out that line floats up 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.659
 Spherical sound field 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.599
 What is attached to that now is this action copper 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.950
 It's like that polarized lens, but a little bit 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.469
 It is good with pounding Katayama orange 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.149
 I'm in various things 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:33.629
 If you use a mako line 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.810
 A cheap change such as scout that keyword or orange 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 System-that looks good 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.879
 It is also considered in the combination of change and all the time considering 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.359
 is not it 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.229
 From that scout 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.229
 The second wave will be easier 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:55.189
 Successor high school of yellow system 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:57.149
 When you enter 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:03:00.149
 I think 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.969
 This change will change the way you look
