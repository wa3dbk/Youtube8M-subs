00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:14.309
 Welcome to my channel this time 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 I will show you how I prepare beans 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.630
 with bone and this time we have 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.509
 Peruvian beans 2 cups 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.480
 approximately we also have this 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.880
 rib with chamorro with bone that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.570
 they are being approximately 2 pounds 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.680
 between the two things half onion 2 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf and 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 salt to taste 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.650
 so for our preparation we go 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.150
 first to put a pot the water a 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.320
 Once we are boiling it we are going to put 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.840
 our our flesh since the meat 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.140
 luck is spilling that loose is the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.950
 let's go 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.159
 a spoon to remove all that and 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.479
 let's add the beans and 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.460
 approximately we are going to leave them to 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:12.890
 boiling over medium heat for two hours 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.880
 so that does not make a recipe very 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 simple but very tasty 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 and I hope you like it 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.439
 after two hours these are the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.100
 results as we were and now 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.960
 we're just going to pay it and we're going to 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.690
 serve in our this is the result 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.429
 of how our beans were with 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 bone 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.400
 I on this occasion accompanied him with a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.319
 little bit of onion cilantro and some 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.900
