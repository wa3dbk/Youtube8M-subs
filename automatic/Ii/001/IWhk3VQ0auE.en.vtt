00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
basic idea is let me go to spawn real

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460 
basic idea is let me go to spawn real
quick<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.079> actually

quick so here you are this is actually

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
quick so here you are this is actually
where<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.650> spawn<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.369> bloop<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.880> this

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
where you spawn in so bloop here in this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.819 
where you spawn in so bloop here in this
bottom<00:01:39.329> room<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.049> basic<00:01:40.409> principle<00:01:40.799> behind

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
bottom room the basic principle behind

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
bottom room the basic principle behind
the<00:01:41.159> server<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.329> an

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the server is that there is like an

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.100 
the server is that there is like an
infection<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.799> here's<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> spawn<00:01:44.640> room

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
infection and then here's the spawn room

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.520 
infection and then here's the spawn room
there<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.259> big<00:01:46.470> infection<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:48.259> broke<00:01:49.259> out

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
there was a big infection and broke out

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
there was a big infection and broke out
in<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.890> basically<00:01:50.189> destroyed<00:01:50.670> society<00:01:51.299> so

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
in a basically destroyed society so

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
in a basically destroyed society so
you'll<00:01:51.840> come<00:01:52.079> out<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.729> are

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
you'll come out here and then you are

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.969 
you'll come out here and then you are
currently<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> survivor<00:01:55.320> group<00:01:55.649> you're

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
currently in the survivor group you're

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.069 
currently in the survivor group you're
just<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> baseline<00:01:57.030> group<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.630> you'll

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
just in the baseline group and you'll

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.240 
just in the baseline group and you'll
walk<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.649> they'll<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.009> big

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
walk out and they'll be this big

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.670 
walk out and they'll be this big
destroyed<00:01:59.610> City<00:01:59.969> inside<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:00.990> camp

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
destroyed City inside this little camp

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.660 
destroyed City inside this little camp
over<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.189> you'll<00:02:02.310> notice<00:02:02.460> somebody

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
spawning inside of here it's like one of

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.250 
spawning inside of here it's like one of
the<00:02:11.849> only<00:02:11.879> safe<00:02:12.300> places<00:02:12.569> in<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> game

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the only safe places in the game

other<00:02:36.260> basically<00:02:37.260> there's<00:02:37.470> two<00:02:37.860> other<00:02:38.040> groups

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
other basically there's two other groups

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.369 
other basically there's two other groups
on<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.450> server<00:02:39.659> that<00:02:39.870> each<00:02:40.019> have<00:02:40.200> their<00:02:40.319> own

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
on the server that each have their own

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.729 
on the server that each have their own
basis<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.970> soulless<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.560> are

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
basis and that is soulless and you are

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.369 
basis and that is soulless and you are
already<00:02:44.280> yes<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.030> this<00:02:45.269> is<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.659> new<00:02:45.870> our<00:02:46.109> base

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
already yes so this is the new our base

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.830 
already yes so this is the new our base
so<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.640> basic<00:02:47.790> premise<00:02:48.180> behind<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
so this is the basic premise behind this

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.069 
so this is the basic premise behind this
is<00:02:49.109> that<00:02:49.170> as<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.609> that's<00:02:51.569> liked<00:02:51.840> all<00:02:52.049> the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
is that as the that's liked all the

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.349 
is that as the that's liked all the
craziness<00:02:52.739> went<00:02:53.069> down<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.579> like<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.000> zombie

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
craziness went down and like the zombie

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.180 
craziness went down and like the zombie
apocalypse<00:02:54.389> happened<00:02:55.260> there's<00:02:55.920> basically

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
apocalypse happened there's basically

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520 
apocalypse happened there's basically
two<00:02:56.370> main<00:02:56.790> groups<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.329> came<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.989> this<00:02:58.319> is

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
two main groups that came up and this is

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.819 
two main groups that came up and this is
new<00:02:58.739> are<00:02:59.510> they<00:03:00.510> are<00:03:00.720> they<00:03:00.989> are<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.530> people

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
that basically went to the military base

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.990 
that basically went to the military base

and they stayed safe the other people
are<00:03:06.120> soulless<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.659> this<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.079> military

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530

are soulless so this is the military
base<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.769> know<00:03:07.829> it's<00:03:08.040> all<00:03:08.250> ghetto<00:03:08.579> in<00:03:08.849> this

just<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.109> new<00:03:25.230> are<00:03:25.440> we're<00:03:26.400> going

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
just that's just the new are we're going

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.449 
just that's just the new are we're going
to<00:03:26.699> be<00:03:26.819> implementing<00:03:27.599> like<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.840> new<00:03:28.459> it'll

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
to be implementing like a new it'll

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.270 
to be implementing like a new it'll
basically<00:03:29.639> like<00:03:29.940> leader<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:31.349> big<00:03:31.530> leaders<00:03:32.010> of

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
basically like leader the big leaders of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.500 
basically like leader the big leaders of
each<00:03:32.400> group<00:03:32.699> but<00:03:32.879> there's<00:03:33.030> going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.209> be<00:03:33.239> tons

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
each group but there's going to be tons

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.360 
each group but there's going to be tons
of<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.470> hopefully<00:03:34.949> they'll<00:03:35.099> always<00:03:35.250> be

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
of them so hopefully they'll always be

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.460 
of them so hopefully they'll always be
one<00:03:35.699> of<00:03:35.879> them<00:03:36.030> online<00:03:36.269> for<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.900> guys<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.230> talk

of so experimenting mind you this is
just<00:03:49.769> kind<00:03:49.859> of<00:03:49.980> an<00:03:50.069> experiment<00:03:50.489> server<00:03:50.760> so<00:03:51.299> you

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
just kind of an experiment server so you

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.059 
just kind of an experiment server so you
notice<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:51.840> wrote<00:03:52.049> over<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.560> will<00:03:52.709> lead<00:03:52.889> you

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
notice I wrote over that will lead you

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.330 
notice I wrote over that will lead you
more<00:03:53.310> towards<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:53.790> main<00:03:53.970> spawn<00:03:54.359> city<00:03:54.780> and

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
more towards the main spawn city and

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.800 
more towards the main spawn city and
this<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.639> soulless<00:03:57.060> so<00:03:57.449> these<00:03:57.599> people

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
this is soulless so these people

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.649 
this is soulless so these people
actually<00:03:58.169> live<00:03:58.650> inside<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.519> like<00:03:59.790> prison

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
actually live inside of this like prison

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.030 
actually live inside of this like prison
area<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.199> you<00:04:01.290> notice<00:04:01.560> both<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.949> these

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
area and you notice both of these

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.789 
area and you notice both of these
general<00:04:02.609> areas<00:04:02.970> are<00:04:03.180> very<00:04:03.449> large<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:04.199> that's

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
general areas are very large and that's

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.140 
general areas are very large and that's
just<00:04:05.010> because<00:04:05.129> we<00:04:05.340> want<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.639> make<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:06.120> a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
just because we want to make it so a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.860 
just because we want to make it so a
they<00:04:06.419> can<00:04:06.599> expand<00:04:07.169> and<00:04:08.359> solace<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:09.540> currently

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
they can expand and solace is currently

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.899 
they can expand and solace is currently
like<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.229> larger<00:04:10.650> group<00:04:10.889> but<00:04:11.370> will<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
like the larger group but will be

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.390 
like the larger group but will be
balancing<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.510> out<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.109> their<00:04:13.919> special
