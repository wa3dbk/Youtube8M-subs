you how to charge it and does come with
a<00:02:09.420> wall<00:02:09.629> charger<00:02:09.679> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.830> very

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
a wall charger this is very

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.070 
a wall charger this is very
to<00:02:11.640> use<00:02:11.850> let<00:02:12.090> me<00:02:12.180> move<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.480> stuff<00:02:12.630> out<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.960> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
to use let me move this stuff out of the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.860 
to use let me move this stuff out of the
way<00:02:13.110> now<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> two<00:02:14.370> cables<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.970> identical<00:02:15.690> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
way now the two cables are identical and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050 
way now the two cables are identical and
this<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.950> because<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.370> does<00:02:17.580> allow<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:17.880> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
this is because it does allow you to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.870 
this is because it does allow you to
charge<00:02:18.270> two<00:02:18.690> items<00:02:19.320> at<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.500> same<00:02:19.770> time<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.850> to
