00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.309
 it does not seem but the car is being washed 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.800
 a wash almost without water 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.620
 very different from the traditional one it spends 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.519
 up to 350 liters of water in a single 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.970
 vehicle 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.939
 this is the ecological washing where products 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.890
 biodegradable replace letters and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.430
 liters of water 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 this is the kind of sustainable washing is 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.360
 camera is environmentally friendly and is used 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.040
 only brings 250 behind water danielle 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 which is to be diluted a product for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.190
 to be washed cars are products of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.289
 high technology are ph neutral product 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.440
 and is not abrasive and are totally 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.910
 biodegradable 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.670
 the novelty conquers customers 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.050
 concerned about the waste of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 natural resources 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 I did the first wash I liked 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.650
 the products they use all 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.150
 biodegradable and so we see that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.860
 you do not have any water or 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.970
 electricity uses nothing and has the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.280
 same result 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.560
 to change a traditional 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
 contributes significantly to the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.420
 minimize waste of water as 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.030
 explains this engineer of agespisa is 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.439
 very difficult for an entrepreneur to support himself 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.650
 washing car with agespisa water 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.020
 because it is very expensive there . 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.850
 water and kamala means you pay 10 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.850
 cubic meters x but if you will pay 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.210
 33 times this consumption is not three times 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.100
 more is much more and then you are 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.810
 today have the means to save you up to 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.409
 quick- washer and mail- wash 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 you use less water it is so that what 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.740
 In these cases, some cases are 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.759
 washes through is deposit is 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.610
 also can i can is artesian 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:02.399
 and they enjoy it there. 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.229
 so it's worth investing in changing some 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.140
 old habits 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.450
 How about starting at home, the people? 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.629
 can even split tap potting 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.590
 it is not always catch up at the end 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.019
 of the month will have a 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.989
 significant in your water is a 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.819
 another thing would be is the box is from 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.440
 leak that the vessel 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.510
 sanitary to enter again at the end 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.300
 of the month a representative account 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.430
 if you check this washing part 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.590
 and injecting in bathing only 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.420
 calculate a direct connected shower 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.459
 you will also have a brutal difference 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 at the end of the month of your account 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.860
 until you shave or brush your teeth with 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.290
 the tap on you will get 11 one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.930
 absurd spending without city one nÃ© 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.049
 this kid has changed his habit and stimulates 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.030
 that other people also change here in the 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.700
 Our capital is having this same 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.160
 problem of the rivers and everything with the washes 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.750
 in the river and such has this problem 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.150
 that we pass over the bridges 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.709
 water near our rivers. 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.379
 polluted so I think we have 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.720
 to have a little conscience and to pass 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.910
 to see what is best for us and for 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.790
 our planet help here 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.670
 This is where you go, you see, it was not spent 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.440
 almost nothing water is the car has this 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.440
 perfect result
