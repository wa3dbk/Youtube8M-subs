00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
grams of protein so one thing you can't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.500 
grams of protein so one thing you can't
be<00:00:48.510> too<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.230> know<00:00:49.320> let<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> label<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.510> if

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
be too you know let the label for you if

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.439 
be too you know let the label for you if
you<00:00:51.660> pull<00:00:51.870> out<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> scoop<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:53.550> looks<00:00:54.210> normal

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you pull out the scoop it looks normal

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.360 
you pull out the scoop it looks normal
but<00:00:54.660> it's<00:00:54.870> slightly<00:00:55.379> taller<00:00:55.770> than<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> normal

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
but it's slightly taller than a normal

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.869 
but it's slightly taller than a normal
protein<00:00:57.500> scoop<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.620> protein<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.190> like<00:00:59.699> my

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
protein scoop of protein and like my

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
protein scoop of protein and like my
other<00:01:00.000> ones<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.379> that's

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
other ones that I have so I think that's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.349 
other ones that I have so I think that's
why<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.070> calories<00:01:02.670> are<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:02.940> higher<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
why the calories are a little higher and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
why the calories are a little higher and
you're<00:01:03.510> getting<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.809> extra<00:01:04.049> six<00:01:04.500> grams<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you're getting that extra six grams of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.170 
you're getting that extra six grams of
protein<00:01:06.350> also<00:01:07.350> total<00:01:08.340> fat<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> two<00:01:08.909> grams

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
protein also total fat is two grams

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.140 
protein also total fat is two grams
which<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> pretty<00:01:09.960> common<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:11.610> claims<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
which is pretty common this claims to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.320 
which is pretty common this claims to
have<00:01:12.299> 37<00:01:13.170> grams<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.680> aminos<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> also<00:01:15.060> eight

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have 37 grams of aminos and also eight

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.649 
have 37 grams of aminos and also eight
grams<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.990> BCAAs<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> two-pound

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
grams of BCAAs so this is a two-pound

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.800 
grams of BCAAs so this is a two-pound
container<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:20.340> says<00:01:20.580> there's<00:01:20.970> twenty

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
container and it says there's twenty
