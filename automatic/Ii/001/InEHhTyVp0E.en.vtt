00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.560 
through Z they're in four different
colors<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:37.260> primary<00:00:37.800> colors<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.640> since

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
colors your primary colors so since

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.110

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
where she seems to get a little

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
where she seems to get a little
overwhelmed<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> how<00:01:00.090> many<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.890> but
