so like this whisper me for example and
I<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:45.000> imagine<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.390> would<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> problem

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
I can imagine that would be a problem

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.410 
I can imagine that would be a problem
because<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:46.740> oh<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.850> wonder<00:01:48.329> what

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.060 
because you think oh well I wonder what
hidden<00:01:48.630> power<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.829> know<00:01:49.950> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
hidden power that is and you know it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.260 
hidden power that is and you know it
might<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.399> little<00:01:50.490> bit<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.820> annoyance<00:01:50.970> for

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
