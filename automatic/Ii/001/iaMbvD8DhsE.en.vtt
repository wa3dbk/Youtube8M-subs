less there are a number of advantages to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.610 
less there are a number of advantages to
having<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:34.310> short<00:00:34.640> breeding<00:00:35.000> season<00:00:35.620> you

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
having this short breeding season you

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.190 
having this short breeding season you
have<00:00:36.830> a<00:00:36.860> much<00:00:37.250> more<00:00:37.550> uniform<00:00:37.850> calf<00:00:38.480> crop<00:00:38.840> it

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
have a much more uniform calf crop it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.500 
have a much more uniform calf crop it
simplifies<00:00:40.130> management<00:00:40.580> tremendously

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
simplifies management tremendously

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.229 
simplifies management tremendously
because<00:00:41.989> all<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.010> management<00:00:43.340> practices<00:00:44.030> can

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
because all the management practices can

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.240 
because all the management practices can
be<00:00:44.300> done<00:00:44.660> at<00:00:45.170> one<00:00:45.380> time<00:00:45.650> rather<00:00:45.980> than<00:00:46.160> having

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
be done at one time rather than having

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.540 
be done at one time rather than having
to<00:00:46.790> say<00:00:47.059> castrate<00:00:48.050> or<00:00:48.410> whatever<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.160> do<00:00:49.520> a

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
to say castrate or whatever and do a

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.460 
to say castrate or whatever and do a
group<00:00:49.910> now<00:00:50.150> and<00:00:50.390> then<00:00:50.480> come<00:00:50.720> back<00:00:50.750> sometime<00:00:51.440> a

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
group now and then come back sometime a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.500 
group now and then come back sometime a
little<00:00:51.739> bit<00:00:51.830> later<00:00:52.040> on<00:00:52.160> and<00:00:52.580> many<00:00:52.940> times<00:00:53.300> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
little bit later on and many times the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.270 
little bit later on and many times the
management<00:00:53.989> just<00:00:54.140> simply<00:00:54.530> doesn't<00:00:54.769> get<00:00:55.070> done

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
management just simply doesn't get done

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.299 
management just simply doesn't get done
also<00:00:55.970> when<00:00:56.480> we<00:00:56.660> get<00:00:57.320> the<00:00:57.530> breeding<00:00:58.100> season

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
also when we get the breeding season

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.180 
also when we get the breeding season
shortened<00:00:59.059> we<00:00:59.600> find<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.230> it's<00:01:00.500> much<00:01:00.800> easier

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
shortened we find that it's much easier

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.520 
shortened we find that it's much easier
to<00:01:01.339> identify<00:01:01.430> those<00:01:02.150> slow<00:01:02.570> or<00:01:02.839> non<00:01:03.019> breeders

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
to identify those slow or non breeders

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.200 
to identify those slow or non breeders
in<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.739> herd<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.190> we<00:01:04.339> get<00:01:04.519> those<00:01:04.699> animals

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
in the herd and we get those animals

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.470 
in the herd and we get those animals
moved<00:01:06.140> out<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.530> herd<00:01:07.120> another<00:01:08.120> big

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
moved out of the herd another big

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.570 
moved out of the herd another big
advantage<00:01:08.690> for<00:01:09.110> having<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.920> short<00:01:10.190> breeding

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
advantage for having that short breeding

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.820 
advantage for having that short breeding
season<00:01:11.000> is<00:01:11.150> that<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.960> improves<00:01:12.440> our<00:01:12.800> ability

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
season is that it improves our ability

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.730 
season is that it improves our ability
to<00:01:13.430> market<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.120> calves<00:01:14.390> we<00:01:15.110> have<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.320> much<00:01:15.560> more

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
to market the calves we have a much more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.790 
to market the calves we have a much more
uniform<00:01:16.040> calf<00:01:16.670> crop<00:01:17.000> consequently<00:01:17.900> we<00:01:18.770> can

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
uniform calf crop consequently we can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.920 
uniform calf crop consequently we can
sell<00:01:19.159> those<00:01:19.340> animals<00:01:19.790> in<00:01:19.909> groups<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.510> get

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
sell those animals in groups and get

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.270 
sell those animals in groups and get
more<00:01:21.170> dollars<00:01:21.580> from<00:01:22.580> those<00:01:23.000> animals<00:01:24.280> with

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
more dollars from those animals with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.470 
more dollars from those animals with
anything<00:01:25.760> there<00:01:26.000> are<00:01:26.030> some<00:01:27.400> advantage

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
anything there are some advantage

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.330 
anything there are some advantage
disadvantages<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.750> doing<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.920> particular

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
disadvantages to doing this particular

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.120 
disadvantages to doing this particular
thing<00:01:31.730> one<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.420> that<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:33.230> will<00:01:33.500> have<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.950> have<00:01:34.070> a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
thing one is that we will have to have a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.430 
thing one is that we will have to have a
lot<00:01:34.670> where<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.060> can<00:01:35.300> put<00:01:35.480> that<00:01:35.630> bull<00:01:35.900> during

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
lot where we can put that bull during

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.590 
lot where we can put that bull during
the<00:01:36.620> time<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.160> we're<00:01:37.940> not<00:01:38.090> breeding<00:01:38.330> the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
the time that we're not breeding the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.740 
the time that we're not breeding the
cows<00:01:39.130> generally<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.490> doesn't<00:01:40.910> take<00:01:41.120> a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
cows generally it doesn't take a

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.490 
cows generally it doesn't take a
tremendous<00:01:43.090> strength<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.450> lot<00:01:44.480> if<00:01:45.260> we<00:01:45.410> will

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
tremendous strength and a lot if we will

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.230 
tremendous strength and a lot if we will
just<00:01:45.620> have<00:01:45.710> a<00:01:45.830> good<00:01:46.130> fence<00:01:46.400> maybe<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.850> hot<00:01:47.030> wire

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
just have a good fence maybe a hot wire

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.540 
just have a good fence maybe a hot wire
on<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.630> inside<00:01:47.660> of<00:01:47.960> it<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.410> many<00:01:48.890> times<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:49.430> we

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
on the inside of it and many times if we

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.750 
on the inside of it and many times if we
put<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> braid<00:01:50.210> Chalian<00:01:50.900> with<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.560> bull<00:01:51.800> so<00:01:52.190> he

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
put a braid Chalian with that bull so he

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.550 
put a braid Chalian with that bull so he
has<00:01:52.940> company<00:01:53.450> he'd<00:01:53.600> be<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> lot<00:01:53.930> easier<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.410> keep

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
has company he'd be a lot easier to keep

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.330 
has company he'd be a lot easier to keep
in<00:01:54.800> place<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:56.600> other<00:01:56.810> thing<00:01:57.170> that<00:01:57.340> many

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
in place the other thing that many

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.550 
in place the other thing that many
producers<00:01:58.670> cited<00:01:59.210> as<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.360> big<00:01:59.690> disadvantage<00:02:00.020> in

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
producers cited as a big disadvantage in

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.710 
producers cited as a big disadvantage in
going<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.040> short<00:02:01.280> calving<00:02:01.910> season<00:02:01.940> is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
going to a short calving season is

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.130 
going to a short calving season is
simply<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.530> process<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:04.280> getting<00:02:04.700> from<00:02:04.940> a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
simply the process of getting from a

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.669 
simply the process of getting from a
365-day<00:02:06.140> calving<00:02:06.890> down<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.640> 90<00:02:08.000> days<00:02:08.410> this<00:02:09.410> can

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
365-day calving down to 90 days this can

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.509 
365-day calving down to 90 days this can
be<00:02:09.860> done<00:02:10.510> but<00:02:11.510> again<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.959> does<00:02:12.200> take<00:02:12.470> some

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
be done but again it does take some

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.460 
be done but again it does take some
determination<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.700> some<00:02:13.910> effort<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:15.230> we're

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
determination and some effort if we're

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.509 
determination and some effort if we're
looking<00:02:15.860> at<00:02:16.239> reducing<00:02:17.239> that<00:02:17.360> breeding<00:02:17.750> season

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
looking at reducing that breeding season

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.170 
looking at reducing that breeding season
down<00:02:19.519> to<00:02:19.940> an<00:02:20.750> April<00:02:21.379> through<00:02:21.739> June<00:02:22.730> which

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
down to an April through June which

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.390 
down to an April through June which
would<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> caves<00:02:24.319> coming<00:02:24.860> January

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
would have the caves coming January

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.610 
would have the caves coming January
through<00:02:25.760> March<00:02:26.260> we<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.549> get<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:29.060> program<00:02:29.620> put

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
through March we can get the program put

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.399 
through March we can get the program put
together<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:31.700> are<00:02:31.909> reducing<00:02:32.719> that<00:02:33.170> in

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
together so that we are reducing that in

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:33.700 
together so that we are reducing that in
about

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
about

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.310 
about
a<00:02:33.740> 3-year<00:02:34.430> period<00:02:34.730> of<00:02:34.970> time<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.780> first<00:02:36.020> year

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
a 3-year period of time the first year

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.100 
a 3-year period of time the first year
what<00:02:36.530> we<00:02:36.710> need<00:02:36.980> to<00:02:37.280> do<00:02:37.880> is<00:02:38.180> delay<00:02:38.540> putting<00:02:38.960> that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
what we need to do is delay putting that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.010 
what we need to do is delay putting that
bull<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.650> till<00:02:40.280> January<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.000> first<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.660> then

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
bull in till January the first and then

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.250 
bull in till January the first and then
take<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:42.830> bull<00:02:43.220> out<00:02:43.520> about<00:02:44.090> August<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.810> 15

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
take that bull out about August of 15

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.950 
take that bull out about August of 15
what<00:02:46.220> we<00:02:46.340> don't<00:02:46.700> want<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.060> do<00:02:47.240> is<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:47.780> simply

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
what we don't want to do is just simply

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.130 
what we don't want to do is just simply
go<00:02:48.470> from<00:02:48.710> 365<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.820> 90<00:02:50.210> because<00:02:50.540> we<00:02:50.810> will<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:50.930> a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
go from 365 to 90 because we will have a

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.950 
go from 365 to 90 because we will have a
number<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.590> cows<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.130> don't<00:02:52.340> get<00:02:52.490> bred

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
number of cows that don't get bred

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.180 
number of cows that don't get bred
consequently<00:02:53.960> we<00:02:54.110> have<00:02:54.140> no<00:02:54.470> calves<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.100> it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
consequently we have no calves and it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.430 
consequently we have no calves and it
becomes<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.850> financial<00:02:56.420> burden<00:02:56.570> what<00:02:57.260> we're

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
becomes a financial burden what we're

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.740 
becomes a financial burden what we're
trying<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.830> do<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.250> just<00:02:58.490> move<00:02:58.790> some<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.690> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
trying to do is just move some of the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.160 
trying to do is just move some of the
cows<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:01.640> bit<00:03:01.790> each<00:03:02.030> year<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:02.990> we

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
cows a little bit each year so that we

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.500 
cows a little bit each year so that we
are<00:03:03.560> getting<00:03:03.890> down<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:04.730> short<00:03:05.150> braiding

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
are getting down to that short braiding

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.930 
are getting down to that short braiding
season<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.110> then<00:03:06.350> not<00:03:06.980> having<00:03:07.250> severe

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
season and then not having severe

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.090 
season and then not having severe
financial<00:03:08.180> losses<00:03:08.810> as<00:03:09.230> we<00:03:09.410> go<00:03:09.620> through<00:03:09.950> that

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
financial losses as we go through that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.420 
financial losses as we go through that
process<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:12.590> second<00:03:13.010> year<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.340> program

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
process the second year in the program

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.670 
process the second year in the program
like<00:03:13.970> this<00:03:14.210> if<00:03:14.450> we<00:03:14.570> will<00:03:14.660> delay<00:03:14.960> putting<00:03:15.590> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
like this if we will delay putting the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.400 
like this if we will delay putting the
bull<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.160> until<00:03:16.600> February<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.780> first<00:03:18.020> and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.670 

breeding<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.670> calving<00:03:56.300> season<00:03:56.330> but<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.410> does

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
breeding and calving season but it does

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.460 
breeding and calving season but it does
have<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.070> lot<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.460> advantages<00:03:59.180> for<00:03:59.630> producers

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
have a lot of advantages for producers

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.320 
have a lot of advantages for producers
and<00:04:00.500> getting<00:04:01.010> that<00:04:01.130> breeding<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.000> calving

season down to where it's relatively

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.520 
season down to where it's relatively
short<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.610> know<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.570> number<00:04:05.960> of<00:04:06.020> producers<00:04:06.260> that

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
short I know a number of producers that

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.590 
short I know a number of producers that
have<00:04:06.740> dropped<00:04:06.980> down<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.250> 60<00:04:07.910> days<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.480> they

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
have dropped down to 60 days and they

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.260 
have dropped down to 60 days and they
say<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.350> is<00:04:10.130> really<00:04:10.790> beneficial

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
say that that is really beneficial

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.660 
say that that is really beneficial
because<00:04:11.780> they<00:04:12.290> have<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:12.710> much<00:04:12.920> more<00:04:13.190> uniform

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
because they have so much more uniform

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.390 
because they have so much more uniform
calf<00:04:14.000> crop<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.720> helps<00:04:14.990> them<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.230> lot<00:04:15.440> with

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
calf crop and it helps them a lot with

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.780 
calf crop and it helps them a lot with
the<00:04:16.580> marketing<00:04:17.090> so<00:04:17.630> as<00:04:17.720> we<00:04:17.870> say<00:04:18.080> that<00:04:18.109> we<00:04:18.590> can

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
the marketing so as we say that we can

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.060
