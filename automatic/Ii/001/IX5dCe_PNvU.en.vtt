to stay in to take a dynamic punch so I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.130 
to stay in to take a dynamic punch so I
do<00:00:33.300> go<00:00:33.690> into<00:00:34.170> my<00:00:34.590> Jirachi<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.300> yeah<00:00:36.809> he

predicting<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.879> switch<00:00:39.149> don't<00:00:39.870> really<00:00:40.079> know

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
predicting my switch don't really know

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.170 
predicting my switch don't really know
why<00:00:40.410> because<00:00:40.710> dynamic<00:00:41.309> punch<00:00:41.550> hits<00:00:41.820> my<00:00:42.000> whole

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
why because dynamic punch hits my whole

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.720 
why because dynamic punch hits my whole
team<00:00:42.420> with<00:00:42.629> neutral<00:00:43.020> damage<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:44.190> he<00:00:44.399> gets<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
team with neutral damage but he gets the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.270 
team with neutral damage but he gets the
first<00:00:44.879> turn<00:00:45.090> freeze<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.829> he's<00:00:46.829> gonna<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.129> for

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
first turn freeze now he's gonna go for

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.160 
first turn freeze now he's gonna go for
the<00:00:47.340> dynamic<00:00:47.789> punch<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.210> hopefully<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:48.989> can

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the dynamic punch here hopefully I can

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
the dynamic punch here hopefully I can
thaw<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.640> choice<00:00:50.969> specs

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.990 
will definitely definitely be a one-hit
ko<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.590> unfortunately<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.430> throw<00:00:59.789> out

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
he's gonna take me out and this really
sucks<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:01.949> jirachi<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.699> main<00:01:02.940> counter

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
sucks because jirachi is my main counter

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
losing him early is never good because

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
sing but I know most my champs like to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.830 
sing but I know most my champs like to
carry<00:01:32.310> Lum<00:01:32.579> berry<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.390> he<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.689> be

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
carry Lum berry and then he would be

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
carry Lum berry and then he would be
able<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.049> hit<00:01:34.229> me<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> dynamic<00:01:34.890> punch<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
able to hit me with a dynamic punch and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.310 
able to hit me with a dynamic punch and
that<00:01:35.729> wouldn't<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.030> good<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.079> why<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that wouldn't be good so that's why I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.140 
that wouldn't be good so that's why I
had<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> deal<00:01:37.799> some<00:01:38.009> damage<00:01:38.130> first<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.820> then

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
had to deal some damage first and then

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
had to deal some damage first and then
bring<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.630> Lapras<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> take<00:01:40.350> him<00:01:40.500> out<00:01:40.650> with

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
bring in my Lapras to take him out with

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.399 
bring in my Lapras to take him out with
a<00:01:41.130> blizzard<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.509> Lapras<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> pretty

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
a blizzard now this Lapras is a pretty

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.800 
a blizzard now this Lapras is a pretty
interesting<00:01:43.680> set<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.430> carries<00:01:44.909> zoom<00:01:45.149> lens<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
interesting set it carries zoom lens and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.380 
interesting set it carries zoom lens and
what<00:01:46.439> zoom<00:01:46.619> lens<00:01:46.829> does<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.670> go<00:01:47.820> second

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
what zoom lens does is if you go second

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.679 
what zoom lens does is if you go second
it<00:01:48.540> increases<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.350> your<00:01:49.649> moves<00:01:49.890> by<00:01:50.070> 20%<00:01:50.729> but

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it increases all your moves by 20% but

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.200 
it increases all your moves by 20% but
since<00:01:52.079> poor<00:01:52.619> Conte<00:01:52.920> was<00:01:53.009> slower<00:01:53.189> than<00:01:53.280> me<00:01:53.549> zoom

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
since poor Conte was slower than me zoom

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.050 
since poor Conte was slower than me zoom
lens<00:01:54.450> isn't<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.930> effect<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.729> Singh<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
lens isn't in effect and Singh will be a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.899 
lens isn't in effect and Singh will be a
55<00:01:57.479> percent<00:01:57.509> accurate<00:01:58.229> move<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.189> do<00:01:59.280> end<00:01:59.729> up

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
55 percent accurate move but I do end up

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.760 
55 percent accurate move but I do end up
hitting<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.020> absolutely<00:02:01.500> perfect

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
hitting and that is absolutely perfect

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.039 
hitting and that is absolutely perfect
because<00:02:02.280> after<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:02.850> Infernape<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.390> down<00:02:03.719> I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
because after my Infernape is down I

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.510 
because after my Infernape is down I
really<00:02:04.590> don't<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.950> great<00:02:05.130> counter

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really don't have a great counter

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
really don't have a great counter
against<00:02:05.759> porygon<00:02:06.000> -<00:02:06.299> except<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:06.990> absol

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
against porygon - except for my absol

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.520 
against porygon - except for my absol
and<00:02:07.860> even<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.849> +2<00:02:09.270> superpower<00:02:09.750> won't<00:02:10.229> be<00:02:10.349> able

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and even a +2 superpower won't be able

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.830 
and even a +2 superpower won't be able
to<00:02:10.619> take<00:02:10.800> down<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.129> porygon<00:02:11.489> -<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.090> my<00:02:12.629> plan

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
to take down this porygon - so my plan

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.550 
to take down this porygon - so my plan
here<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.230> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
here is this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.100 
here is this
up<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.830> +4<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:14.819> take<00:02:15.000> him<00:02:15.120> out<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
up to +4 and then take him out and I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.900 
up to +4 and then take him out and I
know<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.530> live<00:02:16.650> any<00:02:16.860> hit<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.340> if<00:02:17.550> he<00:02:17.730> wakes

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
know I can live any hit so if he wakes

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.050 
know I can live any hit so if he wakes
up<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.720> turn<00:02:18.989> I'm<00:02:19.290> totally<00:02:19.709> fine<00:02:20.160> because

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
up this turn I'm totally fine because

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
up this turn I'm totally fine because
I've<00:02:21.569> got<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.900> focus<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.560> I<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.739> live<00:02:22.890> any

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
I've got that focus and I can live any

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.699 
I've got that focus and I can live any
hit<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.610> yeah<00:02:24.569> I'm<00:02:24.690> gonna<00:02:24.780> set<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.080> +4<00:02:25.500> he

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
hit and yeah I'm gonna set it to +4 he

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.920 
hit and yeah I'm gonna set it to +4 he
doesn't<00:02:25.950> waking<00:02:26.250> up<00:02:26.400> now<00:02:26.610> I<00:02:26.940> thought<00:02:27.599> he<00:02:27.750> might

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
doesn't waking up now I thought he might

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.110 
doesn't waking up now I thought he might
want<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.230> go<00:02:28.380> for<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.890> Thunder<00:02:29.489> wave<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:30.030> he

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
want to go for the Thunder wave but he

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.420 
want to go for the Thunder wave but he
ends<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.360> going<00:02:30.540> for<00:02:31.010> Thunder<00:02:32.010> Bluff<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.280> deal

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
ends up going for Thunder Bluff to deal

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
ends up going for Thunder Bluff to deal
some<00:02:32.640> damage<00:02:32.790> that's<00:02:33.180> totally<00:02:33.660> fine<00:02:33.900> because

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
some damage that's totally fine because

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.199 
some damage that's totally fine because
I'm<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.220> gonna<00:02:35.400> take<00:02:35.640> him<00:02:35.790> out<00:02:35.910> with<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
I'm just gonna take him out with a

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.720 
I'm just gonna take him out with a
superpower<00:02:36.900> now<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.290> end<00:02:37.739> up<00:02:37.890> do<00:02:38.160> getting<00:02:38.430> a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
superpower now I end up do getting a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.910 
superpower now I end up do getting a
critical<00:02:39.239> hit<00:02:39.420> not<00:02:40.080> sure<00:02:40.319> if<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.500> really

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
critical hit not sure if that really

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.650 
critical hit not sure if that really
mattered<00:02:41.250> because<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:41.849> an<00:02:41.970> abyssal<00:02:42.480> at

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
mattered because this is an abyssal at

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.830 
mattered because this is an abyssal at
+4<00:02:43.410> attack<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.150> know

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
+4 attack and I know

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.350 
+4 attack and I know
porygon<00:02:46.530> 2<00:02:46.799> can<00:02:47.130> take<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> lot<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.060> super

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
porygon 2 can take a lot of super

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.600 
porygon 2 can take a lot of super
effective<00:02:48.690> hits<00:02:48.900> but<00:02:49.890> yeah<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.370> is<00:02:50.489> an

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
effective hits but yeah this is an

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.699 
effective hits but yeah this is an
abyssal<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.480> we're<00:02:51.840> talking<00:02:52.140> about<00:02:52.260> sheer

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
abyssal and we're talking about sheer

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.699 
abyssal and we're talking about sheer
power<00:02:52.950> like<00:02:53.280> 1000<00:02:53.880> attack<00:02:54.120> after<00:02:54.330> +<00:02:54.660> floor<00:02:54.989> but

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
power like 1000 attack after + floor but

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.920 
power like 1000 attack after + floor but
at<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:55.920> point<00:02:56.160> he<00:02:56.310> brings<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:56.640> Infernape<00:02:57.150> um

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
at this point he brings in Infernape um

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.190 
at this point he brings in Infernape um
I<00:02:57.989> was<00:02:58.739> thinking<00:02:59.030> he<00:03:00.030> might<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.510> he<00:03:01.049> might

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
I was thinking he might not be he might

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.110 
I was thinking he might not be he might
not<00:03:01.349> carry<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> Mach<00:03:01.920> punch<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.000> thought

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
not carry the Mach punch and I thought

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.370 
not carry the Mach punch and I thought
he<00:03:03.239> was<00:03:03.390> bluffing<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:03.870> that's<00:03:04.019> why<00:03:04.140> I<00:03:04.170> went<00:03:04.319> for

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
he was bluffing so that's why I went for

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.960 
he was bluffing so that's why I went for
the<00:03:04.530> sucker<00:03:04.709> punch<00:03:04.819> unfortunately<00:03:05.819> that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the sucker punch unfortunately that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.300 
the sucker punch unfortunately that
isn't<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.299> case<00:03:06.510> now<00:03:06.840> um<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.920> reason<00:03:08.040> why<00:03:08.280> I

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
isn't the case now um the reason why I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.100 
isn't the case now um the reason why I
didn't<00:03:08.730> switch<00:03:08.880> out<00:03:09.060> as<00:03:09.209> well<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.690> because<00:03:09.959> if

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
didn't switch out as well is because if

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.180 
didn't switch out as well is because if
he<00:03:10.200> wasn't<00:03:10.440> choiced

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
he wasn't choiced

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.860 
he wasn't choiced
he<00:03:11.459> could<00:03:11.640> pretty<00:03:11.760> much<00:03:11.910> take<00:03:12.180> down<00:03:12.390> my<00:03:12.599> team

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
he could pretty much take down my team

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.039 
he could pretty much take down my team
with<00:03:13.799> floor<00:03:14.610> blitz<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.540> fighting-type

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
with floor blitz and a fighting-type

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.120 
with floor blitz and a fighting-type
move<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:17.099> well<00:03:17.450> so<00:03:18.450> yeah<00:03:19.049> at<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:19.709> point<00:03:19.799> I'm

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
move as well so yeah at this point I'm

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.410 
move as well so yeah at this point I'm
predicting<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.640> switch<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.060> that's<00:03:21.150> why<00:03:21.390> I

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
predicting the switch and that's why I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.420 
predicting the switch and that's why I
went<00:03:21.600> for<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.810> hidden<00:03:22.019> power<00:03:22.200> ice<00:03:22.440> but<00:03:23.370> he

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
went for the hidden power ice but he

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.729 
went for the hidden power ice but he
ends<00:03:23.609> up<00:03:23.700> not<00:03:23.850> switching<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:24.690> that<00:03:25.470> kind<00:03:25.680> of

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
ends up not switching so that kind of

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.830 
ends up not switching so that kind of
sucked<00:03:26.010> but<00:03:26.340> he<00:03:26.880> does<00:03:27.060> have<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> pokemon<00:03:27.720> that

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
sucked but he does have a pokemon that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.930 
sucked but he does have a pokemon that
resists<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.500> my<00:03:28.799> moves<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.310> that's<00:03:29.609> the

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
resists all my moves and that's the

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.990 
resists all my moves and that's the
Volcarona<00:03:30.299> it<00:03:30.720> resists<00:03:31.170> my<00:03:31.350> grass<00:03:32.130> fighting

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
Volcarona it resists my grass fighting

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.360 
Volcarona it resists my grass fighting
in<00:03:33.120> ice<00:03:33.269> type<00:03:33.480> moves<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.079> at<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.440> point<00:03:34.769> this

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
in ice type moves so at this point this

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.210 
in ice type moves so at this point this
is<00:03:35.430> really<00:03:35.850> scary<00:03:36.230> if<00:03:37.230> he<00:03:37.350> sets<00:03:37.560> up<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.739> plus<00:03:37.950> one

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
is really scary if he sets up a plus one

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.460 
is really scary if he sets up a plus one
with<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.730> quiver<00:03:38.940> dance<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.480> mice<00:03:39.870> as<00:03:40.079> Endora

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
my team will get swept because I'm not

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.780 
my team will get swept because I'm not
sure<00:03:46.560> if<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.889> add<00:03:47.010> speed<00:03:47.310> since<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.639> am

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
sure if I can add speed since I am

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.720 
sure if I can add speed since I am

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.379 
blast those get a special defense trap
and<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.739> will<00:03:55.889> play<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.280> crucial<00:03:56.609> role<00:03:56.819> later

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
and that will play a crucial role later

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.000 
and that will play a crucial role later
on<00:03:57.630> in<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.989> battle<00:03:58.139> because<00:03:58.470> as<00:03:58.650> you'll<00:03:58.799> see

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
on in the battle because as you'll see

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.400

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
he gets a quiver dance up and that means

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.559 
he gets a quiver dance up and that means
his<00:04:01.650> special<00:04:02.280> defense<00:04:02.489> will<00:04:02.639> be<00:04:02.760> at<00:04:02.910> plus<00:04:03.209> zero

can just bring in my high drag on and
take<00:04:49.830> him<00:04:49.949> out<00:04:50.130> now<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.699> was<00:04:51.150> really<00:04:51.419> surprised

take him out now I was really surprised

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.230 
take him out now I was really surprised
that<00:04:52.470> he<00:04:52.590> didn't<00:04:52.860> switch<00:04:53.070> out<00:04:53.280> his<00:04:53.550> Infernape

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
that he didn't switch out his Infernape

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.730 
that he didn't switch out his Infernape
here<00:04:54.479> because<00:04:54.750> Infernape<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.290> probably<00:04:55.590> his

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
here because Infernape is probably his

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.040 
here because Infernape is probably his
best<00:04:55.949> counter<00:04:56.280> against<00:04:56.639> my<00:04:56.760> team<00:04:57.030> since<00:04:57.750> mach

best counter against my team since mach
punch<00:04:58.320> deals<00:04:58.830> super<00:04:59.130> effective<00:04:59.430> damage

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
punch deals super effective damage

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.879 
punch deals super effective damage
against<00:05:00.060> both<00:05:00.360> mahadji<00:05:00.780> Oregon<00:05:01.169> as<00:05:01.380> well<00:05:01.440> as

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
against both mahadji Oregon as well as

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.700 
against both mahadji Oregon as well as
my<00:05:02.190> Lapras<00:05:02.729> but<00:05:03.510> he<00:05:03.600> stays<00:05:03.810> in<00:05:04.050> which<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.530> good

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
my Lapras but he stays in which is good

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.040 
my Lapras but he stays in which is good
for<00:05:04.889> me<00:05:05.070> because<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.520> take<00:05:05.910> down<00:05:06.150> probably<00:05:06.840> the

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
for me because I take down probably the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.170 
for me because I take down probably the
biggest<00:05:07.260> threat<00:05:07.590> against<00:05:07.830> my<00:05:08.010> team<00:05:08.280> but<00:05:09.090> he

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
biggest threat against my team but he

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.760 
biggest threat against my team but he
still<00:05:09.360> got<00:05:09.510> one<00:05:09.750> more<00:05:09.780> fighting<00:05:10.260> type<00:05:10.440> and

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
still got one more fighting type and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.670 
still got one more fighting type and
that's<00:05:11.100> gonna<00:05:11.370> be<00:05:11.580> his<00:05:11.850> graph<00:05:12.300> T<00:05:12.570> and<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:13.560> is

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
that's gonna be his graph T and this is

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.440 
that's gonna be his graph T and this is
really<00:05:13.889> bad<00:05:14.160> because<00:05:14.340> he's<00:05:14.880> gonna<00:05:15.000> go<00:05:15.210> for<00:05:15.389> the

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
really bad because he's gonna go for the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.790 
really bad because he's gonna go for the
drain<00:05:15.630> punch<00:05:15.840> and<00:05:16.020> that's<00:05:16.139> super<00:05:16.500> effective

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
drain punch and that's super effective

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.159 
drain punch and that's super effective
against<00:05:17.100> both<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.460> my<00:05:17.550> Pokemon<00:05:18.060> and<00:05:18.389> I<00:05:18.900> believe

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
against both of my Pokemon and I believe

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:20.870 
against both of my Pokemon and I believe
he<00:05:19.320> has<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.620> crafty<00:05:20.039> left<00:05:20.250> as<00:05:20.400> well<00:05:20.520> as<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.700> la

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
he has this crafty left as well as a la

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
he has this crafty left as well as a la
tía<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.510> if<00:05:21.870> he's<00:05:22.169> the<00:05:22.289> bulky<00:05:22.740> variant<00:05:23.160> um<00:05:23.940> yeah

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
tía so if he's the bulky variant um yeah

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.980 
tía so if he's the bulky variant um yeah
he's<00:05:25.139> pretty<00:05:25.260> much<00:05:25.500> gonna<00:05:25.680> take<00:05:25.979> my<00:05:26.990> Draco

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
he's pretty much gonna take my Draco

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.900 
he's pretty much gonna take my Draco
meteor<00:05:28.139> really<00:05:28.740> well<00:05:28.919> and<00:05:29.250> pretty<00:05:29.490> much<00:05:29.669> sweep

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
meteor really well and pretty much sweep

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.510
