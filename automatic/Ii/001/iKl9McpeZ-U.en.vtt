00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
that I was just playing then which uses

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.560 
that I was just playing then which uses
the<00:00:26.859> mala<00:00:27.130> technique<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:28.060> push-pull

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
the mala technique and the push-pull

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.749 
the mala technique and the push-pull
technique<00:00:29.050> within<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:29.919> same<00:00:30.160> bar<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:30.579> within

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
technique within the same bar and within

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.080 
technique within the same bar and within
the<00:00:30.939> same<00:00:31.179> beat<00:00:31.480> with<00:00:31.689> just<00:00:31.929> the<00:00:32.020> right<00:00:32.230> hand

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the same beat with just the right hand

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.370 
the same beat with just the right hand
I'll<00:00:34.090> explain<00:00:34.450> first<00:00:34.780> of<00:00:34.930> all<00:00:35.079> how<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.260> play

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
I'll explain first of all how to play

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.900 
I'll explain first of all how to play
the<00:00:35.710> mala<00:00:35.890> technique<00:00:36.280> and<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.520> push-pull

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
the mala technique and the push-pull

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.010 
the mala technique and the push-pull
technique<00:00:37.300> I've<00:00:37.450> done<00:00:37.630> it<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:37.810> few<00:00:37.840> times

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
technique I've done it a few times

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.170 
technique I've done it a few times
before<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:38.860> if<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.430> already<00:00:39.550> know<00:00:39.790> how<00:00:40.150> to

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
before so if you already know how to

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.670 
before so if you already know how to
play<00:00:40.420> those<00:00:40.570> techniques<00:00:40.990> you<00:00:41.140> can<00:00:41.230> just<00:00:41.440> skip

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
play those techniques you can just skip

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.560 
play those techniques you can just skip
to<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.920> second<00:00:42.580> video<00:00:42.700> which<00:00:43.000> shows<00:00:43.240> you<00:00:43.420> how

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
to the second video which shows you how

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.440 
to the second video which shows you how
to<00:00:43.630> play<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:44.080> beat<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.700> let's<00:00:46.090> start<00:00:46.300> out

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
to play the beat and but let's start out

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.030 
to play the beat and but let's start out
with<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:46.780> learning<00:00:47.050> these<00:00:47.200> basic<00:00:47.620> hand

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
with just learning these basic hand

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.400 
with just learning these basic hand
patterns<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:49.330> motor<00:00:49.570> technique<00:00:50.080> which<00:00:50.260> we'll

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
patterns the motor technique which we'll

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.710 
patterns the motor technique which we'll
look<00:00:50.500> at<00:00:50.680> first<00:00:50.980> is<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.790> usually<00:00:52.270> taught<00:00:52.510> as<00:00:52.690> a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
look at first is it usually taught as a

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.870 
look at first is it usually taught as a
repetitive<00:00:53.110> pattern<00:00:53.590> of<00:00:53.650> three<00:00:53.860> now<00:00:54.550> what<00:00:54.760> you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
repetitive pattern of three now what you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.970 
repetitive pattern of three now what you
do<00:00:55.060> is<00:00:55.090> you<00:00:55.510> play<00:00:55.720> an<00:00:55.900> accent<00:00:56.440> on<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:56.620> first

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
do is you play an accent on the first

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.860 
do is you play an accent on the first
note<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.670> second<00:00:58.060> and<00:00:58.180> third<00:00:58.390> notes<00:00:58.690> are

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
note and the second and third notes are

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.370 
note and the second and third notes are
not<00:00:59.170> accents<00:00:59.710> okay<00:01:00.220> so<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.670> way<00:01:00.850> we<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:02.290> way

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
not accents okay so the way we the way

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.170 
not accents okay so the way we the way
that<00:01:02.530> we<00:01:02.620> get<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.920> motion<00:01:03.310> is<00:01:03.460> we<00:01:03.640> raise<00:01:03.940> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that we get the motion is we raise the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.210 
that we get the motion is we raise the
stick<00:01:04.479> kinda<00:01:04.989> you<00:01:05.229> you<00:01:05.590> kind<00:01:05.799> of<00:01:05.920> lift<00:01:06.130> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
stick kinda you you kind of lift the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.130 
stick kinda you you kind of lift the
elbow<00:01:06.549> out<00:01:06.700> to<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:06.880> side<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.840> wrist

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
elbow out to the side and the wrist

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.349 
elbow out to the side and the wrist
up<00:01:08.439> and<00:01:08.979> what<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.250> do<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.579> you<00:01:09.700> flick<00:01:10.179> the

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
up and what you do is you flick the

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:11.999 
up and what you do is you flick the
wrist<00:01:10.509> down<00:01:10.780> back<00:01:11.109> on<00:01:11.289> itself<00:01:11.560> essentially

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
wrist down back on itself essentially

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.160 
wrist down back on itself essentially
and<00:01:12.369> that<00:01:12.399> gets<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.359> that<00:01:13.539> except<00:01:14.049> that

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
and that gets you that except that

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.469 
and that gets you that except that
initial<00:01:14.619> stroke<00:01:14.950> which<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.939> louder<00:01:16.179> one

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
initial stroke which is the louder one

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.899 
initial stroke which is the louder one
okay<00:01:16.929> and<00:01:16.960> from<00:01:17.469> there<00:01:17.859> there<00:01:18.520> should<00:01:18.729> be

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
okay and from there there should be

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.029 
okay and from there there should be
enough<00:01:19.119> momentum<00:01:19.689> in<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.899> initial<00:01:20.530> whip<00:01:20.710> to

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
enough momentum in that initial whip to

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.160 
enough momentum in that initial whip to
give<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.579> second<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:22.240> third<00:01:22.539> non

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
give you the second and third non

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.870 
give you the second and third non
accents<00:01:23.710> okay<00:01:24.069> the<00:01:24.219> strokes<00:01:24.549> that<00:01:24.700> come

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
accents okay the strokes that come

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.669 
accents okay the strokes that come
afterwards<00:01:25.210> so<00:01:31.200> okay<00:01:32.200> that's<00:01:32.350> what<00:01:32.560> we're

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
afterwards so okay that's what we're

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.859 
afterwards so okay that's what we're
aiming<00:01:32.859> for<00:01:33.039> there<00:01:33.479> because<00:01:34.479> there's<00:01:34.630> enough

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
aiming for there because there's enough

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.690 
aiming for there because there's enough
momentum<00:01:35.049> in<00:01:35.469> that<00:01:35.499> initial<00:01:36.039> stroke<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.520> don't

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
momentum in that initial stroke we don't

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.249 
momentum in that initial stroke we don't
actually<00:01:36.909> have<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.299> physically<00:01:37.899> move<00:01:38.020> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
actually have to physically move the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.080 
actually have to physically move the
stick<00:01:38.619> with<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.889> fingers<00:01:39.280> on<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.609> second<00:01:39.939> and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
stick with the fingers on the second and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.370 
stick with the fingers on the second and
third<00:01:40.119> stroke<00:01:40.569> we<00:01:40.719> don't<00:01:40.899> have<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.109> do<00:01:41.229> you

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
third stroke we don't have to do you

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.819 
third stroke we don't have to do you
know<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.840> rebound<00:01:44.200> technique<00:01:44.560> or<00:01:44.679> anything

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
know the rebound technique or anything

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.410 
know the rebound technique or anything
like<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.069> because<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:45.729> should<00:01:46.090> just<00:01:46.270> happen

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
like that because it should just happen

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.340 
like that because it should just happen
on<00:01:46.659> its<00:01:46.749> own<00:01:46.899> accord

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
on its own accord

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.199 
on its own accord
so<00:01:47.889> really<00:01:48.159> you're<00:01:48.399> not<00:01:48.459> using<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.909> fingers<00:01:49.179> a

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
so really you're not using the fingers a

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.550 
so really you're not using the fingers a
whole<00:01:49.450> lot<00:01:49.659> when<00:01:49.810> you're<00:01:49.959> using<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.380> Moeller

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
whole lot when you're using the Moeller

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.590 
whole lot when you're using the Moeller
technique<00:01:50.649> if<00:01:51.189> at<00:01:51.399> all<00:01:51.579> but<00:01:51.999> you<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:52.450> still

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
technique if at all but you do still

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.569 
technique if at all but you do still
need<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.109> make<00:01:53.289> sure<00:01:53.439> that<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> notes<00:01:54.009> do<00:01:54.219> fall

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
need to make sure that the notes do fall

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.730 
need to make sure that the notes do fall
in<00:01:54.850> time<00:01:55.119> okay<00:01:55.569> so<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:56.229> don't<00:01:56.469> just<00:01:56.590> do<00:01:56.709> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
in time okay so you don't just do a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.289 
in time okay so you don't just do a
whipping<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.219> forget<00:01:57.579> about<00:01:57.609> it<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.030> still

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
whipping that forget about it you still

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.449 
whipping that forget about it you still
have<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.539> control<00:01:59.109> the<00:01:59.409> that<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.069> second<00:02:00.340> and

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
have to control the that the second and

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.039 
have to control the that the second and
third<00:02:00.579> notes<00:02:00.850> but<00:02:01.119> you're<00:02:01.389> really<00:02:01.689> not<00:02:01.990> doing

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
third notes but you're really not doing

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.929 
third notes but you're really not doing
a<00:02:02.350> whole<00:02:02.380> lot<00:02:02.590> as<00:02:02.889> far<00:02:02.920> as<00:02:03.130> moving<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:03.609> fingers

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
a whole lot as far as moving the fingers

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.879 
a whole lot as far as moving the fingers
or<00:02:04.060> anything<00:02:04.209> like<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.319> just<00:02:05.350> get<00:02:05.709> used

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
or anything like that so just get used

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.949 
or anything like that so just get used
to<00:02:05.979> cycling<00:02:06.549> that<00:02:06.670> over<00:02:07.029> the<00:02:07.509> trick<00:02:07.749> with<00:02:07.869> the

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
to cycling that over the trick with the

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.700 
to cycling that over the trick with the
Moeller<00:02:08.170> technique<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.709> think<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.369> make

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
Moeller technique I think is to make

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.860 
Moeller technique I think is to make
so<00:02:09.800> on<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.100> third<00:02:10.130> stroke<00:02:10.760> that<00:02:10.970> you<00:02:11.030> can<00:02:11.630> kind

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so on the third stroke that you can kind

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.750 
so on the third stroke that you can kind
of<00:02:11.930> consider<00:02:12.110> think<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.160> as<00:02:13.340> like<00:02:13.730> a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
of consider think of it as like a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.210 
of consider think of it as like a
preparation<00:02:14.240> stroke<00:02:14.870> because<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.040> on

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
preparation stroke because on that on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.480 
preparation stroke because on that on
the<00:02:16.340> third<00:02:16.550> stroke<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.170> three<00:02:18.740> you

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
the third stroke one two and three you

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.970 
the third stroke one two and three you
want<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.820> be<00:02:19.940> raising<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.840> wrist<00:02:21.080> up<00:02:21.320> getting

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
want to be raising the wrist up getting

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.340 
want to be raising the wrist up getting
that<00:02:22.100> elbow<00:02:22.430> out<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.880> slightly<00:02:23.110> ready<00:02:24.110> for

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
that elbow out just slightly ready for

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.080 
that elbow out just slightly ready for
that<00:02:24.470> next<00:02:24.650> whip<00:02:24.950> okay<00:02:25.520> it's<00:02:25.640> really<00:02:25.820> crucial

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
that next whip okay it's really crucial

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520 
that next whip okay it's really crucial
that<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.840> so<00:02:26.870> that<00:02:27.110> you<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.230> get<00:02:27.440> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
that you do that so that you can get the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.200 
that you do that so that you can get the
whole<00:02:27.680> thing<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.160> cycling<00:02:28.490> over<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:28.970> over

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
whole thing just cycling over and over

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:38.410 
whole thing just cycling over and over
go<00:02:35.230> okay<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.710> don't<00:02:37.070> raise<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.060> wrist<00:02:38.270> on

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
go okay if you don't raise the wrist on

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.240 
go okay if you don't raise the wrist on
the<00:02:38.540> third<00:02:38.750> stroke<00:02:39.080> if<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.800> leave<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.100> down

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the third stroke if you leave it down

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.850 
the third stroke if you leave it down
here<00:02:40.690> well<00:02:41.690> if<00:02:42.110> you're<00:02:42.350> going<00:02:42.440> to<00:02:42.530> be<00:02:42.590> playing

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
here well if you're going to be playing

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.290 
here well if you're going to be playing
it<00:02:43.040> continuously<00:02:43.640> you're<00:02:43.880> not<00:02:44.000> really<00:02:44.150> going

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
it continuously you're not really going

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.940 
it continuously you're not really going
to<00:02:44.390> have<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> whole<00:02:44.750> lot<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.900> time<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.440> raise<00:02:45.890> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
to have a whole lot of time to raise the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.280 
to have a whole lot of time to raise the
wrist<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.580> throw<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:46.850> down<00:02:46.910> again<00:02:47.390> in<00:02:47.750> between

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
wrist and throw it down again in between

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.860 
wrist and throw it down again in between
the<00:02:48.860> last<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.550> third<00:02:49.760> note<00:02:50.030> and<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.630> next

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the last the third note and the next

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.240 
the last the third note and the next
whip<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.320> it's<00:02:51.620> really<00:02:51.800> important<00:02:52.190> that

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
whip so it's really important that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.470 
whip so it's really important that
you're<00:02:52.400> keeping<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.850> motion<00:02:53.210> down<00:02:53.360> the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
you're keeping this motion down the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.210 
you're keeping this motion down the
whole<00:02:53.660> time<00:02:53.900> just<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.860> don't<00:02:54.890> sort

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
whole time just so that you don't sort

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.730 
whole time just so that you don't sort
of<00:02:55.310> slow<00:02:56.060> down<00:02:56.270> or<00:02:56.420> get<00:02:56.570> stuck<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.440> that's<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
of slow down or get stuck so that's the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.230 
of slow down or get stuck so that's the
model<00:02:57.920> technique<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.490> we're<00:02:58.610> using<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.090> as

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
model technique and we're using that as

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480 
model technique and we're using that as
a<00:02:59.540> pattern<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.990> three<00:03:00.080> on<00:03:00.350> the<00:03:00.470> hi-hat<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.220> just

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
a pattern of three on the hi-hat so just

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.000 
a pattern of three on the hi-hat so just
one<00:03:01.910> two<00:03:02.270> three<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:02.990> two<00:03:03.200> three<00:03:03.350> one<00:03:03.830> two

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
one two three one two three one two

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.160 
one two three one two three one two
three<00:03:07.000> push<00:03:08.000> pull<00:03:08.270> technique<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> little

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
three push pull technique is a little

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.450 
three push pull technique is a little
bit<00:03:09.260> different<00:03:09.650> this<00:03:09.830> time<00:03:09.890> we're<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:10.400> to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
bit different this time we're going to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.820 
bit different this time we're going to
play<00:03:10.610> an<00:03:10.910> accent<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.660> then<00:03:11.780> one<00:03:12.140> non<00:03:12.410> accent

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
play an accent and then one non accent

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.070 
play an accent and then one non accent
and<00:03:13.040> then<00:03:13.310> another<00:03:13.700> accent<00:03:14.210> non<00:03:14.690> accent

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
and then another accent non accent

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.410 
and then another accent non accent
accent<00:03:15.500> non<00:03:15.740> accent<00:03:16.130> what<00:03:16.550> we<00:03:16.670> do<00:03:16.820> for<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> non

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
accent non accent what we do for the non

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.360 
accent non accent what we do for the non
accent<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.020> technique<00:03:18.410> actually<00:03:18.560> starts

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
accent the technique actually starts

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.400 
accent the technique actually starts
with<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:19.640> non<00:03:19.820> accent<00:03:20.240> okay<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.600> you<00:03:20.960> can<00:03:21.140> to

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
with the non accent okay so you can to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.020 
with the non accent okay so you can to
think<00:03:21.710> of<00:03:21.770> it<00:03:21.890> backwards<00:03:22.460> in<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.670> sense<00:03:22.910> that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
think of it backwards in the sense that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.270 
think of it backwards in the sense that
the<00:03:23.540> beat<00:03:23.870> though<00:03:24.140> does<00:03:24.650> start<00:03:25.010> with<00:03:25.100> an

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
the beat though does start with an

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.160 
the beat though does start with an
accent<00:03:25.670> but<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.480> learn<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.750> technique

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
accent but just to learn the technique

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.690 
accent but just to learn the technique
for<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.190> non<00:03:28.400> accent<00:03:28.880> you<00:03:29.210> play<00:03:29.960> a<00:03:29.990> stroke<00:03:30.410> and

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
for the non accent you play a stroke and

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.340 
for the non accent you play a stroke and
you<00:03:31.700> release<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.570> stick<00:03:32.840> from<00:03:32.990> your<00:03:33.140> hand

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
you release this stick from your hand

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.110 
you release this stick from your hand
okay<00:03:33.830> so<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.070> comes<00:03:34.130> out<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.610> pretty<00:03:34.820> much<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
okay so it comes out to pretty much the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.600 
okay so it comes out to pretty much the
edge<00:03:35.270> of<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.510> fingers<00:03:35.840> there<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:37.340> that's<00:03:37.520> a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
the wrist slightly so that the edge of

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.270 
the wrist slightly so that the edge of
the<00:03:59.120> hi-hat<00:03:59.600> is<00:04:00.350> played<00:04:00.620> by<00:04:00.800> the<00:04:00.860> shoulder<00:04:01.220> of

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
the stick so it's a thicker sound as

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.570 
the stick so it's a thicker sound as
well<00:04:02.960> as<00:04:03.080> being<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.380> louder<00:04:03.710> sound<00:04:03.860> due<00:04:04.370> to<00:04:04.400> the

finger snap the fingers snap is a really

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:07.990 
finger snap the fingers snap is a really
important<00:04:07.160> thing<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.370> learn<00:04:07.640> you<00:04:07.820> need<00:04:07.940> to

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
important thing to learn you need to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.370

spend a lot of time for sitting there
snapping<00:04:09.740> the<00:04:10.010> stick<00:04:10.220> into<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.520> pan<00:04:10.730> because

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
snapping the stick into the pan because

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.060 
snapping the stick into the pan because
that's<00:04:11.630> something<00:04:11.960> we<00:04:12.050> use<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> lot<00:04:12.620> ok

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
that's something we use a lot ok

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.610 
that's something we use a lot ok
particularly<00:04:13.610> when<00:04:14.390> we<00:04:14.510> don't<00:04:15.020> have<00:04:15.200> rebound

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
particularly when we don't have rebound

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.380 
particularly when we don't have rebound
on<00:04:15.770> our<00:04:15.920> side<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.580> that's<00:04:16.880> what<00:04:17.060> I'm<00:04:17.150> doing

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
on our side so that's what I'm doing

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.920 
on our side so that's what I'm doing
there<00:04:17.570> so

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
there so

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.879 
there so
open<00:04:18.500> close<00:04:19.579> release<00:04:19.970> snap<00:04:20.859> push-pull

open close release snap push-pull

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.260 
open close release snap push-pull
they're<00:04:22.280> three<00:04:22.520> different<00:04:22.550> names<00:04:22.910> for<00:04:23.090> the

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
they're three different names for the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.900 
they're three different names for the
