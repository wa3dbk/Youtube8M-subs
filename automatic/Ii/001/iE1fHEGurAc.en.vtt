 Bones and organs of movement annually 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.789

 with far-reaching consequences for humans 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 with disabilities means one's own

 vehicle a great deal of freedom 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.859
 the physical conditions are 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.590
 from person to person different and 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.350
 must be individually clarified 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.090
 Nowadays, complex conversions are also possible 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.100
 at cars and motorcycles 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.680
 thanks to the technical progress no 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 problem more 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 christoph kunz has been involved in an accident 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.649
 the paraplegic motorbike he has 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.980
 since then numerous successes in the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.690
 top sport celebrated a paralympics 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.460
 in sochi even the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.219
 Gold medal in the giant slalom 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.230
 He has his own family and works 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.729
 trained in the paraplegic center in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.020
 nottwil with eight of his law firm really 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.580
 only formal kaya goal and whispers the reason 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.570
 she that you that she that is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.520
 realize 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.049
 and here's a lot more in powerplay 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 efficiently months rehabilitation of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.420
 made 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 hoof does not explain one for a long time 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.430
 the destiny and the call show what 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.979
 everything is possible and the club itself 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 made and realized that I was filming 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:32.040
 it always happens shortly after the accident 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 just an idea of ​​mobility 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.509
 is for me a crucial factor 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.290
 for integration and independent 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.170
 and he has to step out after weeks before 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.079
 the agitation with a hall on the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.409
 boot vehicle and that just the same 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.869
 independence and tridonic seeking 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.689
 Still needs for training 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.350
 sustainable and and teammate and maxi 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.270
 and underestimates yes with vehicle 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.950
 moment at the boat 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 in combination with shale gas reason for 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.069
 the road despite braking mechanical 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.440
 systems paid directly and movable 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.569
 automatic vehicle purchased and the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.260
 and that is very straightforward and with 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.739
 which one is flexible and very important 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.140
 is it that you do not go forward that 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.780
 the limits in the head where you yourself 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.489
 the feeling something there so that is sitting 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.510
 the show was considered a factor 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.709
 but that you try limit slot 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.019
 so important to me they do the 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.370
 then mobility is always at the very beginning yet 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.640
 no idea how that is when 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.489
 to drive at all 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.780
 the experiences make and so 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.849
 realize that much more possible than 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.470
 that said to us after his 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.099
 destiny immersion mainka 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.099
 imagine 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.450
 also age-related phenomena such as 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.430
 the decrease in vision can be the cause 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.340
 for a restriction in everyday life and in the 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.799
 Road traffic has to follow 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.420
 regular visits to physicians and sight tests 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.480
 is above all the healthy one 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.049
 common sense asked 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.909
 In the end everybody has to 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.299
 road users to safety in 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.739
