and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.490> coming<00:01:56.760> back<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.970> make<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.299> more

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
and then coming back to make it more

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.390 
and then coming back to make it more
challenging<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.619> move<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.040> single

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
challenging you just move on to a single

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:08.059 
challenging you just move on to a single
leg<00:01:59.520> variation<00:02:06.140> okay<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.350> you're<00:02:07.680> adding<00:02:07.799> more

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
leg variation okay as you're adding more

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.499 
leg variation okay as you're adding more
and<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.340> weight<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.850> you're<00:02:09.420> gonna

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
and more weight to that you're gonna

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
and more weight to that you're gonna
want<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> have<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.470> add<00:02:10.649> more<00:02:11.009> pressure

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
want to have to really add more pressure

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000 
want to have to really add more pressure
to<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> plate<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.450> push<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.680> pull<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
to the plate to push it back and pull it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.320 
to the plate to push it back and pull it
forward<00:02:14.040> which<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.790> make<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.120> more

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
forward which is going to make that more

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.360 
forward which is going to make that more
challenging<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.020> really<00:02:16.590> engage<00:02:16.920> your<00:02:17.130> core

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
challenging and really engage your core

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
single leg just do the sign amount of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.290 
single leg just do the sign amount of
repetitions<00:02:23.069> for<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.370> leg<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:23.970> move<00:02:24.180> to
