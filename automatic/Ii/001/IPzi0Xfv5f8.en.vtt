00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you can you can get it loose plastic

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.330 
you can you can get it loose plastic
clips<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.159> each<00:01:44.310> end<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.810> there's<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.890> metal

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
screw that uses 3/8 socket that's about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
screw that uses 3/8 socket that's about
it<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.700> adjustment<00:01:58.850> adjustment

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
it and then the adjustment adjustment

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.810 
it and then the adjustment adjustment
screws<00:02:00.950> adjustment<00:02:01.950> bolts<00:02:03.860> also<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:05.040> 3/8<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
screws adjustment bolts also use 3/8 but

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.290 
screws adjustment bolts also use 3/8 but
you<00:02:05.939> need<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.270> use<00:02:06.360> open<00:02:06.750> end<00:02:06.930> wrench<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:09.149> be

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you need to use open end wrench to be

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.510 
you need to use open end wrench to be
able<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.629> fit<00:02:09.810> into<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.140> spot<00:02:10.440> otherwise<00:02:10.860> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
able to fit into that spot otherwise you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.640 
able to fit into that spot otherwise you
have<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> remove<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> tire<00:02:13.129> so<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.160> think

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
have to remove the tire so I think

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.479 
have to remove the tire so I think
that's<00:02:16.650> about<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:19.830> think<00:02:19.890> cost<00:02:20.280> you

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
that's about it and I think cost you

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.760 
that's about it and I think cost you
once<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.480> don't<00:02:21.629> have<00:02:21.840> any<00:02:21.989> more<00:02:22.170> adjustment

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
once you don't have any more adjustment

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.610 
once you don't have any more adjustment
on<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.550> plate<00:02:23.879> you<00:02:24.270> just<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.470> replace

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
on this plate you just have to replace

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.970 
on this plate you just have to replace
the<00:02:26.040> belt<00:02:26.569> at<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.810> point<00:02:28.140> but<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.709> belt

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the belt at that point but this belt

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.110 
the belt at that point but this belt
seems<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.520> be<00:02:29.700> okay<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.830> drive<00:02:31.830> belt<00:02:32.160> for

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
seems to be okay for now drive belt for

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.059 
seems to be okay for now drive belt for
the<00:02:33.269> wheels<00:02:33.480> doesn't<00:02:34.019> seem<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:34.709> any

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
the wheels doesn't seem to have any

00:02:35.069 --> 00:03:01.059 
the wheels doesn't seem to have any
adjustment<00:02:35.730> but<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:58.290> pretty<00:02:58.590> tight

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.119 

deflection<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:03.110> less<00:03:04.110> than<00:03:04.349> 1/2<00:03:04.560> inch<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.099> think

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
deflection is less than 1/2 inch I think

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.339 
deflection is less than 1/2 inch I think
both<00:03:05.730> ways<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.480> want<00:03:06.659> to<00:03:06.810> say<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> we'll<00:03:09.989> see<00:03:10.200> how

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
both ways I want to say so we'll see how

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.610 
both ways I want to say so we'll see how
that<00:03:10.409> works<00:03:11.599> so<00:03:12.599> that<00:03:12.750> covers<00:03:12.959> it

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that works so that covers it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.440 
that works so that covers it
hopefully<00:03:15.260> ok<00:03:16.260> bye
