00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.579
 a lot 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.150
 a lot 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.369
 m 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.369
 a lot 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.640
 11 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.279
 today the 5th year students of the management school of Grenoble and 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.449
 Annecy of the coup 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.519
 preparation day for the international competition for 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.300
 Friday 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.000
 one day at the end of which only ten of them will be 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.320
 selected then it's for the students it's 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.320
 difficult day 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.570
 not easy 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.810
 to face professionals 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.130
 everyone 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.140
 one century ago 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 montebourg is even worse 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.220
 in France this is not what you will undertake the relationship between 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.220
 a group of students who passed the contest finally 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 gl I think that m 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 good luck 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 I do not like a lot of imported cucumbers 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.370
 the looters style 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.200
 it is made up of professionals from the business world 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.210
 coaching and marketing training 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 demers place to action 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 it's not easy 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.660
 so what 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.990
 on a project or a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.430
 besides master of all that know how to do the team is running on 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.020
 fire 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.119
 we can understand 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 as for the contents of the supermarket 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.790
 so 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 in the soul 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.929
 2 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:41.019
 so 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.189
 we must not forget on the other hand 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.009
 note that the arrangement did not improve 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.039
 it's natural 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.929
 previously 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.229
 in addition to being part of their experience 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.229
 that's why we have to take points to take 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.639
 haaretz so individuals 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.179
 regular activities 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.289
 the triathlete the academic team 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.859
 the alliance 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.549
 these past five years this 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.549
 gerrard should see the day 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.849
 the commercial field 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.609
 sometimes by in the contradiction what we made a mistake but I think 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:19.709
 it's great 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.709
 it's hard 

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:28.009
 strong competition 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.129
 the french president 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.729
 3 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.529
 this confinement there this 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.599
 the French 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.869
 that's why in more important 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:46.119
 that's good 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:49.119
 a winner or 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.779
 late wins 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.779
 c 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.089
 unless it was at its height in the contact center 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.689
 I am on 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.249
 Internet 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.309
 victory in a row 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.309
 the rates 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:41.909
 yesterday morning 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.909
 the beginning of summer 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.749
 ap 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:56.620
 2 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.749
 a lot 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:03.529
 the scientific school 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.400
 a first point that yesterday 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.259
 ability to think about e-commerce and sales 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:16.320
 he proposed I must be proud over several years 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.879
 at this moment 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.830
 develop skills know-how after five years 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.979
 will allow students 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.029
 relatively easily this time of the 90s market 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.909
 resignation then first job 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:36.109
 the second point to 1 5% currently applying to the students side 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:38.599
 to accompany them to the neck 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.199
 I think of the company 38 francs for the preparation of the competition before 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.449
 the dauphiné do it 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:47.469
 until the end accompany them so that during the competition 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:50.469
 are part of the team still students stalls 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.089
 the third point at 6% 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.969
 the feast so it's trade trades these are trades where he 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.400
 enough to know how to speak not at all but they developed 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.330
 in his small I think including the toolbox of the founder 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.230
 who can pretend 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.780
 a little uncomfortable at first because you have to learn for them 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.689
 studios imagi not in the trade must learn 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:15.519
 actually from the moment they are stateless many are the students 

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:20.369
 who at the end of their mission my turn around first job 10 happily 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:22.759
 that I had learned from toddlers of the seller because I do not have time 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:25.740
 to go out running negotiations why 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:32.120
 lemétayer opposite ansa a lack of pedagogical documentation 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.550
 and especially 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.639
 two animators france 3
