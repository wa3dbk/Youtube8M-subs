00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.059
 look into a hidden world that 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.230
 human eye takes in the movie flowing 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.520
 movements from 24 images per second was 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.189
 Water fountains like this one is the first 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 super slow motion visible to one 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.840
 special camera allows such 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.890
 pictures stefan know she's all the way 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890
 built according to his ideas 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.970
 can happen in a second 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.580
 We subsequently stretch to 40 seconds 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.839
 so will be from a rather unspectacular 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.260
 water passage a sensational 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.260
 hingucker 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.979
 meter high splashing water flying 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.020
 Mud is the high speed camera 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:22.930
 predestined for spectacular offroad 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:25.000
 recordings she is not designed for 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.560
 but as certain things designed 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.909
 to record in high speed and 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.720
 then a great effect to have one 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.640
 Super slow motion to drift the car 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:40.899
 everything has to be perfect to capture 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.580
 light sharpness and the driving maneuver after 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.680
 every shot is controlled by stefan vajs 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.300
 the picture on the laptop at film or 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.039
 advertising makes this effort meaningful 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:02:02.259
 however, the camera is only suitable 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:02:04.840
 of course for very special motives 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.470
 elegant from the technical effort is 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.539
 enormously 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.670
 the camera hangs over a meter long cable 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.049
 on a laptop because she does not draw 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.810
 on film but on a four gigabyte 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.239
 big hard disk per second 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.579
 shoots at scam 1000 frames 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.950
 strung like a daumenkino revealed 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.780
 This then a super slow motion for three 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:29.410
 piece needs stefan vajs and three 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 hour working worth checking out 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.560
 off-road area 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.880
 Normally you can see the mud first 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.100
 after he has one on his face 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.440
 is too late to dodge 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.010
 would be with this camera you can see him 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.010
 already in the approach
