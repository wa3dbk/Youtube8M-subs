a Bentley claims are making a what is it

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.840 
a Bentley claims are making a what is it
I<00:02:16.530> can't<00:02:16.800> even<00:02:16.860> think<00:02:17.010> at<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.280> time<00:02:17.670> machine

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
I can't even think at a time machine

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.240 
I can't even think at a time machine
which<00:02:18.690> I'm<00:02:19.050> glad<00:02:19.290> how<00:02:19.470> they<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.800> rolled<00:02:20.130> with

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
which I'm glad how they just rolled with

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.280 
which I'm glad how they just rolled with
that<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.790> make<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:20.970> really<00:02:21.360> good<00:02:21.390> story<00:02:22.140> line

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that to make a really good story line

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.800 
that to make a really good story line
and<00:02:22.760> it's<00:02:23.760> gonna<00:02:24.210> be<00:02:24.330> really<00:02:24.540> cool<00:02:24.750> to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
and it's gonna be really cool to

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.030 
and it's gonna be really cool to
actually<00:02:24.900> meet<00:02:25.260> all<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> Cooper's<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.920> know

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
I think that I just think it's going to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.850 
I think that I just think it's going to
be<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.600> very<00:02:27.690> well<00:02:28.110> put<00:02:28.230> together<00:02:28.350> game<00:02:28.710> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
playing through this the fill of its

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.650 
playing through this the fill of its
really<00:03:16.710> good<00:03:16.890> i'm<00:03:17.070> not<00:03:17.220> too<00:03:17.400> critical<00:03:17.700> or<00:03:18.180> wow

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
really good i'm not too critical or wow

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.770 
really good i'm not too critical or wow
I<00:03:18.690> actually<00:03:18.959> hit<00:03:19.260> me<00:03:20.090> really<00:03:21.090> looking<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
I actually hit me really looking for the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.750 
I actually hit me really looking for the
graphic<00:03:22.080> design<00:03:22.650> or<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:23.040> game<00:03:23.190> design<00:03:23.459> I<00:03:23.489> mean

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
graphic design or the game design I mean

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.580 
graphic design or the game design I mean
or<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.239> even<00:03:24.420> though<00:03:25.190> what<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.430> word<00:03:27.590> I'm

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
or the even though what is the word I'm

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.170 
or the even though what is the word I'm
not<00:03:28.680> even<00:03:28.890> looking<00:03:28.980> for<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.340> voice<00:03:29.580> acting<00:03:30.060> in

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
not even looking for the voice acting in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.820 
not even looking for the voice acting in
the<00:03:30.270> game<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:30.570> I<00:03:30.720> don't<00:03:31.020> expect<00:03:31.620> them

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
the game because I don't expect them

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.530 
the game because I don't expect them
they<00:03:31.980> had<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> same<00:03:32.400> voice<00:03:32.640> acting<00:03:33.180> back<00:03:33.360> in

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
they had the same voice acting back in

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.520 
they had the same voice acting back in
the<00:03:33.630> 2001<00:03:34.410> mainly<00:03:35.340> because<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:36.060> mean<00:03:36.959> voice<00:03:37.350> I

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
the 2001 mainly because I mean voice I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.870 
the 2001 mainly because I mean voice I
think<00:03:37.739> is<00:03:37.800> actually<00:03:37.920> kind<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.280> easy<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.670> mock

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
think is actually kind of easy to mock

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.490 
think is actually kind of easy to mock
because<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:39.510> you've<00:03:39.660> ever<00:03:39.780> heard<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.110> cartoon

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
because if you've ever heard a cartoon

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.280 
because if you've ever heard a cartoon
normally<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:41.160> not<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.370> same<00:03:41.640> one<00:03:42.290> actually

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
normally it's not the same one actually

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.990 
normally it's not the same one actually
even<00:03:43.500> all<00:03:43.680> three<00:03:44.070> slides<00:03:44.370> have<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.670> different

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
even all three slides have a different

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.840 
even all three slides have a different
carmelita<00:03:45.450> voice<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.580> they're<00:03:47.580> not<00:03:47.670> really

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
carmelita voice so they're not really

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.610 
carmelita voice so they're not really
similar<00:03:48.180> either<00:03:48.570> they<00:03:49.140> didn't<00:03:49.290> do<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.440> best

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
similar either they didn't do the best

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.740 
similar either they didn't do the best
job<00:03:49.739> with<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.010> sucker<00:03:50.370> punch<00:03:50.670> but<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.450> didn't

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
job with that sucker punch but it didn't

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.540 
job with that sucker punch but it didn't
take<00:03:51.870> away<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.350> aspect<00:03:52.860> of<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> game<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.430> my

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
take away of the aspect of a game in my

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.660 
take away of the aspect of a game in my
opinion<00:03:53.580> no<00:03:54.060> are<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.989> kidding<00:03:55.200> me<00:03:58.670> alright

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
opinion no are you kidding me alright

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.280 
opinion no are you kidding me alright
but<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.180> should<00:04:00.570> not<00:04:00.720> have<00:04:00.840> actually<00:04:01.140> much

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
but we should not have actually much

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.840 
but we should not have actually much
more<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:01.739> it's<00:04:01.980> not<00:04:02.160> really<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.459> longer<00:04:02.790> a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
more to do it's not really that longer a

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.979 
more to do it's not really that longer a
demo<00:04:03.470> ok<00:04:04.470> I'll<00:04:04.800> pay<00:04:04.950> attention<00:04:05.660> but<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:06.810> you
