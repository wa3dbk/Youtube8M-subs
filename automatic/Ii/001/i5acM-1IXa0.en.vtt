here I can see quite a bit of sediment
and<00:02:40.230> water<00:02:41.130> as<00:02:41.430> well<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.630> just<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.900> good

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
and water as well so it's just a good

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.230 
and water as well so it's just a good
time<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.350> change<00:02:43.500> it

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240

with the diesel fuel and it'll get a

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:06.710 
with the diesel fuel and it'll get a
nice<00:02:52.860> tight<00:02:53.100> seal<00:03:05.030> make<00:03:06.030> sure<00:03:06.209> not<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.510> over

tighten it that's it also make sure that
this<00:03:14.190> seal<00:03:14.459> here<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.480> little<00:03:15.750> wet<00:03:15.989> with

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
this seal here is a little wet with

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:26.090 
this seal here is a little wet with
diesel<00:03:24.110> now<00:03:25.110> I'll<00:03:25.260> tighten<00:03:25.500> up<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.769> filter

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
diesel now I'll tighten up the filter

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.590 
diesel now I'll tighten up the filter
I'll<00:03:26.220> spin<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.489> on<00:03:26.670> but<00:03:26.970> make<00:03:27.090> sure<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.390> this

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
I'll spin it on but make sure that this

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.270 
I'll spin it on but make sure that this
little<00:03:27.660> wire<00:03:28.170> here<00:03:28.500> for<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.709> sediment<00:03:29.130> or

sender<00:03:29.640> doesn't<00:03:30.239> get<00:03:30.450> all<00:03:30.570> twisted<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:33.350> I'll

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
sender doesn't get all twisted up I'll

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.080 
sender doesn't get all twisted up I'll
use<00:03:34.620> my<00:03:34.799> strap<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.220> tighten<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.640> just<00:03:35.670> because

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
use my strap to tighten it just because

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.610 
use my strap to tighten it just because
I<00:03:36.180> can't<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:36.540> get<00:03:36.750> my<00:03:36.900> hand<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.290> there<00:03:37.320> to

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
I can't really get my hand in there to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.580 
I can't really get my hand in there to
give<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.160> good<00:03:38.340> torque<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:40.100> let's<00:03:41.100> try<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
give it a good torque so let's try that

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.870 
give it a good torque so let's try that
I'm<00:03:43.590> not<00:03:43.739> too<00:03:43.890> tight<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.250> just<00:03:44.400> want<00:03:44.549> a<00:03:44.610> little

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
I'm not too tight you just want a little

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.160 
I'm not too tight you just want a little
snug<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.510> got<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.780> able<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.959> get<00:03:46.080> this

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
snug you got to be able to get this

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.990 
snug you got to be able to get this
thing<00:03:46.380> off<00:03:49.070> hook<00:03:50.070> your<00:03:50.220> sender<00:03:50.519> wire<00:03:50.700> back<00:03:50.940> up

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
thing off hook your sender wire back up

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.039 
thing off hook your sender wire back up
now<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.060> need<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.329> get<00:03:54.420> rid<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.630> all<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.930> air

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
now you need to get rid of all the air

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.930 
now you need to get rid of all the air
in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> system<00:03:55.500> because<00:03:55.920> now<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.400> there's

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
in the system because now that there's

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.509 
in the system because now that there's
no<00:03:57.060> fuel<00:03:57.360> in<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.540> filter<00:03:57.959> right<00:03:58.079> now<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.070> use

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
no fuel in that filter right now so use

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.460 
no fuel in that filter right now so use
the<00:03:59.670> primer<00:03:59.910> pump<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.360> top<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.870> just<00:04:01.320> keep

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
the primer pump on top and just keep

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.190 
the primer pump on top and just keep
pumping<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.890> until<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.250> feel<00:04:02.400> good<00:04:02.670> pressure

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
pumping it until you feel good pressure

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.740 
pumping it until you feel good pressure
it's<00:04:04.200> going<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.410> take<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> little<00:04:04.739> while<00:04:05.750> there

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
it's going to take a little while there

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.190 
it's going to take a little while there
we<00:04:06.900> go

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
we go

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.449 
we go
that<00:04:07.410> should<00:04:07.560> do<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.709> so<00:04:08.070> I'm<00:04:08.160> going<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.310> take
