Christian life it is not a habitual
rebellion<00:02:12.750> against<00:02:13.380> God<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:15.209> proof<00:02:15.450> of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
rebellion against God and the proof of

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.170 
rebellion against God and the proof of
that<00:02:15.870> is<00:02:16.109> our<00:02:16.500> next<00:02:16.650> test<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:17.700> are<00:02:17.820> going<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that is our next test we are going to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.289 
that is our next test we are going to
see<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:19.019> sin<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.859> our<00:02:20.280> lives<00:02:21.079> is<00:02:22.079> not

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
see that sin in our lives is not

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.800 
see that sin in our lives is not
necessarily<00:02:24.299> an<00:02:25.549> indicator<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.940> we're<00:02:27.600> lost

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
necessarily an indicator that we're lost

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.729 
necessarily an indicator that we're lost
but<00:02:28.370> our<00:02:29.370> attitude<00:02:30.090> towards<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.959> sin<00:02:31.230> in<00:02:31.260> our

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
but our attitude towards the sin in our

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.729 
but our attitude towards the sin in our
life<00:02:32.010> will<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.820> an<00:02:33.030> indicator<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.989> whether<00:02:34.500> we

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
life will be an indicator of whether we
