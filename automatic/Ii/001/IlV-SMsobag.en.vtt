and inside they have a cardboard

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.859 
and inside they have a cardboard
material<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.459> off<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> little<00:02:09.599> bit

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
material so it's off it's a little bit

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.780 
material so it's off it's a little bit
stiff<00:02:10.110> unless<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.500> break<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.489> know

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
stiff unless you break it in and I know

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.640 
stiff unless you break it in and I know
there's<00:02:12.090> some<00:02:12.420> type<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.629> shaving<00:02:13.110> cream<00:02:13.140> tray

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
there's some type of shaving cream tray

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
there's some type of shaving cream tray
I<00:02:13.680> don't<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:13.980> how<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.280> makes<00:02:14.909> it<00:02:15.090> softer

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
I don't know how that makes it softer

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.869 
I don't know how that makes it softer
but<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.230> seems<00:02:16.439> to<00:02:16.560> work<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:17.310> other<00:02:17.519> people's

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
but it seems to work in other people's

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.539 
but it seems to work in other people's
videos<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:19.530> could<00:02:19.680> try<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.890> if<00:02:20.189> you<00:02:20.340> want

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
videos so you could try that if you want

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.890 
videos so you could try that if you want

so<00:03:55.269> much<00:03:55.420> more<00:03:55.450> thicker<00:03:55.900> it's<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.590> lot<00:03:56.799> heavier

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
so much more thicker it's a lot heavier

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.339 
so much more thicker it's a lot heavier
makes<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.580> feel<00:03:57.730> like<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.360> you're<00:03:58.989> actually

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
holding the belt that's on TV so you

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.360
