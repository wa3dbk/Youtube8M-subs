so important to understand that but in
order<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> volume<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.170> need<00:00:49.350> the

length and they need the product it's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
length and they need the product it's
misapplication<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.399> product<00:00:53.789> sometimes<00:00:54.120> why

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
misapplication of product sometimes why

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.639 
misapplication of product sometimes why
they<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.570> choose<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.170> use<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> product

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
going to help them to get lift with

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.679 
going to help them to get lift with
something<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.009> short<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:30.240> remember

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
something that's so short so remember

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.230 
something that's so short so remember
two<00:01:30.930> things<00:01:30.960> number<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.829> leave<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:33.030> links

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
two things number one leave some links

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.660 
two things number one leave some links
so<00:01:33.570> you're<00:01:33.689> able<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.020> create<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.680> volume<00:01:35.070> if

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so you're able to create the volume if

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
so you're able to create the volume if
she<00:01:35.939> says<00:01:36.180> well<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.390> want<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.780> shorter<00:01:37.320> make<00:01:37.770> her

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
she says well I want it shorter make her

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.740 
she says well I want it shorter make her
understand<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> only<00:01:38.850> way<00:01:38.970> she's<00:01:39.360> gonna<00:01:39.540> get

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
understand the only way she's gonna get

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.600 
understand the only way she's gonna get
the<00:01:39.930> volume<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.439> not<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> round<00:01:41.369> brush

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the volume is not with a round brush

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.330 
the volume is not with a round brush
because<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.060> round<00:01:42.299> brush<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.780> too<00:01:43.110> large<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.979> go

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because a round brush is too large to go

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280 
because a round brush is too large to go
underneath<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> volume<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
underneath to get the volume with the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
underneath to get the volume with the
hair<00:01:46.409> being<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:46.799> short<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.640> important<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
hair being so short it's important that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
hair being so short it's important that
they<00:01:48.360> rely<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.720> product<00:01:49.229> now<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:49.770> probably

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
they rely on product now you're probably

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.590 
they rely on product now you're probably
