each side of the the under flap there
these<00:00:42.600> legs<00:00:42.930> can<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> broken<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.430> with

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
these legs can be broken you know with

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.819 
these legs can be broken you know with
your<00:00:44.820> hands<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.360> you'd<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.930> like<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> use

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
your hands if you'd like I like to use

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.850

I've<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.700> some<00:00:47.910> lobster<00:00:48.559> shears<00:00:49.559> here

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
I've got some lobster shears here

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.979 
I've got some lobster shears here
they've<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.520> stubby<00:00:51.030> blades<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.809> they're

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
they've got stubby blades and they're

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.069 
they've got stubby blades and they're
not<00:00:52.949> real<00:00:53.309> broad<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.360> they're<00:00:54.480> firm<00:00:54.780> enough

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
not real broad but they're firm enough

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.350 
not real broad but they're firm enough
that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.590> use<00:00:55.770> them<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that you can use them to to get in and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.569 
that you can use them to to get in and
around<00:00:57.629> these<00:00:57.840> guys<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.410> they're<00:00:59.309> starting

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
around these guys and they're starting

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.099 
around these guys and they're starting
enough<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> through<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> show<00:01:00.750> quite

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
enough to get through that show quite

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.060 
enough to get through that show quite
efficiently<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:03.080> what<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> usually<00:01:04.350> try<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.799> do

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
efficiently so what I usually try to do

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.520 
efficiently so what I usually try to do
first<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.909> come<00:01:06.600> around<00:01:06.810> each<00:01:06.990> side<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
first is come around each side of the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.340 
first is come around each side of the
flap<00:01:08.119> on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.180> underneath<00:01:09.720> side<00:01:09.990> from<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
flap on the underneath side from the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.109 
flap on the underneath side from the
back<00:01:10.560> end<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.990> cut<00:01:12.990> apart<00:01:14.119> without

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
back end here and cut apart without

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.810 
back end here and cut apart without
going<00:01:15.600> too<00:01:15.780> deeply<00:01:17.330> similar<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.549> cuts

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
going too deeply similar to the cuts

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
going too deeply similar to the cuts
that<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.330> grocery<00:01:21.810> stores<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that you see in grocery stores and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:34.399 
that you see in grocery stores and
restaurants<00:01:31.280> okay<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> we've<00:01:33.810> made<00:01:33.840> two<00:01:34.140> cuts

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
restaurants okay so we've made two cuts

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.810 
restaurants okay so we've made two cuts
go<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.829> direction<00:01:35.869> we'll<00:01:36.869> separate<00:01:37.320> this

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
go in this direction we'll separate this

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.600 
go in this direction we'll separate this
with<00:01:38.820> our<00:01:39.000> fingers

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.609 

take<00:01:45.610> off<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.940> under<00:01:46.150> flap<00:01:46.420> there<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.530> I'm

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
take off the under flap there and I'm

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.350 
take off the under flap there and I'm
just<00:01:47.740> gonna<00:01:47.890> kind<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.250> gently<00:01:48.549> break<00:01:49.090> those

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
just gonna kind of gently break those

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.660 
just gonna kind of gently break those
just<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:49.990> little<00:01:50.260> bit<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.560> get<00:01:50.680> them<00:01:50.799> separated

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
just a little bit to get them separated

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.880 
just a little bit to get them separated
as<00:01:52.540> you<00:01:52.810> can<00:01:52.930> see<00:01:53.170> they're<00:01:53.380> coming<00:01:53.500> apart

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
as you can see they're coming apart

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.539 
as you can see they're coming apart
pretty<00:01:54.220> easy<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.950> that's<00:01:57.100> always<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.430> good

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
pretty easy and that's always a good

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:59.340 
pretty easy and that's always a good
sign<00:01:57.850> that<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.240> crab<00:01:58.570> itself<00:01:59.020> has<00:01:59.200> been

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
sign that the crab itself has been

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.070 
sign that the crab itself has been
steamed<00:02:00.000> fully<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.330> chilled<00:02:01.630> down<00:02:01.840> as

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
steamed fully and chilled down as

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.480 
steamed fully and chilled down as
quickly<00:02:02.320> as<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.619> needs<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.979> be<00:02:03.070> when<00:02:03.399> the

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
quickly as it needs to be when the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.830 
quickly as it needs to be when the
separates<00:02:03.970> real<00:02:04.210> nice<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.630> easy<00:02:04.750> like<00:02:05.050> that

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
separates real nice and easy like that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.050 
separates real nice and easy like that
so<00:02:07.840> there's<00:02:08.050> one<00:02:08.259> section<00:02:08.679> there<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:11.440> we<00:02:11.530> go

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
so there's one section there there we go

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.640 
so there's one section there there we go
so<00:02:13.060> there's<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.840> right<00:02:13.989> in<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.200> left<00:02:14.410> half

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
so there's the right in the left half

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.250 
so there's the right in the left half
and<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.760> here's<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> underside<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:17.050> well

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and then here's the underside as well

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.210 
and then here's the underside as well
now<00:02:18.450> along<00:02:19.450> with<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.750> head<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.230> body<00:02:20.380> we

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
now along with the head and the body we

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.160 
now along with the head and the body we
