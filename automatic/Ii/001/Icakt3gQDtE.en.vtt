00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.313
 The best thing to say is about cystic fibrosis treatment 

00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:06.513
 depending on how it manifests in different organ systems. 

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:09.602
 So go ahead and start with GIT (digestive system). 

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.333
 I want to get started, 

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.300
 because I remembered once taking care of a CF boy. 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.105
 as I drive caring for a boy with CF. Before he ate anything, 

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:20.680
 breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.914
 we had to give him pills in the pills. 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.309
 Not that it's hard to eat, 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.871
 but it just stopped me that he wouldn't eat anything without them, 

00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:31.112
 because of all the nutrients of the food 

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:34.373
 they would be wasted without the enzymes that help them digest. 

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:36.707
 So remember - our pancreas, 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.340
 therefore her head helps us to spend by 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.272
 that secretes enzymes that will help absorb 

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:47.239
 sugars, fats and proteins from our diet. 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.265
 Maybe you think, I thought, 

00:00:48.265 --> 00:00:51.213
 that absorption takes place in the gut, and you're right. 

00:00:51.213 --> 00:00:55.581
 So deliberately, if I can paint it properly. 

00:00:55.581 --> 00:01:00.271
 Here's the stomach ... stomach. 

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.801
 And here's the intestines. 

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.471
 I just paint it like that. It's one big doodle. 

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:09.701
 And you're right. Nutrients are absorbed in the digestive tract ... 

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.281
 ... and go into the blood. But the pancreas is responsible 

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:16.271
 for excreting enzymes that help break down. 

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:18.871
 For example, protein is difficult to break down. 

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.801
 Without enzymes, the intestines would not be able to 

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.577
 nothing to do with food. 

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:26.511
 In cystic fibrosis, this system is clogged 

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.414
 and we can't clean it ... 

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:29.366
 ...yet. 

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:32.066
 But what we can do is create artificial enzymes 

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.131
 that look like those that produce the pancreas. 

00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:37.535
 You just give them to a man to eat them. 

00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:39.873
 In this way, we try to replace the natural process, 

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.574
 which does not work 

00:01:41.574 --> 00:01:44.834
 in patients with cystic fibrosis. 

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.100
 Just to the turn, the little boy we looked after, 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.436
 he also had to pay attention to calories, 

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:53.676
 because despite the enzymes and taking a lot of food, 

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:57.006
 it is hard for him to keep his weight. 

00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:00.796
 Even to the digestive tract - the pancreas also produces insulin. 

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:01.576
 We paint it. 

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:04.400
 He helps us regulate the blood sugars. 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.880
 Not everyone with CF has a problem 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.875
 with insulin, but when they have, 

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.141
 we call it CF-bound diabetes. 

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:16.040
 If necessary, we treat them for diabetes 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.346
 and we give them insulin, but again, 

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.672
 this is not the case with every patient. 

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:23.103
 Next, we say something about the lungs. 

00:02:23.103 --> 00:02:25.809
 The lungs are not only often affected by CF, 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.211
 but here we also meet 

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.547
 with high mortality. 

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:32.706
 Basically CF was a childhood disease 

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:35.636
 because not many children have grown up. 

00:02:35.636 --> 00:02:37.876
 Fortunately, this changed with the onset of therapy, 

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:40.036
 which we are talking about 

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:42.306
 but still there are many lung infections, 

00:02:42.306 --> 00:02:43.946
 which are characterized by thick mucus. 

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:45.606
 The bacteria are trapped there. 

00:02:45.606 --> 00:02:47.936
 It is the perfect environment for them to grow. 

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.876
 It is not uncommon for people with CF 

00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:52.396
 they suffered one pneumonia after another. 

00:02:52.396 --> 00:02:53.746
 This is very demanding for the body 

00:02:53.746 --> 00:02:55.416
 and people can die of it. 

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:58.416
 Many CF patients need to 

00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:01.676
 wear this vest for about half an hour a day. 

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:02.116
 I'll try to draw it. 

00:03:02.116 --> 00:03:04.176
 Looks like a big bulletproof vest. 

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:09.167
 It's heavy and has tubing connected here 

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:11.601
 which lead to the device 

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.503
 like a big vacuum cleaner, and when you turn it on, 

00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:17.841
 so it all starts to tremble. 

00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:20.180
 It seems
