00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.029 
to kind of sanitize it give it a
bacteria<00:06:40.469> or<00:06:41.360> if<00:06:42.360> you<00:06:43.289> squeeze<00:06:43.800> your

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
bacteria or if you squeeze your

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.939 
bacteria or if you squeeze your
blackhead<00:06:44.610> or<00:06:44.909> stuff<00:06:45.719> like<00:06:45.810> that<00:06:45.930> I<00:06:46.349> would<00:06:46.740> use

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
blackhead or stuff like that I would use

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.029 
blackhead or stuff like that I would use
a<00:06:46.979> stringent<00:06:47.430> n<00:06:47.940> toner<00:06:48.270> I<00:06:48.680> think<00:06:49.680> this<00:06:49.830> is

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
a stringent n toner I think this is

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.769 
a stringent n toner I think this is
really<00:06:50.310> good<00:06:50.669> one<00:06:50.819> because<00:06:50.849> I<00:06:51.360> finished<00:06:51.690> the

00:06:51.769 --> 00:06:51.779 
really good one because I finished the

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:52.610 
really good one because I finished the
whole<00:06:51.930> bottle<00:06:51.960> and

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
whole bottle and

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:57.140 
whole bottle and
I<00:06:52.650> kind<00:06:53.250> of<00:06:53.310> like<00:06:53.550> it<00:06:54.350> but<00:06:55.550> do<00:06:56.550> I<00:06:56.610> say<00:06:56.910> it's

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
I kind of like it but do I say it's

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.980 
I kind of like it but do I say it's
really<00:06:57.600> good<00:06:57.840> I<00:06:58.700> like<00:06:59.700> this<00:06:59.970> one<00:07:00.240> more<00:07:00.420> I<00:07:00.720> mean

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
really good I like this one more I mean

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.350 
really good I like this one more I mean
it's<00:07:01.350> a<00:07:01.470> different<00:07:01.680> thing<00:07:01.860> but<00:07:02.220> this<00:07:02.970> one<00:07:03.180> that

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
it's a different thing but this one that

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.050 
it's a different thing but this one that
is<00:07:03.480> really<00:07:03.750> good<00:07:03.960> okay<00:07:04.490> that's<00:07:05.490> it<00:07:05.670> for<00:07:05.910> now
