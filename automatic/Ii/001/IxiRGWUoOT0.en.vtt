00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 we continue from the workshop I'm 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.760
 concilia brother 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.719
 good I brought a little bit of mixture between 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.500
 origami some and holes that are called 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.529
 here and in brazil for example is a musician 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 musician with brazil in the flowers clear 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.199
 these are some hydrangea with fabric or with 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.320
 cloth the leaves are made in cloth once 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.230
 yes and these are smaller and this 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.230
 also part all of a piece of cloth and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.630
 that we see in the flowers and then the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.730
 flowers so they are individual that 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.250
 can apply in this case what produces 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.430
 in a wipe but you can apply 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.710
 in anything so it's like a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 origami is like a unit died to me 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.800
 with clear fabric because it is a fold that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.410
 is made in cloth then this is a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.710
 origami but this cloth if you want to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.520
 I show you how to do it 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 like that flower although we started with 2 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.540
 are two measures one more one more 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 big we are now going to do it 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.150
 larger the square of which 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 we start is 6 centimeters and the other 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.620
 the youngest one of this one is 5 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.330
 centimeters 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.340
 what happens that costs me because what 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.050
 handled in inch two inches and two 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.420
 inches you have to be the account because 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.210
 I said in centimeters it costs me good 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.240
 we started from the little square the squared 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 we're going to fold not right in the middle that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.219
 pass a little 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.250
 and that 's how sewing is alive 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.810
 hidden and you do not see on the edge that is 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.850
 can you tell him to take classes then 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.670
 after we have it that way we doubled it 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.740
 we fold it in half and we're going to 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.649
 We will make a little pill 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.659
 yes and we will continue is that each 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.390
 It has five clear petals then 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.750
 we continue the pastillita 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.420
 and we are celebrating as if they were 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.729
 pearls then we do the hem 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:14.300
 a tiny community like that until you arm 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.200
 the light flower and we are gathering and we are going 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.270
 is adjusting so that it frowns a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.640
 I'll put it a little bit here 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.020
 that there is there is not wanted 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.800
 stay like this 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.080
 and we are doing it is clear here 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.260
 we have and they are closing and go beyond 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.430
 I close this 56 so you can see 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.310
 how is the shape and we close the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.900
 we work is awesome things 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.450
 that can be done another one demonstrated the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.860
 little eyes and then this one left you 5 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.070
 it is also but it is a little bit more 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.800
 big then either stick it or bank 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.790
 being one up help from the other 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.830
 then here you can apply a button 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.290
 detail or you can do it with a 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.110
 hole that are history I'm going to 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.840
 show how the yoyo is done is a 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.130
 meaning to the word and I, I, I 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.920
 is the one that is traditional then in the 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.790
 circle with that dress are two circles 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.890
 cut and are cooked the opposite this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.750
 that is their minds and hands the organs 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.280
 are the links sometimes just the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.320
 Heel very well and there are two together 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.720
 you have a little circle left then 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.750
 you have it as it is clear that you are going 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.190
 accommodating if you see clear 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.880
 and we are also cooking 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:48.380
 we are doing like this and you are leaving this 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.360
 little flower that is here in the middle 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.570
 we can also put that on you see what 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.090
 complacent that we are growing like this and 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.180
 another one that I want to show you quickie if 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.180
 him although the same me the leaf 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.540
 We doubled the milestone in four 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.530
 we opened it we doubled it in 46 we passed 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 the pastillita and also the ojito was 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.960
 that is bigger there you can go 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.410
 arming with larger weapons and 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.810
 The bouquet of this order is a hole that 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.640
 It was cooked like a little flower and you put it on 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.860
 stuffed bottles to that I 'll tell you 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.930

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.700
 this one but the descended and then of 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.920
 How good is this infinity of things 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.920
 I want to show you why this is a 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.080
 catalog that you have and guarachas of their 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.700

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.760
 countless things that can be done 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.410
 a peace and this must be something should not 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.129
