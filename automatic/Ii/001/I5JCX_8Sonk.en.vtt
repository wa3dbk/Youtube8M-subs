00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
know kudos to the g17 there we got it's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
know kudos to the g17 there we got it's
a<00:00:57.300> 24<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> 168<00:00:58.469> millimetre<00:00:58.920> seven<00:00:59.280> times<00:00:59.520> zoom

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
a 24 to 168 millimetre seven times zoom

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
a 24 to 168 millimetre seven times zoom
so<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.899> comparison<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.800> my

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
so you know in comparison again to my

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.789 
so you know in comparison again to my
Alex<00:01:02.190> 100<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.180> longer<00:01:03.449> zoom<00:01:03.780> Alex<00:01:04.199> 100<00:01:04.619> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
Alex 100 it's a longer zoom Alex 100 is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.310 
Alex 100 it's a longer zoom Alex 100 is
a<00:01:04.830> 24<00:01:05.640> -<00:01:05.729> 75<00:01:06.240> millimeter<00:01:06.659> equivalent<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.260> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
a 24 - 75 millimeter equivalent this is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.789 
a 24 - 75 millimeter equivalent this is
a<00:01:07.470> 24<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> 168<00:01:08.640> millimeter<00:01:09.119> equivalent<00:01:09.799> so

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
a 24 to 168 millimeter equivalent so

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.570 
a 24 to 168 millimeter equivalent so
brighter<00:01:11.750> faster<00:01:12.750> lens<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> longer<00:01:13.920> reach

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
brighter faster lens with a longer reach

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.960 
brighter faster lens with a longer reach
in<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> zoom<00:01:15.619> super<00:01:16.619> UD<00:01:17.070> lens<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.850> just

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
in the zoom super UD lens so that's just

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.840 
in the zoom super UD lens so that's just
saying<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.299> know<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.479> should<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.810> decent

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
saying you know it should be a decent

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.080 
saying you know it should be a decent
quality<00:01:20.850> lens<00:01:21.439> decent<00:01:22.439> resolving<00:01:23.130> power<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
quality lens decent resolving power and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.020 
quality lens decent resolving power and
decent<00:01:24.600> characteristics<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> elements

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
decent characteristics and the elements

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
decent characteristics and the elements
digit<00:01:27.030> 6<00:01:27.299> plus<00:01:27.540> we've<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> newer<00:01:28.140> digit

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
digit 6 plus we've got the newer digit

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.749 
digit 6 plus we've got the newer digit
processing<00:01:28.950> system<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.430> should<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.700> able

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
processing system so it should be able

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.580 
processing system so it should be able
to<00:01:29.880> handle<00:01:30.270> all<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.680> enhancements<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
to handle all of the enhancements to the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.190 
to handle all of the enhancements to the
resolution<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.570> video<00:01:36.570> codecs<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
resolution and the video codecs and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.920 
resolution and the video codecs and
things<00:01:37.409> like<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.130> know<00:01:38.250> newer<00:01:38.579> faster

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
things like that you know newer faster

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.289 
things like that you know newer faster
pipeline<00:01:39.930> basically<00:01:40.530> large<00:01:41.460> one-inch<00:01:41.939> sensor

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
pipeline basically large one-inch sensor

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.840 
pipeline basically large one-inch sensor
so<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.619> we're<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.189> comparison<00:01:44.670> here

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so you know we're on in comparison here

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.810 
so you know we're on in comparison here
to<00:01:44.880> something<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> F<00:01:45.479> said<00:01:46.399> 1000<00:01:47.399> or<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
to something like the F said 1000 or the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.600 
to something like the F said 1000 or the
rx100<00:01:48.390> we're<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:48.869> up<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.220> know<00:01:50.250> micro

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
rx100 we're not up to a you know micro

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330 
rx100 we're not up to a you know micro
four-thirds<00:01:51.119> size<00:01:51.869> sensor<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.070> where

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
four-thirds size sensor so that's where

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.580 
four-thirds size sensor so that's where
the<00:01:53.579> lx100<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.450> gonna<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> advantage<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the lx100 is gonna have the advantage or

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
the lx100 is gonna have the advantage or
you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> got<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.340> micro<00:01:56.610> 4/3<00:01:56.939> sensor

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
you know you got a micro 4/3 sensor

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
you know you got a micro 4/3 sensor
significantly<00:01:57.960> bigger<00:01:58.110> than<00:01:58.229> 1<00:01:58.500> inch<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
significantly bigger than 1 inch and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920 
significantly bigger than 1 inch and
they're<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.280> packing<00:01:59.790> super<00:02:00.360> mega<00:02:00.540> pixels

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
they're not packing super mega pixels

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
Alex 100 and you know pretty comparable

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.459 
Alex 100 and you know pretty comparable
to<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:06.899> you're<00:02:07.049> getting<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.350> of

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
top-of-the-line micro four-thirds I've

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960 
top-of-the-line micro four-thirds I've
been<00:02:10.470> very<00:02:10.649> happy<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.220> myself<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.730> think

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

been very happy with it myself I think
you're<00:02:12.239> gonna<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.870> better<00:02:13.110> image

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you're gonna see it is better image

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.800 
you're gonna see it is better image
out<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.159> camera<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.609> the<00:02:14.700> Alex<00:02:14.909> 100<00:02:15.269> over<00:02:15.689> the

when it was the g11 even or g12
not<00:03:19.470> something<00:03:19.769> I'd<00:03:19.859> probably<00:03:20.040> consider

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
not something I'd probably consider

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.369 
not something I'd probably consider
anymore<00:03:20.849> not<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.060> what's<00:03:21.629> you<00:03:22.169> know<00:03:22.260> the
