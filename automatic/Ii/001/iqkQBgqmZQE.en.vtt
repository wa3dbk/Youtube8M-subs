00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
first step we have this tool I think if

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.509 
first step we have this tool I think if
you<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> claw<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:21.960> either<00:00:22.230> end<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.949> that

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you have a claw on either end and that

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.029 
you have a claw on either end and that
claw<00:00:23.820> goes<00:00:24.660> into<00:00:26.960> into<00:00:27.960> holes<00:00:28.260> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> side<00:00:29.010> of

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
claw goes into into holes on the side of

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.389 
claw goes into into holes on the side of
the<00:00:29.990> slot<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.679> side<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.930> fitting<00:00:34.399> you

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the slot on the side of the fitting you

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.979 
the slot on the side of the fitting you
really<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.880> need<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.420> lot<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.719> people

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
really don't need that a lot of people

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.209 
really don't need that a lot of people
talk<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.410> how<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.710> don't<00:00:37.920> need<00:00:38.070> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
talk about how you don't need that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.030

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the back of looks like it's the one that

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
the back of looks like it's the one that
we<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> back<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.059> there's

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
these Springs and that pushes a little

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.060 
these Springs and that pushes a little
lock<00:00:50.100> button<00:00:50.870> down<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.800> slide

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
lock button down so that it will slide

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.410 
lock button down so that it will slide
forward<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.820> long<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.360> good

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.280 
to pull that forward this you still need
to<00:01:02.190> push<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> even<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> tool<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.539> lot<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.810 
that I was able to get more grip with
the<00:01:18.659> tool<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> from<00:01:20.369> autozone

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820

and now let me talk about the next

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.359 
and now let me talk about the next
problem<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:36.030> why<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.270> hose<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> cut<00:01:37.369> alright

problem and why the hose is cut alright

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
problem and why the hose is cut alright

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so if you follow this hose and we'll

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.899 
so if you follow this hose and we'll
just<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.549> camera<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> I

clip part and you can see how it works
it<00:02:07.770> basically<00:02:08.220> as<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.759> compresses<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.890> loosens

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
it basically as it compresses it loosens

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.199 
it basically as it compresses it loosens
a<00:02:10.950> grip<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.520> both<00:02:11.700> sides<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.180> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
a grip and it's on both sides so you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.840 
a grip and it's on both sides so you
have<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.540> hold<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.930> from<00:02:13.110> either<00:02:13.230> side<00:02:13.850> and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
have to hold that from either side and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.540 
have to hold that from either side and
then<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> other<00:02:15.390> side<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:17.100> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
then on the other side it's kind of a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.750 
then on the other side it's kind of a
fancy<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:19.080> guess<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.770> more<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.220> quick

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
fancy I guess that's more of a quick

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.020 
fancy I guess that's more of a quick
disconnect<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.540> called<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.870> spring<00:02:22.110> set

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
disconnect and is called a spring set

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230 
disconnect and is called a spring set
very<00:02:24.030> fancy<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.370> when<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.520> fully<00:02:26.790> open

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
very fancy in that when it's fully open

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.449 
very fancy in that when it's fully open
and<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.570> comes<00:02:27.780> fully<00:02:28.080> open<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.590> this<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.370> you

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
and it comes fully open like this so you

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.610 
and it comes fully open like this so you
can<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.730> how<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:29.970> works<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:30.480> has<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:32.660> pin<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:34.020> hole

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
can see how it works it has a pin a hole

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.880 
can see how it works it has a pin a hole
here<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.250> pin<00:02:35.550> on<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.450> prong<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.739> when

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
here and a pin on this prong so when

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.070 
here and a pin on this prong so when
it's<00:02:38.040> fully<00:02:38.250> open<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.760> locks<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.600> release

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
it's fully open it locks in a release

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.560 
it's fully open it locks in a release
position<00:02:40.770> so<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.580> way<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.970> push<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.420> on

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.630 

lift<00:02:45.570> up<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.170> pin<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.610> a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
lift up on this pin just with a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.300 
lift up on this pin just with a
screwdriver<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.380> will<00:02:49.470> instantly<00:02:49.769> spring

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
screwdriver and it will instantly spring

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.520 
screwdriver and it will instantly spring
close<00:02:50.550> be<00:02:51.239> kind<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.450> nice<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.600> push<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.170> left

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
close be kind of nice you push on left

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.910 
close be kind of nice you push on left
spring<00:02:52.920> getting<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.640> off<00:02:53.790> however<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.680> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
spring getting it off however if it's a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.000 
spring getting it off however if it's a
chore<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.970> it's<00:02:57.150> quite<00:02:57.420> heavy<00:02:57.600> duty<00:02:58.019> and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
chore because it's quite heavy duty and

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.800 
chore because it's quite heavy duty and
I<00:02:59.400> couldn't<00:02:59.790> quite<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.239> in<00:03:00.420> there<00:03:00.570> with<00:03:00.720> the

I couldn't quite get in there with the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.449 
I couldn't quite get in there with the
pliers<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.590> what<00:03:01.800> I'm<00:03:01.890> going<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.070> do<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.340> I'm

going to take a screwdriver under the
one<00:03:04.890> in<00:03:05.040> there<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.489> kind<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.790> twist<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
one in there and just kind of twist it

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.930 
one in there and just kind of twist it
and<00:03:06.360> break<00:03:06.570> it<00:03:06.600> until<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.230> until<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.340> off<00:03:08.519> now

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and break it until it until it's off now

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.170 
and break it until it until it's off now
what's<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:14.100> same<00:03:14.370> part<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.000> had

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
what's this this is the same part it had

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.229 
what's this this is the same part it had
the<00:03:15.329> same<00:03:15.510> crimp<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.440> same<00:03:16.709> metal<00:03:17.700> crimp<00:03:18.000> on

the same crimp the same metal crimp on

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.620 
the same crimp the same metal crimp on
it<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.890> old<00:03:20.010> part<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.150> what<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.299> did

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
it and is the old part and what I did

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.990 
it and is the old part and what I did
because<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.230> week<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:22.680> what<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.370> thought<00:03:23.670> out

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
because the week was what I thought out

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.920 
because the week was what I thought out
that<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.870> hose<00:03:25.140> here<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.010> bad<00:03:26.190> crimp

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that the hose here and just a bad crimp

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.850 
that the hose here and just a bad crimp
I<00:03:27.930> took<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.860> grinder<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.820> ground<00:03:30.650> from<00:03:31.650> this

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
I took a grinder and ground from this

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.479 
I took a grinder and ground from this
point<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.610> this<00:03:32.760> point<00:03:33.530> cutting<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.680> cutting

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
point to this point cutting it cutting

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.699 
point to this point cutting it cutting
it<00:03:35.579> mostly<00:03:36.000> off<00:03:36.209> now<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.079> grinder<00:03:37.500> goes

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
it mostly off now if a grinder goes

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.009 
it mostly off now if a grinder goes
through<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:39.019> through<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.049> metal<00:03:40.549> crimp<00:03:42.019> to

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
through the through the metal crimp to

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.229 
through the through the metal crimp to
the<00:03:43.140> hose<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.590> would<00:03:43.709> get<00:03:43.890> your<00:03:44.070> hose<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.180> I

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
the hose it would get your hose and so I

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.000 
the hose it would get your hose and so I
stopped<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:45.720> about<00:03:46.140> where<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.530> starts<00:03:46.860> to

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
stopped just about where it starts to

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.780 
stopped just about where it starts to
turn<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:49.049> I<00:03:49.079> didn't<00:03:49.350> cut<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> down<00:03:49.799> part<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.730> I

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
turn so I didn't cut the down part and I

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.670 
turn so I didn't cut the down part and I
just<00:03:50.970> wiggled<00:03:51.299> until<00:03:51.570> it<00:03:51.660> came<00:03:51.840> off<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
just wiggled until it came off and that

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.910 
just wiggled until it came off and that
exposed<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.610> hose<00:03:53.940> which<00:03:54.269> has<00:03:54.480> kind<00:03:55.410> of<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.709> um

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
exposed this hose which has kind of a um

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
exposed this hose which has kind of a um
barb<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:57.720> then<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.959> put<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:59.180> hose<00:04:00.350> just<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.940> one

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
barb and so then I put a hose just a one

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.470 
barb and so then I put a hose just a one
of<00:04:03.060> those<00:04:03.180> worm<00:04:03.959> type<00:04:04.370> clamps<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.239> it's

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
of those worm type clamps on it and it's

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.150 
of those worm type clamps on it and it's
still<00:04:06.660> linked<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.560> reason<00:04:07.859> why<00:04:07.980> it's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
still linked and the reason why it's

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.930 
still linked and the reason why it's
still<00:04:08.280> leak

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
still leak

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.120 
still leak
is<00:04:09.150> actually<00:04:09.540> there's<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.230> hole<00:04:10.500> in<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.860> bottom

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
is actually there's a hole in the bottom

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.250 
is actually there's a hole in the bottom
of<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.340> connector<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.180> see<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.690> calcium

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
of the connector you can see the calcium

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.650 
of the connector you can see the calcium
deposits<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:14.760> that's<00:04:15.000> where<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.300> leak<00:04:15.480> was

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
deposits so that's where the leak was

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.320 
deposits so that's where the leak was
from<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.200> I<00:04:16.230> couldn't<00:04:16.560> save<00:04:17.400> myself<00:04:17.610> any<00:04:18.060> money

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
from so I couldn't save myself any money

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.560 
from so I couldn't save myself any money
I<00:04:18.620> had<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:19.739> buy<00:04:19.890> the<00:04:19.950> whole<00:04:20.070> new<00:04:20.340> fitting<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.299> I

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
I had to buy the whole new fitting and I

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.160 
I had to buy the whole new fitting and I
probably<00:04:21.840> could<00:04:22.140> cut<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.680> one<00:04:22.890> off<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:24.170> then

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
probably could cut this one off and then

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.200 
probably could cut this one off and then
do<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.530> hose<00:04:25.680> clamp<00:04:26.040> that<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:27.000> know<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
do the hose clamp that you know you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.510 
do the hose clamp that you know you
really<00:04:27.540> hate<00:04:28.020> to<00:04:28.200> waste<00:04:28.380> this<00:04:28.620> nicely

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
really hate to waste this nicely

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.910 
really hate to waste this nicely
designed<00:04:29.880> hose<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:30.930> I'll<00:04:31.080> just<00:04:31.260> take<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.680> time

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
designed hose so I'll just take the time

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.660 
designed hose so I'll just take the time
to<00:04:33.500> put<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> whole<00:04:34.770> piece<00:04:35.010> on<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.550> do<00:04:35.640> it

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
to put the whole piece on and do it

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.310 
to put the whole piece on and do it
properly<00:04:38.660> hmm<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.710> if<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.370> were<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:42.120> try<00:04:43.050> in

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
properly hmm the if you were to try in

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.720 
properly hmm the if you were to try in
by<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.990> hose<00:04:45.990> from<00:04:47.510> autozone<00:04:49.190> they<00:04:50.190> have<00:04:50.400> one

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
by the hose from autozone they have one

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.840 
by the hose from autozone they have one
that<00:04:51.000> rotates<00:04:51.780> around<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:52.950> point<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.790> I

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
that rotates around to this point and I

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.840 
that rotates around to this point and I
guess<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.180> hose<00:04:54.420> clamp<00:04:54.810> at<00:04:55.770> this<00:04:56.100> point<00:04:56.460> and

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
guess you hose clamp at this point and

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.280 
guess you hose clamp at this point and
you<00:04:56.880> don't<00:04:57.690> use<00:04:57.930> your<00:04:58.140> spring<00:04:58.920> clamp<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:01.140> if

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
you don't use your spring clamp and if

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.650 
you don't use your spring clamp and if
you<00:05:01.440> look<00:05:01.680> at<00:05:01.800> this<00:05:02.040> it's<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.120> straight<00:05:03.390> tube

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
you look at this it's a straight tube

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.930 
you look at this it's a straight tube
there's<00:05:03.960> no<00:05:04.110> barb<00:05:04.470> and<00:05:04.830> it's<00:05:05.250> rather<00:05:05.460> slippery

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
there's no barb and it's rather slippery

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.090 
there's no barb and it's rather slippery
it's<00:05:06.390> aluminum<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.170> I<00:05:07.590> kind<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.860> had<00:05:07.980> the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
it's aluminum and I kind of had the

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.690 
it's aluminum and I kind of had the
feeling<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.750> it<00:05:09.750> would<00:05:10.710> squeeze<00:05:11.400> too

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
feeling that it would squeeze too

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.159 
feeling that it would squeeze too
tightly<00:05:12.000> on<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.390> aluminum<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.050> might

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
tightly on this aluminum and might

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.470 
tightly on this aluminum and might
deform<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.830> and<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.610> really<00:05:14.910> didn't<00:05:15.150> like<00:05:15.270> the

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
deform it and I really didn't like the

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.150 
deform it and I really didn't like the
idea<00:05:15.510> of<00:05:15.810> just<00:05:15.900> putting<00:05:16.380> a<00:05:16.440> hose<00:05:16.620> clamp<00:05:16.860> on

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
idea of just putting a hose clamp on

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.159 
idea of just putting a hose clamp on
there<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.590> did<00:05:20.130> think<00:05:20.430> of<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:21.570> l-shaped

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
there so I did think of the l-shaped

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.800 
there so I did think of the l-shaped
line<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.590> they<00:05:22.680> also<00:05:22.860> have<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.970> putting<00:05:24.600> a

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
line that they also have and putting a

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.180 
line that they also have and putting a
hose<00:05:25.169> clamp<00:05:25.350> here<00:05:26.750> if<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:28.020> was<00:05:28.620> further<00:05:28.860> and

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
hose clamp here if it was further and

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.500 
hose clamp here if it was further and
you<00:05:29.250> wanted<00:05:29.490> to<00:05:29.520> save<00:05:29.730> yourself<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.240> thirty

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
you wanted to save yourself to thirty

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.240 
you wanted to save yourself to thirty
nine<00:05:30.780> dollars<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.290> just<00:05:31.410> one<00:05:31.560> get<00:05:31.890> the<00:05:32.010> ten

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
nine dollars and just one get the ten

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.200 
nine dollars and just one get the ten
dollar<00:05:33.050> one<00:05:34.050> from<00:05:34.400> autozone<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.730> reuse<00:05:36.030> your

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
dollar one from autozone and reuse your

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.290 
dollar one from autozone and reuse your
fitting<00:05:36.630> but<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.410> problem<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:38.010> they<00:05:38.340> have<00:05:38.370> bow

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
fitting but the problem is they have bow

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.750 
fitting but the problem is they have bow
rings<00:05:39.630> inside<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.200> here<00:05:40.440> those<00:05:41.130> earnings<00:05:41.580> go

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
rings inside of here those earnings go

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.360 
rings inside of here those earnings go
bad<00:05:41.970> as<00:05:42.150> well<00:05:42.360> so<00:05:43.230> they<00:05:43.350> start<00:05:43.770> leaking<00:05:43.980> at

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
bad as well so they start leaking at

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.700 
bad as well so they start leaking at
this<00:05:44.580> point<00:05:44.910> which

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
this point which

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.740 
this point which
be<00:05:46.710> another<00:05:47.040> situation<00:05:47.370> where<00:05:48.000> water<00:05:48.390> comes

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
be another situation where water comes

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.540 
be another situation where water comes
out<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.230> he<00:05:49.800> said<00:05:50.010> there's<00:05:50.220> an<00:05:50.340> o-ring

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
out and he said there's an o-ring

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.090 
out and he said there's an o-ring
replacement<00:05:51.450> kit<00:05:51.690> but<00:05:52.260> not<00:05:52.440> available<00:05:52.920> for

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
replacement kit but not available for

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.950 
replacement kit but not available for
this<00:05:53.220> fitting<00:05:53.610> I<00:05:53.820> don't<00:05:54.210> know<00:05:54.300> if<00:05:54.390> that<00:05:54.570> was<00:05:54.750> to

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
this fitting I don't know if that was to

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.770 
this fitting I don't know if that was to
sell<00:05:55.200> me<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:56.760> part<00:05:57.030> but<00:05:57.240> since<00:05:57.420> there<00:05:57.660> was<00:05:57.750> a

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
sell me the part but since there was a

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.270 
sell me the part but since there was a
hole<00:05:58.020> in<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.260> bottom<00:05:58.590> really<00:05:58.770> didn't<00:05:59.190> matter

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
hole in the bottom really didn't matter

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.370 
hole in the bottom really didn't matter
but<00:05:59.970> that<00:06:00.060> might<00:06:00.300> be<00:06:00.330> another<00:06:00.780> solution<00:06:01.050> that

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
but that might be another solution that

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.260 
but that might be another solution that
we<00:06:01.590> just<00:06:01.770> replaced<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.310> hose<00:06:03.120> over<00:06:03.450> and<00:06:03.720> kit

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
we just replaced the hose over and kit

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.870 
we just replaced the hose over and kit
if<00:06:06.270> that<00:06:06.480> is<00:06:06.660> a<00:06:06.690> possibility<00:06:07.260> and<00:06:07.790> there<00:06:08.790> you

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
if that is a possibility and there you

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.410 
if that is a possibility and there you
got<00:06:09.060> it

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
got it

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.390 
got it

which hose you have this hose here has a

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.330 
which hose you have this hose here has a

the<00:06:32.460> return<00:06:32.790> one's<00:06:33.090> the<00:06:33.240> supply<00:06:33.600> not<00:06:34.440> quite

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
the return one's the supply not quite

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.170 
the return one's the supply not quite
sure<00:06:34.680> which<00:06:35.010> is<00:06:35.190> which<00:06:35.340> to<00:06:35.610> be<00:06:35.700> honest

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
sure which is which to be honest

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.520 
sure which is which to be honest
except<00:06:36.900> for<00:06:37.910> referring<00:06:38.910> to<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.120> diagram<00:06:39.530> the

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
except for referring to the diagram the

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.930 
except for referring to the diagram the
lower<00:06:40.800> one<00:06:41.190> is<00:06:41.930> this<00:06:42.930> one<00:06:43.230> not<00:06:43.650> the<00:06:43.890> top<00:06:44.130> on<00:06:44.430> the

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
lower one is this one not the top on the

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.790 
lower one is this one not the top on the
diagram<00:06:45.390> so<00:06:46.010> this<00:06:47.010> passenger<00:06:47.880> side<00:06:48.800> equals

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
diagram so this passenger side equals

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.930 
diagram so this passenger side equals
the<00:06:49.920> bottom<00:06:50.520> one<00:06:50.730> in<00:06:51.150> the<00:06:51.930> image<00:06:52.320> on<00:06:52.560> the<00:06:53.400> Ford

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
the bottom one in the image on the Ford

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.860 
the bottom one in the image on the Ford
comm<00:06:54.750> and<00:06:55.490> when<00:06:56.490> I<00:06:56.520> was<00:06:56.700> at<00:06:56.850> Ford<00:06:57.210> dealer<00:06:57.660> I

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
comm and when I was at Ford dealer I

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.580 
comm and when I was at Ford dealer I
actually<00:06:58.470> took<00:06:58.770> a<00:06:58.830> picture<00:06:58.920> of<00:06:59.400> it<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:01.050> I<00:07:01.350> told

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
actually took a picture of it and I told

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.990 
actually took a picture of it and I told
him<00:07:01.770> it<00:07:01.860> was<00:07:01.950> a<00:07:01.980> large<00:07:02.250> one<00:07:02.490> and<00:07:02.700> they<00:07:02.760> still

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 
him it was a large one and they still

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.080 
him it was a large one and they still
ordered<00:07:03.330> the<00:07:03.420> wrong<00:07:03.540> part<00:07:03.960> and<00:07:04.200> he<00:07:05.160> said<00:07:05.400> oh<00:07:05.580> he

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
ordered the wrong part and he said oh he

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.380 
ordered the wrong part and he said oh he
ordered<00:07:06.590> the<00:07:09.320> the<00:07:10.320> upper<00:07:10.740> upper<00:07:11.490> diagram<00:07:12.120> one

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.390 
ordered the the upper upper diagram one

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.380 
ordered the the upper upper diagram one
you<00:07:12.930> would<00:07:13.050> think<00:07:13.230> this<00:07:13.470> outside<00:07:14.400> is<00:07:14.880> upper

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390 
you would think this outside is upper

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.860 
you would think this outside is upper
but<00:07:16.320> actually<00:07:16.830> outside<00:07:17.340> was<00:07:17.670> lower<00:07:18.330> in<00:07:18.660> the

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
but actually outside was lower in the

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.660 
but actually outside was lower in the
diagram<00:07:19.260> so<00:07:19.860> maybe<00:07:20.070> that<00:07:20.280> will<00:07:20.340> help<00:07:20.490> you

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:20.670 
diagram so maybe that will help you

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:23.830 
diagram so maybe that will help you
order<00:07:20.970> the<00:07:21.090> right<00:07:21.210> part<00:07:21.540> if<00:07:21.720> you<00:07:21.870> need<00:07:22.050> to<00:07:22.730> yeah

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 
order the right part if you need to yeah

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.210 
order the right part if you need to yeah
the<00:07:24.840> diagram<00:07:25.290> also<00:07:25.470> shows<00:07:25.650> when<00:07:26.010> going

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:26.220 
the diagram also shows when going

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.560 
the diagram also shows when going
straight<00:07:26.520> to<00:07:26.640> the<00:07:26.670> water<00:07:26.910> pump<00:07:27.210> and<00:07:27.300> they<00:07:27.420> both

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:27.570 
straight to the water pump and they both

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.360 
straight to the water pump and they both
go<00:07:27.810> kind<00:07:28.110> of<00:07:28.200> around<00:07:28.440> and<00:07:28.680> behind<00:07:28.770> so<00:07:29.250> we

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
go kind of around and behind so we

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.650 
go kind of around and behind so we
really<00:07:29.700> can't<00:07:29.940> figure<00:07:30.150> out<00:07:30.240> which<00:07:30.420> one's

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
really can't figure out which one's

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.480 
really can't figure out which one's
going<00:07:30.840> to<00:07:30.930> the<00:07:31.080> water<00:07:31.260> pump<00:07:31.530> which<00:07:32.160> one<00:07:32.340> is<00:07:32.430> the

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490 
going to the water pump which one is the

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.860 
going to the water pump which one is the
returned<00:07:32.820> and<00:07:32.970> which<00:07:33.060> ones<00:07:33.270> will<00:07:33.420> supply<00:07:34.550> but

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:35.870 
returned and which ones will supply but

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.440 
returned and which ones will supply but
knowing<00:07:36.870> that<00:07:37.110> the<00:07:37.790> passenger<00:07:38.790> side<00:07:39.030> one<00:07:39.300> is

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:39.450 
knowing that the passenger side one is

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.540 
knowing that the passenger side one is
the<00:07:39.570> same<00:07:39.780> as<00:07:39.960> the<00:07:40.560> lower<00:07:40.770> in<00:07:40.980> the<00:07:41.070> diagram

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:41.550 
the same as the lower in the diagram

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.120 
the same as the lower in the diagram

I<00:07:46.800> hope<00:07:47.220> this<00:07:47.400> video<00:07:47.670> helps<00:07:48.030> I<00:07:48.240> only<00:07:48.690> posted<00:07:49.080> it

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.230 
I hope this video helps I only posted it

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.600 
I hope this video helps I only posted it
because<00:07:49.530> it<00:07:49.650> took<00:07:49.770> me<00:07:49.830> so<00:07:50.100> much<00:07:50.220> time<00:07:50.280> to

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.610 
because it took me so much time to

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.790 
because it took me so much time to
figure<00:07:50.790> out<00:07:51.030> and<00:07:51.300> there<00:07:51.870> was<00:07:52.020> no<00:07:52.080> videos<00:07:52.620> on

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 
figure out and there was no videos on

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.560 
figure out and there was no videos on
YouTube<00:07:53.220> so<00:07:53.760> hopefully<00:07:54.210> this<00:07:54.390> will<00:07:54.510> help

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.570 
YouTube so hopefully this will help

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.110 
YouTube so hopefully this will help
someone<00:07:54.930> else
