it's<00:00:41.340> been<00:00:41.550> fantastic<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:45.360> specs<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it's been fantastic the specs on the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.590 
it's been fantastic the specs on the
board<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.440> 42.5<00:00:47.309> inches<00:00:47.340> long<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.329> 20

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
board it's 42.5 inches long with the 20

9.5<00:00:49.200> inch<00:00:49.410> wheelbase<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.879> larger<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.809> am

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
9.5 inch wheelbase so it is larger I am

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.700 
9.5 inch wheelbase so it is larger I am
6<00:00:52.350> feet<00:00:52.469> tall<00:00:53.870> so<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.079> stance<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
6 feet tall so this stance is

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.299 
6 feet tall so this stance is
essentially<00:00:56.100> perfect<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.760> me<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:58.550> right

essentially perfect for me and right

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.910 
essentially perfect for me and right
right<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.030> pockets<00:01:03.530> that's<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.769> where

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
right here the pockets that's just where

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.719 
right here the pockets that's just where
I<00:01:04.979> keep<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.189> feet<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.760> feels<00:01:06.720> great<00:01:07.670> let<00:01:08.670> me

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I keep my feet and feels great let me

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.740 
I keep my feet and feels great let me
tell<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.330> bit<00:01:09.450> about<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> concave

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
tell you a little bit about the concave

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.580 
tell you a little bit about the concave
it's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.930> very<00:01:13.290> heavily<00:01:13.850> rockered<00:01:14.850> board<00:01:15.590> with

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it's a very heavily rockered board with

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.440 
it's a very heavily rockered board with
a<00:01:16.619> deep<00:01:16.890> tub<00:01:17.189> all<00:01:17.970> throughout<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:22.070> right<00:01:23.070> here

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
a deep tub all throughout and right here

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.499 
a deep tub all throughout and right here
you<00:01:24.450> can<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:26.180> it's<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you can see kind of right there it's the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.999 
you can see kind of right there it's the
newest<00:01:27.990> innovation<00:01:28.619> from<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.400> Boston<00:01:30.150> board

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
newest innovation from the Boston board

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.340 
newest innovation from the Boston board
it's<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> bubble<00:01:32.430> drop<00:01:32.610> concave<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.350> you

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's the bubble drop concave and you

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's the bubble drop concave and you
probably<00:01:34.680> heard<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.280> about<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.729> if<00:01:35.939> you've

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
probably heard a lot about it if you've

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.370 
probably heard a lot about it if you've
researched<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> board<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:39.380> Boston's

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
researched the board at all Boston's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.310 
researched the board at all Boston's
really<00:01:40.680> happy<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> design<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.140> was

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
really happy with the design and I was

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.380 
really happy with the design and I was
to<00:01:43.640> essentially<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.000> did<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.360> they

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to essentially what they did is they

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.319 
to essentially what they did is they
took<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.170> symmetrical<00:01:46.710> top<00:01:47.040> mount<00:01:47.600> idea<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
took the symmetrical top mount idea and

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.179 
took the symmetrical top mount idea and
they<00:01:51.329> added<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.259> would<00:01:52.409> what<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> would<00:01:53.159> feel

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
they added what would what it would feel

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.999 
they added what would what it would feel
like<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.450> drop<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:57.680> just<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> drop

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
like to have a drop or just the drop

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.880 
like to have a drop or just the drop
concave<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.670> not<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> drop<00:02:00.240> mounting

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
concave or not the drop mounting

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.999 
concave or not the drop mounting
obviously<00:02:01.890> um<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> right<00:02:04.229> where<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> bubble

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
obviously um so right where the bubble

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.119 
obviously um so right where the bubble
drop<00:02:05.219> meets<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> deep<00:02:05.880> tub<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> have<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
drop meets the deep tub you have a

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.240 
drop meets the deep tub you have a
beautiful<00:02:08.459> pocket<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:10.140> keep<00:02:10.679> my<00:02:10.830> feet<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.190> in

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
beautiful pocket I keep my feet right in

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
beautiful pocket I keep my feet right in
there

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
there

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.310 
there
and<00:02:12.340> for<00:02:12.640> free-riding<00:02:13.030> especially<00:02:14.020> but<00:02:14.260> also

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
and for free-riding especially but also

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.340 
and for free-riding especially but also
downhill<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:16.330> feel<00:02:16.510> very<00:02:16.810> locked<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.200> and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
downhill you feel very locked in and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.040 
downhill you feel very locked in and
very<00:02:17.500> secure<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.910> very<00:02:19.120> simplistic<00:02:19.360> idea

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
very secure it's a very simplistic idea

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.620 
very secure it's a very simplistic idea
and<00:02:20.970> that's<00:02:21.970> what<00:02:22.090> I've<00:02:22.210> really<00:02:22.600> enjoyed

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and that's what I've really enjoyed

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.210 
and that's what I've really enjoyed
about<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.470> not<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> very<00:02:23.800> complex

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
about it that's not a very complex

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.240 
about it that's not a very complex
concave<00:02:25.740> so<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:28.170> would<00:02:29.170> hope<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:30.130> would

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
concave so I would hope that you would

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.990 
concave so I would hope that you would
want<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.459> try<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.730> board<00:02:31.060> out<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.330> well<00:02:33.000> it's

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
want to try this board out as well it's

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.480 
want to try this board out as well it's
way<00:02:34.450> fun<00:02:34.780> I've<00:02:35.050> been<00:02:35.320> shredding<00:02:35.709> on<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:35.980> it's

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
way fun I've been shredding on it it's

primary function but you can it's fun

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.000 
primary function but you can it's fun
and<00:03:08.770> it's<00:03:09.640> good<00:03:09.700> for<00:03:10.030> dancing<00:03:10.360> as<00:03:10.630> well<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:11.739> far

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
and it's good for dancing as well as far

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.479 
and it's good for dancing as well as far
as<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.190> kick<00:03:12.370> tails<00:03:12.610> go<00:03:13.200> they<00:03:14.200> aren't<00:03:14.860> very

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
as the kick tails go they aren't very

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.910 
as the kick tails go they aren't very
upturned<00:03:16.209> they<00:03:16.480> have<00:03:16.720> almost<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.680> little

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
upturned they have almost like a little

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.539 
upturned they have almost like a little
bit<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.340> drop<00:03:18.670> right<00:03:19.090> here<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:21.190> kind<00:03:21.400> of

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
bit of drop right here it's kind of

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.310 
bit of drop right here it's kind of
weird<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.000> can<00:03:22.150> barely<00:03:22.540> see<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.110> you<00:03:23.170> can

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
weird you can barely see it that you can

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.979 
weird you can barely see it that you can
really<00:03:23.530> feel<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:24.010> when<00:03:24.730> you're<00:03:24.880> riding<00:03:25.180> I

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
really feel it when you're riding I

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.470 
really feel it when you're riding I
would<00:03:28.989> recommend<00:03:29.140> this<00:03:29.500> board<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.799> anyone

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
would recommend this board to anyone

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.930 
would recommend this board to anyone
compared<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.510> other<00:03:31.570> boards<00:03:32.019> I've<00:03:32.170> owned

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
compared to other boards I've owned

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.430 
compared to other boards I've owned
probably<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.060> closest<00:03:34.480> has<00:03:34.660> been<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.110> DK

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
probably the closest has been the DK

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.150 
probably the closest has been the DK
penguin<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:37.000> find<00:03:37.360> this<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.510> be<00:03:38.160> superior

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
penguin and I find this to be superior

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.440 
penguin and I find this to be superior
actually<00:03:41.640> first<00:03:42.640> of<00:03:42.790> all<00:03:42.880> just<00:03:42.940> because<00:03:43.329> of

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
actually first of all just because of

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.680 
actually first of all just because of
the<00:03:43.480> stability<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:45.670> doesn't<00:03:45.730> have<00:03:46.299> a<00:03:46.329> lot<00:03:46.660> of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
the stability it doesn't have a lot of

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.360 
the stability it doesn't have a lot of
flex<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.440> has<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> bit<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.160> wider<00:03:48.340> stance<00:03:48.760> and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
flex it has a bit of a wider stance and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.850 
flex it has a bit of a wider stance and
it's<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.430> very<00:03:51.459> comfortable<00:03:52.239> ride<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:56.230> would

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
it's a very comfortable ride and I would

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.500 
it's a very comfortable ride and I would
highly<00:03:57.100> recommend<00:03:57.130> checking<00:03:57.610> this<00:03:58.000> out<00:03:58.209> and
