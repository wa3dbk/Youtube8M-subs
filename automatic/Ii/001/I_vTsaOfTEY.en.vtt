00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.780 

it's<00:01:00.089> from<00:01:01.089> Central<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:02.190> South<00:01:03.190> southern

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
it's from Central and South southern

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.630 
it's from Central and South southern
Africa<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.909> then<00:01:08.159> taste<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.340> supposed<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.580> be

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
Africa and then taste it supposed to be

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.170 
Africa and then taste it supposed to be
fruity<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:11.170> they<00:01:11.320> take<00:01:11.409> a<00:01:11.470> citrus<00:01:12.010> flavor<00:01:12.340> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
fruity or they take a citrus flavor and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.210 
fruity or they take a citrus flavor and
then<00:01:13.360> we'll<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:13.600> searing<00:01:13.960> heat<00:01:14.200> that<00:01:15.100> is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
then we'll it's searing heat that is

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.110 
then we'll it's searing heat that is
comparable<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.760> a<00:01:15.909> standard<00:01:16.330> habanero<00:01:16.780> so<00:01:17.110> I

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
comparable to a standard habanero so I

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.580 
comparable to a standard habanero so I
guess<00:01:19.120> just<00:01:19.150> move<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.570> up<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.320> heat<00:01:20.500> of

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
guess just move on up the heat of

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.320 
guess just move on up the heat of
habanero<00:01:20.800> maybe<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.640> little<00:01:21.730> bit<00:01:21.880> harder<00:01:22.000> I

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
habanero maybe a little bit harder I

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.170 
habanero maybe a little bit harder I
