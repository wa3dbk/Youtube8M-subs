the<00:02:09.100> way<00:02:09.220> racing<00:02:09.550> is<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.790> guess<00:02:09.940> with<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
the way racing is I guess with the

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.450 
the way racing is I guess with the
history<00:02:11.230> between<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.770> two<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.310> what
