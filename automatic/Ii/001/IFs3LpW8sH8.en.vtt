was sometimes that weight felt felt

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.500 
was sometimes that weight felt felt
heavy<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> left

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
heavy so I left

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.020 
heavy so I left
there<00:02:16.659> and<00:02:16.870> other<00:02:17.830> times<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.310> felt<00:02:18.489> light<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:19.000> I

there and other times it felt light so I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600 
there and other times it felt light so I
i<00:02:19.360> put<00:02:20.260> i<00:02:20.470> bumped<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.829> up<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.069> little<00:02:21.189> bit<00:02:21.370> harm

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
i put i bumped it up a little bit harm

so<00:02:21.909> you<00:02:21.970> had<00:02:22.299> enter<00:02:22.840> workout<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.500> intro

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
so you had enter workout in intro

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.399 
so you had enter workout in intro
workout<00:02:24.489> biofeedback<00:02:25.299> parameters<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.260> were

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
workout biofeedback parameters that were

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.929 
workout biofeedback parameters that were
dictated<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.129> what<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.400> would<00:02:27.640> do<00:02:27.730> mix

that<00:02:35.019> I<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> based<00:02:35.829> everything<00:02:36.250> was

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
that I that I based everything was

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.699 
that I that I based everything was
around<00:02:36.909> was<00:02:37.209> I<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.629> going<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.840> train<00:02:38.200> as<00:02:38.379> often

get you very far but I had enough self

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.439 
get you very far but I had enough self
awareness<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.519> what<00:03:36.669> I<00:03:36.699> was<00:03:36.849> doing<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.239> I

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
awareness of what I was doing that I

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.409 
awareness of what I was doing that I
could<00:03:37.629> I<00:03:37.870> could<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:39.129> could<00:03:39.340> have<00:03:39.699> my<00:03:39.910> template

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
could I could I could have my template

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.089 
could I could I could have my template
essentially<00:03:40.989> what<00:03:41.169> what<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.650> wanted<00:03:42.040> to

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
essentially what what I wanted to

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.460 
essentially what what I wanted to
accomplish<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:43.599> could<00:03:43.810> tell<00:03:44.230> if<00:03:44.379> I

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
accomplish and then I could tell if I

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.720 
accomplish and then I could tell if I
was<00:03:44.620> getting<00:03:44.799> closer<00:03:45.040> or<00:03:45.310> further<00:03:45.459> away<00:03:45.609> from

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
was getting closer or further away from

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.199 
was getting closer or further away from
that<00:03:46.030> goal<00:03:46.239> as<00:03:46.540> I<00:03:47.230> went<00:03:47.379> so<00:03:47.829> let's<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.549> this

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
that goal as I went so let's the in this

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.369 
that goal as I went so let's the in this
segment<00:03:49.419> here<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.959> then<00:03:50.049> in<00:03:50.169> the<00:03:50.260> next

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
segment here and then in the next

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:51.509 
segment here and then in the next
segment<00:03:50.620> we'll<00:03:50.799> get<00:03:50.949> a<00:03:50.980> little<00:03:51.160> more<00:03:51.280> specific

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
segment we'll get a little more specific

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.729 
segment we'll get a little more specific
about<00:03:51.970> above<00:03:52.569> your<00:03:52.720> actual<00:03:53.079> workouts<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
reps deeds and things like that because

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.259 
reps deeds and things like that because
after<00:03:55.989> all<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.010> are<00:03:57.190> probably<00:03:57.760> going<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.150> be<00:03:58.239> a

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
after all you are probably going to be a

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:58.750 
after all you are probably going to be a
world

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
world

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.929 
world
so<00:03:59.420> we'll<00:04:00.319> follow<00:04:00.470> this<00:04:00.769> up<00:04:00.830> with<00:04:00.980> part<00:04:01.400> 3<00:04:01.700> and

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
so we'll follow this up with part 3 and

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.539 
so we'll follow this up with part 3 and
we'll<00:04:02.150> get<00:04:02.299> into<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.569> nitty-gritty<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
we'll get into the nitty-gritty of

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.770 
we'll get into the nitty-gritty of
Kevin's<00:04:04.549> training<00:04:05.239> to<00:04:05.360> win<00:04:05.540> three
