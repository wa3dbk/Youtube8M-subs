for<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.690> TV<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:02.370> world<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:03.090> thinking<00:00:07.010> you're

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
for a TV the world is thinking you're

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.620 
for a TV the world is thinking you're
asking<00:00:08.340> well<00:00:08.700> you<00:00:08.820> answered<00:00:09.059> Polly<00:00:09.480> the

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
asking well you answered Polly the

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.350 
asking well you answered Polly the
question<00:00:09.990> but<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:11.210> understanding<00:00:12.210> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
question but for you understanding the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.169 
question but for you understanding the
brain<00:00:12.570> where<00:00:12.960> does<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.110> exactly<00:00:13.590> mean<00:00:13.920> if<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.519> if

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
brain where does it exactly mean if I if

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.560 
brain where does it exactly mean if I if
there's<00:00:15.389> anything<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:16.020> exactly<00:00:16.680> here<00:00:16.949> yeah

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
there's anything like exactly here yeah

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.939 
there's anything like exactly here yeah
right<00:00:18.570> its<00:00:18.779> there's<00:00:19.080> different<00:00:19.500> levels<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
right its there's different levels of

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.189 
right its there's different levels of
understanding<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.000> may<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.720> giant

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
understanding so it may be that a giant

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.859 
understanding so it may be that a giant
simulation<00:00:23.039> can<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:24.119> quack<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> duck<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
simulation can can quack like a duck and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.630 
simulation can can quack like a duck and
walk<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> duck<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.590> talk<00:00:25.920> like<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> but

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
walk like a duck and talk like it but

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.070 
walk like a duck and talk like it but
it's<00:00:26.849> often<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> case<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.930> make<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it's often the case that we can make a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
it's often the case that we can make a
copy<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.590> something<00:00:28.740> before<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.119> understand

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
copy of something before a we understand

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.959 
copy of something before a we understand
why<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:30.990> works<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.579> recreate

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
why it works you can you can recreate

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.229 
why it works you can you can recreate
something<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.690> takes<00:00:34.140> maybe<00:00:35.120> generations<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
something it takes maybe generations to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.790 
something it takes maybe generations to
figure<00:00:36.420> out<00:00:36.540> why<00:00:36.719> any<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.410> true<00:00:37.559> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
figure out why any of that is true and

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.930 
figure out why any of that is true and
then<00:00:38.399> there's<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.850> deeper<00:00:39.390> question<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
then there's this deeper question of of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
then there's this deeper question of of
private<00:00:41.940> subjective<00:00:42.390> experience<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
private subjective experience and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.139 
private subjective experience and
whether<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:43.829> ever<00:00:44.010> somehow<00:00:44.640> come<00:00:44.969> out

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
whether that will ever somehow come out

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.729 
whether that will ever somehow come out
of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> physical<00:00:45.809> pieces<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.289> parts<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.680> I

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
of the physical pieces of parts and I

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.080 
of the physical pieces of parts and I
think<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> different<00:00:47.850> level

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
think that's just it's a different level

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
think that's just it's a different level
of<00:00:48.149> understanding<00:00:48.800> that<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.920> might<00:00:50.160> not<00:00:50.309> have

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
of understanding that we might not have

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.500 
of understanding that we might not have
the<00:00:50.640> capacity<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.090> wrap<00:00:51.210> our<00:00:51.329> head<00:00:51.480> around

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the capacity to wrap our head around

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
the capacity to wrap our head around
right<00:00:51.870> we've<00:00:52.260> evolved<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.370> operate<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
right we've evolved to to operate a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
right we've evolved to to operate a
particular<00:00:54.390> spatio-temporal<00:00:54.960> scale<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.800> we

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
particular spatio-temporal scale so we

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
particular spatio-temporal scale so we
care<00:00:56.100> about<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.520> know<00:00:56.910> apples<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.510> rabbits

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
care about you know apples and rabbits

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
care about you know apples and rabbits
and<00:00:57.930> mates<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> rivers<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> things<00:00:59.010> like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and mates and rivers and things like

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
and mates and rivers and things like
that<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> that's<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.420> spatio-temporal

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that and that's the spatio-temporal

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
that and that's the spatio-temporal
scale<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.859> operate<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
scale that we operate on and what we

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
scale that we operate on and what we
already<00:01:03.300> know<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.439> look<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.799> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
already know is that when we look at the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.960 
already know is that when we look at the
fabric<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.729> very<00:01:06.150> small<00:01:07.220> atoms<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.580> sub

added it the physics there is such that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
we cannot understand it it is important

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.789 
we cannot understand it it is important

well<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.810> think<00:01:49.170> I'm<00:01:49.649> much<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.310> pragmatic<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
well I think I'm much more pragmatic to

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
well I think I'm much more pragmatic to
that<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.350> you

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that I think that we have to see you

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.530 
that I think that we have to see you
know<00:01:53.040> otherwise<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.670> speculate<00:01:54.060> however

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
know otherwise we can speculate however

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
know otherwise we can speculate however
whether<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> case<00:01:56.009> or<00:01:56.250> not<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
whether that is the case or not and I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.870 
whether that is the case or not and I
think<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.060> when<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.360> come<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.780> theories

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
think that when we come to theories

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
think that when we come to theories
people<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.090> often<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> criticism<00:02:01.530> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
people I often get the criticism that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
people I often get the criticism that
you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.100> cannot<00:02:02.520> understand<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.810> just

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
you know you cannot understand this just

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.959 
you know you cannot understand this just
by<00:02:04.409> building<00:02:04.829> these<00:02:04.920> pieces<00:02:05.219> without<00:02:05.490> really

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
by building these pieces without really

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
by building these pieces without really
knowing<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.509> whole<00:02:06.750> brain<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.110> working

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
knowing how the whole brain is working

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109 
knowing how the whole brain is working
without<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.649> theory<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.520> brain<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> once

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
without a theory of the brain and once

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.369 
without a theory of the brain and once
you<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> theory<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:09.989> brain<00:02:10.200> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
you have a theory of the brain you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.740 
you have a theory of the brain you
should

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
should

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.630 
should
be<00:02:11.170> able<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.650> go<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:12.490> start

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
be able to go in and start

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.330 
be able to go in and start
reconstructing<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.960> that<00:02:14.710> sounds<00:02:15.190> very

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
reconstructing that and that sounds very

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640 
reconstructing that and that sounds very
reasonable<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.420> fact<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.900> know<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.020> theory

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
reasonable but in fact you know a theory

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.250 
reasonable but in fact you know a theory
is<00:02:17.830> based<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:18.310> facts<00:02:18.700> and<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.910> problem<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.990> on

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
is based on facts and the problem I on

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.710 
is based on facts and the problem I on
think<00:02:20.650> about<00:02:21.250> why<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.640> do<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:21.880> have<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.270> theory

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
think about why we do not have a theory

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
think about why we do not have a theory
is<00:02:22.900> because<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.680> just<00:02:23.920> do<00:02:24.130> not<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.580> facts

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
is because we just do not have the facts

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.210 
is because we just do not have the facts
we<00:02:25.330> have<00:02:25.510> even<00:02:26.170> though<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.500> lot<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.100> is

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
we have even though the a lot of it is

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.740 
we have even though the a lot of it is
out<00:02:27.370> there<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:28.000> haven't<00:02:28.300> put<00:02:28.450> them<00:02:28.600> together

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
out there we haven't put them together

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.650 
out there we haven't put them together
we<00:02:29.170> haven't<00:02:29.500> actually<00:02:30.030> assembled<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.209> facts

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
we haven't actually assembled the facts

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.890 
we haven't actually assembled the facts
in<00:02:32.050> order<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.709> begin<00:02:32.940> even<00:02:33.940> seeing<00:02:34.600> what<00:02:34.870> a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
in order to begin even seeing what a

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.699 
in order to begin even seeing what a
theory<00:02:35.350> could<00:02:35.500> look<00:02:35.680> like<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.820> think

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
theory could look like so I think

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.260 
theory could look like so I think
absolutely<00:02:38.709> essential<00:02:39.250> step<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.000> start

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
absolutely essential step is to start

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.620 
absolutely essential step is to start
putting<00:02:40.630> these<00:02:40.750> pieces<00:02:41.020> together<00:02:41.320> and<00:02:42.160> then

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
putting these pieces together and then

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.930 
putting these pieces together and then
when<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.720> comes<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:44.110> what<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:44.940> possibly

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
when it comes to what is it possibly

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.780 
when it comes to what is it possibly
going<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.390> look<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:48.160> that<00:02:48.220> one<00:02:48.760> of

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
going to look like I think that one of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.240 
going to look like I think that one of
the<00:02:49.000> magical<00:02:49.180> things<00:02:49.750> about<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.440> brain<00:02:50.800> that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
the magical things about the brain that

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.000 
the magical things about the brain that
is<00:02:51.430> different<00:02:51.730> from<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.180> computer<00:02:53.080> for<00:02:53.440> example

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
is different from a computer for example

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.960 
is different from a computer for example
is<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.150> is<00:02:55.420> not<00:02:55.989> only<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.950> computer<00:02:57.700> does

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
is that it is not only a computer does

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.330 
is that it is not only a computer does
the<00:02:58.600> calculation<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.620> then<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.160> do

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
the calculation and then you do

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.070 
the calculation and then you do
visualization<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:01.450> we<00:03:01.600> see<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.959> same

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
visualization and we see the same

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
visualization and we see the same
problem<00:03:02.440> when<00:03:02.560> we're<00:03:02.709> trying<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.980> make

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
problem when we're trying to make

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.040 
problem when we're trying to make
supercomputers<00:03:04.030> interactive<00:03:04.600> we<00:03:04.780> want<00:03:04.959> to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
supercomputers interactive we want to

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.680 
supercomputers interactive we want to
make<00:03:05.200> them<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:06.310> submit<00:03:06.790> simulation

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
make them do submit simulation

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.600 
make them do submit simulation
visualization<00:03:08.440> analysis<00:03:08.980> at<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> same<00:03:09.400> time

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
visualization analysis at the same time

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.949 
visualization analysis at the same time
that's<00:03:10.120> what<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.420> brain<00:03:10.630> does<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:11.620> brain<00:03:11.950> is

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
that's what the brain does the brain is

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.650 
that's what the brain does the brain is
visualizing<00:03:13.959> what<00:03:14.320> it's<00:03:14.650> computing<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:16.239> this

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
visualizing what it's computing so this

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.380 
visualizing what it's computing so this
is<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.900> visualization<00:03:17.549> at<00:03:18.549> the<00:03:18.760> same<00:03:18.970> time<00:03:19.180> it's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
is a visualization at the same time it's

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.610 
is a visualization at the same time it's
a<00:03:19.480> computation<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.790> I'm<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.989> is<00:03:23.140> happening

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
a computation and I'm this is happening

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.289 
a computation and I'm this is happening
for<00:03:24.190> me<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.580> looks<00:03:24.820> like<00:03:25.000> it's<00:03:25.150> happening

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
for me it looks like it's happening

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.630 
for me it looks like it's happening
outside<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:26.320> know<00:03:26.470> unless<00:03:26.890> Pink<00:03:27.220> Floyd<00:03:27.459> was

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
outside you know unless Pink Floyd was

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.370 
outside you know unless Pink Floyd was
right<00:03:27.880> but<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.299> was<00:03:28.540> definitely<00:03:28.750> happening

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
right but this was definitely happening

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.360 
right but this was definitely happening
outside<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.049> not<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:32.650> happening

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
outside and but it's not it's happening

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.479 
outside and but it's not it's happening
in<00:03:33.489> my<00:03:33.640> head<00:03:33.930> but<00:03:34.930> I<00:03:34.989> projected<00:03:35.709> out<00:03:35.860> there<00:03:36.190> so

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
in my head but I projected out there so

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.600 
in my head but I projected out there so
how<00:03:36.850> do<00:03:36.910> i<00:03:37.150> get<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.630> correspondence<00:03:38.350> between

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
how do i get the correspondence between

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.000 
how do i get the correspondence between
all<00:03:39.610> this<00:03:39.880> electrical<00:03:40.690> stuff<00:03:41.079> inside<00:03:41.620> and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
all this electrical stuff inside and

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.759 
all this electrical stuff inside and
then<00:03:42.579> suddenly<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:43.150> magical<00:03:43.630> picture<00:03:44.019> so

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
then suddenly this magical picture so

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.009 
then suddenly this magical picture so
there<00:03:45.190> is<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:45.970> challenges<00:03:46.810> and

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
there is a there is the challenges and

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.900 
there is a there is the challenges and
what<00:03:47.410> we<00:03:47.590> have<00:03:47.739> to<00:03:47.890> address<00:03:48.130> start<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.760> become

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
what we have to address start to become

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.610 
what we have to address start to become
clearer<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:49.540> clearer<00:03:49.810> when<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.200> start<00:03:50.470> to

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
clearer and clearer when you start to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.979 
clearer and clearer when you start to
actually<00:03:50.799> put<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.190> together<00:03:51.519> so<00:03:52.030> I<00:03:52.299> agree

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
actually put this together so I agree

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.380 
actually put this together so I agree
with<00:03:53.019> David<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.970> challenges<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.360> know

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
with David that the challenges you know

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.720 
with David that the challenges you know
what<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> theory<00:03:56.470> could<00:03:56.739> look<00:03:57.010> like<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.459> just

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
what a theory could look like is just

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.420 
what a theory could look like is just
not<00:03:57.959> not<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.320> doesn't<00:03:59.500> seem<00:03:59.769> to<00:03:59.920> be<00:04:00.010> anywhere

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
not not it doesn't seem to be anywhere

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.660 
not not it doesn't seem to be anywhere
near<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.970> horizon<00:04:01.120> but<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:02.500> think<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.100> it's

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
near the horizon but I think that it's

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.819 
near the horizon but I think that it's
now<00:04:03.850> going<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.299> be<00:04:04.420> on<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.690> horizon<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:05.590> we

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
now going to be on the horizon if we

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.650 
now going to be on the horizon if we
don't<00:04:05.950> put<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.370> pieces<00:04:06.610> together<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.360> facts

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
don't put the pieces together the facts

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.970 
don't put the pieces together the facts
together<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.380> begin<00:04:08.560> constructing<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:09.700> theory
