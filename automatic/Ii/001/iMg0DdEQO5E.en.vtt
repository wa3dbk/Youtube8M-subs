you<00:05:20.990> would<00:05:21.110> do<00:05:21.229> is<00:05:21.349> you<00:05:21.470> would<00:05:21.500> just<00:05:21.740> take<00:05:22.780> some

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
you would do is you would just take some

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.600 
you would do is you would just take some
of<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.259> pop<00:05:24.530> it<00:05:24.710> on<00:05:24.800> there<00:05:25.039> and<00:05:25.280> then

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
of this and pop it on there and then

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.800 
of this and pop it on there and then
actually<00:05:25.880> do<00:05:25.940> your<00:05:26.030> dark<00:05:26.240> eye<00:05:26.389> shadow<00:05:26.599> and<00:05:26.690> it

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
actually do your dark eye shadow and it

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.960 
actually do your dark eye shadow and it
falls<00:05:27.050> on<00:05:27.289> to<00:05:27.470> here<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:28.550> would<00:05:28.729> fall<00:05:28.940> under

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
falls on to here it would fall under

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.670 
falls on to here it would fall under
everything<00:05:29.389> you<00:05:29.570> could<00:05:29.690> just<00:05:29.840> wipe<00:05:30.380> it<00:05:30.530> off

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
everything you could just wipe it off

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.980 
everything you could just wipe it off
like<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:31.419> because<00:05:32.419> it<00:05:32.570> would<00:05:32.659> have<00:05:32.780> come<00:05:32.900> up

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
like that because it would have come up

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.140 
like that because it would have come up
there<00:05:33.110> it<00:05:33.169> would<00:05:33.289> be<00:05:33.409> list<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.889> anyways<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:34.940> want
