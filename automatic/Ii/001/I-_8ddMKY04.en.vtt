00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.080
 internet you have here you can buy it and 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.520
 change the colors but it costs you a 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.809
 watching them give partridges good vibes for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.610
 that I'm going to pay with scary hours when 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 I can have it for free when the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.380
 sir look less in general jumps from 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.510
 this side car ponent team 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.100
 of reddish yellow which 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.410
 you want and in fact buy it I do not have 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 no more than $ 200 so 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.829
 yes by and I can not have any of this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.489
 but he did not see having this car for the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.720
 bending so let's get out of here and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.979
 we have to go to this location that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 he has it because this man has left 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.700
 helmet we do not just have to go to this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.860
 part of here will surely be 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.420
 this car is a toy and peyron that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.830
 run from laos that we can stay what 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.690
 for us to have it the garage 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.899
 nice cool is more like much more 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.899
 expeditious 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.470
 It is with much mystery that it continues to rise 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:29.119
 curiosities because you want to follow 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.369
 looking at both weapon locations 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.780
 like cars like helicopters 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.890
 whatever it is, it has 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.970
 seemed like a good occasion to 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.979
 introduce you this car that I 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.939
 found out there and one step away from 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.039
 say to see if with the missions 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.960
 secondary that you with an acceptance 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.610
 more or less average so to speak but 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.840
 like me the truth is that I enjoyed 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.670
 doing the mission to keep going up 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.310
 these side missions of gta 5 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.619
 there we will go there to see if we 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.000
 we can not always touch me recording of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.400
 night I do not know why you like autism 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.500
 that does not allow me 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.000
 ladies at night which looks the worst 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.590
 but good if it is not used to make 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.870
 this location and for it is not going to 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.580
 continue with this car the truth we are 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.830
 arriving has to be here in 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.690
 this site right next to this hotel 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.369
 and I think I just ate, win not 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.010
 is here with him, nobody is going to take you 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.960
 a pardon because it does not have to be 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.320
 here and in fact it is not yet you have not 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.550
 paid you see is not there to pretend to have not 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.100
 because they are to the east not sure the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.840
 bugatti sternum is the same has to 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.150
 expose in the morning so we go 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.099
 to wait for dawn 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.500
 Well guys, after half an hour 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.629
 that was pulling me looking for the end here is 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 this car is the consell that the air 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.959
 look for you 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.489
 bukaty the history is that you see coming 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.629
 it 's enough with the muds that 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.069
 has to be car this bonus the 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.769
 of course, that timely 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.079
 Anna Christie travels practically in 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.189
 a car of more than one million dollars 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.010
 as one that we would be looking to put it 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.750
 that is to say that listening seems very 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.220
 randomly you can pull to better 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.659
 not wandering around that's the typical car 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.069
 that appears when he feels like it but 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.109
 it's worth getting a car but 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.329
 because it's very very expensive from those of the 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:04.079
 you already have dollars and we have free 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.280
 free and look what cool is bus I 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.019
 will take a turn so you see it they are not 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.849
 experts come after saving it out there 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.829
 it's going to cost me a bit to get the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.680
 frankie house almost wearing a 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.060
 little round so that we are not judged is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.459
 but it's not that he no longer worried about what 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.560
 You see, it has a pretty high speed 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.689
 from the typical cars that are 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.510
 they move very what you say to you can 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:30.840
 take curves very for example 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.970
 practically with a little but it would be 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.409
 the car Mr. cook to you for a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.239
 million dollars we went through the ass and 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.239
 we had it free if we are going to have 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.319
 to take a couple of turns before being able to 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.450
 get it but good what to do with 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.970
 this car is that everything take it to the 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.950
 franklin area and then already repeat in 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.390
 his house as well as the boys but 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.370
 have liked the video that you vote for 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.829
 more local you do not have curious things in 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.379
 large photo 5 that those 73 were parts 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.909
 and I 've all seen there that there are 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.069
 hidden weapons that we're going to see 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.629
 a big hug and I shot with my 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.629
 mouth aunt party and until the next
