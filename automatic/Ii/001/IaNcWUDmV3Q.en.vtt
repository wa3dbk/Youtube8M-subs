three um as of now day four I do have
some<00:00:12.570> footage<00:00:13.880> yeah<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.660> do<00:00:15.839> indeed<00:00:16.529> have

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
some footage yeah so I do indeed have

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.590 
some footage yeah so I do indeed have
Daphnia<00:00:17.340> hatch<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.789> actually<00:00:18.029> have<00:00:18.359> quite<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
Daphnia hatch I actually have quite a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.410 
Daphnia hatch I actually have quite a
bit<00:00:18.690> um<00:00:19.100> by<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.160> end<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> day<00:00:20.730> three<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.119> had

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
bit um by the end of day three I had

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.550 
bit um by the end of day three I had
about<00:00:21.980> 1/4<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.189> my<00:00:23.400> Daphne<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.880> hatched<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
about 1/4 of my Daphne have hatched and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.160 
about 1/4 of my Daphne have hatched and
so<00:00:25.789> what<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.910> ratio<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.869> in<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
so what the ratio was is that in the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.230 
so what the ratio was is that in the
small<00:00:28.410> container<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:29.099> had<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:29.789> eleven

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
small container I had about eleven

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.749 
small container I had about eleven
hatched<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.349> four<00:00:31.710> hatched<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.460> in

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hatched and about four hatched and in

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.250 
hatched and about four hatched and in
this<00:00:32.940> larger<00:00:33.239> container<00:00:34.100> and<00:00:35.100> then<00:00:36.050> as<00:00:37.050> of

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
this larger container and then as of

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.880 
this larger container and then as of
today<00:00:37.559> day<00:00:37.800> four<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.300> confirmed

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
today day four I have confirmed

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.110 
today day four I have confirmed
approximately<00:00:40.890> twenty<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.730> smaller

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
approximately twenty in the smaller

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.150 
approximately twenty in the smaller
container<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.960> eleven<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> larger

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
container and about eleven in the larger

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
container and about eleven in the larger
container<00:00:44.539> and<00:00:45.539> that's<00:00:45.899> confirmed<00:00:46.350> there's

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
container and that's confirmed there's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.920 
container and that's confirmed there's
probably<00:00:47.070> many<00:00:47.309> many<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> haven't

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
probably many many more that I haven't

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.750 
probably many many more that I haven't
so<00:00:49.620> far<00:00:49.649> sighted<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.489> I've<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.539> 31<00:00:52.140> plus

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
so far sighted so I've about 31 plus

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.200 
so far sighted so I've about 31 plus
Daphnia<00:00:53.760> hatched<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> tremendous<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
Daphnia hatched which is a tremendous a

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
Daphnia hatched which is a tremendous a
tremendously<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.510> hatch<00:00:57.930> rate<00:00:58.230> my<00:00:58.440> eye<00:00:58.469> on

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
tremendously good hatch rate my eye on

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
tremendously good hatch rate my eye on
let's<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.480> some<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> water

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
let's see if you can see some the water

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.690 
let's see if you can see some the water
is<00:01:03.750> indeed<00:01:04.350> cloudy<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.670> just

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
is indeed cloudy because I have just

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.910 
is indeed cloudy because I have just
given<00:01:06.060> them<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> good<00:01:06.810> feeding<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> yeast<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
given them a good feeding of yeast in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.370 
given them a good feeding of yeast in
both<00:01:08.189> both<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.360> hatching<00:01:09.990> containers

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
both both of the hatching containers

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.679 
both both of the hatching containers
I've<00:01:10.619> made<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.430> cloudy<00:01:11.700> enough<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.659> that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
I've made it just cloudy enough so that

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.960 
I've made it just cloudy enough so that
it<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> difficult<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.070> through<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it is difficult to see through but it is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.960 
it is difficult to see through but it is
indeed<00:01:15.659> still<00:01:15.990> transparent<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.850> can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
indeed still transparent so you can

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
indeed still transparent so you can
still<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.710> features<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> opposite<00:01:20.640> side

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
still see features on the opposite side

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.690 
still see features on the opposite side
of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> tank

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
of the tank

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.030 
of the tank
let's<00:01:23.700> see<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.439> definitely

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
let's see but this one it's definitely

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.270 
let's see but this one it's definitely
far<00:01:26.369> more<00:01:26.549> plentiful<00:01:26.880> than<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.420> larger

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
far more plentiful than the larger

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.890 
far more plentiful than the larger
hatching<00:01:29.280> container<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.119> believe<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
hatching container and I do believe the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
hatching container and I do believe the
reason<00:01:31.170> why<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.460> smart

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
reason why is because in this smart

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.499 
reason why is because in this smart
container<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.930> been<00:01:34.140> using<00:01:35.270> spring<00:01:36.270> water

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
container I have been using spring water

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.140 
container I have been using spring water
and<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.740> other<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.220> aquarium<00:01:38.729> water<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and the other one was aquarium water and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.819 
and the other one was aquarium water and
I<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.299> believe<00:01:39.600> ask<00:01:39.990> something<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.619> with

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
I do believe ask something to do with

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.120 
I do believe ask something to do with
the<00:01:41.400> purity<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.329> water<00:01:43.140> quality<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the purity of the water quality that

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.660 
the purity of the water quality that
does<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.680> triggering<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.979> FFO

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
does have to do with triggering the FFO

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.840 
does have to do with triggering the FFO
um<00:01:47.970> or<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:49.140> believe<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.610> fall

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
um or I believe it's at that's the fall

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
um or I believe it's at that's the fall
I'm<00:01:51.329> not<00:01:51.540> quite<00:01:51.750> sure<00:01:52.070> sorry<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.280> probably

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
I'm not quite sure sorry that probably

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.830 
I'm not quite sure sorry that probably
sounds<00:01:53.850> real<00:01:54.000> stupid<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.689> sure

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
sounds real stupid if you're not sure

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.230 
sounds real stupid if you're not sure
what<00:01:54.930> I'm<00:01:55.020> saying<00:01:55.259> but<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
what I'm saying but that is the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.039 
what I'm saying but that is the
terminology<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.960> Daphnia<00:01:58.710> eggs<00:01:59.630> the<00:02:00.630> AIDS

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
terminology for Daphnia eggs the AIDS

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.679 
terminology for Daphnia eggs the AIDS
that<00:02:01.399> when<00:02:02.399> once<00:02:02.880> hydrated<00:02:03.479> hatch<00:02:04.079> out<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.250> um

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
that when once hydrated hatch out so um

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.309 
that when once hydrated hatch out so um
yeah<00:02:06.770> they<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:09.179> believe<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.869> trigger<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
yeah they I do believe the trigger is

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.309 
yeah they I do believe the trigger is
similar<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> triops<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.489> brine<00:02:12.270> shrimp<00:02:12.300> which

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
similar to triops and brine shrimp which

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.520 
similar to triops and brine shrimp which
is<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.829> purity<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.640> water<00:02:14.849> which<00:02:15.530> which

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
is the purity of the water which which

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.580 
is the purity of the water which which
shows<00:02:17.189> to<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:18.530> hatching<00:02:19.849> creatures<00:02:20.849> that<00:02:21.590> it

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
shows to the hatching creatures that it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.899 
shows to the hatching creatures that it
is<00:02:22.889> an<00:02:23.129> incoming<00:02:23.579> rain<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:26.129> believe<00:02:26.639> my

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
is an incoming rain so I do believe my

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.369 
is an incoming rain so I do believe my
heart<00:02:27.060> rate<00:02:27.329> will<00:02:27.510> increase<00:02:27.659> tremendously

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
heart rate will increase tremendously

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.740 
heart rate will increase tremendously
over<00:02:28.889> the<00:02:29.249> next<00:02:29.489> coming<00:02:29.819> days<00:02:29.849> cuz<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.359> do<00:02:30.420> have

a<00:02:50.730> size<00:02:51.590> let's<00:02:52.590> say<00:02:52.769> about<00:02:52.859> one<00:02:53.780> oh<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:55.019> can

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
a size let's say about one oh you can

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:57.800 
a size let's say about one oh you can
see<00:02:55.260> one<00:02:55.379> hopping<00:02:55.709> there<00:02:56.449> you<00:02:57.449> could<00:02:57.629> say

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
see one hopping there you could say

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.030 
see one hopping there you could say
about<00:02:58.079> less<00:02:59.069> than<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.430> millimeter<00:03:00.060> um<00:03:01.040> possibly

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
about less than a millimeter um possibly

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.089 
about less than a millimeter um possibly
a<00:03:02.340> millimeter<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.569> at<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.290> largest<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:04.889> some

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
a millimeter but at the largest so some

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.099 
a millimeter but at the largest so some
of<00:03:05.129> them<00:03:05.340> are<00:03:05.459> undef<00:03:06.150> initely<00:03:06.510> not<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:06.959> their

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
of them are undef initely not at their

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.520 
of them are undef initely not at their
adult<00:03:07.319> size<00:03:07.530> still<00:03:08.489> juveniles<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.599> will<00:03:10.349> give

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
adult size still juveniles I will give

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.470 
adult size still juveniles I will give
them<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.829> couple<00:03:11.099> more<00:03:11.519> days<00:03:11.699> I'd<00:03:11.969> say<00:03:12.150> four<00:03:12.449> or

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
them a couple more days I'd say four or

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.909 
them a couple more days I'd say four or
five<00:03:12.569> more<00:03:12.840> days<00:03:12.989> until<00:03:13.230> they<00:03:13.469> reach<00:03:13.620> adult

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
five more days until they reach adult

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.339 
five more days until they reach adult
size<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:15.000> will<00:03:15.150> begin<00:03:15.329> propagating<00:03:16.199> their

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
size and it will begin propagating their

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.289 
size and it will begin propagating their
own<00:03:18.079> their<00:03:19.079> own<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:20.340> can<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.609> if<00:03:20.669> they<00:03:20.759> do<00:03:20.819> hop

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
own their own you can see if they do hop

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.999 
own their own you can see if they do hop
and<00:03:21.540> they<00:03:21.689> are<00:03:21.780> relatively<00:03:22.290> fast<00:03:22.739> they

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:23.009 
and they are relatively fast they

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.339 
and they are relatively fast they
actually<00:03:23.280> swim<00:03:23.489> very<00:03:23.549> fast<00:03:23.879> in<00:03:24.389> comparison<00:03:24.930> to

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
actually swim very fast in comparison to

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.670 
actually swim very fast in comparison to
the<00:03:25.859> brine<00:03:26.579> shrimp<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:27.150> traps<00:03:27.689> that<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.259> have

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the brine shrimp and traps that we have

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.729 
the brine shrimp and traps that we have
been<00:03:28.889> well<00:03:29.639> versed<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.540> this<00:03:30.750> channel

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
been well versed in on this channel

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.679 
been well versed in on this channel
those<00:03:32.180> those<00:03:33.259> type<00:03:34.259> of<00:03:34.290> creatures<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.979> indeed

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
those those type of creatures do indeed

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:38.539 
those those type of creatures do indeed
actually<00:03:36.689> swim<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.470> comparison<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.069> these

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
actually swim in comparison to these

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.990 
actually swim in comparison to these
animals<00:03:39.090> I'm<00:03:39.569> hopping<00:03:40.319> nature<00:03:40.709> but<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.459> have<00:03:41.759> to

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
animals I'm hopping nature but I have to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.589 
animals I'm hopping nature but I have to
say<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.509> uh<00:03:43.129> they<00:03:44.129> do<00:03:44.189> have<00:03:44.699> a<00:03:44.729> tremendous

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
say that uh they do have a tremendous

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.050 
say that uh they do have a tremendous
speed<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.799> mean<00:03:46.889> look<00:03:47.250> at<00:03:47.340> how<00:03:47.549> fast<00:03:47.790> these<00:03:48.000> guys

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
speed I mean look at how fast these guys

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.189 
speed I mean look at how fast these guys
swim<00:03:48.659> I<00:03:49.229> do<00:03:49.829> wish<00:03:50.419> you<00:03:51.419> guys<00:03:51.569> could<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:51.870> see

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
swim I do wish you guys could really see

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.649 
swim I do wish you guys could really see
them<00:03:52.549> but<00:03:53.549> there<00:03:53.699> are<00:03:53.729> a<00:03:53.879> tremendous<00:03:54.419> amount

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
them but there are a tremendous amount

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.020 
them but there are a tremendous amount
in<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:54.959> smaller<00:03:55.290> tank<00:03:55.680> I'm<00:03:56.609> definitely

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
in this smaller tank I'm definitely

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.420 
in this smaller tank I'm definitely
gonna<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.509> move<00:03:57.750> them<00:03:57.989> because<00:03:58.199> if<00:03:59.129> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
gonna have to move them because if I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.589 
gonna have to move them because if I
keep<00:03:59.639> them<00:03:59.759> in<00:03:59.939> here<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.120> if<00:04:00.269> they<00:04:00.389> begin

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
keep them in here and if they begin

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.709 
keep them in here and if they begin
propagating<00:04:01.699> I'm<00:04:02.699> definitely<00:04:03.329> gonna<00:04:03.449> be

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:03.719 
propagating I'm definitely gonna be

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.969 
propagating I'm definitely gonna be
having<00:04:04.079> a<00:04:04.290> size<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.569> oxygen<00:04:06.569> issue<00:04:07.439> in<00:04:07.829> this

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
having a size and oxygen issue in this

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.969 
having a size and oxygen issue in this
tank<00:04:08.189> because<00:04:08.579> they<00:04:09.060> are<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.539> be<00:04:09.979> so

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
tank because they are going to be so

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.619 
tank because they are going to be so
many<00:04:11.219> so<00:04:11.819> I'm<00:04:11.909> probably<00:04:12.030> gonna<00:04:12.329> have<00:04:12.569> to

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
many so I'm probably gonna have to

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.209 
many so I'm probably gonna have to
definitely<00:04:12.900> put<00:04:13.409> them<00:04:13.530> in<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.769> five<00:04:13.949> yard

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:14.219 
definitely put them in that five yard

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.009 
definitely put them in that five yard
but<00:04:14.729> as<00:04:14.789> you<00:04:14.879> saw<00:04:15.030> there<00:04:15.239> he<00:04:15.389> moved<00:04:15.569> really

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
but as you saw there he moved really

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.659 
but as you saw there he moved really
fast<00:04:16.169> these<00:04:16.590> guys<00:04:16.739> get<00:04:17.099> across<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.489> teen

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
fast these guys get across the teen

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.500 
fast these guys get across the teen
group<00:04:17.789> far<00:04:18.389> easily<00:04:19.940> so<00:04:20.940> I'm<00:04:21.000> definitely<00:04:21.209> gonna

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
group far easily so I'm definitely gonna

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.629 
group far easily so I'm definitely gonna
have<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.810> transfer<00:04:22.260> them<00:04:22.409> so<00:04:22.919> right<00:04:23.370> now<00:04:23.490> what

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
have to transfer them so right now what

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.640 
have to transfer them so right now what
I'm<00:04:23.760> feeding<00:04:23.940> them<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.240> just<00:04:24.419> your<00:04:24.630> basic<00:04:24.659> ease

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
I'm feeding them is just your basic ease

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.090 
I'm feeding them is just your basic ease
I<00:04:25.770> have<00:04:26.759> a<00:04:26.790> lot<00:04:27.060> more<00:04:27.090> than<00:04:27.360> just<00:04:27.600> this<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.650> keep

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
I have a lot more than just this I keep

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.070 
I have a lot more than just this I keep
it<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.430> fridge<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.940> rest<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:30.930> have

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
it in the fridge to rest and I have

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.029 
it in the fridge to rest and I have
about<00:04:31.290> 4<00:04:31.350> ounces<00:04:32.009> of<00:04:32.990> fresh<00:04:33.990> actively<00:04:34.830> dry

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
about 4 ounces of fresh actively dry

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.830 
about 4 ounces of fresh actively dry
yeast<00:04:35.250> that<00:04:35.520> I'm<00:04:35.610> using<00:04:35.789> here<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.270> they<00:04:36.660> do

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
yeast that I'm using here and they do

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200 
yeast that I'm using here and they do
seem<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.199> enjoy<00:04:37.350> it<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.740> Archie<00:04:38.039> act<00:04:38.310> much

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
seem to enjoy it the Archie act much

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.480 
seem to enjoy it the Archie act much
like<00:04:39.240> predatory<00:04:40.139> animals<00:04:40.590> obviously<00:04:41.340> they

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
like predatory animals obviously they

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.560 
like predatory animals obviously they
are<00:04:41.669> but<00:04:42.000> they<00:04:42.169> aggressively<00:04:43.610> dive<00:04:44.610> into<00:04:44.910> into

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
are but they aggressively dive into into

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.550 
are but they aggressively dive into into
the<00:04:45.660> clouds<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:47.360> yeast<00:04:48.360> when<00:04:48.720> I<00:04:48.750> do<00:04:48.900> dump<00:04:49.410> them

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
the clouds of yeast when I do dump them

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.529 
the clouds of yeast when I do dump them
into<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.860> tank<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.250> they<00:04:50.430> actively<00:04:51.120> swim

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
into the tank and they actively swim

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.070 
into the tank and they actively swim
into<00:04:51.930> it<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.850> their<00:04:53.850> since<00:04:54.509> they<00:04:54.660> are<00:04:54.750> filter

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
into it and their since they are filter

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.510 
into it and their since they are filter
feeders<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.039> way<00:04:56.160> that<00:04:56.340> they

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
feeders that is the way that they

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.320 
feeders that is the way that they
consume<00:04:56.970> their<00:04:58.100> prey<00:04:59.100> or<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.880> could<00:05:00.060> call

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
consume their prey or you could call

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.010 
consume their prey or you could call
them<00:05:00.419> prey<00:05:00.690> which<00:05:01.289> is<00:05:01.470> by<00:05:01.680> them<00:05:02.449> they<00:05:03.449> consume

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
them prey which is by them they consume

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.800 
them prey which is by them they consume
it<00:05:04.169> by<00:05:04.289> swimming<00:05:04.740> into<00:05:04.919> it<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.570> that's<00:05:06.570> why

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
it by swimming into it and that's why

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.719 
it by swimming into it and that's why
they<00:05:06.990> move<00:05:07.199> around<00:05:07.380> so<00:05:07.740> much<00:05:07.800> because<00:05:08.070> with

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
they move around so much because with

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.580 
they move around so much because with
each<00:05:08.940> step<00:05:09.330> that<00:05:09.360> they're<00:05:09.660> taking<00:05:10.110> they're

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
each step that they're taking they're

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.980 
each step that they're taking they're
actively<00:05:11.070> consuming<00:05:11.729> more<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.000> more<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.600> the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
actively consuming more and more of the

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.409 
actively consuming more and more of the
microorganisms<00:05:13.800> in<00:05:14.490> their<00:05:14.789> environment<00:05:15.300> so

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
microorganisms in their environment so

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.719 
microorganisms in their environment so
it<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:15.870> really<00:05:16.260> cool<00:05:16.530> it's<00:05:16.710> like<00:05:16.770> us<00:05:17.039> every

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
it is really cool it's like us every

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.610 
it is really cool it's like us every
time<00:05:17.940> we<00:05:18.090> take<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.300> step<00:05:18.630> when<00:05:18.900> we<00:05:18.930> walk<00:05:19.260> we<00:05:19.289> are

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
time we take a step when we walk we are

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.370 
time we take a step when we walk we are
consuming<00:05:20.690> just<00:05:21.690> a<00:05:21.750> little<00:05:22.020> bit<00:05:22.139> of<00:05:22.229> energy

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
consuming just a little bit of energy

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.080 
consuming just a little bit of energy
we're<00:05:22.860> getting<00:05:23.070> a<00:05:23.130> little<00:05:23.280> bit<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.580> every

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
we're getting a little bit and every

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.909 
we're getting a little bit and every
time<00:05:24.240> we<00:05:24.389> walk<00:05:24.570> which<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:24.960> really<00:05:25.349> unique<00:05:25.530> I

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
time we walk which is really unique I

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.810 
time we walk which is really unique I
have<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.789> say<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:29.310> know<00:05:29.370> there<00:05:29.550> are<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.699> lot

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
have to say and you know there are a lot

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.820 
have to say and you know there are a lot
inherent<00:05:30.479> may<00:05:30.750> be<00:05:30.810> difficult<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.410> see<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.740> I

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
inherent may be difficult to see and I

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.700 
inherent may be difficult to see and I
really<00:05:31.979> do<00:05:32.220> apologize<00:05:32.520> it's<00:05:33.510> not<00:05:33.840> much<00:05:34.110> easier

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
really do apologize it's not much easier

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.710 
really do apologize it's not much easier
to<00:05:34.949> try<00:05:35.610> to<00:05:35.669> see<00:05:35.880> them<00:05:36.000> from<00:05:36.090> the<00:05:36.240> side<00:05:36.479> I'm

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
to try to see them from the side I'm

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
to try to see them from the side I'm
sorry<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.190> still<00:05:38.639> quite<00:05:38.940> difficult<00:05:39.150> but

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
sorry it is still quite difficult but

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.589 
sorry it is still quite difficult but

they are in there I assure you there are

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.990 
they are in there I assure you there are
about<00:05:42.810> a<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:43.260> can<00:05:43.560> see<00:05:43.800> easily<00:05:44.070> quite<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.610> few<00:05:44.909> in

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
about a I can see easily quite a few in

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.089 
about a I can see easily quite a few in
here<00:05:45.030> you<00:05:46.020> can<00:05:46.139> see<00:05:46.320> some<00:05:46.500> of<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.650> structures

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
here you can see some of the structures

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.270 
here you can see some of the structures
like<00:05:47.310> they're<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.580> 10a<00:05:47.820> and<00:05:48.740> you<00:05:49.740> can<00:05:49.919> kind<00:05:50.220> of

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
like they're in 10a and you can kind of

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.779 
like they're in 10a and you can kind of
see<00:05:50.460> their<00:05:51.139> feature<00:05:52.139> of<00:05:52.590> kind<00:05:53.220> of<00:05:53.280> like<00:05:53.430> a<00:05:53.460> tail

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
see their feature of kind of like a tail

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.339 
see their feature of kind of like a tail
looking<00:05:54.270> thing<00:05:54.449> I'm<00:05:54.570> not<00:05:54.659> quite<00:05:54.870> sure<00:05:54.900> but

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
looking thing I'm not quite sure but

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.980 
looking thing I'm not quite sure but
they<00:05:56.159> are<00:05:56.310> really<00:05:56.550> cool<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:57.360> do<00:05:57.419> have<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.750> admit

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
they are really cool I do have to admit

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
they are really cool I do have to admit
they<00:05:58.199> are<00:05:58.229> really<00:05:58.680> exciting<00:05:59.130> to<00:05:59.250> watch<00:06:01.010> they

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
they are really exciting to watch they

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.490 
they are really exciting to watch they
don't<00:06:02.220> seem<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:02.460> act<00:06:03.330> much<00:06:03.720> in<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.110> presence

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
don't seem to act much in the presence

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.610 
don't seem to act much in the presence
of<00:06:04.590> each<00:06:04.740> other<00:06:05.010> they<00:06:05.280> don't<00:06:05.460> seem<00:06:05.669> to<00:06:05.849> like

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
of each other they don't seem to like

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.310 
of each other they don't seem to like
like<00:06:08.150> mind<00:06:09.150> each<00:06:09.330> other's<00:06:09.630> presence<00:06:09.900> that's

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
like mind each other's presence that's

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.100 
like mind each other's presence that's
what<00:06:10.440> I<00:06:10.500> meant<00:06:10.710> but<00:06:11.430> they<00:06:11.639> do<00:06:11.699> indeed<00:06:12.240> enjoy

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
what I meant but they do indeed enjoy

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.610 
what I meant but they do indeed enjoy
feeding<00:06:14.120> that's<00:06:15.120> for<00:06:15.300> sure<00:06:15.539> they<00:06:15.780> eat<00:06:16.470> a<00:06:16.500> lot

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
feeding that's for sure they eat a lot

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.980 
feeding that's for sure they eat a lot
on<00:06:17.190> the<00:06:17.580> I've<00:06:18.030> heard<00:06:18.240> them<00:06:18.389> earlier<00:06:18.570> this

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
on the I've heard them earlier this

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.860 
on the I've heard them earlier this
morning<00:06:19.229> and<00:06:20.070> it<00:06:20.639> is<00:06:20.849> kind<00:06:21.120> of<00:06:21.210> later<00:06:21.419> if<00:06:21.690> the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
morning and it is kind of later if the

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.450 
morning and it is kind of later if the
night<00:06:22.080> right<00:06:22.320> now<00:06:22.470> but<00:06:23.130> they've<00:06:23.310> already

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
night right now but they've already

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.520 
night right now but they've already
cleaned<00:06:23.820> their<00:06:24.150> tanks<00:06:24.479> so<00:06:24.599> I<00:06:24.630> had<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:25.110> give

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
cleaned their tanks so I had to give

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:26.870 
cleaned their tanks so I had to give
them<00:06:25.590> another<00:06:25.860> feeding<00:06:26.130> or<00:06:26.370> they<00:06:26.520> probably

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
them another feeding or they probably

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.810 
them another feeding or they probably
starve<00:06:27.120> tonight<00:06:27.330> so<00:06:28.220> as<00:06:29.220> far<00:06:29.550> as<00:06:29.699> I'm

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
starve tonight so as far as I'm

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.920 
starve tonight so as far as I'm
concerned<00:06:30.240> I'm<00:06:30.360> probably<00:06:30.539> going<00:06:30.750> to<00:06:30.840> be

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
concerned I'm probably going to be

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.000 
concerned I'm probably going to be
needing<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.500> have<00:06:32.750> feedings<00:06:33.750> twice<00:06:34.080> a<00:06:34.110> day<00:06:34.440> to

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
needing to have feedings twice a day to

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.730 
needing to have feedings twice a day to
keep<00:06:35.219> these<00:06:35.460> guys<00:06:35.729> um<00:06:36.289> growing<00:06:37.289> because<00:06:37.529> I

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
keep these guys um growing because I

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.320 
keep these guys um growing because I
swear<00:06:38.310> they<00:06:38.520> eat<00:06:38.760> a<00:06:38.789> lot

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
swear they eat a lot

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.380 
swear they eat a lot
they<00:06:40.570> really<00:06:40.900> are<00:06:40.990> ravenous<00:06:41.410> creatures<00:06:42.390> so

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
they really are ravenous creatures so

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.180 
they really are ravenous creatures so
that's<00:06:44.170> really<00:06:44.380> um<00:06:44.680> how<00:06:45.100> far<00:06:45.130> I'm<00:06:45.550> with<00:06:45.790> this

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190

that's really um how far I'm with this
Owen<00:06:48.190> in<00:06:48.340> here<00:06:48.850> I<00:06:49.030> kind<00:06:49.540> of<00:06:49.660> managed<00:06:50.050> to

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
Owen in here I kind of managed to

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.440 
Owen in here I kind of managed to
separate<00:06:50.590> what<00:06:51.100> I<00:06:51.130> believe<00:06:51.460> to<00:06:51.490> be<00:06:51.670> a<00:06:51.790> try<00:06:52.120> up<00:06:52.300> I

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:52.450 
separate what I believe to be a try up I

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.750 
separate what I believe to be a try up I
think<00:06:52.660> a<00:06:52.690> tribe<00:06:52.930> did<00:06:53.200> hatch<00:06:53.380> in<00:06:53.760> this

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
think a tribe did hatch in this

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.710 
think a tribe did hatch in this
container<00:06:55.090> right<00:06:55.360> here<00:06:55.630> and<00:06:56.410> I<00:06:57.720> can't

00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 
container right here and I can't

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.330 
container right here and I can't
honestly<00:06:59.500> find<00:06:59.770> them<00:06:59.920> that's<00:07:00.070> kind<00:07:00.310> of

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:00.340 
honestly find them that's kind of

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.610 
honestly find them that's kind of
embarrassing<00:07:00.460> I<00:07:00.910> know<00:07:00.940> but<00:07:01.510> I<00:07:01.720> can't<00:07:02.200> find<00:07:02.470> him

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
embarrassing I know but I can't find him

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.320 
embarrassing I know but I can't find him
right<00:07:02.740> now<00:07:02.800> but<00:07:03.160> I<00:07:03.370> did<00:07:03.730> separate<00:07:04.060> them<00:07:04.210> with<00:07:04.300> a

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:04.330 
right now but I did separate them with a

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.570 
right now but I did separate them with a
little<00:07:04.750> bit<00:07:04.870> of<00:07:04.990> water<00:07:05.140> as<00:07:05.320> you<00:07:05.440> can<00:07:05.590> see<00:07:05.830> and

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
little bit of water as you can see and

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.150 
little bit of water as you can see and
uh<00:07:06.810> she's<00:07:07.810> either<00:07:07.990> dry<00:07:08.440> up<00:07:08.500> or<00:07:08.740> fairy<00:07:08.980> shrimp

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
uh she's either dry up or fairy shrimp

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.520 
uh she's either dry up or fairy shrimp
he's<00:07:09.460> obviously<00:07:09.610> one<00:07:10.060> of<00:07:10.120> the<00:07:10.270> two<00:07:10.510> because<00:07:10.780> he

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
he's obviously one of the two because he

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.890 
he's obviously one of the two because he
swims<00:07:12.220> in<00:07:12.430> such<00:07:12.670> a<00:07:12.700> manner<00:07:12.970> he<00:07:13.240> doesn't<00:07:13.570> hop

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
swims in such a manner he doesn't hop

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.840 
swims in such a manner he doesn't hop
like<00:07:14.140> the<00:07:14.260> others<00:07:14.500> and<00:07:14.770> he<00:07:14.890> has<00:07:15.010> physical

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
like the others and he has physical

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.870 
like the others and he has physical
features<00:07:16.150> that<00:07:16.180> do<00:07:16.510> resemble<00:07:17.020> a<00:07:17.670> first<00:07:18.670> or

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 
features that do resemble a first or

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.820 
features that do resemble a first or
second<00:07:19.240> instar

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:20.830 
second instar

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.470 
second instar
life<00:07:21.640> stage<00:07:21.970> of<00:07:22.330> a<00:07:22.810> fairy<00:07:23.140> shrimp<00:07:23.320> or<00:07:23.680> a

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:24.480 
life stage of a fairy shrimp or a

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.420 
life stage of a fairy shrimp or a
Charles<00:07:25.480> so<00:07:25.960> she's<00:07:26.860> in<00:07:26.890> there<00:07:27.190> I'm<00:07:27.280> probably

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
Charles so she's in there I'm probably

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.480 
Charles so she's in there I'm probably
gonna<00:07:27.610> care<00:07:27.850> for<00:07:28.000> him<00:07:28.120> separately<00:07:29.280> and<00:07:30.280> I

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:30.490 
gonna care for him separately and I

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.070 
gonna care for him separately and I
don't<00:07:30.820> honestly<00:07:31.000> know<00:07:31.210> whether<00:07:31.690> he<00:07:31.930> is<00:07:31.960> a

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
don't honestly know whether he is a

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.350 
don't honestly know whether he is a
patient<00:07:32.350> or<00:07:32.710> Daphnia<00:07:33.160> but<00:07:33.400> I<00:07:33.610> mean<00:07:34.120> if<00:07:34.240> a

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 
patient or Daphnia but I mean if a

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.780 
patient or Daphnia but I mean if a
shrimp<00:07:34.630> or<00:07:34.840> a<00:07:34.870> traps<00:07:35.260> but<00:07:35.710> we'll<00:07:36.250> have<00:07:36.430> to<00:07:36.580> see

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790 
shrimp or a traps but we'll have to see

as he grows older but um yeah so that's

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.660 
as he grows older but um yeah so that's
about<00:07:40.330> it<00:07:40.800> I'm<00:07:41.800> probably<00:07:41.980> gonna<00:07:42.250> get<00:07:42.430> another
