 colorful children's performances and which 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:09.200
 has its subtext with us that is 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.080
 animals animals animal world animals all 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.610
 they should not be taken literally as 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.950
 there are not enough animals 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 civilized educated behave 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 how people people just behave 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.450
 how animals animals are very rude 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.530
 uncivilized is such a story 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.530
 it turns out 2 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.049
 all on the hare threw caught called 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.079
 way down 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.379
 girls you you you you see that he is to them 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:03.889
 trying to tear apart yes on your fingers let's 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:07.629
 open on and the facade on f5 lunge is stronger 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:10.340
 will make and that the tension was up further 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.450
 you turn your right foot back and you 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.180
 turn him 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.580
 so this up here is two hands up on 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:26.069
 two hands up you take a step step lunge 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.970
 here and the girls you mirror mirror 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.519
 unfold mirror each other until 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.660
 give character to each character the most 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:42.090
 complicated and that is understandable 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.530
 kids and read everything and let's say 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.340
 staging process in general in general 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.340
 complicated 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.670
 but 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.360
 imuran 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:05.899
 this moment everything happened so fast 

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:08.519
 all so tight deadlines for us now and 

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:12.749
 leaning relying primarily on 

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:16.079
 music golovin and lokshina + Anna Matison 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:18.249
 the author of the libretto and the artist who in 

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:21.729
 in general, this is the idea 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:23.739
 the creation of children's ballet I consider it 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.120
 right it should be because 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:27.850
 such a genre 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.260
 now there is practically no and in some 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.930
 major theaters musical side 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.170
 and very rarely do a play occur 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.910
 ballet and musical some periods 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.520
 for children it seems to me in the Mariinsky 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.110
 theater it should be just a spectacle 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.110
 for children ballet precisely 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.080
 coming up 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.480
 yes can a beautiful dress dress 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.930
 and together now on them 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.600
 here you can get around brotherly 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.600
 healthy so 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.820
 done for
