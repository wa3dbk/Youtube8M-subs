somebody put in to get to that level and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.230 
somebody put in to get to that level and
that's<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.219> the<00:01:29.310> judges<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.700> looking<00:01:29.850> for

that's what the judges are looking for

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
that's what the judges are looking for

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
but if you don't present yourself well

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.149 
but if you don't present yourself well
then<00:01:33.209> some<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.899> gets<00:01:34.139> lost<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.709> well<00:01:34.859> so

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
then some of that gets lost as well so

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.489 
then some of that gets lost as well so
so<00:01:35.639> a<00:01:35.670> big<00:01:35.939> part<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.569> is<00:01:37.079> hitting<00:01:37.259> your

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:37.499 
so a big part of it is is hitting your

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:39.260 
so a big part of it is is hitting your
poses<00:01:37.889> right<00:01:38.099> and<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.429> we<00:01:38.729> practice<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.240> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
poses right and and we practice that I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.849 
poses right and and we practice that I
mean<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.599> that<00:01:39.659> becomes<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.259> big<00:01:40.439> part<00:01:40.649> of<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
mean not that becomes a big part of the

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.459 
mean not that becomes a big part of the
preparation<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.749> posing<00:01:42.749> and<00:01:43.170> doing<00:01:43.200> the
