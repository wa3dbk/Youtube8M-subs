00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.940
 Is the camera on? 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.600
 Is it running? 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.700
 Everything started when I wanted a new surfboard 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.340
 but didn't have enough money for it. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.780
 I discovered that it was possible if I bought the materials. 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 So I asked my father for advice. 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.420
 He made surfboards in the 1980s. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.780
 He told me it would be too difficult. 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.600
 It was the worst idea ever. 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 But that didn't stop me. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.040
 My name is Mathias. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 and together with my brother Simon and our friend Bo we launched the surf brand Oh Dawn. 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.360
 In Denmark there are not really large oceans, 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.040
 only small seas and the weather is almost always bad. 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.240
 It rains and often freezes. 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.800
 And there are only waves when the wind is really strong. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.500
 So that involves some challenges in terms of temperature. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.360
 Launching a Danish surf brand may not be the best idea ever. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 The times we walked against the wall with our heads cannot be counted. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 Making clothes is generally very difficult. 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.260
 I don't think anyone thought about how difficult that was. 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.740
 To know what we want in terms of construction, 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.980
 what good material is, what you can and cannot do. 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.540
 It was a very long learning process. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.900
 I think we persisted because we like to make things with our hands. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.220
 Make surfboards and design clothes 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.560
 is the perfect way to continue surfing when there are no waves. 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.660
 When we started with Oh Dawn, we didn't really have an idea 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.260
 how we would get the case started. 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.860
 We had no business plan 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.000
 and so they laughed at us at the bank when we wanted to open an account. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.660
 We all had to do it ourselves. 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.800
 Everything. The website. Appointments with customers. 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.800
 Packing boxes. Everything. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.400
 And actually we are still being laughed at. 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between work and leisure 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.620
 when everything is about surfing. 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 I think I was more in the water when I had a normal day job. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.320
 I often wish that I could take a step back to spend time with my child and my girlfriend. 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.260
 To forget all worries. 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.480
 All unanswered emails and invoices and deadlines. 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.300
 But I also don't think I can do without all this. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
 That sense of modesty and pride 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.960
 when I see people wearing things that we have made. 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.920
 That makes everything right. 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 We started in 2011 and although on paper it seemed like the worst plan ever 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.660
 we are now in sixty stores around the world. 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.220
 And I really didn't expect that. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.660
 Supporting Success against the odds
