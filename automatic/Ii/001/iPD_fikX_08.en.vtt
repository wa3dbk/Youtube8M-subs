00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
now update it now this will actually

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649 
now update it now this will actually
down<00:01:40.950> rate<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> instead<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.790> updating<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> so

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
down rate it instead of updating it so

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
down rate it instead of updating it so
it's<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.259> tricking<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> itunes<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.579> it

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it's kind of tricking the itunes but it

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's kind of tricking the itunes but it
works<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:45.000> well<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.750> from<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.290> once<00:01:46.890> this

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
works really well so from here once this

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.649 
works really well so from here once this
