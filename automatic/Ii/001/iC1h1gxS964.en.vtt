00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
palings is going to be a really

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.749 
palings is going to be a really
important<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.829> think<00:01:33.249> is<00:01:33.399> going<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.609> be<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
important I think is going to be the

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.739 
important I think is going to be the
next<00:01:33.939> arc<00:01:34.179> actually<00:01:34.779> is<00:01:34.959> the<00:01:36.450> Garlic<00:01:37.450> meteor<00:01:37.689> I

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
next arc actually is the Garlic meteor I

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:38.849 
next arc actually is the Garlic meteor I
think<00:01:37.929> that's<00:01:38.049> gonna<00:01:38.139> be<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.319> focus<00:01:38.709> on<00:01:38.770> the

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
think that's gonna be a focus on the

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:40.620 
think that's gonna be a focus on the
next<00:01:39.039> arcs<00:01:39.369> but<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.819> guess<00:01:39.969> they<00:01:40.119> mentioned<00:01:40.509> it

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
next arcs but I guess they mentioned it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.319 
next arcs but I guess they mentioned it
within<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:40.899> episode<00:01:41.409> just<00:01:41.920> email<00:01:42.219> just<00:01:42.429> do<00:01:43.299> a
