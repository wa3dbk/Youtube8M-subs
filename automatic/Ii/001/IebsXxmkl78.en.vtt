00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
and now you'll see the board and I'm

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.520 
and now you'll see the board and I'm
actually<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> tip<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.039> over<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
actually going to tip it over and it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
go okay and I already took the heatsink

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
go okay and I already took the heatsink
off<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:21.560> CPU<00:01:22.560> which<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
off but you see here the CPU which is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580 
off but you see here the CPU which is
where<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.119> heatsink<00:01:24.720> goes<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:25.200> goes<00:01:25.439> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
where the heatsink goes it also goes in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.249 
where the heatsink goes it also goes in
these<00:01:25.710> two<00:01:25.860> chips<00:01:26.130> right<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:27.170> don't<00:01:28.170> know

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
these two chips right here I don't know

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.080 
these two chips right here I don't know
exactly<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.799> they<00:01:28.920> are<00:01:28.950> probably<00:01:29.400> RAM<00:01:29.700> or

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
exactly what they are probably RAM or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.130 
exactly what they are probably RAM or
something<00:01:30.630> other<00:01:31.110> than<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.659> anyway<00:01:33.659> if

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
something other than that but anyway if

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.399 
something other than that but anyway if
you<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.460> close<00:01:36.560> sorry<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.329> close

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
you see close sorry if you look up close

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.870 
you see close sorry if you look up close
if<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.860> zoom<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.670> here

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.870 

you'll<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> says<00:01:48.509> rock<00:01:48.869> chip<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you'll see that it says rock chip and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.260 
you'll see that it says rock chip and
that<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.540> processor<00:01:52.170> type<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:54.000> let<00:01:54.149> me

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that is the processor type so let me

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.730 
that is the processor type so let me
zoom<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.630> or<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:57.860> okay<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.430> by<00:02:00.210> default<00:02:00.740> they

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
zoom out or more okay so by default they

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.490 
zoom out or more okay so by default they
already<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.670> paste<00:02:03.149> set<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
already have the paste set on the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.270 
already have the paste set on the
heatsink

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
heatsink

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.399 
heatsink
and<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.360> see<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> scraped<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.079> off<00:02:07.170> because

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and you can see I scraped it off because

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.850 
and you can see I scraped it off because
it<00:02:07.740> looks<00:02:07.890> very<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:09.509> looked<00:02:09.750> bad<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.770> way

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
it looks very it looked bad just the way

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.900 
it looks very it looked bad just the way
they<00:02:10.979> put<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:11.580> really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
they put it on there it's really

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.720 
they put it on there it's really
horrible

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.990 
take a thermal pad and I got maybe five
of<00:02:18.810> these<00:02:19.079> off<00:02:19.469> of<00:02:19.500> ebay<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.459> three<00:02:20.879> dollars

so<00:02:34.709> first<00:02:35.129> take<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.329> thermal<00:02:36.540> pad<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.170> place

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
so first take the thermal pad and place

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.149 
so first take the thermal pad and place
it<00:02:37.980> right<00:02:38.099> under<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.370> heat<00:02:38.639> sink<00:02:39.620> right<00:02:40.620> under

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
it right under the heat sink right under

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:49.590 
it right under the heat sink right under
here

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.670 

just<00:02:50.200> kind<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.500> pull<00:02:51.900> down<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.960> little<00:02:53.080> bit<00:02:53.290> it

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
just kind of pull down a little bit it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.210 
just kind of pull down a little bit it
does<00:02:53.890> kind<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.190> stick<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:57.010> kind<00:02:57.160> of

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
does kind of stick to it so it's kind of

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.610 
does kind of stick to it so it's kind of
hard<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.490> change<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.270> little<00:02:58.450> bit<00:02:58.600> but

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:12.280 

stick<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.770> on<00:03:02.980> here

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.220 

and<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:14.060> press<00:03:14.239> down<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.480> little<00:03:14.659> bit<00:03:14.840> so<00:03:15.140> it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
and just press down a little bit so it

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.500 
and just press down a little bit so it
kind<00:03:15.379> of<00:03:15.439> sticks<00:03:15.739> through<00:03:15.920> there<00:03:16.480> make<00:03:17.480> sure

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
kind of sticks through there make sure

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.149 
kind of sticks through there make sure
doesn't<00:03:17.900> stick<00:03:18.170> your<00:03:18.349> fingers<00:03:18.860> because

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
doesn't stick your fingers because

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.869 
doesn't stick your fingers because
there's<00:03:19.670> time<00:03:19.909> to<00:03:19.939> do<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:21.310> okay<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.370> now<00:03:22.790> I'm

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 
there's time to do that okay so now I'm

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.789 
there's time to do that okay so now I'm
going<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.090> take<00:03:23.209> our<00:03:23.360> tape<00:03:23.599> it<00:03:24.379> can<00:03:24.530> be<00:03:24.650> any

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
going to take our tape it can be any

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.899 
going to take our tape it can be any
kind<00:03:25.010> of<00:03:25.129> tape<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:25.670> clear<00:03:26.230> sticky<00:03:27.230> tape<00:03:27.260> and

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
kind of tape just clear sticky tape and

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:38.470 
kind of tape just clear sticky tape and
just<00:03:29.079> tape<00:03:30.940> one<00:03:31.940> side<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:36.760> tape<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.060> SD

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
just tape one side and tape it to the SD

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.520 
just tape one side and tape it to the SD
card<00:03:38.510> slot<00:03:38.959> right<00:03:38.989> here<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:42.049> can<00:03:42.200> use<00:03:42.319> two

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
card slot right here you can use two

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.110 
card slot right here you can use two
pieces<00:03:42.950> if<00:03:43.099> you<00:03:43.220> want<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:43.640> there's<00:03:43.819> really<00:03:43.939> no

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
pieces if you want but there's really no

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.009 
pieces if you want but there's really no
point<00:03:44.390> because<00:03:45.079> the<00:03:45.500> enclosure<00:03:45.950> case<00:03:47.019> pretty

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
point because the enclosure case pretty

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.569 
point because the enclosure case pretty
much<00:03:48.370> closes<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.489> up<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:51.040> if<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.190> want<00:03:52.370> tape

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
much closes it up but if you want tape

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.190 
much closes it up but if you want tape
on<00:03:52.760> here<00:03:52.909> that<00:03:53.150> way<00:03:53.269> doesn't<00:03:53.569> move<00:03:53.659> around<00:03:53.900> and

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
on here that way doesn't move around and

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.020 
on here that way doesn't move around and
it<00:03:54.290> goes<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.829> other<00:03:54.920> parts<00:03:55.310> of<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:56.530> board

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
it goes to the other parts of the board

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.309 
it goes to the other parts of the board
okay<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.269> then<00:03:59.420> take<00:03:59.720> another<00:03:59.840> piece<00:04:00.139> of<00:04:00.170> tape

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
okay and then take another piece of tape

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.349 
okay and then take another piece of tape
and<00:04:01.720> let<00:04:02.720> me<00:04:03.250> put<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.340> on<00:04:04.519> this<00:04:06.459> mini<00:04:07.459> HDMI<00:04:08.060> port

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
and let me put it on this mini HDMI port

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.099 
and let me put it on this mini HDMI port
right<00:04:08.480> here<00:04:10.359> just<00:04:11.359> tape<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:11.659> make<00:04:11.840> sure<00:04:11.870> it's

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
right here just tape it make sure it's

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:19.420 
right here just tape it make sure it's
sealed<00:04:15.760> then<00:04:16.760> not<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.000> be<00:04:17.090> perfect<00:04:17.449> but<00:04:18.430> let's

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
sealed then not to be perfect but let's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:28.870 
sealed then not to be perfect but let's
see<00:04:19.699> if<00:04:19.849> it'll<00:04:20.000> tip<00:04:20.299> over<00:04:20.570> or<00:04:20.599> not

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.580 

okay<00:04:29.880> yeah<00:04:30.060> I'm<00:04:30.600> not<00:04:30.810> gonna<00:04:30.960> be<00:04:31.050> shaking<00:04:31.440> or

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
okay yeah I'm not gonna be shaking or

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.010 
okay yeah I'm not gonna be shaking or
anything<00:04:31.800> so<00:04:32.250> there's<00:04:32.430> no<00:04:32.460> point<00:04:32.730> of<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:33.120> you

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
anything so there's no point of a you

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.660 
anything so there's no point of a you
know<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:35.070> moving<00:04:35.490> around<00:04:35.670> a<00:04:35.790> lot<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:37.710> make

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
know if it moving around a lot and make

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.120 
know if it moving around a lot and make
sure<00:04:38.850> your<00:04:39.000> antenna<00:04:39.780> goes<00:04:40.080> back<00:04:40.320> in<00:04:40.530> right

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
sure your antenna goes back in right

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.850 
sure your antenna goes back in right
stays<00:04:44.130> there<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.640> then<00:04:45.390> just<00:04:45.930> put<00:04:46.680> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
stays there and then just put the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.150 
stays there and then just put the
enclosure<00:04:47.040> on<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:50.780> usually<00:04:51.780> line<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.200> up<00:04:52.260> front

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
enclosure on I usually line it up front

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.540 
enclosure on I usually line it up front
side<00:04:53.370> with<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.610> OTG<00:04:53.910> and<00:04:56.870> power<00:04:57.870> and<00:04:58.320> USB<00:04:58.980> port

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
side with the OTG and power and USB port

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.590 
side with the OTG and power and USB port
right<00:05:01.700> there<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:02.940> kind<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.210> just<00:05:03.360> start

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
right there and I kind of just start

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.340 
right there and I kind of just start
from<00:05:03.690> here<00:05:03.900> make<00:05:04.800> sure<00:05:04.980> it's<00:05:05.100> lined<00:05:05.280> up<00:05:07.910> and

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
from here make sure it's lined up and

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.660 
from here make sure it's lined up and
then<00:05:10.350> I<00:05:10.440> close<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.920> rest<00:05:11.100> of<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.280> body<00:05:11.460> right

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
then I close the rest of the body right

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:20.030 
then I close the rest of the body right
here<00:05:16.160> so<00:05:17.160> there<00:05:17.280> you<00:05:17.340> go<00:05:17.520> and<00:05:18.800> temperature<00:05:19.800> was

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
here so there you go and temperature was

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.660 
here so there you go and temperature was
really<00:05:20.430> good<00:05:20.580> on<00:05:20.700> here<00:05:20.990> I<00:05:22.250> actually<00:05:23.250> reached

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
really good on here I actually reached

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:29.690 
really good on here I actually reached
up<00:05:23.990> on<00:05:24.990> a<00:05:25.050> test<00:05:26.930> maybe<00:05:27.930> about<00:05:28.230> a<00:05:28.290> hundred<00:05:28.890> with

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
up on a test maybe about a hundred with

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.050 
up on a test maybe about a hundred with
this<00:05:30.270> solution<00:05:30.930> on<00:05:31.050> here<00:05:31.430> without<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.820> it

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
this solution on here without it it

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.560 
this solution on here without it it
would<00:05:33.330> get<00:05:33.540> up<00:05:33.660> pretty<00:05:33.900> high<00:05:34.170> I<00:05:35.390> didn't<00:05:36.390> test

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
would get up pretty high I didn't test

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.610 
would get up pretty high I didn't test
it<00:05:36.810> without<00:05:37.170> the<00:05:38.900> without<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.080> thermal<00:05:40.500> pad

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
it without the without the thermal pad

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.130 
it without the without the thermal pad
on<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:40.830> but<00:05:41.220> I<00:05:41.580> know<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.600> was<00:05:42.720> really<00:05:42.900> high

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
on it but I know it was really high

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.700 
on it but I know it was really high
before<00:05:43.500> it<00:05:43.620> was<00:05:43.740> on<00:05:43.860> there<00:05:44.040> because<00:05:44.310> you<00:05:44.460> can't

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
before it was on there because you can't

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.670
