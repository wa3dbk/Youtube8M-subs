friends out of it and it really pushed
me<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.920> I'm<00:02:20.069> also<00:02:20.280> thinking<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.970> trying

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
me and I'm also thinking of trying

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.330 
me and I'm also thinking of trying
lacrosse<00:02:21.810> next<00:02:22.170> year<00:02:22.380> because<00:02:22.650> it's

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
lacrosse next year because it's

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.760 
lacrosse next year because it's
something<00:02:23.670> new<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.420> that's<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:25.140> thing<00:02:25.170> that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
something new and that's one thing that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.680 
something new and that's one thing that
I<00:02:25.800> probably<00:02:26.040> won't<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.700> try<00:02:27.060> any<00:02:27.540> other

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I probably won't get to try any other

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.110 
I probably won't get to try any other
time<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:28.410> life<00:02:28.709> so<00:02:29.099> for<00:02:29.370> example<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:30.000> you

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
time in my life so for example if you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.420 
time in my life so for example if you
have<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.870> interest<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.650> drama<00:02:32.040> but

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
have kind of interest in drama but

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.430 
have kind of interest in drama but
you've<00:02:32.550> never<00:02:32.790> done<00:02:33.120> anything<00:02:33.420> proper<00:02:34.140> then

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
you've never done anything proper then

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.280 
you've never done anything proper then
just<00:02:34.680> go<00:02:35.310> along<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.880> drama<00:02:36.060> club<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.630> just

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
just go along to the drama club and just

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.589 
just go along to the drama club and just
try<00:02:37.890> out<00:02:38.130> what's<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.940> worst<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.420> could

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
try out what's the worst that could

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.449 
try out what's the worst that could
happen<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.530> kind<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.920> goes<00:02:41.190> with

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
happen and that just kind of goes with

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.059 
happen and that just kind of goes with
everything<00:02:41.760> not<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.239> sports<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.350> friends

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
everything not just sports but friends

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.910 
everything not just sports but friends
and<00:02:44.280> just<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.940> social<00:02:45.510> activities<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.560> try

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
and just like social activities just try

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.460 
and just like social activities just try
and<00:02:47.310> discover<00:02:47.760> new<00:02:48.030> things<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:48.569> that's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
and discover new things because that's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.170 
and discover new things because that's
really<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.890> university<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.610> about<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.090> then

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
really what university is about and then

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.289 
really what university is about and then
my<00:02:51.360> next<00:02:51.420> tip<00:02:51.930> which<00:02:52.380> is<00:02:52.620> also<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.250> trick<00:02:53.819> when

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
my next tip which is also a trick when

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.470 
my next tip which is also a trick when
it<00:02:54.450> gets<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.989> exam<00:02:55.500> time<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.610> keep<00:02:56.819> up<00:02:57.120> with

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
it gets to exam time is to keep up with

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.350 
it gets to exam time is to keep up with
the<00:02:57.660> reading<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:58.319> know<00:02:58.440> there<00:02:59.340> will<00:02:59.549> be<00:02:59.790> loads

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
the reading I know there will be loads

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.809 
the reading I know there will be loads
and<00:03:00.630> loads<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:01.230> reading<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.040> just<00:03:02.340> what

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
and loads of reading that is just what

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.570 
and loads of reading that is just what
university<00:03:03.480> or<00:03:03.720> college<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.349> just<00:03:04.650> about<00:03:05.250> and

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
university or college is just about and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.220 
university or college is just about and
especially<00:03:05.910> at<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.480> start<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.200> year

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
especially at the start of the year

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.580 
especially at the start of the year
you'll<00:03:08.040> probably<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.610> thinking<00:03:09.260> exams<00:03:10.260> are<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
you'll probably be thinking exams are a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.589 
you'll probably be thinking exams are a
long<00:03:10.830> way<00:03:11.010> off<00:03:11.250> I'll<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:11.790> do<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.060> reading

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
long way off I'll just do that reading

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.319 
long way off I'll just do that reading
another<00:03:12.989> time<00:03:13.380> but<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:13.890> you<00:03:14.579> keep<00:03:14.880> saying

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
another time but then you keep saying

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.690 
another time but then you keep saying
that<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.959> then<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.380> get<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.769> books<00:03:17.400> and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
that and then you get like books and

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.759 
that and then you get like books and
books<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.209> reading<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.170> haven't<00:03:19.590> done

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
books of reading that you haven't done

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.069 
books of reading that you haven't done
and<00:03:20.100> then<00:03:20.220> you're<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.609> behind<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.420> then<00:03:21.600> you

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
and then you're so behind and then you

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.750 
and then you're so behind and then you
get<00:03:22.230> stressed<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:23.010> that's<00:03:23.220> probably

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
get stressed and that's probably

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.150 
get stressed and that's probably
reflected<00:03:24.720> in<00:03:24.959> your<00:03:25.079> exam<00:03:25.440> results<00:03:25.920> at<00:03:26.100> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
reflected in your exam results at the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.430 
reflected in your exam results at the
end<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.609> year<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:27.239> my<00:03:27.510> friend<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:27.959> example

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
end of the year so my friend for example

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.650 
end of the year so my friend for example
bought<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.950> whiteboard<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.760> noted<00:03:30.180> down<00:03:30.359> all

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
bought a whiteboard and noted down all

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.630 
bought a whiteboard and noted down all
the<00:03:30.870> reading<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.530> she<00:03:31.680> had<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:31.980> do<00:03:32.130> for<00:03:32.430> each

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
the reading that she had to do for each

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.780

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
went along and that really helped her to
