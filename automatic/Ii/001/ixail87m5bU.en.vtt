want you know you can take a fist me and
try<00:06:35.319> to<00:06:35.379> punch<00:06:35.679> it<00:06:35.949> or<00:06:36.339> you<00:06:36.550> can<00:06:36.699> take<00:06:36.849> try

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:37.059 
try to punch it or you can take try

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:38.759 
try to punch it or you can take try
something<00:06:37.569> else<00:06:37.659> do<00:06:37.869> and<00:06:38.019> try<00:06:38.169> to<00:06:38.229> poke<00:06:38.559> and
