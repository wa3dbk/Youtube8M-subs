00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
we are going to switch down to the

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.470 
we are going to switch down to the
bottom<00:01:07.320> level<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.660> upgrade<00:01:09.660> those<00:01:10.140> two

ranged attack that significantly

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.630 
ranged attack that significantly
increases<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.260> damage<00:01:22.440> for<00:01:22.890> their<00:01:23.070> ranged

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
attack don't worry about the exploding

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.820 
attack don't worry about the exploding
barrels<00:01:26.190> yet<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.660> quite<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> while<00:01:28.230> but<00:01:28.650> those

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
barrels yet for quite a while but those

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.460

those<00:01:29.250> ranged<00:01:29.700> attacks<00:01:30.060> those<00:01:30.540> helped<00:01:30.990> quite

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
those ranged attacks those helped quite

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.920 
those ranged attacks those helped quite
a<00:01:32.010> bit<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.700> once<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:33.360> we're<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
a bit and once we do that we're going to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.250 
a bit and once we do that we're going to
build<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.440> two<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.310> totem<00:01:35.910> axe<00:01:36.300> thrower

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
build it two of the totem axe thrower

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.210 
build it two of the totem axe thrower
towers<00:01:38.240> now<00:01:39.240> you're<00:01:39.510> doing<00:01:39.780> this

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
towers now you're doing this

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.270 
towers now you're doing this
specifically<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.119> power<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
specifically for the power on the on the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880 
specifically for the power on the on the
left<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.940> one<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.720> orange<00:01:45.930> totem<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
left the one the orange totem that

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.640 
left the one the orange totem that
basically<00:01:47.729> allows<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.900> enemies<00:01:49.260> to<00:01:49.290> take

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
basically allows the enemies to take

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.380 
basically allows the enemies to take
more<00:01:50.040> damage<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.030> fully

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
more damage you're going to fully

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:08.839 
more damage you're going to fully
upgrade<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.470> both<00:01:53.070> towers

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.759 

now<00:02:09.390> they<00:02:09.509> will<00:02:09.659> notice<00:02:09.929> next<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.349> are<00:02:10.469> doing

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
now they will notice next we are doing

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.610 
now they will notice next we are doing
the<00:02:11.700> artillery<00:02:12.659> there<00:02:13.049> in<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.439> center<00:02:13.829> I

don't<00:02:16.620> know<00:02:16.680> if<00:02:16.799> that's<00:02:16.950> necessary<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.700> do

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
don't know if that's necessary to do

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.449 
don't know if that's necessary to do
that<00:02:17.999> right<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.959> quickly<00:02:19.379> but<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:20.219> will

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
that does come in handy fairly soon and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.990 
that does come in handy fairly soon and
then<00:02:25.290> once<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.709> do<00:02:25.829> that<00:02:25.859> just<00:02:26.129> upgrade<00:02:26.819> that
