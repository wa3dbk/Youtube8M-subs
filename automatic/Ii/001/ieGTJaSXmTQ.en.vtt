I<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.860> think<00:01:44.040> they'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> much<00:01:44.399> dealt<00:01:44.759> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
I don't think they'll be much dealt with

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the quality of this project it's so

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.649 
the quality of this project it's so
clean<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.340> has<00:01:47.460> toys<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.000> won't<00:01:48.180> even<00:01:48.270> see

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
air ride on that car is just like when

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.920 
air ride on that car is just like when
you<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.790> somewhere<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.450> change<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you get somewhere you can change the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.499 
you get somewhere you can change the
precision<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> car<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:56.909> handles<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> lot

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
precision of the car it handles a lot

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:57.780 
precision of the car it handles a lot
but

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
but

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.880 
but

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
the hydraulics do hydraulics bouncing

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.730 
the hydraulics do hydraulics bouncing
around<00:02:00.580> I<00:02:00.610> like<00:02:00.880> has<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.240> lot<00:02:01.510> of<00:02:01.540> oil<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.530> it's<00:02:02.680> a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
around I like has a lot of oil so it's a

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.310 
around I like has a lot of oil so it's a
big<00:02:03.010> mess<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.490> truck<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.780> not<00:02:04.990> meant<00:02:05.260> to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
big mess in the truck it's not meant to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.710 
big mess in the truck it's not meant to
hop<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:06.220> ride<00:02:06.550> will<00:02:06.760> Glide<00:02:06.790> when<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.480> wants

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
hop this ride will Glide when it wants

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.200 
hop this ride will Glide when it wants
attention<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.410> it'll<00:02:08.890> turn<00:02:09.040> heads<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:10.030> is

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210

the<00:02:20.860> tunes

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.459 

I<00:02:25.129> think<00:02:25.879> that's<00:02:26.120> working<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.810> think<00:02:27.079> it's<00:02:27.200> okay

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:27.469 
I think that's working I think it's okay

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.209 
I think that's working I think it's okay
I<00:02:27.709> got<00:02:28.159> the<00:02:28.249> junk<00:02:28.459> in<00:02:28.609> this<00:02:28.700> from<00:02:30.219> pumping

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
I got the junk in this from pumping

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.699 
I got the junk in this from pumping
through<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> back<00:02:31.700> to<00:02:32.269> Sony<00:02:32.599> subs<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.290> three

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
through the back to Sony subs and three

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.530 
through the back to Sony subs and three
amps<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.189> could<00:02:34.340> probably<00:02:34.609> drive<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.299> car

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
amps that could probably drive this car

big<00:02:47.750> day<00:02:47.959> because<00:02:47.989> we<00:02:48.409> fired<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.920> engine

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:54.249 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.030
