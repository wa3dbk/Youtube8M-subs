00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
that basically addresses the issue now I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.600 
that basically addresses the issue now I
didn't<00:02:07.580> bandai's<00:02:08.239> oh<00:02:08.500> he<00:02:09.500> left<00:02:09.679> with<00:02:10.340> terrace

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
uploading on regular schedule again

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.880 
uploading on regular schedule again
because<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:39.840> brought<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.230> grade<00:02:40.440> up<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.680> little

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
because I brought that grade up a little

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.970 
because I brought that grade up a little
bit<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.840> think<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.170> about<00:02:43.200> sums<00:02:43.380> up<00:02:43.800> this

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
bit but I think that about sums up this

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.910 
bit but I think that about sums up this
episode<00:02:44.780> or<00:02:45.780> last<00:02:46.020> episode<00:02:46.560> because<00:02:46.709> we're

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
episode or last episode because we're

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
episode or last episode because we're
going<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.100> be<00:02:47.160> starting<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.760> new<00:02:47.940> server<00:02:48.300> I
