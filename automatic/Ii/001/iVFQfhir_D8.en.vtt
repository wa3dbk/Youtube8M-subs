00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello to this lesson, we will analyze how 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 create curtains 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.690
 well or in general or what fabric 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:19.970
 which we can manage to start 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:24.119
 let's take about the size of the fabric 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.699
 let's say that we do that initially 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.159
 All in the lines have taken this 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.399
 rectangle 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:42.510
 now go to effects 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:44.460
 modifier and included this effect here he 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.899
 allows you to make such chaotic 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.969
 polygons such a chaotic fabric 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.690
 it turns out 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.079
 the conversation is smooth and here we add value 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.149
 let's say we deliver a small value 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.820
 to make it easier to show and computer 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:08.840
 did not hang much but in principle here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:13.760
 can put and 404 that is 05 06 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.870
 Depending on the size of your fabric 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.830
 what you need to do next 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:24.200
 apply effect 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:29.570
 fabric prime effect go parameters 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:34.160
 select our object here it is you including 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 tissue properties and tidy up here 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:41.910
 the name is a lot of different fabrics and different 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.390
 densities are obtained if you want 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:49.650
 further to understand you can look 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 either poke see what 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:00.860
 opportunities I usually put 3 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.860
 choose don't forget to click ok 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:13.740
 so now take the boxes and so about 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:21.510
 I put it like that 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:27.600
 the little one was dragging up necessarily 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.319
 put this where you have points so here 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.950
 one box 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.260
 let's take through some step 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.720
 let's take it like this and add 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.739
 copy 10 pieces back okay and through this 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.989
 distance u set 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:53.430
 he even god many 10 let 's not remove 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:56.840
 join in here well, something like this should 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.959
 look and here 's a grid 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.060
 but there about should look 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.570
 sketch now what to do go in 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.280
 editor 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:15.200
 the coffin choose this point it will be 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:21.860
 associated with this boxing group 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:26.190
 press ok and using this key 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.200
 suggest boxing if you have a stage 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.820
 some other objects may crop 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.100
 another century is undesirable let's 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:42.329
 select the dash this point click again 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:45.890
 coffin okay and connect and also 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.890
 doing with the rest 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.420
 like this we can connect the effect 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:14.349
 turn off clicking here and banned perfectly 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.349
 let's go full screen 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.790
 This way you can in the pits 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.859
 make where you will take shape 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.740
 for example in this place also 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.310
 By applying each point box can also 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.790
 below as a lesson I will not make big 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.990
 I will do approximately explain how everything works 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.710
 but already looking at your imagination you can 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.840
 any any shape make your weave and 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.560
 now click let's give it realistic 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.660
 at first 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:53.410
 and press simulator that's how we see 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:57.010
 the fabric sagged as if now with animation 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.780
 now we can take moving and 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.260
 drag our fabric 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:08.180
 let's say here also notice we can take 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.250
 just three squares drag left 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.060
 mouse button does not release until the fabric 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.450
 transferred because there are glitches 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.000
 We wait until it will be transferred to its 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:25.270
 places then we can let go of the left button 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.440
 mouse I just came across when big 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.630
 a large number of polygons 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:36.590
 it hangs a little and throws you away 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:44.810
 it is also undesirable to raise 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:47.780
 upside down gravity works here not 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:51.590
 everything works fine as we see ours 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:55.789
 rules took this form can also 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.490
 move until we are not satisfied with any 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:02.419
 option then choose the fabric and turn off 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.250
 simulator in the future moses you want 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.490
 use it in the interior is better 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:13.040
 translate it all into a field translate into 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:17.590
 the field and at such an object we already have 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.810
 say in 3d and will no longer fade a 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.770
 if you are left to take out that is 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.430
 own option 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:29.840
 that back will be even it does not want 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:36.170
 Well, he can just finish it 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:40.340
 smoothing like this you like we see that 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:44.480
 the fabric is so crumpled it is due to the fact that 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:48.640
 fewer polygons than more polygons than 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:53.030
 smoother can add two more stings 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.540
 nude with us tutorial we came as 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:01.850
 create fabric also we could do 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:04.720
 there are squares and squeeze it up then 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.720
 following lessons
