00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.160
 right inside one of the root of the right 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.300
 the memory of the internal memory and 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:55.949
 rename some files to folder and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 modify his screen settings 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.430
 easy to upgrade to new maps and I 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.530
