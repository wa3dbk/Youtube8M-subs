00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.700
 Zdarova men and I will give and start with 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.829
 you all want to try 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.740
 play steel hunt if 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.870
 have not played yet and I say want yes I am 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.300
 absolutely sure the regime with objections 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.490
 it is already good it is vigorously and dynamically 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 but what is the essence of steel hunting and what 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.720
 it is different from superiority 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.650
 Now I will briefly tell you everything that you 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.510
 must know 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.399
 I understand that it will be difficult for you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.469
 believe but your main task is to type 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.309
 By the end of the battle more points than yours 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.079
 rivals 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.730
 if a player or platoon is gaining 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.530
 The required number of chu in before the end 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.140
 time will naturally win 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.390
 counted ahead of time to participate in the battle 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 players available 5 tanks with the letter b 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.140
 more or 25 tons of is-7 leopard-1 t57 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 heavy and object 268 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.530
 tactical and technical characteristics of these 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.780
 machines are exactly the same as existing 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.179
 blackheads fighting vehicles were 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.249
 naturally accrued for free if you 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.899
 rather rich Pinocchio you can 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.610
 will install equipment on them 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.340
 equipment transplanted to these tanks already 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 the crew in the hangar in this case 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.149
 he should be retrained for gold or 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.310
 loans but in general you will be quite 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.189
 enough to install on the tank a little 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.960
 repair kit first aid kit and charge the whole 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.630
 ammunition most that neither is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.759
 conventional shells major difference 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.340
 this game event was the division 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.070
 tasks in the battle of individual and platoon 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.939
 players the main task of the individual 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 solo players 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.070
 killing rivals and causing damage 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.869
 everyone here is just such guys playing 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.380
 for themselves they have no allies 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.299
 when capturing the flag of solo players flag 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.530
 destroyed victory points are awarded for 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.960
 causing damage to destroy rivals and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.969
 absorption she is already destroying the flags 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.789
 the main task of the platoon is the delivery of flags to 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.189
 marked areas a platoon must be composed 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.659
 of three players and going exactly the same 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.969
 just like a regular platoon is enough 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.189
 so that all three members of the platoon took the tanks 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.899
 drain the fish it represents 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.990
 separate combat unit all the rest 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.360
 combat participants are from foam 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.369
 name victory points earned by participants 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.860
 platoon summarizes victory points 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.280
 charged for delivering flags five 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.560
 points 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.349
 causing damage 3 points for every thousand 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.239
 damage and destruction of rivals one point 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.970
 for each frag here is another innovation 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.030
 during the battle, you can use combat 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.160
 reserves shelling and air strikes 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.989
 Reserves are not immediately available and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.750
 for effective actions in the game 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.880
 damage and destruction of rivals 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.459
 for the use of reserves is necessary 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.500
 press seven or eight and select 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.720
 their field of application is for 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.510
 the use of air strikes should indicate 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.519
 its direction using the mouse format 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.620
 Combat is chosen randomly during 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.739
 team gathering time there are three 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.480
 format single command and mixed 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.910
 in solo combat, everything is extremely simple 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.100
 12 sul players participate each by himself 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.049
 yourself no flags no victory points 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.480
 charged for damage and 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.580
 killing rivals for early 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.280
 wins player needs to earn 20 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.860
 points such as scoring a daughter for 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.630
 every thousand damage and a daughter for a coat in 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.840
 mixed combat is simultaneously 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.359
 four platoons and 4 player solas are battles 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.940
 all against all combat units considered 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.910
 a squad of three tankers or a solo player 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.950
 victory is won by a platoon or solo player 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.170
 who is the first to score 100 victory points 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.540
 or get more victory points by 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.850
 the end of the battle almost win accrued 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.370
 for damage destroying rivals and 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.280
 delivery in the case of a platoon and destruction 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.560

 damage 5 points for fak one point for 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.889
 absorption of the flag in the same team battle 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.350
 simply missing these same four 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.989
 sol player instead is still present 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.790
 one platoon cow now tell you a secret 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.040
 wins is the easiest instruction for those 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.139
 who do not understand nothing spectacular 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.850
 flags capture the flag this is the main way 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.319
 victory for the capture is necessary just 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.720
 get close to one of the flags on 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.490
 short distance 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.380
 and then move it to the delivery area 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.900
 after that the flag returns to 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.490
 do not forget the original position along the way 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.260
 enjoy rome zones they 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.510

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.370
 ammunition and do not be afraid to die 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.070
 the number of your revivals in the picture 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.410
