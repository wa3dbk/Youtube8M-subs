00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the assassinations a hot war a Cold War

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.549 
the assassinations a hot war a Cold War
and<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.149> shining<00:00:36.750> beacon<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and the one shining beacon in that

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.490 
and the one shining beacon in that
period<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.340> moon<00:00:38.670> missions<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
period was the moon missions and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.959 
period was the moon missions and
everything<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.620> possible<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
everything was possible it was a the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.729 
everything was possible it was a the
world<00:00:42.210> fair<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> decade<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.680> was

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
world fair was in that decade that was

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.910 
world fair was in that decade that was
all<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.280> tomorrow<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.710> lose

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
all about tomorrow and so if you lose

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.560 
all about tomorrow and so if you lose
your<00:00:47.309> space<00:00:47.969> edge<00:00:49.430> my<00:00:50.430> deep<00:00:50.879> concern<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> that

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
your space edge my deep concern is that

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.080 
your space edge my deep concern is that
you<00:00:51.840> lose<00:00:52.140> everything<00:00:52.800> else<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.309> society

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
you lose everything else about society

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.080 
you lose everything else about society
that<00:00:54.570> enables<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> compete<00:00:55.620> economically

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
that enables you to compete economically

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
that enables you to compete economically
of<00:00:57.090> course<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.480> went<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> moon<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.500> of

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
of course we went to the moon because of

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
of course we went to the moon because of
military<00:00:59.370> motivations<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:01.199> why<00:01:01.379> we

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
military motivations and that's why we

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.410 
military motivations and that's why we
stopped<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.340> anywhere<00:01:02.820> beyond<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> moon

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
stopped going anywhere beyond the moon

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.170 
stopped going anywhere beyond the moon
because<00:01:03.989> we<00:01:04.140> saw<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.379> Russia<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.700> done<00:01:05.939> they

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
because we saw that Russia was done they

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
because we saw that Russia was done they
were<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.510> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.200> moon<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
were not going to go to the moon the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.520 
were not going to go to the moon the
dreamers<00:01:08.820> back<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.240> were<00:01:09.420> thinking<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
dreamers back then were thinking that we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
dreamers back then were thinking that we
went<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.220> moon<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.909> were

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
went to the moon because we were

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.600 
went to the moon because we were
explorers<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.979> were<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> case<00:01:14.369> of

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
explorers and if that were the case of

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.890 
explorers and if that were the case of
course<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:15.000> would<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.150> continued<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
course we would have continued on to

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.140 
course we would have continued on to
Mars<00:01:16.140> but<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.009> didn't<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.610> obvious<00:01:18.000> in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
Mars but we didn't it was obvious in

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480 
Mars but we didn't it was obvious in
retrospect<00:01:18.450> why<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.439> didn't<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.340> argue

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
retrospect why we didn't I would argue

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.760 
retrospect why we didn't I would argue
that<00:01:20.640> today<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:22.020> think<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.409> China<00:01:22.680> as

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that today if we think of China as

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.730 
that today if we think of China as
competition<00:01:23.720> economic<00:01:24.720> competition<00:01:25.290> which

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
competition economic competition which

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
competition economic competition which
they<00:01:25.890> surely<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.750> pull<00:01:28.049> back<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.380> our

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
they surely are then to pull back on our

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.310 
they surely are then to pull back on our
space<00:01:28.770> ambitions<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.030> direct<00:01:30.570> sort<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
space ambitions is a direct sort of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
space ambitions is a direct sort of
lever<00:01:31.860> arm<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.520> our<00:01:32.790> capacity<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.420> compete

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
lever arm on our capacity to compete

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.950 
lever arm on our capacity to compete
economically<00:01:34.070> but<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.810> things

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
economically but if so one of the things

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.179 
economically but if so one of the things
you<00:01:37.079> talk<00:01:37.259> about<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.650> article<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you talk about in that article is that

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.120 
you talk about in that article is that
this<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.450> part<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> general<00:01:39.960> decline<00:01:40.619> in

the kind of sexiness of science but also

the amount of time energy we're putting
into<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> well<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.869> my<00:01:49.020> question<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.530> why

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
into it well so my question to you why

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.310 
into it well so my question to you why
should<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:50.549> use<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.970> indirect<00:01:51.630> path<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
should we use this indirect path to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.679 
should we use this indirect path to
science<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> fund<00:01:53.610> science<00:01:53.909> why

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
science if we want to fund science why

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.590 
science if we want to fund science why
not<00:01:54.899> fund<00:01:55.170> science<00:01:55.619> yeah<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.360> that's<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
not fund science yeah because that's a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
not fund science yeah because that's a
common<00:01:57.960> question<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.560> always<00:01:58.920> gets<00:01:59.399> asked

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
common question that always gets asked

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.730 
common question that always gets asked
and<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.450> happens<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> approach

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
and what happens is when you approach

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.770 
and what happens is when you approach
the<00:02:01.950> world<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.369> way<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:03.000> find<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.360> problem

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the world that way you find a problem

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.510 
the world that way you find a problem
and<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.990> say<00:02:04.170> well<00:02:04.350> let's<00:02:04.380> put<00:02:04.860> some<00:02:05.009> money<00:02:05.189> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
and you say well let's put some money to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.270 
and you say well let's put some money to
do<00:02:05.880> more<00:02:05.909> what<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.840> solution<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:08.160> that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
do more what the solution is to that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.040 
do more what the solution is to that
problem<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:09.119> they<00:02:09.330> amount<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.929> like

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
problem what they amount to are like

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.809 
problem what they amount to are like
band-aids<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.800> each<00:02:10.920> little<00:02:11.190> problem<00:02:11.610> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
band-aids on each little problem so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.880 
band-aids on each little problem so
today<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.780> need<00:02:12.930> more<00:02:13.140> scientists<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.770> let's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
today we need more scientists so let's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.059 
today we need more scientists so let's
May

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
May

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.130 
May
better<00:02:14.249> science<00:02:14.700> teachers<00:02:15.060> put<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.989> little

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
better science teachers put a little

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.229 
better science teachers put a little
band-aid<00:02:16.530> there<00:02:16.799> we<00:02:17.430> need<00:02:17.609> we<00:02:17.879> want<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.120> keep

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
band-aid there we need we want to keep

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.660 
band-aid there we need we want to keep
our<00:02:18.359> jobs<00:02:18.389> so<00:02:19.139> let's<00:02:19.439> make<00:02:19.859> incentives<00:02:20.430> for

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
our jobs so let's make incentives for

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.280 
our jobs so let's make incentives for
corporations<00:02:21.389> to<00:02:21.629> not<00:02:21.780> move<00:02:22.019> their

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
corporations to not move their

little<00:02:23.760> band-aid<00:02:24.150> there<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.959> go<00:02:25.079> around

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
little band-aid there and you go around

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.899 
little band-aid there and you go around
and<00:02:25.469> you<00:02:25.590> put<00:02:25.739> all<00:02:25.769> these<00:02:25.950> band-aids<00:02:26.370> down<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
and you put all these band-aids down and

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.920 
and you put all these band-aids down and
you're<00:02:27.299> ignoring<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:28.049> deeper<00:02:29.420> engine<00:02:30.420> that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you're ignoring a deeper engine that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.479 
you're ignoring a deeper engine that
could<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.319> operating<00:02:31.889> that<00:02:31.920> would<00:02:32.069> solve<00:02:32.250> all

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
could be operating that would solve all

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.849 
could be operating that would solve all
those<00:02:32.609> problems<00:02:32.930> simultaneously<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.319> worry

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
those problems simultaneously you worry

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.220 
those problems simultaneously you worry
a<00:02:34.980> lot<00:02:35.250> about<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.939> the<00:02:35.969> fact<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.719> people<00:02:37.019> are

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
a lot about the the fact that people are

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.860 
a lot about the the fact that people are
getting<00:02:37.500> very<00:02:37.799> cost-conscious<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.939> very<00:02:39.299> and

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
getting very cost-conscious and very and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.690 
getting very cost-conscious and very and
really<00:02:40.200> cutting<00:02:40.560> back<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.069> tell<00:02:41.250> story

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
really cutting back and you tell story

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.690 
really cutting back and you tell story
about<00:02:41.939> the<00:02:42.180> Hubble<00:02:42.569> telescope<00:02:43.230> explain<00:02:44.040> why

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
about the Hubble telescope explain why

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
about the Hubble telescope explain why
would<00:02:44.939> it's<00:02:45.239> important<00:02:45.659> and<00:02:45.780> what<00:02:45.900> happened

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
would it's important and what happened

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.289 
would it's important and what happened
oh<00:02:46.349> well<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:46.950> particular<00:02:47.489> case<00:02:47.669> it<00:02:47.969> was

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
oh well in that particular case it was

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.149 
oh well in that particular case it was
you<00:02:48.659> know<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> Hubble<00:02:49.079> telescope<00:02:49.200> as<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.859> may

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
you know the Hubble telescope as you may

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.800 
you know the Hubble telescope as you may
remember<00:02:50.219> when<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.090> was<00:02:51.120> launched<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.569> mirror

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
remember when it was launched the mirror

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.869 
remember when it was launched the mirror
had<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.139> wrong<00:02:52.319> curvature<00:02:52.889> to<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.099> images

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
had the wrong curvature to it images

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.610 
had the wrong curvature to it images
were<00:02:54.000> fuzzy<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.900> it'd<00:02:55.049> be<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.169> little<00:02:55.469> while

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
were fuzzy so it'd be a little while

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.199 
were fuzzy so it'd be a little while
before<00:02:55.650> we'd<00:02:56.250> get<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.549> repaired<00:02:57.000> with

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
before we'd get that repaired with

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.089 
before we'd get that repaired with
corrective<00:02:57.780> optics<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.590> what<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:58.829> you<00:02:58.919> do

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
corrective optics so what do you do

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.640 
corrective optics so what do you do
because<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.639> there<00:02:59.819> it's<00:02:59.879> offensive<00:03:00.650> you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
because it's up there it's offensive you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.770 
because it's up there it's offensive you
gotta<00:03:01.799> like<00:03:01.980> mount<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.370> mission<00:03:02.699> to<00:03:02.849> go<00:03:03.030> work<00:03:03.599> on

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
gotta like mount a mission to go work on

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.209 
gotta like mount a mission to go work on
it<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.049> you'd<00:03:04.260> be<00:03:04.439> clever<00:03:04.799> about<00:03:04.949> how<00:03:05.069> you

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
it and you'd be clever about how you

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.979 
it and you'd be clever about how you
design<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:06.030> corrective<00:03:06.540> because<00:03:06.870> that

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
design the corrective because that

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.689 
design the corrective because that
problem<00:03:07.379> was<00:03:07.500> not<00:03:07.650> anticipated<00:03:08.400> before

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:08.699 
problem was not anticipated before

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.580 
problem was not anticipated before
Hubble<00:03:09.090> was<00:03:09.329> launched<00:03:09.719> so<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.319> had<00:03:10.469> to<00:03:10.560> be

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
Hubble was launched so you had to be

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.349 
Hubble was launched so you had to be
really<00:03:11.069> clever<00:03:11.280> by<00:03:11.549> what<00:03:11.699> you<00:03:11.790> pulled<00:03:12.030> out<00:03:12.209> and

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
really clever by what you pulled out and

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.240 
really clever by what you pulled out and
what<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.569> swapped<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:13.980> there<00:03:14.189> was

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
what you swapped in and so there was

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.149 
what you swapped in and so there was
some<00:03:14.310> time<00:03:14.669> downtime<00:03:15.659> if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> will<00:03:16.139> where<00:03:16.739> you

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
some time downtime if you will where you

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.710 
some time downtime if you will where you
could<00:03:17.310> get<00:03:17.519> data<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.180> was<00:03:18.269> kind<00:03:18.479> of<00:03:18.569> fuzzy

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
could get data but it was kind of fuzzy

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.569 
could get data but it was kind of fuzzy
data<00:03:19.049> so<00:03:19.739> what<00:03:19.919> do<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.069> do<00:03:20.220> well<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.489> know

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
data so what do you do well you know

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.999 
data so what do you do well you know
want<00:03:20.699> to<00:03:20.759> waste<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.449> so<00:03:22.049> an<00:03:22.259> algorithm<00:03:22.590> was

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:23.009 
want to waste it and so an algorithm was

when<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:22.020> dream<00:05:22.290> big<00:05:22.530> in<00:05:22.979> an<00:05:23.790> agency<00:05:24.270> such<00:05:24.479> as

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
when you dream big in an agency such as

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.540 
when you dream big in an agency such as
NASA<00:05:24.840> and<00:05:25.139> it's<00:05:25.380> not<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.770> much<00:05:26.010> money<00:05:26.310> right

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
NASA and it's not that much money right

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.490 
NASA and it's not that much money right
now<00:05:27.180> it's<00:05:27.300> a<00:05:27.360> half<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.720> penny<00:05:27.870> on<00:05:28.139> your<00:05:28.290> tax

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
now it's a half a penny on your tax

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.219 
now it's a half a penny on your tax
dollar<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.979> say<00:05:29.280> double<00:05:29.490> it<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.630> penny<00:05:30.900> all

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
dollar I say double it to a penny all

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.860 
dollar I say double it to a penny all
right<00:05:31.350> then<00:05:31.919> we<00:05:32.310> go<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.520> Mars<00:05:32.850> in<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.240> big<00:05:33.450> way<00:05:33.630> in

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
right then we go to Mars in a big way in

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.650 
right then we go to Mars in a big way in
short<00:05:34.770> term<00:05:35.039> it<00:05:35.310> becomes<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:35.910> big<00:05:36.210> visible

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
short term it becomes a big visible

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.540 
short term it becomes a big visible
project<00:05:37.169> school<00:05:37.470> kids<00:05:37.770> know<00:05:37.950> about<00:05:37.979> it<00:05:38.370> and

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
project school kids know about it and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.610 
project school kids know about it and
who's<00:05:38.940> that<00:05:39.150> first<00:05:39.390> astronaut<00:05:39.870> class<00:05:40.080> today

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
who's that first astronaut class today

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.130 
who's that first astronaut class today
they're<00:05:41.130> in<00:05:41.340> middle<00:05:41.970> school<00:05:42.150> today<00:05:42.360> look<00:05:42.840> why

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
they're in middle school today look why

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.340 
they're in middle school today look why
not

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
not

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.469 
not
I<00:05:43.530> got<00:05:43.890> an<00:05:43.979> idea<00:05:44.220> let's<00:05:44.370> select<00:05:44.700> them<00:05:44.940> now<00:05:45.120> and

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
I got an idea let's select them now and

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.150 
I got an idea let's select them now and
then<00:05:45.870> we<00:05:45.990> all<00:05:46.080> contract<00:05:46.620> see<00:05:46.860> how<00:05:46.979> are<00:05:47.100> they

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
then we all contract see how are they

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.469 
then we all contract see how are they
eating<00:05:47.460> well<00:05:47.610> are<00:05:47.880> they<00:05:47.940> getting<00:05:48.120> good<00:05:48.360> grades

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
eating well are they getting good grades

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.930 
eating well are they getting good grades
that's<00:05:48.870> tomorrow's<00:05:49.500> mercury<00:05:49.890> 7<00:05:50.310> what<00:05:50.729> would

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
that's tomorrow's mercury 7 what would

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.790 
that's tomorrow's mercury 7 what would
we<00:05:51.060> learn<00:05:51.270> what<00:05:51.720> what<00:05:51.990> is<00:05:52.110> your<00:05:52.260> hope<00:05:52.470> about

we learn what what is your hope about

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800 
we learn what what is your hope about
the<00:05:52.860> Mars<00:05:53.190> mission<00:05:53.550> because<00:05:53.729> you<00:05:53.970> this<00:05:54.450> is<00:05:54.630> I

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
the Mars mission because you this is I

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.810 
the Mars mission because you this is I
mean<00:05:55.169> clearly<00:05:55.440> part<00:05:55.800> of<00:05:55.890> it<00:05:56.010> is<00:05:56.130> symbolic<00:05:56.460> but

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
mean clearly part of it is symbolic but

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.460 
mean clearly part of it is symbolic but
but<00:05:57.150> part<00:05:57.450> of<00:05:57.510> it<00:05:57.630> is<00:05:57.720> you<00:05:57.870> actually<00:05:58.020> think

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
but part of it is you actually think

but part of it is you actually think
there's<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.740> lot<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.039> learn<00:05:59.280> by<00:05:59.460> well<00:05:59.669> as<00:06:00.120> a

reasons for going into space NASA was
created<00:06:13.260> in<00:06:13.410> a<00:06:13.650> geopolitical<00:06:14.039> climate<00:06:14.490> if<00:06:14.970> we

created in a geopolitical climate if we

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:18.440 
created in a geopolitical climate if we
were<00:06:15.479> spooked<00:06:15.960> by<00:06:16.500> Sputnik<00:06:17.220> Sputnik<00:06:18.060> itself

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
were spooked by Sputnik Sputnik itself

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:20.120 
were spooked by Sputnik Sputnik itself
was<00:06:18.630> a<00:06:18.660> hollowed<00:06:19.050> out<00:06:19.139> intercontinental

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
was a hollowed out intercontinental

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.070 
was a hollowed out intercontinental

ballistic missile with the missile

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.480 
ballistic missile with the missile
removed<00:06:22.410> put<00:06:22.710> in<00:06:22.800> a<00:06:22.889> little<00:06:23.039> radio

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
removed put in a little radio

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.490 
removed put in a little radio
transmitter<00:06:24.090> so<00:06:24.660> everyone<00:06:24.960> said<00:06:25.139> oh<00:06:25.229> it's

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
transmitter so everyone said oh it's

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.110 
transmitter so everyone said oh it's
going<00:06:25.800> beat<00:06:26.010> the<00:06:26.280> military<00:06:26.729> knew<00:06:26.940> the

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
going beat the military knew the

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.129 
going beat the military knew the
implication<00:06:27.660> of<00:06:27.780> this<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:28.200> so<00:06:28.770> so<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:30.139> space

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
implication of this and so so the space

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:33.469 
implication of this and so so the space
station<00:06:31.500> itself<00:06:31.770> the<00:06:32.100> initial<00:06:32.580> impetus<00:06:33.060> was

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
station itself the initial impetus was

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.120 
station itself the initial impetus was
Russia's<00:06:34.110> building<00:06:34.560> their<00:06:34.710> own<00:06:34.830> space

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
Russia's building their own space

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.310 
Russia's building their own space
station<00:06:35.550> so<00:06:36.030> I<00:06:36.060> don't<00:06:36.390> have<00:06:36.510> a<00:06:36.539> problem<00:06:36.840> with

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
station so I don't have a problem with

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.050 
station so I don't have a problem with
geopolitical<00:06:37.770> arguments<00:06:38.550> for<00:06:38.669> going<00:06:38.880> into

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
geopolitical arguments for going into

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:39.750 
geopolitical arguments for going into
space

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.700 
space
let<00:06:40.180> all<00:06:40.330> the<00:06:40.540> reasons<00:06:40.930> reveal<00:06:41.500> themselves

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
let all the reasons reveal themselves

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.850 
let all the reasons reveal themselves
tourism<00:06:42.720> let<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:43.840> private<00:06:44.020> sector<00:06:44.200> go<00:06:44.620> take

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
tourism let the private sector go take

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.710 
tourism let the private sector go take
care<00:06:44.890> of<00:06:45.160> that<00:06:45.280> I<00:06:45.640> don't<00:06:45.910> have<00:06:46.060> any<00:06:46.240> problems

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
care of that I don't have any problems

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.870 
care of that I don't have any problems
with<00:06:46.870> that<00:06:46.900> and<00:06:47.230> I<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.470> scientist<00:06:48.220> send<00:06:48.700> me<00:06:48.790> to

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
with that and I a scientist send me to

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.510 
with that and I a scientist send me to
Mars<00:06:49.090> would<00:06:49.960> you<00:06:50.110> go<00:06:50.320> I<00:06:50.560> would<00:06:50.830> so<00:06:51.010> go<00:06:51.040> to<00:06:51.220> Mars

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520
