today's<00:00:24.890> theory<00:00:25.430> involves<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.060> premise<00:00:26.480> that

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
today's theory involves the premise that

today's theory involves the premise that
some<00:00:27.050> Pokemon<00:00:27.619> can<00:00:27.860> cause<00:00:28.070> more<00:00:28.460> problems

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 
than they're worth this theory was asked

by my love Jen and she suggested that

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.670 
by my love Jen and she suggested that
maybe<00:00:34.399> some<00:00:34.790> Pokemon<00:00:35.239> can<00:00:35.450> help<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.050> some<00:00:36.470> can

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
maybe some Pokemon can help but some can

hmm I have theorized myself that Pokemon

hmm I have theorized myself that Pokemon
joined<00:01:32.240> humans<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.900> achieve<00:01:33.200> greater<00:01:33.590> power

regardless<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.740> why<00:01:36.860> Pokemon<00:01:37.430> joined<00:01:37.700> humans

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
regardless of why Pokemon joined humans

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.240 
regardless of why Pokemon joined humans
it<00:01:38.330> happens<00:01:38.780> think<00:01:39.140> about<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.560> some<00:01:39.770> Pokemon

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
it happens think about it some Pokemon

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.399 
it happens think about it some Pokemon
have<00:01:40.430> enough<00:01:40.700> power<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.210> rule<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.659> world<00:01:41.869> and

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
have enough power to rule the world and

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.469 
have enough power to rule the world and
if<00:01:42.590> those<00:01:42.740> Pokemon<00:01:43.280> use<00:01:43.520> their<00:01:43.729> powers<00:01:44.180> with

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
if those Pokemon use their powers with

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.390 
if those Pokemon use their powers with
others<00:01:44.930> they<00:01:45.110> could<00:01:45.259> easily<00:01:45.530> amass<00:01:46.130> an

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
unstoppable army so let's agree that

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.230 
unstoppable army so let's agree that
it's<00:01:48.680> important<00:01:49.130> for<00:01:49.189> Pokemon<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.970> join

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
it's important for Pokemon to join

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.090 
it's important for Pokemon to join
humans<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.869> getting<00:01:51.110> greater<00:01:51.350> heights<00:01:51.680> now
