00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.250
 so I was very happy with this 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.680
 my participation in the world without 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.610
 kimono already had more or less than two 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.890
 I have not competed and been training 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.860
 strong I always kept training myself 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.840
 in this goal nor on honey did much training 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.660
 capable of jiu jitsu the back part if me to 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.340
 part of the card so I will spend good 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 maybe and training 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.440
 hence I already wanted to compete last year 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.140
 but I was here in Brazil in Italy 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.170
 he stays on the schedule is always very 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 heavy with every glass every amount 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 my fight 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.930
 the trip will come back last year was 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 that like this year I was there in 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.219
 California in Florida was already 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.820
 crouching on the date of the event decides to fight 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.280
 about three weeks ago so hit the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 I want to fight I stay here I will fight 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760
 Then I started to run after 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.680
 I had to join the card first 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.899
 who was not affiliated this year 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700
 Then I 'm training and I'm solving 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.590
 I'm training the card business and 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.060
 taking such documentation 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.170
 when I saw that the documentation was 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.909
 OK 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.369
 So I told you now, I have to fight. 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.920
 It was two weeks before he left. 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.079
 where do I know if I got cold Florida 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.779
 Where I'm living now, he's the ebit. 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:23.039
 For God's sake, and from Paul himself, 

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.869
 30 minutes 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.539
 So, you see every day for the gym. 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.899
 Pablo and I intensified it, missing three 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:33.389
 I've been focusing the preparation 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.880
 for that haftanin and training with 

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.340
 pablo joining with jorge santiago valerÃ¡ 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.789
 Brazilians have always been strong or 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.819
 happy as acting there made four fights 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.459
 is to win from the hard face leaving as the 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.859
 the olive leandro love that was 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.149
 There was a time without losing there so I stayed 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.639
 very happy there 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.549
 Of course I learned a lot too. 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:59.669
 in the competition was the competition of a 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:01.619
 where I saw that not as failure only the 

00:01:59.669 --> 00:02:03.959
 hard training that matters 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.380
 I think the training matters 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.330
 much more on fight day is a game 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.060
 so it's a more mental game 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.390
 so I had a strong head and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.720
 I was confident even though I knew 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.280
 Leandro and Victor were at a faster pace. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.209
 competition competing more than 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.980
 I 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.440
 I was very focused and focused. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.380
 very focused on winning in victory and not 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.150
 to maintain an aggressive style and 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.260
 move but at the same time do not lose 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.420
 position did not miss the alidade moment 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.640
 transition from one of the scores also 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.390
 so I was very focused was a 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.130
 determined to beat her or annoy her 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.380
 I think it was a 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.080
 important question in the fight with leandro 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.480
 love that is a hard guy and I stayed 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 all the time suffocating and bothering you 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.550
 do not let him no time accepted 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.489
 Wish was not ahead on the scoreboard 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.769
 So I've already started on the front and butter 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.870
 had a rhythm other than bothering him 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.090
 tried to leave him all the time he 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.700
 I was was not comfortable was 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 struggling to stay comfortable and this one 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.410
 It's the kind of fight I like to keep. 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.739
 the aggressiveness keep the movement 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.360
 keep up the pressure and leave my opponent 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.450
 all the time when 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.010
 superimposed on doing right as the 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.350
 area is a tough guy he has all 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.220
 controversy is enough to fight is a guy 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:30.410
 that is mma has had a belt of 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.410
 time in the coliseum of the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.090
 Oxy institution is a tough guy and already 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.250
 made international events 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.590
 I think I think it's a good test for me. 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.680
 a guy who has a lot more fight than me 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.140
 but at the same time this is the one that is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.430
 one of the coaching things that 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.549
 influence on my side as much as 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.040
 athlete entering recalls at an fc event 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.430
 Great to see all that adrenaline I 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.440
 I think they break down and can 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.660
 another call there to fetch the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.030
 first round victory was good to have 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.209
 fought jiu jitsu was something that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.540
 He gave a cheer the more so and see all there 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:11.540
 guys guys praise for barral was there 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.880
 He was stoked eating cyborg mourning 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.250
 robert victor of the guys there 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.019
 the mogiano liking type even having 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.090
 A while without fighting. 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.330
 the guys continue madonna the way they 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.340
 I fought in that word that I stayed 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.349
 changed the game it became a more boring game 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.050
 not everyone liked everyone 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.759

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.659
