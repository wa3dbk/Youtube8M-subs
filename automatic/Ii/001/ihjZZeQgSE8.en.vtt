for<00:01:12.750> another<00:01:12.869> surf<00:01:13.200> that's<00:01:13.439> fine<00:01:13.740> um<00:01:14.010> maybe<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
for another surf that's fine um maybe I

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.429

could have gone for a bo-bunch here I
don't<00:01:16.619> even<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.189> range<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
don't even think from that range of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
don't even think from that range of
bullet<00:01:17.820> punch<00:01:17.970> foot<00:01:18.180> kills<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:19.020> go

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
bullet punch foot kills so you know go

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.420 
bullet punch foot kills so you know go
for<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> pursuit<00:01:19.710> might<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.070> been<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.189> best

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
for the pursuit might have been the best

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.530 
for the pursuit might have been the best
option<00:01:21.229> but<00:01:22.229> yeah<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.070> anyway<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:23.850> he<00:01:24.330> ends<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
option but yeah so anyway so he ends a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600

brain in his own scizor and then what

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.039 
brain in his own scizor and then what
he's<00:01:26.820> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.840> had<00:01:28.020> no

switch out anyways I mean if I try to go

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.450 
switch out anyways I mean if I try to go
from<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:37.350> own<00:01:37.500> pursuit<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.250> want<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
from my own pursuit you really want to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.830 
from my own pursuit you really want to
do<00:01:38.579> anything<00:01:38.790> especially<00:01:39.090> since<00:01:39.600> he<00:01:39.689> wasn't

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
switching out to it was kind of a waste

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.399 
switching out to it was kind of a waste
so<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.360> gonna<00:01:42.450> go<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.750> charger<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.259> gonna

so I'm gonna go to my charger I'm gonna
go<00:01:43.500> for<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.740> mega<00:01:44.040> charizard<00:01:44.850> evolution<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
go for that mega charizard evolution and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.679 
go for that mega charizard evolution and
go<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.740> uh<00:01:46.850> dragon<00:01:47.850> dance<00:01:48.180> expecting

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
go for that uh dragon dance expecting

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.300 
go for that uh dragon dance expecting
him<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> switch<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.680> exactly<00:01:49.829> what

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
him to switch out which is exactly what

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.380 
him to switch out which is exactly what
happens<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.790> ends<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.119> corn<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
happens in the ends of corn in

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.300 
happens in the ends of corn in
tetrahymena<00:01:51.780> tar<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.799> honestly<00:01:52.979> thought

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
tetrahymena tar and I honestly thought

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.639 
tetrahymena tar and I honestly thought
that<00:01:53.549> an<00:01:53.939> earthquake<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.720> Charizard<00:01:55.470> would

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that an earthquake from Charizard would

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.319 
that an earthquake from Charizard would
be<00:01:55.770> able<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.009> knock<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.430> tyranitar<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
be able to knock out this tyranitar and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.440 
be able to knock out this tyranitar and
it<00:01:57.810> really<00:01:58.170> really<00:01:58.799> really<00:01:59.040> kills<00:01:59.820> me<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
it really really really kills me that it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
it really really really kills me that it
doesn't<00:02:00.899> because<00:02:01.170> now<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> could

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
doesn't because now I like I I could

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.760 
doesn't because now I like I I could
have<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.479> swept<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.380> thing<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
have really swept with it that thing I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 
have really swept with it that thing I
had<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.420> don't<00:02:06.750> know

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
charge our tax I felt like I could have

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.640 
charge our tax I felt like I could have
done<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.979> well<00:02:11.310> against<00:02:11.700> it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
done really well against it

Gliscor<00:02:47.480> now<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:49.069> we'll<00:02:49.280> just<00:02:49.430> you<00:02:49.549> know<00:02:49.670> see

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
Gliscor now and we'll just you know see

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.640 
Gliscor now and we'll just you know see
what<00:02:50.090> happens<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:50.569> all<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.840> fun<00:02:51.079> stuff<00:02:51.109> so

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
what happens with all this fun stuff so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.379 
what happens with all this fun stuff so
he<00:02:52.129> ends<00:02:52.310> up<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.519> for<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.730> u-turn<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.239> then

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
he ends up going for the u-turn and then

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:54.819 
he ends up going for the u-turn and then
he's<00:02:53.510> gonna<00:02:53.629> end<00:02:53.840> up<00:02:53.989> switching<00:02:54.230> out<00:02:54.500> he<00:02:54.739> is

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
he's gonna end up switching out he is

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.119 
he's gonna end up switching out he is
actually<00:02:55.099> going<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:55.700> go<00:02:55.790> into<00:02:56.120> his<00:02:56.329> charizard

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
actually going to go into his charizard

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.759 
actually going to go into his charizard
and<00:02:58.129> that's<00:02:58.939> honestly<00:02:59.299> like<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.989> guess<00:03:00.560> better

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
and that's honestly like I guess better

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.470 
and that's honestly like I guess better
for<00:03:01.040> him<00:03:01.189> because<00:03:01.579> I<00:03:01.879> can't<00:03:02.060> really<00:03:02.180> hit<00:03:02.420> him

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
for him because I can't really hit him

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.819 
for him because I can't really hit him
like<00:03:02.659> knock<00:03:02.840> office<00:03:03.170> are<00:03:03.290> gonna<00:03:03.379> do<00:03:03.560> that<00:03:03.680> much

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
like knock office are gonna do that much

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.410 
like knock office are gonna do that much
because<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.159> can't<00:03:04.370> knock<00:03:04.549> off<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.760> mega<00:03:04.939> stone<00:03:05.000> I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
because I can't knock off a mega stone I

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.899 
because I can't knock off a mega stone I
can<00:03:05.930> go<00:03:06.019> for<00:03:06.200> poison<00:03:06.620> but<00:03:06.739> that's<00:03:06.859> it<00:03:07.099> so<00:03:07.400> knock

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
can go for poison but that's it so knock

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.369 
can go for poison but that's it so knock
off<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.120> mega<00:03:08.420> stone<00:03:08.510> it's<00:03:08.810> really<00:03:09.139> all<00:03:09.260> I'm

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
off a mega stone it's really all I'm

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.990 
off a mega stone it's really all I'm
going<00:03:09.560> for<00:03:09.799> maybe<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> little<00:03:10.310> bit<00:03:10.519> of<00:03:10.549> toxic

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
going for maybe do a little bit of toxic

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.119 
going for maybe do a little bit of toxic
stall<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:11.840> go<00:03:11.959> for<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.170> poison<00:03:12.349> he's<00:03:13.040> just

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
stall so I go for the poison he's just

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.740 
stall so I go for the poison he's just
going<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.370> go<00:03:13.489> for<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.670> dragon<00:03:13.879> is<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:14.329> he<00:03:14.540> may

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
going to go for a dragon is if he may

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.259 
going to go for a dragon is if he may
evolve<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.590> gives<00:03:15.829> me<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.579> opportunity<00:03:16.819> to

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
evolve that gives me the opportunity to

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.369 
evolve that gives me the opportunity to
go<00:03:17.299> for<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.569> earthquake<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.049> that's<00:03:18.230> why<00:03:18.349> he's

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
go for the earthquake so that's why he's

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.720 
go for the earthquake so that's why he's
not<00:03:18.620> making<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.949> ball<00:03:19.129> bigger<00:03:19.370> you're<00:03:19.519> just

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
not making a ball bigger you're just

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.330 
not making a ball bigger you're just
curious<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.750> um<00:03:21.109> yeah<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:21.799> gonna<00:03:21.919> like

curious so um yeah I'm just gonna like

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.740 
curious so um yeah I'm just gonna like
keep<00:03:22.549> stalling<00:03:22.849> here<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.239> you<00:03:23.299> don't<00:03:23.449> do<00:03:23.569> my

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
keep stalling here and you don't do my

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.819 
keep stalling here and you don't do my
thing<00:03:23.989> stalling<00:03:24.919> it<00:03:25.069> up<00:03:26.379> really<00:03:27.379> not<00:03:27.680> much

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
thing stalling it up really not much

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.409 
thing stalling it up really not much
else<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.220> can<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.489> he's<00:03:28.790> going<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.030> go<00:03:29.180> for<00:03:29.389> a

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
else I can do he's going to go for a

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.849 
else I can do he's going to go for a
couple<00:03:29.629> roost<00:03:29.930> here<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.319> there<00:03:30.440> that's<00:03:30.650> not

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
couple roost here and there that's not

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.619 
couple roost here and there that's not
too<00:03:31.190> bad<00:03:31.239> um<00:03:32.919> although<00:03:33.919> like<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.579> plus<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.359> flare

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
too bad um although like a plus to flare

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.449 
too bad um although like a plus to flare
blitz<00:03:35.780> or<00:03:35.959> whatever<00:03:36.260> is<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:37.099> know<00:03:37.159> kind<00:03:37.430> of

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
blitz or whatever is it you know kind of

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.819 
blitz or whatever is it you know kind of
scares<00:03:37.730> me<00:03:37.790> right<00:03:38.060> now<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.510> he<00:03:39.379> now<00:03:39.500> heads<00:03:39.530> up

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
scares me right now so he now heads up

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.680 
scares me right now so he now heads up
going<00:03:40.040> for<00:03:40.129> the<00:03:40.190> mega<00:03:40.370> evolution<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.120> was<00:03:41.540> like

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
going for the mega evolution I was like

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.599 
going for the mega evolution I was like
okay<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:42.799> store<00:03:43.069> we're<00:03:43.190> gonna<00:03:43.250> go<00:03:43.430> for<00:03:43.549> the

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
okay this store we're gonna go for the

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.129 
okay this store we're gonna go for the
protect<00:03:43.909> and<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:44.359> works<00:03:44.510> out<00:03:44.629> very<00:03:44.690> nicely

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
protect and it works out very nicely

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.170 
protect and it works out very nicely
because<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:45.799> turn<00:03:46.069> is<00:03:46.250> of<00:03:46.790> course<00:03:46.940> its

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
because that turn is of course its

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.939 
because that turn is of course its
aren't<00:03:47.389> he<00:03:47.510> ends<00:03:47.870> up<00:03:48.019> going<00:03:48.349> for<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.769> mega

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
aren't he ends up going for the mega

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.199 
aren't he ends up going for the mega
evolution<00:03:49.489> we're<00:03:49.609> just<00:03:49.729> going<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.879> work<00:03:50.030> out

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
evolution we're just going to work out

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.000 
evolution we're just going to work out
very<00:03:50.359> nicely<00:03:50.659> so<00:03:51.349> now<00:03:51.470> what<00:03:51.620> I'm<00:03:51.739> going<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.889> do

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
very nicely so now what I'm going to do

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.319 
very nicely so now what I'm going to do
is<00:03:52.099> I'm<00:03:52.220> actually<00:03:52.340> going<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.669> bring<00:03:52.879> my<00:03:53.060> tint

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
is I'm actually going to bring my tint

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.479 
is I'm actually going to bring my tint
accrual<00:03:53.629> I<00:03:53.810> was<00:03:54.409> hoping<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:54.769> maybe<00:03:54.919> I<00:03:55.370> could

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
accrual I was hoping that maybe I could

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.610 
accrual I was hoping that maybe I could
you<00:03:55.849> know<00:03:55.879> get<00:03:56.180> some<00:03:56.449> recoiled<00:03:57.260> a<00:03:57.319> witch<00:03:57.500> with

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
you know get some recoiled a witch with

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.979 
you know get some recoiled a witch with
flare<00:03:57.889> blitz<00:03:58.040> in<00:03:58.250> toxic<00:03:59.090> but<00:03:59.540> actually<00:03:59.840> ends

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
flare blitz in toxic but actually ends

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.479 
flare blitz in toxic but actually ends
up<00:04:00.019> going<00:04:00.139> for<00:04:00.379> drank<00:04:00.590> law<00:04:00.829> instead<00:04:01.159> I<00:04:01.220> guess

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
up going for drank law instead I guess

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.099 
up going for drank law instead I guess
he<00:04:01.609> was<00:04:01.729> predicting<00:04:02.090> me<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.269> switch<00:04:02.449> out<00:04:02.659> or<00:04:02.900> he

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
he was predicting me to switch out or he

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.180 
he was predicting me to switch out or he
just<00:04:03.260> didn't<00:04:03.530> you<00:04:03.590> know<00:04:03.620> want<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:03.949> take<00:04:04.069> that

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
just didn't you know want to take that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.580 
just didn't you know want to take that
much<00:04:04.340> recoil<00:04:04.699> here<00:04:05.449> I<00:04:05.479> expect<00:04:06.109> him<00:04:06.229> to<00:04:06.349> go<00:04:06.440> for

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
much recoil here I expect him to go for

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.869 
much recoil here I expect him to go for
the<00:04:06.650> roost<00:04:06.919> expecting<00:04:07.459> meeting<00:04:07.699> over<00:04:07.849> the

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
the roost expecting meeting over the

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.550 
the roost expecting meeting over the
protects<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.449> that<00:04:08.720> didn't<00:04:09.079> happen<00:04:09.169> that<00:04:09.379> was

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
protects and that didn't happen that was
