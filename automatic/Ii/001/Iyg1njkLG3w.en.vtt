00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.430
 the boy monkeys 12 jackman and this is a 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:06.690
 movie video to answer them 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.790
 possibly the question that most have me 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.350
 done since I started uploading guides 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.690
 this game and this is how to get 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.889
 strange coins the monkey is released without 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.900
 destination and are used to buy you to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.150
 south the agent of the 9 exotic pieces 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.250
 Exceptional as well as consumables 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.539
 unique that only he can sell you and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.949
 Many have seen me whenever it comes to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 south I always have enough currency to 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.820
 buy almost anything 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.320
 of which it offers me so remarkable that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 Many want to know how to get 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.949
 enough of these in this video I'm going 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 to say all the possible methods of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 get strange coins as well 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 a couple of tips to get more in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.969
 a week the first method for 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 get good strangers is through 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.260
 of the crucible can you give one at the end of 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.090
 a game you have won or lost 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.100
 and it's completely random depends on the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.629
 100 percent of your luck so it's 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.309
 question of playing part of crucible and if 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.140
 you are lucky then it may come out 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.239
 one of these coins the second method 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 is with the tarp creep when you wear it 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 blue or purple engrams whether from 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.329
 weapons or armor or whatever it may be 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.149
 receive a foreign currency for a grass 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.789
 blue or two to three times a purple 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.110
 again this is also luckily another 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.090
 way to get strangers 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.860
 with public events when completing one of 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.210
 these with gold medal is possible 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.100
 get an external currency like 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
 reward though it 's pretty weird that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.420
 happen also by completing events 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.430
 public the poster to tower will give you 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.990
 as a gift package to get 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.270
 Gold medal in your first event 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.950
 public of the day in this package also 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 you may receive a strange currency if 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.310
 you are lucky and you can only get 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.940
 one of these per day that in each 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.460
 character 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.200
 following a rather weird way but 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 also possible to get coins 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.890
 you miss those through the chests that 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.259
 are found in all areas of the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.119
 planets this as I tell you is pretty 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.030
 weird, but if you want, you can 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.650
 try to look for them that way 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.210
 finally and not least the pot 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.280
 of gold the best way to get 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 strange coins in testing this is 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.420
 completing a weekly assault mission 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.430
 I say it's the best way because it's the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.810
 unique that assures us 100% get 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.610
 these coins but possibly also 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.899
 be the most difficult the way 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.369
 works this mission is as follows 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.869
 this mission has new coins 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.729
 strangers in a bank 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.179
 the mission comes in three difficulties of 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.070
 level 22 26 and 28 if you complete the level 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.290
 22 you will receive three strange coins 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.360
 completing the level 26 will have 6 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.730
 and level 28 is will give you all nine 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.739
 coins but eye if you complete first by 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.189
 example of level 22 and you get three 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.319
 coins 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.569
 the other two difficulties will have three 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.340
 less coins to offer you so if 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.709
 they have enough level you can do it 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.230
 level 28 that is the highest and receive 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.019
 all coins or make it level 22 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.970
 and take 3 and then get the others 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.590
 six that remain in the mission bank 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.540
 completing the other difficulties in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.040
 another moment but to the maximum that can 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.439
 receive with this mission are nine 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.109
 strange coins with each character in 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.879
 a week now here I bring you a 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.129
 trick or rather a strategy that has 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.750
 used many players to 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.180
 get many coins this years in 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.980
 a week the weekly mission can give you 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.840
 up to nine strange coins with each 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.329
 character so if for example you 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.040
 you have a level 28 hunter and complete 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.549
 the weekly assault and you get nine 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.829
 coins 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.319
 if you have another hunter created already in 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.209
 level 20 you can pass to that other 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.159
 hunter or another character all the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.530
 light armor of your first character 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.049
 through the trunk in the tower equip 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.060
 telos with your second hunter and you'll have 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.680
 a second character at level 28 with the 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.100
 that you can complete up to your weekly and 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.230
 receives 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.610
 the nine coins and you can do this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.830
 up to three times if you have three 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.810
 hunters in another case three titans or 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.430
 three sorcerers you can pass your 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.740
 armor with light between those three 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.390
 characters and receive up to 27 coins 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.580
 you miss with this method in a week 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.820
 completing the level jump mission 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.080
 28 this with each of these characters 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.790
 Of course, for this to work, you must 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.950
 take the trouble to create another 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.870
 character and take it up to level 20 what 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.910
 which you can honestly do in 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.830
 few days so good me 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.300
 personally I have not used this method anymore 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.640
 that my main character is a hunter 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.800
 and I then created myself a sorcerer and 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.510
 then a titan so the armor 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.190
 my hunter can not share them with 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.950
 us but my sincere is already at level 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.470
 25 so this week I could do 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.900
 level 28 assault with my hunter and the one 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.150
 level 26,000 and zero and receive 15 coins 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.710
 strangers with this method I know that for 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.820
 many of you even with this method 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.260
 and with all those that I mentioned 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.660
 previously it is possible that it is 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.610
 difficult to get strange coins and the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.140
 truth is that it's supposed to be like that 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.150
 game is designed so that you get 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.090
 exotic pieces is not a chore 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.740
 simple one last thing is that too 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.700
 you can get strange coins in 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.100
 The mission 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.870
 weekly this is a level 28 broadcast 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.720
 harder than the weekly jump route 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.610
 normal but still when completing it can 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.100
 receive quite a few strange coins like 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.200
 also other this material is 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.330
 ascending and legendary pieces or 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.150
 exotic and I've seen people get 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.130
 up to 11 or 20 as a reward coins 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.280
 strange as well as a friend received 5 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.260
 nothing else and it's a random method and then 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.930
 since these missions can also 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.100
 give you exotic pieces as a reward 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.780
 I think that if they actually came out 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.210
 strange coins because you had bad 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.620
 lucky so good guys this is my 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.150
 how to get strange coins guide 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.140
 in destination and many people 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.640
 I was asking that so then 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.290
 they commented the videos as I get 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.850
 so many and the truth is that most 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.500
 the times has been luckily with the 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.820
 first methods that I mentioned and 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.770
 doing the weekly missions every 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.300
 week so hope there 's nothing to them 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.530
 this the video any doubt is in the 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.000
 comments if they liked it not well 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.290
 they left like I like a favorite 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.270
 most very much subscribe to 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.860
 means of dressing and I just do not all 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.860
 feel video until next 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:29.520
 as to 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.750
 ah
