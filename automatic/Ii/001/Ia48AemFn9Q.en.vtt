00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.270 

and<00:02:27.290> now<00:02:27.470> we're<00:02:27.590> gonna<00:02:27.680> go<00:02:27.860> ahead<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.010> take<00:02:28.250> a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
and now we're gonna go ahead and take a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.860 
and now we're gonna go ahead and take a
look<00:02:28.459> at<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:29.030> ad<00:02:29.480> itself<00:02:29.860> we'll<00:02:30.860> do<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:30.980> 360<00:02:31.610> on

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
look at the ad itself we'll do a 360 on

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.720 
look at the ad itself we'll do a 360 on
you<00:02:32.870> know<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.989> far<00:02:33.290> away<00:02:33.470> shot<00:02:33.769> and<00:02:34.040> then<00:02:34.550> we'll

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
you know a far away shot and then we'll

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.809 
you know a far away shot and then we'll
show<00:02:34.940> some<00:02:34.970> I'll<00:02:35.360> show<00:02:35.540> some<00:02:35.810> close-ups<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
show some I'll show some close-ups on it

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.020 
show some I'll show some close-ups on it
so<00:02:38.769> there's<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.860> look<00:02:40.010> at<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.340> front<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.730> do

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
so there's a look at the front you do

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.300 
so there's a look at the front you do
have<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.390> head<00:02:41.569> that<00:02:42.349> does<00:02:42.590> swing<00:02:42.920> side<00:02:43.160> to

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
have the head that does swing side to

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.539 
have the head that does swing side to
side<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:44.629> don't<00:02:44.870> have<00:02:45.080> any<00:02:45.349> up-and-down<00:02:46.340> law

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
side you don't have any up-and-down law

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.150 
side you don't have any up-and-down law
that's<00:02:47.480> not<00:02:47.750> true<00:02:48.170> up<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:48.590> down<00:02:48.709> motion<00:02:48.890> you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
that's not true up and down motion you

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.920 
that's not true up and down motion you
can<00:02:49.340> Bob<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.760> like<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.120> but<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.840> will

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
can Bob it like that but it will

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.170 
can Bob it like that but it will
actually<00:02:51.170> move<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.920> down<00:02:52.069> but<00:02:52.970> you<00:02:53.090> do

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
actually move up and down but you do

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.789 
actually move up and down but you do
have<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.480> side<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> side<00:02:54.049> range<00:02:54.380> which<00:02:54.620> is

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
have the side to side range which is

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.000 
have the side to side range which is
really<00:02:55.069> cool<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.750> then<00:02:56.750> swing<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.709> around<00:02:57.829> to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
really cool and then swing it around to

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.759 
really cool and then swing it around to
the<00:02:58.069> other<00:02:58.130> side<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.810> same<00:03:00.019> on<00:03:00.560> this

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
the other side it is the same on this

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.280 
the other side it is the same on this
side<00:03:00.829> of<00:03:01.069> course<00:03:01.280> and<00:03:02.239> then<00:03:02.690> we'll<00:03:02.840> look<00:03:02.959> at

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
side of course and then we'll look at

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.250 
side of course and then we'll look at
the<00:03:03.890> rear<00:03:04.130> section<00:03:04.489> there<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:08.209> see<00:03:08.959> if<00:03:09.049> I<00:03:09.110> can

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the rear section there and see if I can

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.630 
the rear section there and see if I can
do<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:09.440> top<00:03:10.040> down<00:03:10.340> without<00:03:11.019> breaking<00:03:12.019> them<00:03:12.170> so

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
do it top down without breaking them so

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.170 
do it top down without breaking them so
there's<00:03:13.640> what<00:03:13.819> the<00:03:13.940> top<00:03:14.150> looks<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:16.180> I'll

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
there's what the top looks like and I'll

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.509 
there's what the top looks like and I'll
show<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:18.730> look<00:03:19.730> at<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.660> bottom<00:03:21.310> then<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.340> do

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
show you look at the bottom then we do

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.360 
show you look at the bottom then we do
have<00:03:22.700> poseable<00:03:23.209> legs<00:03:23.420> on<00:03:23.660> these<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:25.069> you<00:03:25.100> have

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
have poseable legs on these so you have

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.910 
have poseable legs on these so you have
the<00:03:25.639> front<00:03:25.940> leg<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.420> go<00:03:26.630> all<00:03:26.930> legs<00:03:27.350> move<00:03:27.560> but

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
the front leg that go all legs move but

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.960 
the front leg that go all legs move but
you<00:03:28.010> have<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.639> point<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.569> a<00:03:30.079> point<00:03:30.709> there<00:03:31.609> and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
you have a point here a point there and

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.530 
you have a point here a point there and
then<00:03:32.660> you<00:03:32.780> also<00:03:32.989> have<00:03:33.639> front<00:03:34.639> flex<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
then you also have front flex in the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.770 
then you also have front flex in the
feet<00:03:36.250> front<00:03:37.250> to<00:03:37.400> rear<00:03:37.639> nothing<00:03:38.150> side<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.540> side

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
feet front to rear nothing side to side

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.030 
feet front to rear nothing side to side
I<00:03:39.139> will<00:03:39.950> say<00:03:40.310> this<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:42.470> is<00:03:42.700> pretty<00:03:43.700> wobbly<00:03:45.040> as

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
I will say this this is pretty wobbly as

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.780 
I will say this this is pretty wobbly as
you<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:46.370> tell<00:03:46.639> there's<00:03:47.000> there's<00:03:47.359> not<00:03:47.720> much

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
you can tell there's there's not much

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.970 
you can tell there's there's not much
not<00:03:49.790> much<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.209> base<00:03:50.420> point<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:51.079> this<00:03:51.170> two<00:03:51.380> to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
not much of a base point for this two to

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.590 
not much of a base point for this two to
stand<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.489> I'll<00:03:52.579> stand<00:03:52.760> fine<00:03:53.120> when<00:03:53.359> you've<00:03:53.450> got

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
stand it I'll stand fine when you've got

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.500 
stand it I'll stand fine when you've got
the<00:03:53.750> leg<00:03:53.900> straight<00:03:54.260> like<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:55.269> just<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.329> little

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
the leg straight like this just a little

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.530 
the leg straight like this just a little
wobbly<00:03:56.690> if<00:03:57.319> you<00:03:58.040> start<00:03:58.400> trying<00:03:58.760> to<00:03:58.849> do<00:03:59.060> certain

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
wobbly if you start trying to do certain

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.670 
wobbly if you start trying to do certain
poses<00:03:59.780> where<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:01.069> foot<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.489> up<00:04:01.670> in<00:04:01.790> the<00:04:01.910> air<00:04:02.680> he

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
poses where the foot is up in the air he

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.710 
poses where the foot is up in the air he
really<00:04:04.220> wants<00:04:04.489> to<00:04:04.519> fall<00:04:04.790> over<00:04:05.120> even<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.599> you

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
really wants to fall over even if you

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.589 
really wants to fall over even if you
try<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:05.989> brace<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.440> with<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.680> other<00:04:06.829> legs<00:04:07.599> so

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
try to brace it with the other legs so

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.909 
try to brace it with the other legs so
you<00:04:08.660> just<00:04:08.900> do<00:04:09.079> have<00:04:09.230> to<00:04:09.349> be<00:04:09.470> careful<00:04:09.799> with<00:04:09.859> that

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
you just do have to be careful with that

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.289 
you just do have to be careful with that
and<00:04:10.419> then<00:04:11.419> also<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:12.230> did<00:04:12.739> notice<00:04:13.000> these<00:04:14.000> pieces

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
and then also I did notice these pieces

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.089 
and then also I did notice these pieces
tend<00:04:15.169> to<00:04:15.380> fall<00:04:15.769> off<00:04:15.980> somewhat<00:04:16.549> easy<00:04:18.010> when<00:04:19.010> you

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
tend to fall off somewhat easy when you

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:21.339 
tend to fall off somewhat easy when you
especially<00:04:19.400> when<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.789> move<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.180> legs<00:04:20.419> they

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:21.349 
especially when you move the legs they

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.250 
especially when you move the legs they
just<00:04:21.590> they<00:04:21.769> pop<00:04:22.039> off<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.720> that's<00:04:23.720> kind<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.080> just

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
just they pop off so that's kind of just

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.300 
just they pop off so that's kind of just
a<00:04:24.500> downfall<00:04:25.310> of<00:04:25.430> that

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
a downfall of that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.090 
a downfall of that
so<00:04:26.760> closer<00:04:27.000> look<00:04:27.210> at<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.630> body<00:04:27.950> we'll<00:04:28.950> open

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
so closer look at the body we'll open

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.910 
so closer look at the body we'll open
this<00:04:29.370> door<00:04:29.700> which<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.450> opens<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.590> actually

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
this door which this opens it actually

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.120 
this door which this opens it actually
opens<00:04:32.160> on<00:04:32.310> both<00:04:32.490> sides<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:33.410> have<00:04:34.410> room<00:04:34.800> on<00:04:34.950> the

of<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:14.070> ad<00:06:14.250> app<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:15.180> I<00:06:15.210> definitely<00:06:15.750> like<00:06:16.260> this

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
of the ad app so I definitely like this

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.950 
of the ad app so I definitely like this
set<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:17.669> only<00:06:17.880> few<00:06:18.120> drawbacks<00:06:18.330> were<00:06:18.720> like<00:06:18.870> I

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
set the only few drawbacks were like I

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.680 
set the only few drawbacks were like I
said<00:06:19.140> it's<00:06:19.410> a<00:06:19.500> little<00:06:19.770> wobbly<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.430> legs<00:06:20.690> are

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
said it's a little wobbly the legs are

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.029 
said it's a little wobbly the legs are
somewhat<00:06:22.080> hard<00:06:22.289> to<00:06:22.320> pose<00:06:22.530> as<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:22.770> can<00:06:22.890> tell

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 
somewhat hard to pose as you can tell

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.380 
somewhat hard to pose as you can tell
there<00:06:23.190> I've<00:06:23.310> got<00:06:23.460> a<00:06:23.490> different<00:06:23.820> pose<00:06:24.000> on<00:06:24.270> them

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
there I've got a different pose on them

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.170 
there I've got a different pose on them
so<00:06:25.350> some<00:06:25.560> bending<00:06:25.860> of<00:06:25.979> the<00:06:26.010> legs<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:26.850> just<00:06:26.970> got

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
so some bending of the legs you just got

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.219 
so some bending of the legs you just got
to<00:06:27.270> be<00:06:27.330> careful<00:06:27.450> because<00:06:27.600> you<00:06:27.750> can't<00:06:27.960> take<00:06:28.140> it

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
to be careful because you can't take it

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.140
