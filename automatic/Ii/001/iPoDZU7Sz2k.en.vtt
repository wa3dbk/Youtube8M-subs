00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.420
 you're from your plate more darina of 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.660
 meiland azewijn 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.969
 we are in jelte today 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.870
 just over the german border i'm on that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.789
 the 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.920
 sand the corn on stage I'm Jan 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.720
 krosenbrink and I am with the 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.580
 kverneland group benelux we sell 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.980
 so among other things the his machine like that 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.410
 we back here at work we see 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.630
 bought the two because we do 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.170
 the same in the contracting company 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.570
 machines 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.490
 we like to be 3 strawberries 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.690
 structure that we have 12 reijers 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.809
 theoretical 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.670
 do you talk about the same capacity and the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.570
 12 rows 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.590
 is a machine that is free at the moment 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.530
 is universal and in a certain 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.840
 union formality of the size here 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.160
 we are among the 12 row optima 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.989
 here cutting discs have a double 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.000
 cutting discs ge cable so cutting discs 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.620
 for the art miss administration that can 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.359
 still some depth that can with a pin-hole 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.429
 connection can be set 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.850
 and there is a continuous press on the 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.010
 skye 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.840
 disks say that he is always in 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.729
 the soil remains the boring element 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.530
 therefore also has a spring pressure 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.420
 setting if the machine is on the ground 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.909
 state we can add another 100 kilos here 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.110
 put extra pressure on you you can see that 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.380
 I still have to get a little bit on it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.799
 put 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.340
 but he can also be busy 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.979
 to become 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.439
 we have double depth wheels here 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.659
 can be continuously adjusted and 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.100
 the deep wheels can commute 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.280
 So there should vault to a can is the 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.200
 can therefore always follow here with the soil 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.390
 there is even more room for a toddler 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.340
 the cloud timer is actually among these 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.049
 circumstances not necessary but he cares 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.939
 there for sure that the depth wheels and what 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.540
 have nice bed to say about it 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.430
 walk 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.000
 we work with 369 shredders ourselves 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.340
 the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.040
 multiple of and six rows in 12 rows 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.930
 that spoke us somewhat to see you too 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.659
 say that in the in the chopping world 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.689
 but they have gone bigger becker 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.549
 and then you have to get the plot 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.049
 can sow or shred 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.820
 but do you have the advantage of being in the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.890
 corner a very fast are also gone 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.050
 you have a large 9 meter wide 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.360
 once in the corner and and you are right 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.750
 You thus a large lot that is 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.550
 that is really an advantage of van 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.230
 of wider machines in addition 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.980
 this machine so specialty that he 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.470
 can be switched off per row and also on GPS 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.060
 can be switched off in combination with a 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.830
 straight line system as under the hands of 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.120
 john deere but also other brands and we 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.680
 can therefore in geer 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.720
 papers say so we can row and 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.410
 switch off per one trip and two on the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.790
 three 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.310
 but actually with a row so to speak 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.510
 it is the nicest contour you have 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.270
 despite the machine for the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.760
 the outside world seems to work great 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.560
 actually very efficient 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.290
 that the every nexcare corn with double 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.320
 is sown and not so much that you have the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 only saves on granules 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.510
 but also often where you double the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.580
 jesse diseases and such and yet 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.260
 loss of revenue 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.870
 that that's the right place for you 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.850
 rear the v pressure rollers 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.410
 which ensure that the well is well 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.150
 stuck in the ground head in one 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.130
 kind of compile you and who can be here 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.560
 we also put extra pressure on that 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.000
 the seed pressed well we are 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.770
 even the wheels can 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.540
 adjust position if you are on whole 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.070
 Club Brugge ground sits on heavy clay soil 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.930
 we can do the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.090
 say for something else together 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.549
 but that he does not write a blockage 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.470
 and well press the 12 rows first in terms of 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.019
 weight not heavier than the aga rows 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.360
 the way for time also because that 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.480
 quite compact behind the tractor 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.060
 on the other hand, we do have it 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.110
 a slightly larger art with stock 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.209
 U.S 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.640
 which is also compact with the tractor 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.020
 built so that the weight is still reasonable 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.660
 is in balance and the total weight 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.720
 not much more than the one in the previous row 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.210
 and that it is still with a free one 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.090
 compact tractor can be in this case 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.800
 We are very satisfied we hope we have too 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.290
 just may or may not double with 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.320
 sowing but that actually brings one 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.410
 benefit because you get boring during it 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.920
 the weight certainly in the charge are you 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.200
 lost 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.489
 because that machine itself is on land 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.890
 walk if we look at the total 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.200
 machine then it is therefore parallel 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.880
 foldable in double extendable 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.890
 that is, he claps his 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.960
 four elements above the ball the lower one 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.030
 4 elements and those are also sent to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.670
 pushed in the actual 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.160
 position or the height transport height is 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.750
 is 3 meters in and five centimeters good 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.820
 so it keeps him free from the bottom 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.820
 your three and a half meter transport 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.590
 height and is therefore within 3 meters 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.560
 transport width that is also important 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.520
 here are small containers on these elements 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.500
 in a capacity of 30 liters 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.290
 we also have an even bigger bakery of 55 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.160
 liter then that three meters ten 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.400
 transportation 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.440
 About the width you need to get well 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.930
 delve into the operation of the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.300
 electronics in the control sketch of 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.940
 john that you as the ark what boring 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.130
 machine in this case the clutch that 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.660
 that well matched what the best leather 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.400
 Missing is of course to do with 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.260
 start and then you run into problems 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.170
 to 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.260
 didam either by experts all 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.200
 minutes and I just want to 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.440
 say with 1 or 2 days sow the doctrine 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.250
 you just know the machine very quickly and 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.930
 now I can say after a boring week 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.100
 that the mill is logic is not 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:38.030
 difficult it is even a very big one 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.820
 project and I that it pulls car 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.520
 systems they have it right it 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.040
 track next to the drive 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.930
 possibility that you actually whole 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.030
 can be boring and relax for the rest 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.100
 just the satellite does the job 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.450
 the cost of van of the boring 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.430
 will be for the for the 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.500
 end user are not helped but 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.240
 his proceeds will be great 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.630
 thus ultimately he has there 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.630
 solution 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.550
 the
