and what's rocket League it's hard to
exactly<00:01:22.170> put<00:01:22.380> my<00:01:22.500> finger<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
exactly put my finger on it is that the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.870 
exactly put my finger on it is that the
great<00:01:24.119> use<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.450> physics<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> Oh

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
great use of physics is it the Oh

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
great use of physics is it the Oh
moments<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.030> occur<00:01:27.060> multiple<00:01:27.960> times<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.650> game

moments that occur multiple times a game

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.890 
moments that occur multiple times a game
is<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> angles<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> teamwork

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
is it the use of angles and teamwork

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.469 
is it the use of angles and teamwork
maybe<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.250> general<00:01:32.670> silliness<00:01:33.360> of
