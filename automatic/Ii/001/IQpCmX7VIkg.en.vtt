00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.849
 ecological and the problem of 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.370
 Amazon logging and we will do it with 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.949
 an expert professor eustorgio 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:19.340

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.370
 also a good one 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.220
 a rising star on TV even in the 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.920
 cinema also a note 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:34.160
 short model and debora calligaris 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:37.309
 that they don't want to be well then 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.800
 professor and how harmful the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.790
 Masonic deforestation for ours 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.890
 beautiful planet deforestation signs that 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.559
 the elimination of the arboreal vegetation 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.670
 in a wooded area of the reasons for 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.980
 which one practices is one of these kind of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.960
 operations of are many pc's can 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.670
 be both negative and positive 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.790
 and when he talks about the negative ones to 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.640
 better to talk about deforestation than 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.770
 the plants were very much 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.140
 I prefer flowers because they are all 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.840
 colorful plants instead are usually 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.610
 always only green 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 I think the most beautiful are those that 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.320
 then they do well the flowers well but there 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.580
 I remember that Professor Calligaris is a 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.770
 your disposal if any of you 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.479
 out a question he wants to ask me 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.840
 something about logging 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.750
 Amazon let's hear, I'm a marco e 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.330
 natural good even if they are not 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 contrary and to make some retouches 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.679
 here and there of course the important thing is that it is 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.080
 well done obviously we remind you that 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.569

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.520
 the ecological problem it involves 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.780
 in short, therefore, I remind you that he sees 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.869
 the professor available who is there 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.780

 memory and it is only here 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.890

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.300
 well in a barn 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.200
 no because the whole page was there for 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.580
 charity I realize however the theme is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.220
 deforestation 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.370
 the ecological problem and this involves 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 so here is the band member 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.080
 and of our party of John the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.290

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.209
 on behalf of the whole band I wanted to know 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.010
 debora have you ever had group sex 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.630
 clear at this point he applied 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.310
 we speak to the professor for professor 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 I want to know what the problem is 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.970
 which involves them we will exit from the dal 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.970
 deforestation problem 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.440
 basically they danced by 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.060
 deforestation 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.180
 an example in that cauldron of 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.920
 champion is that of rooting la 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 of passions and illegal in some areas 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.209
 wooded for the construction of works 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.880
 masonry agricultural and commercial activities 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.130
 this type you're looking at me 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.250
 legs not like the eye fell but was 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.610
 listening to the professor there is no mica 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.930
 nothing bad is a pleasure to fascinate 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.930
 a man as intriguing as that 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.910
 good morning of cases becomes eradication 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.270
 because the present proceeds to 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.730
 Pope deforestation was holding one 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:46.400
 machine and not the concept I think it is 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.350
 right about fitness you know I understand 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.930
 that just slept the thing at 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.030
 Calf is there really of 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.880
 thick reasons when its time 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.650
 she and I say it goes well the here must not 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.030
 also stop for non education 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.980
 it seems to me that the young lady has it 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.400
 interrupted before I do it 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.340
 courtesy please and fitness 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.790
 actually treadmill and exercise bike 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.970
 because in short, firm and fast it stops him 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.970
 yet
