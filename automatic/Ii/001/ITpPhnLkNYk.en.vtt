charger or wireless charger it uses
electromagnetic<00:01:41.579> induction<00:01:42.210> which<00:01:42.659> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
electromagnetic induction which is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.030 
electromagnetic induction which is
basically<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.259> stick<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> battery<00:01:43.890> pack

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
basically you just stick a battery pack

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620 
basically you just stick a battery pack
in<00:01:44.340> your<00:01:44.369> device<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:44.909> then<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> also<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
in your device and then you also have a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.780 
in your device and then you also have a
charging<00:01:46.020> station<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:47.070> same<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.340> magic

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
charging station and I same with magic

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.490 
charging station and I same with magic
mouse<00:01:47.970> right<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.479> just<00:01:48.930> stick<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> battery

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

in<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> place<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.250> top<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.820> will

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
in and place it on top and it will

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 
in and place it on top and it will
charge<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.380> charge<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> every

review in the future with that now of

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.320 
review in the future with that now of
course<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.190> soundboard<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.730> only<00:03:02.940> as<00:03:03.120> good<00:03:03.209> as

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
course the soundboard is only as good as

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.240 
course the soundboard is only as good as
its<00:03:03.630> mike<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.080> that's<00:03:04.230> why<00:03:04.410> i<00:03:04.440> splurged<00:03:05.190> a

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
its mike so that's why i splurged a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.590 
its mike so that's why i splurged a
little<00:03:05.430> bit<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.670> go<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:05.910> blue<00:03:06.240> spark

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
little bit and go out a blue spark

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.480 
little bit and go out a blue spark
condenser<00:03:07.080> microphone<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:08.190> runs<00:03:08.340> on

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
condenser microphone and it runs on

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.460 
condenser microphone and it runs on
phantom<00:03:08.880> power<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.930> was<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.110> little<00:03:10.260> bit<00:03:10.380> of

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
phantom power so it was a little bit of

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.780 
phantom power so it was a little bit of
a<00:03:10.530> hassle<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:10.950> i<00:03:11.130> did<00:03:11.310> need<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.520> sound

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
a hassle because i did need a sound

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.940 
a hassle because i did need a sound
board<00:03:12.000> with<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.420> microphone<00:03:12.930> but<00:03:13.770> it<00:03:13.860> was

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
board with this microphone but it was

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
board with this microphone but it was
definitely<00:03:14.130> worth<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.640> makes<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.060> very<00:03:15.090> clear

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
definitely worth it makes a very clear
