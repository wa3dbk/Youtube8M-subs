different thing than the geologists

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.410 
different thing than the geologists
would<00:01:05.519> do<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> same<00:01:06.180> team<00:01:11.420> observation

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
would do with the same team observation

would do with the same team observation
is<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> key<00:01:13.260> skill<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:14.040> geological<00:01:14.670> science<00:01:15.090> now

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
is a key skill in geological science now

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
is a key skill in geological science now
it<00:01:15.960> allows<00:01:16.259> us<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.710> characterize<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it allows us to characterize and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.149 
it allows us to characterize and
understand<00:01:18.270> how<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.140> planet<00:01:19.740> earth<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
understand how the planet earth is

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.600 
understand how the planet earth is
formed<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.140> what<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.290> find<00:01:22.680> fascinating<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
formed and what I find fascinating is a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
formed and what I find fascinating is a
geologist<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.360> artists<00:01:24.930> can<00:01:25.110> look<00:01:25.290> at

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
geologist is how artists can look at

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.340 
geologist is how artists can look at
very<00:01:25.740> same<00:01:26.070> material<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.210> work<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> in

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
very same material that I work on and in

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.310 
very same material that I work on and in
this<00:01:28.470> particular<00:01:28.650> picture<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:30.420> artists<00:01:31.170> has

this particular picture the artists has

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.920 
this particular picture the artists has
taken<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> geological<00:01:32.280> map<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.820> has<00:01:33.630> created

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
taken a geological map and has created

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.890 
taken a geological map and has created
art<00:01:34.380> by<00:01:35.100> abstracting<00:01:35.939> parts<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.630> map

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
during the three years we've held it the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.390 
during the three years we've held it the
concept<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.139> fabric<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.710> land<00:04:38.889> appears<00:04:39.280> to

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
concept of fabric of the land appears to

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.600 
concept of fabric of the land appears to
be<00:04:39.520> trapped<00:04:39.790> in<00:04:40.000> two<00:04:40.120> artists<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:40.900> laymen<00:04:41.290> and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
be trapped in two artists and laymen and

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.210 
be trapped in two artists and laymen and
scientists<00:04:42.610> alike<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.380> we<00:04:44.380> hope<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:44.950> this

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
scientists alike and we hope that this

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.540 
scientists alike and we hope that this
might<00:04:45.520> form<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.410> cornerstone<00:04:47.410> possibly<00:04:48.280> for

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
might form the cornerstone possibly for

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.320 
might form the cornerstone possibly for
a<00:04:49.000> broader<00:04:50.010> multimedia<00:04:51.010> visual<00:04:51.490> arts<00:04:51.850> type<00:04:52.150> of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
a broader multimedia visual arts type of

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.810 
a broader multimedia visual arts type of
celebration<00:04:52.600> that<00:04:53.560> can<00:04:53.710> be<00:04:53.830> held<00:04:54.040> annually<00:04:54.639> at

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
the University of Aberdeen so from his

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.940 
the University of Aberdeen so from his
humble<00:04:57.790> beginnings<00:04:58.000> which<00:04:58.960> was<00:04:59.260> around<00:04:59.800> the

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
humble beginnings which was around the

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.100 
humble beginnings which was around the
curry<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.490> an<00:05:00.910> Aberdeen<00:05:01.270> restaurant<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:01.990> we

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
curry and an Aberdeen restaurant as we

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.690 
curry and an Aberdeen restaurant as we
were<00:05:02.229> discussing<00:05:02.620> things<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.220> do<00:05:03.370> with<00:05:03.520> our

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
were discussing things to do with our

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.940 
were discussing things to do with our
time<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.780> we've<00:05:05.050> actually<00:05:05.229> come<00:05:05.650> up<00:05:05.800> with

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
time and we've actually come up with

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.800 
time and we've actually come up with
something<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.340> appears<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:06.910> have<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.060> UK

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
something that appears to have a UK

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.190 
something that appears to have a UK
national<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:08.470> international<00:05:09.100> resonance<00:05:10.200> we

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
national and international resonance we

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.610 
national and international resonance we
think<00:05:11.950> that<00:05:12.070> the<00:05:12.690> concept<00:05:13.690> can<00:05:13.930> be<00:05:13.990> exported

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
think that the concept can be exported

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.340 
think that the concept can be exported
to<00:05:14.830> overseas<00:05:15.610> universities<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.600> we<00:05:17.169> have

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
to overseas universities and we have

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.110 
to overseas universities and we have
some<00:05:17.530> interest<00:05:17.890> now<00:05:18.160> from<00:05:18.460> North<00:05:18.669> American

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
some interest now from North American

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.690 
some interest now from North American
universities<00:05:19.720> who<00:05:20.229> see<00:05:20.470> this<00:05:20.650> as<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.919> unique

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
universities who see this as a unique

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.150 
universities who see this as a unique
form<00:05:22.060> of<00:05:22.270> outreach<00:05:23.080> into<00:05:23.470> their<00:05:23.620> communities

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
form of outreach into their communities

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.180 
form of outreach into their communities
and<00:05:24.370> if<00:05:25.240> they<00:05:25.419> ask<00:05:25.450> us<00:05:25.810> we<00:05:26.440> will<00:05:26.590> be<00:05:26.650> certainly

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
and if they ask us we will be certainly

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.270
