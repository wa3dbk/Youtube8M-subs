00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
from it the more insight I gained from

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.160 
from it the more insight I gained from
my<00:01:00.989> experience<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:02.420> guess<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.780> traditionally

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
my experience I guess it traditionally

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
my experience I guess it traditionally
is<00:01:04.290> called<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.619> near-death<00:01:05.010> experience<00:01:05.720> though

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is called a near-death experience though

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
is called a near-death experience though
I<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> case

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
I don't know if that was really the case

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.030 
I don't know if that was really the case
but<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> guess<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.750> didn't<00:01:10.320> know<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> Croke<00:01:10.770> as

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
but I guess I didn't know the Croke as

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.690 
but I guess I didn't know the Croke as
you<00:01:11.760> say<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.900> did<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.409> non-physical<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.400> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you say and I did go non-physical and I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.480 
you say and I did go non-physical and I
guess<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.240> told<00:01:15.450> by<00:01:15.600> my<00:01:15.750> doctors<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.320> as<00:01:17.250> far

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
guess I'm told by my doctors that as far

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
guess I'm told by my doctors that as far
as<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.729> vitals<00:01:18.060> they<00:01:18.150> flatlined<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:19.070> some

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
as my vitals they flatlined for some

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.789 
as my vitals they flatlined for some
unknown<00:01:20.250> period<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.700> time<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.780> did<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
unknown period of time and I did go to a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.210 
unknown period of time and I did go to a
a<00:01:23.430> non<00:01:23.729> physical<00:01:23.909> state<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.299> existence<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.220> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
a non physical state of existence and it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.800 
a non physical state of existence and it
was<00:01:26.369> magical<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.030> was<00:01:27.150> wonderful
