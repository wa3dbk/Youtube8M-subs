00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.519
 well it's waves if sir bertrand 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.159
 good meet up for a new 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.929
 commented video so on call of duty 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.489
 black ops first judges so have a 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.060
 little return on this game it is rather 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.259
 pleasure 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.599
 so this is my first time 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.129
 offers black ops so on my channel 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.629
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.910
 party a team death match so 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.530
 on the gingn knapk is rather favorable 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.980
 so to try to make big 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.840
 massacre 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.730
 especially since it is a map that is 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.370
 a map enough discovered good to do 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.289
 kills with helicopters it's rather 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.269
 effective so I use uncle aircraft 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.129
 so a soul that is aesthetically very 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.780
 very ugly but I can tell you that a 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.359
 art like this this as soon as you have 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.769
 some mastery we can say that 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.210
 you can frankly do very 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.519
 big bubbles so really from very 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.800
 heavy very carnage excuse me 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.690
 the little bug just you to see 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.400
 than during this gameplay with a weapon 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.770
 like this one I advise you when 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.670
 even two to get around the enemy for 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.980
 take them from behind 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.630
 it is true that it is a little more 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.950
 advised to do this style of play 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.870
 especially a weapon like this 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.720
 especially it's a gunshot so 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.190
 whoever finds it must still 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.450
 have some control of weapons 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.950
 arafat so it's true that it's not 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.900
 a blowjob 25 so kivu 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.460
 we will say that it takes a burst for me 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.560
 am a guy but once you have 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.330
 a certain mastery so we'll say 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.640
 as soon as you really tend 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.640
 have a really good shoot so with a 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.390
 weapon like this you have to 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.730
 approximately drawn at the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.840
 thorax for maximum two burst you 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.480
 see that during this gameplay 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.000
 in general I will really put one to 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.520
 two burst maximum there may be 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.040
 at a time when I'm going to put 3 burst 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.420
 late I really do not know anymore but 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.390
 in general when the guy is a one shot 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.580
 in general you put at least one 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.170
 burst to kill him so I'm so 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.610
 the strict kids we will say basic because 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.070
 that it's still the most used 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.260
 in this opus so the blackbird as well 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.090
 that dogs by louis and dogs 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.170
 so there in passing to a small bug 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.420
 which I am not what I wanted to do 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.680
 I am going to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.569
 my blackburn but without doing it on purpose 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
 I started my hearing so frankly 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.450
 I was a little disgusted because 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.800
 I told myself good I 'm farting a 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.870
 little bit my series p you eat could have 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.030
 to have my dogs but eventually big I 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.190
 will succeed to continue to my series 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.810
 so I'll just try to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.850
 cover the area with my helicopter so 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.560
 story of not get pummeled my 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.150
 series to his clothes especially good 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.620
 I was in the middle rejected two 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.959
 tips in full go so what was 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.150
 barely shut I was not really 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.510
 discreet so with regards to my 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.800
 assets so assets I finally use 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.569
 give in to all I advise you when 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.650
 even on this box so with age and 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.650
 11 so I advise you a weapon 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.060
 secondary of which a gun finally the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.739
 secondary weapon we feel a little bit 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.010
 but all of them I advise you 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.000
 especially on all two main 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.560
 especially right now if you come a 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.660
 little bit on this black ops returns from 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.700
 donate me I advise you enormously 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.200
 using sleight of hand so pro 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.640
 story of aiming faster 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.739
 since it's still a weapon to 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.510
 burst so do not forget that when 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.130
 you are in close combat with a 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.130
 enemy who is an automatic weapon so 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.030
 what can be a galil an ak 47 or 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.430
 even machine guns 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.440
 it is true that it is a little more 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.000
 you are a little less hungry you 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.820
 is at a disadvantage compared to the enemy 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.790
 who will be able to adjust more quickly 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.079
 with a weapon this finally automatic so 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.760
 there at the passage of the nesting blocks name 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.709
 you evokes that I think necessarily do 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.329
 a lot of kiel with my other way I 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.549
 assure you that I continued my series 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.290
 so that's it then so I said so 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.489
 the sleight of hand to aim more 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.799
 so quickly when you're at camp 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.320
 record is still the ideal especially 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.290
 good it's a weapon that like I wanted 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.810
 said to a very good sets since good 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.900
 she has a time between each burst 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.700
 pretty low pretty short so this allows 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.410
 to chain a second burst very 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.709
 or can quickly compare 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.480
 still with the n 8 on black ops 2 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.579
 so frankly this is one of my 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.200
 favorite weapons even though it looks like 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.950
 nothing is true but hey it stays when 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.170
 even a weapon 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.299
 so frankly I wanted to advise 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.549
 so so I used 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.440
 will pee so I hack to avoid the 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.740
 equipment and half good I you 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.050
 advise a little bit about all 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.640
 if just because at mans there is 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.010
 new players I find so 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.040
 on this black ops religions especially good 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.330
 it's been 2 years since 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.430
 finally let's say it's left to 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.440
 abandonment if I can say that if I can 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.820
 to say it's like that apologizes and me a 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.320
 little bit by the common early since we 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.850
 will say that big players are when 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.740
 same party on the other giants this 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.340
 which is a little normal and everything 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.160
 simply 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.540
 but I think there are a lot of new 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.550
 Players who use quotation marks 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.190
 a little bit the codes of that as soon as he 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.300
 there is another who who comes out is 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.740
 it's just the players who 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.060
 do not have too many levels that 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.890
 do not really know the maps and who 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.480
 play we'll say a little bit so 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.490
 disgusting but hey we go a little bit 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.550
 understand them even if it's a small 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.050
 little bit of theirs so that's so 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.180
 a little bit the gameplay I you 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.650
 present so finally it's a good 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.880
 gameplay you to see that it could have been 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.230
 pass for me you 'll see that good 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.490
 I'm going a little bit you this pole and I 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.920
 will finish on a perfect which I 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.020
 are going to die no time so I want 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.280
 also to send this video so 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.990
 by the side that I so frankly a 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.250
 thank you so much to my dear Claude on their 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.500
 frankly it really makes me 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.640
 a lot of pleasure 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.110
 frankly to develop my channel that 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.720
 would be the ideal so here is the little 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.250
 end flame so I finish on a 38 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.380
 0 so frankly a very nice score 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.880
 on twickenham like this so I'll you 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.010
 say to the next for another video 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.190
 a big thank you side that I have by all 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.190
 the world
