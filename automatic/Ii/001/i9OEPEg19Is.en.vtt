the reason why I like it so much is that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.910 
the reason why I like it so much is that
it<00:01:16.370> does<00:01:16.640> not<00:01:16.850> strip<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.420> hair<00:01:17.810> too<00:01:18.530> too<00:01:18.710> much

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
you the consistency that's the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.979 
you the consistency that's the
consistency<00:03:36.590> right<00:03:37.160> there<00:03:37.400> so<00:03:37.850> it's<00:03:38.750> not

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
consistency right there so it's not

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.539 
consistency right there so it's not
liquidy<00:03:39.530> it's<00:03:39.860> definitely<00:03:41.260> creamy<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.590> nice

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.660 
liquidy it's definitely creamy and nice
and<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:43.910> like<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.299> feel<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.620> product<00:03:46.400> P

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
and I like the feel of it this product P

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.449 
and I like the feel of it this product P
I<00:03:46.910> think<00:03:47.390> if<00:03:47.540> you<00:03:47.690> use<00:03:47.900> maybe<00:03:48.230> too<00:03:48.530> much<00:03:48.920> too

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
I think if you use maybe too much too

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.940 
I think if you use maybe too much too
often<00:03:49.730> I'm<00:03:50.360> sure<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:50.989> will<00:03:51.079> create<00:03:51.410> product

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
often I'm sure it will create product

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.729 
often I'm sure it will create product
build-up<00:03:52.310> but<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:54.890> they<00:03:55.100> have<00:03:55.430> the

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
build-up but I and then they have the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.729 
build-up but I and then they have the
moisture<00:03:57.739> intense<00:03:58.540> bouncy<00:03:59.540> curl<00:04:00.019> pudding<00:04:00.470> and

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
moisture intense bouncy curl pudding and

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.580 
moisture intense bouncy curl pudding and
I<00:04:01.250> believe<00:04:01.549> that<00:04:01.579> this<00:04:01.880> is<00:04:01.940> meant<00:04:02.390> for<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.930> wash

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
I believe that this is meant for a wash

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.509 
I believe that this is meant for a wash
and<00:04:03.890> go<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:05.570> can<00:04:05.750> probably<00:04:05.989> use<00:04:06.799> this<00:04:07.070> for

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
and go and you can probably use this for

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.910 
and go and you can probably use this for
twist<00:04:07.820> ups<00:04:08.030> as<00:04:08.269> well<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:09.320> this<00:04:09.530> is<00:04:09.709> mainly

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
twist ups as well but this is mainly

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.640 
twist ups as well but this is mainly
