fire<00:02:08.729> danger<00:02:09.289> qpf<00:02:10.289> wise<00:02:10.500> we're<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:10.950> looking

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
fire danger qpf wise we're not looking

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
fire danger qpf wise we're not looking
at<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.430> lot<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> precipitation<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
at a lot of precipitation but the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.100 
at a lot of precipitation but the
question

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
question

moisture is leaving and the cold air is
arriving<00:03:10.200> so<00:03:10.770> one<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.250> those<00:03:11.400> things<00:03:11.550> where<00:03:11.700> we

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
arriving so one of those things where we

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.030 
arriving so one of those things where we
may<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.209> few<00:03:12.300> snow<00:03:12.900> flurries<00:03:13.110> oh<00:03:13.470> and

may see a few snow flurries oh and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.509 
may see a few snow flurries oh and
Monday<00:03:14.610> could<00:03:14.820> be<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:14.970> day<00:03:15.209> where<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.650 
barrel system we've got the clothes low
up<00:03:55.350> over<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:56.850> north<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.269> Great<00:03:57.360> Lakes

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
up over just north of the Great Lakes

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.600 
up over just north of the Great Lakes
and<00:03:57.900> then<00:03:58.080> we've<00:03:58.200> got<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.470> bit<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.160> an<00:03:59.250> open

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
and then we've got a bit of an open

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.170 
and then we've got a bit of an open
trough<00:03:59.910> over<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:01.110> extreme<00:04:01.980> western<00:04:02.519> gulf<00:04:03.000> of

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
trough over the extreme western gulf of

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.080 
trough over the extreme western gulf of
mexico<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:04.290> pattern<00:04:04.650> flattens<00:04:05.489> even<00:04:05.850> more

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
mexico that pattern flattens even more

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.530 
mexico that pattern flattens even more
as<00:04:06.330> we<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.660> into<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:06.989> more<00:04:07.850> zonal<00:04:08.850> flow<00:04:08.880> across

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
as we get into a more zonal flow across

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.330 
as we get into a more zonal flow across
much<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.380> eastern<00:04:10.560> half<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.280> country

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
much of the eastern half of the country

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.490 
much of the eastern half of the country
as<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:12.120> long<00:04:12.299> wave<00:04:12.510> trough<00:04:12.840> seems<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.350> be

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
as the long wave trough seems to be

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.949 
as the long wave trough seems to be
dampening<00:04:14.010> out<00:04:14.190> just<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.700> little<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.299> of

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
dampening out just a little bit and of

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.180 
dampening out just a little bit and of
course<00:04:15.989> we'll<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.620> watching<00:04:17.040> that

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
course we'll have to be watching that

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.030 
course we'll have to be watching that
little<00:04:17.390> disturbance<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.570> gulf

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
little disturbance in the gulf

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.650 
little disturbance in the gulf
suggestions<00:04:20.040> are<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.430> we<00:04:20.549> will<00:04:20.729> have<00:04:20.910> a<00:04:20.940> cold

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
suggestions are that we will have a cold

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.320 
suggestions are that we will have a cold
front<00:04:21.720> approaching<00:04:22.410> from<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.740> north<00:04:23.330> west

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
front approaching from the north west

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.540 
front approaching from the north west
but<00:04:24.810> as<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.349> can<00:04:25.410> see<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.830> 540<00:04:26.340> line

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
but as you can see the 540 line

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.490 
but as you can see the 540 line
now<00:04:26.729> back<00:04:26.940> up<00:04:26.970> into<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.599> Ohio<00:04:27.930> River<00:04:28.229> Valley

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
now back up into the Ohio River Valley

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.379 
now back up into the Ohio River Valley
so<00:04:28.949> it<00:04:29.069> looks<00:04:29.220> like<00:04:29.310> we<00:04:29.580> should<00:04:29.759> be<00:04:29.789> warming<00:04:30.270> up

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
so it looks like we should be warming up

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.390 
so it looks like we should be warming up
with<00:04:30.599> that<00:04:30.780> flattening<00:04:31.259> of<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.409> pattern<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
with that flattening of the pattern the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.279 
with that flattening of the pattern the
pattern<00:04:32.430> becomes<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.240> little<00:04:33.389> remained

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
pattern becomes a little remained

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.439 
pattern becomes a little remained
somewhat<00:04:34.680> zonal<00:04:35.159> but<00:04:35.340> also<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.970> taking<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
somewhat zonal but also is taking on a

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.129 
somewhat zonal but also is taking on a
little<00:04:36.659> bit<00:04:36.900> more<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.259> a<00:04:37.349> southwesterly<00:04:39.139> fetch

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
little bit more of a southwesterly fetch

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.110 
little bit more of a southwesterly fetch
to<00:04:40.409> it<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.770> means<00:04:41.099> that<00:04:41.370> we<00:04:41.490> should<00:04:41.819> warm

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
to it and that means that we should warm

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.450 
to it and that means that we should warm
up<00:04:42.300> nicely<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.960> as<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.710> front<00:04:43.979> approaches

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
up nicely and as that front approaches

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.460 
up nicely and as that front approaches
will<00:04:44.699> have<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.240> rain<00:04:45.509> around<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.110> first<00:04:46.319> of

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
will have a rain around the first of

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.700 
will have a rain around the first of
februari<00:04:46.949> and<00:04:47.310> then<00:04:48.210> by<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:49.020> time<00:04:49.169> we<00:04:49.440> get<00:04:49.560> out

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
februari and then by the time we get out

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.559 
februari and then by the time we get out
into<00:04:49.919> voodoo<00:04:50.099> country<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:51.030> looks<00:04:51.300> like<00:04:51.449> the

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
into voodoo country it looks like the

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.430 
into voodoo country it looks like the
GFS<00:04:51.990> is<00:04:52.169> suggesting<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.979> the<00:04:54.440> deepest

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
GFS is suggesting that the deepest

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.189 
GFS is suggesting that the deepest
trough<00:04:55.740> would<00:04:56.039> be<00:04:56.190> over<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:57.240> western<00:04:57.930> part<00:04:58.169> of

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
trough would be over the western part of

00:04:58.199 --> 00:04:59.570 
trough would be over the western part of
the<00:04:58.259> country<00:04:58.440> with<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:58.889> fairly<00:04:59.370> substantial

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
the country with a fairly substantial

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.089 
the country with a fairly substantial
Ridge<00:05:00.300> centered<00:05:01.289> over<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.620> Florida

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
Ridge centered over the Florida

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.939 
Ridge centered over the Florida
peninsula<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:02.879> a<00:05:02.909> big<00:05:03.629> big<00:05:04.229> change<00:05:04.590> for<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
peninsula so a big big change for the

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.200 
peninsula so a big big change for the
eastern<00:05:05.280> half<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.550> country<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:06.030> that

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
eastern half of the country is that

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.379 
eastern half of the country is that
would<00:05:06.389> signal<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.080> significant<00:05:07.710> warmup

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
would signal a significant warmup

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.700 
would signal a significant warmup
unfortunately<00:05:09.389> with<00:05:09.690> a<00:05:09.719> significant<00:05:10.319> warm<00:05:10.530> up

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
unfortunately with a significant warm up

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.350 
unfortunately with a significant warm up
when<00:05:11.159> we<00:05:11.250> look<00:05:11.430> out<00:05:11.639> around<00:05:12.060> three<00:05:12.210> hundred

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
when we look out around three hundred

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.180 
when we look out around three hundred
and<00:05:12.569> seventy-two<00:05:12.930> hours<00:05:13.080> around<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.889> ninth

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
and seventy-two hours around the ninth

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.309 
and seventy-two hours around the ninth
of<00:05:14.430> februari<00:05:14.819> that<00:05:15.389> certainly<00:05:15.810> looks<00:05:15.900> like

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
of februari that certainly looks like

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.149 
of februari that certainly looks like
this<00:05:16.560> could<00:05:16.919> have<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:18.240> look<00:05:18.449> of<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:19.199> severe

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
this could have the look of a severe

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.119 
this could have the look of a severe
weather<00:05:20.340> potential<00:05:21.199> especially<00:05:22.199> across<00:05:22.740> the

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129 
weather potential especially across the

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.339 
weather potential especially across the
southeastern<00:05:23.789> US<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.569> a<00:05:24.599> fairly<00:05:25.110> strong

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
southeastern US with a fairly strong

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.010 
southeastern US with a fairly strong
trough<00:05:25.800> coming<00:05:26.250> out<00:05:26.819> of<00:05:26.879> the<00:05:27.300> Rockies<00:05:27.509> and

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
trough coming out of the Rockies and

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.399 
trough coming out of the Rockies and
that<00:05:28.289> Ridge<00:05:29.190> over<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.969> Southwest<00:05:30.870> Atlantic

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
that Ridge over the Southwest Atlantic

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.070 
that Ridge over the Southwest Atlantic
pumping<00:05:31.830> up<00:05:31.949> the<00:05:32.159> warmth<00:05:32.490> into<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:33.300> eastern

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
pumping up the warmth into the eastern

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.809 
pumping up the warmth into the eastern
half<00:05:34.289> of<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.500> country<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:34.919> it<00:05:35.340> looks<00:05:35.520> like<00:05:35.580> it

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
half of the country so it looks like it

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.550 
half of the country so it looks like it
would<00:05:35.940> be<00:05:36.000> warmer<00:05:36.509> but<00:05:36.690> we<00:05:36.870> also<00:05:37.050> might<00:05:37.349> have

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
would be warmer but we also might have

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.350 
would be warmer but we also might have
the<00:05:37.650> potential<00:05:38.009> for<00:05:38.490> some<00:05:38.849> severe<00:05:39.210> weather

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
the potential for some severe weather

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.990 
the potential for some severe weather
but<00:05:40.229> that's<00:05:40.440> voodoo<00:05:40.770> country<00:05:41.310> remember<00:05:41.639> so

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
but that's voodoo country remember so

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.580 
but that's voodoo country remember so
we're<00:05:42.300> kind<00:05:42.630> of<00:05:42.690> speculating<00:05:43.259> there<00:05:43.469> it

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
we're kind of speculating there it

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.469 
we're kind of speculating there it
certainly<00:05:43.889> has<00:05:44.099> a<00:05:44.130> look<00:05:44.430> of<00:05:44.639> potential<00:05:45.449> for
