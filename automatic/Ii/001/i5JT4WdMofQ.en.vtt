today about what robot basic can do with
the<00:00:29.099> simple<00:00:29.460> little<00:00:29.580> robot<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.330> simply

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the simple little robot and a simply

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.030 
the simple little robot and a simply
little<00:00:30.900> simulation<00:00:33.440> what<00:00:34.440> you're<00:00:34.620> seeing<00:00:34.829> on

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
little simulation what you're seeing on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130 
little simulation what you're seeing on
the<00:00:35.130> screen<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> actual<00:00:36.570> program<00:00:37.020> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the screen is the actual program is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
the screen is the actual program is
going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> control<00:00:37.680> our<00:00:37.800> simulation<00:00:38.340> now

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
going to control our simulation now

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.119 
going to control our simulation now
obviously<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.750> can't<00:00:40.200> read<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.800> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
obviously you can't read it here so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
obviously you can't read it here so
we're<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> zoom<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.180> look<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.450> each

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we're going to zoom in and look at each

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.940 
we're going to zoom in and look at each
of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> sections<00:00:43.079> independently<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
of the sections independently this is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
of the sections independently this is
the<00:00:47.129> main<00:00:47.309> program<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.480> notice<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> it

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the main program you notice that it

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
the main program you notice that it
calls<00:00:49.289> several<00:00:49.770> subroutines<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.210> one

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
calls several subroutines we have one

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.080 
calls several subroutines we have one
that<00:00:51.719> draws<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.230> line<00:00:52.379> itself<00:00:52.910> one<00:00:53.910> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that draws the line itself one that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
that draws the line itself one that
initializes<00:00:54.660> our<00:00:54.989> robot<00:00:55.610> has<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.820> moves

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
initializes our robot has it moves

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.459 
initializes our robot has it moves
forward<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.230> it's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
forward just a little bit so that it's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
forward just a little bit so that it's
actually<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.890> line<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> then<00:00:59.550> we<00:00:59.670> follow

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
actually on the line and then we follow

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.690 
actually on the line and then we follow
the<00:01:00.359> line

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.430 

you<00:01:03.060> see<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.780> bunch<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.170> line

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
you see here is a bunch of line

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.860 
you see here is a bunch of line
statements<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.610> draw<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.910> actual<00:01:06.480> line<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
statements to draw the actual line that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.010 
statements to draw the actual line that
the<00:01:06.960> robot<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.350> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> follow<00:01:08.690> robot<00:01:09.690> basic

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the robot is going to follow robot basic

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.410 
the robot is going to follow robot basic
has<00:01:10.200> many<00:01:10.680> many<00:01:10.920> graphic<00:01:11.400> commands<00:01:11.820> but<00:01:12.300> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
has many many graphic commands but you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.720 
has many many graphic commands but you
can<00:01:12.540> look<00:01:12.690> at<00:01:12.780> those<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.200> help<00:01:13.380> files

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
can look at those in the help files

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.970 
can look at those in the help files
let's<00:01:14.730> move<00:01:14.940> on

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.430 

in<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.640> subroutine<00:01:19.030> were<00:01:19.600> initializing<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
then an hour since command this is the

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.050 
then an hour since command this is the
command<00:01:59.350> that<00:01:59.500> actually<00:01:59.920> reads<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.580> sensors

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
command that actually reads the sensors

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.520 
command that actually reads the sensors
on<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.270> bottom<00:02:01.720> that<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:01.899> tell<00:02:02.259> where<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
on the bottom that can tell where the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.130 
on the bottom that can tell where the
line<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.190> we're<00:02:04.090> adding<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.570> with<00:02:04.720> one<00:02:04.960> or

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
line is and we're adding it with one or

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.840 
line is and we're adding it with one or
four<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.590> look<00:02:05.710> at<00:02:05.830> either<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.100> left<00:02:06.430> sensor

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
four to look at either the left sensor

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.300 
four to look at either the left sensor
or<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.119> right<00:02:07.270> sensor<00:02:07.690> so<00:02:08.619> what<00:02:08.800> happens<00:02:09.130> is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
or the right sensor so what happens is

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.670 
or the right sensor so what happens is
if<00:02:09.520> there's<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.450> sensor<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.050> right<00:02:11.230> we

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
if there's a sensor on the right we

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.020 
if there's a sensor on the right we
decide<00:02:11.980> which<00:02:12.190> way<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.400> turn<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> vice<00:02:13.780> versa

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
decide which way to turn and vice versa

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.070 
decide which way to turn and vice versa
this<00:02:16.030> way<00:02:16.209> we're<00:02:16.420> going<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.660> have<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> robot

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
this way we're going to have the robot

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.740 
this way we're going to have the robot
turning<00:02:17.770> every<00:02:18.100> time<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.550> gets<00:02:19.000> off<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.569> line

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
turning every time it gets off the line

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.229 
turning every time it gets off the line
a<00:02:19.780> little<00:02:20.020> bit<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:21.250> let's<00:02:21.430> see<00:02:21.640> what<00:02:21.850> happens

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
a little bit but let's see what happens

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.420 
a little bit but let's see what happens
when<00:02:22.330> we<00:02:22.569> run<00:02:22.600> this<00:02:22.930> program<00:02:23.140> because<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:23.980> may

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
when we run this program because it may

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.490 
when we run this program because it may
not<00:02:24.640> respond<00:02:25.420> exactly<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.200> way<00:02:26.319> you<00:02:26.380> expect

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
not respond exactly the way you expect

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.250 
not respond exactly the way you expect
when<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.709> run<00:02:29.920> this<00:02:30.130> program<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.810> robot<00:02:31.989> is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
when we run this program the robot is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.240 
when we run this program the robot is
going<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.530> try<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.830> follow<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.430> line<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.100> we're

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
going to try to follow the line so we're

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.850 
going to try to follow the line so we're
going<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.430> run<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.700> now<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.569> see<00:02:37.840> them<00:02:38.050> screen

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
going to run it now we see them screen

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.100 
going to run it now we see them screen
come<00:02:39.069> up<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.730> robots<00:02:40.120> moving<00:02:40.360> along<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.049> the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
come up the robots moving along and the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.870 
come up the robots moving along and the
long<00:02:41.350> as<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:41.709> moving<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.190> fairly<00:02:42.489> straight

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
long as it's moving on a fairly straight

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.330 
long as it's moving on a fairly straight
line<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.269> does<00:02:43.450> fine<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.560> hits<00:02:44.769> this<00:02:44.980> sharp

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
line it does fine but it hits this sharp

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.550 
line it does fine but it hits this sharp
curve<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:46.000> it<00:02:46.060> doesn't<00:02:46.480> turn<00:02:46.660> back<00:02:46.959> fast

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
curve and it doesn't turn back fast

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.180 
curve and it doesn't turn back fast
enough<00:02:47.950> hits<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.850> wall<00:02:49.739> causing<00:02:50.739> an<00:02:50.980> error

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
enough hits the wall causing an error

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.000 
enough hits the wall causing an error
let's<00:02:51.459> zoom<00:02:51.610> in<00:02:51.730> here<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.060> see<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.360> error<00:02:52.510> is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
let's zoom in here and see the error is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.990 
let's zoom in here and see the error is
a<00:02:54.010> collision

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.350 

in<00:03:01.540> our<00:03:01.780> original<00:03:02.320> fellow<00:03:02.530> line<00:03:03.090> we<00:03:04.090> found

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
in our original fellow line we found

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.900 
in our original fellow line we found
that<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.050> robot<00:03:05.470> would<00:03:05.920> fail<00:03:06.250> when<00:03:06.490> I<00:03:06.520> got<00:03:06.730> to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
that the robot would fail when I got to

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.750 
that the robot would fail when I got to
a<00:03:06.940> sharp<00:03:07.270> turn<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:08.350> reason<00:03:08.710> was<00:03:08.920> because<00:03:09.040> the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
a sharp turn the reason was because the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.580 
a sharp turn the reason was because the
robots<00:03:09.970> when<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.690> was<00:03:10.840> off<00:03:11.020> the<00:03:11.200> line<00:03:11.380> would

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
robots when it was off the line would

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.380 
robots when it was off the line would
simply<00:03:11.980> try<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.400> turn<00:03:12.610> back<00:03:12.820> towards<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.180> line

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
simply try to turn back towards the line

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.260 
simply try to turn back towards the line
but<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.410> didn't<00:03:14.710> turn<00:03:14.740> enough<00:03:15.190> in<00:03:16.000> this

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
but it didn't turn enough in this

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.820 
but it didn't turn enough in this
subroutine<00:03:16.690> instead<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.410> using<00:03:17.560> if

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
subroutine instead of using if

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.830 
subroutine instead of using if
statements<00:03:17.860> we're<00:03:18.700> using<00:03:18.880> wild<00:03:19.390> statements

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
statements we're using wild statements

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.280 
statements we're using wild statements
so<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.590> as<00:03:20.740> long<00:03:21.520> as<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.000> off<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.360> line<00:03:22.540> it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
so that as long as it's off the line it

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.530 
so that as long as it's off the line it
will<00:03:23.410> continue<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.100> turn<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:24.970> forces<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
will continue to turn this forces the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360 
will continue to turn this forces the
robot<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:25.990> always<00:03:26.590> come<00:03:26.800> back<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.220> right

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
robot to always come back to the right

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.880 
robot to always come back to the right
spot<00:03:27.930> we're<00:03:28.930> going<00:03:29.050> to<00:03:29.110> substitute<00:03:29.380> this

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
spot we're going to substitute this

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.770 
spot we're going to substitute this
subroutine<00:03:30.250> for<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.820> original<00:03:31.270> follow<00:03:31.480> line

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
subroutine for the original follow line

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.050 
subroutine for the original follow line
and<00:03:32.080> then<00:03:32.590> we'll<00:03:32.770> run<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.130> program<00:03:33.489> again<00:03:33.580> and

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
and then we'll run the program again and

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.300 
and then we'll run the program again and
see<00:03:34.390> if<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.720> can<00:03:35.320> handle<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.950> dark<00:03:36.130> turns

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
see if it can handle the dark turns

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.260 
see if it can handle the dark turns
alright<00:03:39.310> we're<00:03:39.459> going<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:39.640> run<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.910> program

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
alright we're going to run the program

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.680 
alright we're going to run the program
again<00:03:40.300> with<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> new<00:03:40.989> subroutine<00:03:42.420> this<00:03:43.420> case

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
again with the new subroutine this case

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.750 
again with the new subroutine this case
the<00:03:43.870> robot<00:03:44.200> begins<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.950> as<00:03:45.100> before<00:03:45.250> it's

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
the robot begins just as before it's

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.490 
the robot begins just as before it's
going<00:03:45.970> along<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.330> straight<00:03:46.540> lines<00:03:46.810> but<00:03:47.350> when

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
going along the straight lines but when

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.650 
going along the straight lines but when
it<00:03:47.590> hits<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:47.920> sharp<00:03:48.280> curve<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:49.060> file<00:03:49.420> is

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
it hits this sharp curve the file is

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.050 
it hits this sharp curve the file is
going<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:49.989> make<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.260> continue<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.890> turn<00:03:51.340> into

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
going to make it continue to turn into

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.670

absolute best algorithm but we're

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.330 
absolute best algorithm but we're
demonstrating<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.890> couple<00:04:11.220> different

that the simulator that you've seen has
all<00:04:37.110> sorts<00:04:37.440> of<00:04:37.680> sensors<00:04:38.160> that<00:04:38.280> can<00:04:38.340> be<00:04:38.550> real

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
all sorts of sensors that can be real

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.379 
all sorts of sensors that can be real

it has line following sensors as we saw

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.030 
it has line following sensors as we saw
in<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.970> demo<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.510> there's<00:04:52.320> many<00:04:52.590> many<00:04:52.800> other

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
in the demo and there's many many other

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.550 
in the demo and there's many many other
sensors<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:54.180> neat<00:04:54.419> thing<00:04:54.690> is<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:55.110> all<00:04:55.320> these

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
sensors the neat thing is that all these

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.950 
sensors the neat thing is that all these
sensors<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.250> we<00:04:56.400> have<00:04:56.570> simulated<00:04:57.570> in<00:04:57.840> the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
sensors that we have simulated in the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.170 
sensors that we have simulated in the
language<00:04:58.350> are<00:04:58.620> actually<00:04:59.490> available<00:04:59.610> from

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
language are actually available from

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.320 
language are actually available from
parallax<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.960> many<00:05:01.080> other<00:05:01.290> companies<00:05:02.330> let's

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
parallax and many other companies let's

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.650 
parallax and many other companies let's
take<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.540> look<00:05:03.840> at<00:05:03.960> one<00:05:04.169> of<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.320> robots<00:05:05.450> this<00:05:06.450> is

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
take a look at one of the robots this is

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.060 
take a look at one of the robots this is
a<00:05:06.690> small<00:05:07.020> robot<00:05:07.410> that<00:05:07.560> we've<00:05:07.680> built<00:05:07.919> to

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
a small robot that we've built to

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.430 
a small robot that we've built to
demonstrate<00:05:08.669> those<00:05:08.820> ideas<00:05:09.210> like<00:05:10.169> for<00:05:10.350> example

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
demonstrate those ideas like for example

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.440 
demonstrate those ideas like for example
here<00:05:10.890> on<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.100> front<00:05:11.370> we<00:05:11.520> have<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.820> ultrasonic

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
here on the front we have the ultrasonic

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.480 
here on the front we have the ultrasonic
sensor<00:05:12.750> from<00:05:12.930> parallax<00:05:13.350> there's<00:05:14.100> also<00:05:14.310> a

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
sensor from parallax there's also a

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.270 
sensor from parallax there's also a
compass<00:05:15.030> there's<00:05:15.720> bumpers<00:05:16.230> here<00:05:17.070> at<00:05:17.190> the

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
compass there's bumpers here at the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.790 
compass there's bumpers here at the
bottom<00:05:17.520> we<00:05:18.450> actually<00:05:18.780> have<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.050> line<00:05:19.260> sensors

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
bottom we actually have the line sensors

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.520 
bottom we actually have the line sensors
and<00:05:20.010> these<00:05:20.400> are<00:05:20.550> from<00:05:20.669> parallax<00:05:21.090> to<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:22.350> whole

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
and these are from parallax to the whole

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.409 
and these are from parallax to the whole
idea<00:05:22.890> is<00:05:22.950> that<00:05:23.100> you<00:05:23.250> can<00:05:23.520> build<00:05:23.729> any<00:05:23.970> robot

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
idea is that you can build any robot

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.409 
idea is that you can build any robot
even<00:05:25.110> if<00:05:25.229> it's<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.470> walking<00:05:25.830> robot<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.580> control

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
even if it's a walking robot and control

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.690 
even if it's a walking robot and control
it<00:05:27.600> with<00:05:27.690> robot<00:05:28.050> basic<00:05:28.470> we're<00:05:29.370> going<00:05:29.520> to<00:05:29.580> do

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
it with robot basic we're going to do

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.909 
it with robot basic we're going to do
some<00:05:29.729> examples<00:05:30.030> here<00:05:30.450> and<00:05:30.780> show<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:31.380> how<00:05:31.680> this

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
some examples here and show you how this

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.580 
some examples here and show you how this
robot<00:05:32.400> can<00:05:32.639> be<00:05:33.360> controlled<00:05:33.870> with<00:05:34.020> the<00:05:34.290> exact

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
robot can be controlled with the exact

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.840 
robot can be controlled with the exact
same<00:05:34.800> program<00:05:35.250> that<00:05:35.400> we<00:05:35.490> just<00:05:35.729> used<00:05:36.229> now<00:05:37.229> on

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
same program that we just used now on

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.650 
same program that we just used now on
this<00:05:38.850> robot<00:05:39.270> there's<00:05:39.780> also<00:05:40.520> here<00:05:41.520> in<00:05:41.669> RB<00:05:42.030> 500

robot programmers bonanza and it gives

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.120 
robot programmers bonanza and it gives
the<00:06:07.140> complete<00:06:07.289> details<00:06:07.830> of<00:06:07.979> that<00:06:08.010> program

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
the complete details of that program

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.010 
the complete details of that program
that's<00:06:11.130> in<00:06:11.340> residing<00:06:11.970> within<00:06:12.390> the<00:06:12.720> robot

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
that's in residing within the robot

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.830 
that's in residing within the robot
itself<00:06:13.580> it's<00:06:14.580> kind<00:06:14.850> of<00:06:14.910> an<00:06:15.060> interpreter<00:06:15.630> that

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
itself it's kind of an interpreter that

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.290 
itself it's kind of an interpreter that
gets<00:06:16.110> signals<00:06:16.620> from<00:06:17.039> the<00:06:17.460> robot<00:06:17.940> basic

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
gets signals from the robot basic

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.630 
gets signals from the robot basic
language<00:06:18.650> tells<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.830> what<00:06:19.979> to<00:06:20.039> do<00:06:20.250> and<00:06:20.430> then<00:06:20.520> it

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
language tells it what to do and then it

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.700 
language tells it what to do and then it
carries<00:06:21.060> out<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.300> actions<00:06:21.810> such<00:06:22.289> as<00:06:22.320> turn

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710

we're<00:06:28.050> going<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.260> do<00:06:28.350> now<00:06:28.530> is<00:06:28.740> we're<00:06:28.919> going<00:06:29.070> to

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
we're going to do now is we're going to

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.980 
we're going to do now is we're going to
take<00:06:29.310> this<00:06:29.490> robot<00:06:30.270> which<00:06:30.479> has<00:06:30.660> already<00:06:30.810> been

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
take this robot which has already been

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.110 
take this robot which has already been
programmed<00:06:31.260> to<00:06:31.590> handle<00:06:31.979> the<00:06:32.370> commands<00:06:32.729> coming

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
programmed to handle the commands coming

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.909 
programmed to handle the commands coming
from<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:33.390> language<00:06:33.720> and<00:06:34.320> we're<00:06:34.470> going<00:06:34.620> to<00:06:34.710> set

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
from the language and we're going to set

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.430 
from the language and we're going to set
it<00:06:35.010> on<00:06:35.100> to<00:06:35.310> a<00:06:35.340> line<00:06:35.700> and<00:06:36.000> let<00:06:36.060> that<00:06:36.780> line<00:06:37.229> be

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
it on to a line and let that line be

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.339 
it on to a line and let that line be
followed<00:06:37.919> using<00:06:38.610> the<00:06:38.789> exact<00:06:39.270> same<00:06:39.450> program

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
followed using the exact same program

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.830 
followed using the exact same program
that<00:06:40.860> you<00:06:41.010> just<00:06:41.220> saw<00:06:41.430> we<00:06:42.030> do<00:06:42.150> have<00:06:42.300> to<00:06:42.419> make<00:06:42.570> one

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
that you just saw we do have to make one

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.659 
that you just saw we do have to make one
modification<00:06:43.500> let's<00:06:43.980> go<00:06:44.100> back<00:06:44.280> and<00:06:44.460> look<00:06:44.550> at

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:44.669 
modification let's go back and look at

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:52.520 
modification let's go back and look at
the<00:06:44.730> program<00:06:45.090> and<00:06:45.240> see<00:06:45.389> what<00:06:45.570> that<00:06:45.690> is<00:06:51.530> all

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:52.530 
the program and see what that is all

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.560 
the program and see what that is all
right<00:06:52.770> we'd<00:06:53.130> like<00:06:53.280> to<00:06:53.340> now<00:06:53.639> use<00:06:53.699> the<00:06:54.210> same

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
right we'd like to now use the same

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.890 
right we'd like to now use the same
program<00:06:55.110> to<00:06:55.440> control<00:06:55.830> a<00:06:55.860> real<00:06:56.340> robot<00:06:56.900> we're

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900
