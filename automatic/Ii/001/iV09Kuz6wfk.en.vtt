00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
of just a few years that I began to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.330 
of just a few years that I began to
specialize<00:02:27.329> in<00:02:27.359> color<00:02:27.870> and<00:02:28.769> was<00:02:29.010> teaching

specialize in color and was teaching
color<00:02:29.579> workshops<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:31.470> 1983<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.870> decided<00:02:33.870> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
color workshops and in 1983 I decided I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.280 
color workshops and in 1983 I decided I
wanted<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.590> computer<00:02:35.159> and<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:36.209> didn't<00:02:37.049> really

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
wanted a computer and I didn't really

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.190 
wanted a computer and I didn't really
have<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> reason<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:38.069> buy<00:02:38.189> a<00:02:38.220> computer<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:40.019> when

have a reason to buy a computer and when

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.349 
have a reason to buy a computer and when
I<00:02:40.230> bought<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.950> felt<00:02:41.220> very<00:02:41.489> guilty<00:02:41.790> because<00:02:42.180> I

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
I bought it I felt very guilty because I

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.110 
I bought it I felt very guilty because I
didn't<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> project<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.859> I<00:02:43.889> outlined<00:02:44.489> one

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
didn't have a project so I outlined one

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.780 
didn't have a project so I outlined one
of<00:02:45.239> my<00:02:45.359> color<00:02:45.689> classes<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.620> as<00:02:47.250> soon<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.639> I

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
of my color classes and as soon as I

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.569 
of my color classes and as soon as I
printed<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.299> out<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.870> knew<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.709> was<00:02:49.889> a<00:02:49.920> book<00:02:50.250> and

myself photography but also to teach

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.040 
myself photography but also to teach
myself<00:05:03.810> better<00:05:03.990> composition<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:04.919> in<00:05:05.190> art<00:05:05.520> and

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
this has been very satisfying and so

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.060 
this has been very satisfying and so
right<00:05:09.090> now<00:05:09.449> I<00:05:09.780> there<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.260> kind<00:05:10.470> of<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:10.650> focus

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
right now I there is kind of a focus

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.980 
right now I there is kind of a focus
kind<00:05:11.729> of<00:05:11.789> a<00:05:11.880> shift<00:05:12.180> going<00:05:12.389> over<00:05:12.810> into

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
kind of a shift going over into

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.890 
kind of a shift going over into
photography<00:05:13.699> but<00:05:14.699> I<00:05:14.729> do<00:05:14.940> find<00:05:15.419> that<00:05:15.690> when<00:05:15.870> I
