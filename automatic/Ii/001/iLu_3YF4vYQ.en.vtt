00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hi guys with great pleasure today vi 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.799
 I present the first application of lit 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.250
 smiling mines or a born project 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.320
 from the focus magazine from the agency there are 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.039
 familiar with digital academy and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 professor daniela lucangeli expert 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.869
 absolute development and learning e 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 development of cognitive abilities in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.340
 so babies are born today with this one 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 application an application path 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.410
 times just to develop through the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 cognitive power that has the game le 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.640
 intellectual functions of our children 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 in particular it counts place 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.020
 obviously goes to develop the dress 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.540
 of the mathematical intelligence that it is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.910
 completely born in us here is the first 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.399
 of language development and that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.370
 this application as a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.410
 catalyst helps to develop mine 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 but beware of the beautiful aspects 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.190
 educational of the world 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.699
 the iter smiling mines and what it is 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.090
 applications are not only limited 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.979
 to the relationship scheme a child but also to 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.290
 they also involve what is 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.409
 the key operator the companion 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 absolute of adventure and growth 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.920
 in the life of the child who is the parent 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.850
 we will see how we see the child side 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 application 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 so let's start in this case I can 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.390
 create multiple profiles let's see my profile 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.780
 david and I go inside 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.780
 application 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.220
 the voice invites me to play with the frog 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 very delicate delicious too 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.340
 the illustration they really pay for 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.420
 those of a beautiful book we go to 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:44.250
 touch the objects that move must 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.930
 understand which is the right crown for the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.080
 frog based on size as you see 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.490
 I guessed the crown is right and 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.800
 so I find myself a hand who knows how many 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.370
 fingers 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:05.130
 we touch our fingers 12 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:06.210
 I was wrong three four and five in the 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.260
 meanwhile I see the progress 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.260
 of this level 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.820
 the mosque change group this one 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.000
 is 5 and so we go back so we proceed 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.500
 back and we find that there are different 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.290
 levels within the application 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 that I can go to unlock this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.860
 because the city own application 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.660
 develops according to different levels of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.850
 game where the big guys make me ad 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.130
 to address different aspects of 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.780
 development of numerical intelligence ad 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.600
 example the quantity the difference between 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.930
 large and small the major and minor 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.550
 learning to name numbers e 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.260
 away saying 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.000
 the reserved area is very interesting 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.640
 in the hollow parents who makes us understand 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.100
 precisely what the fundamental role is 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.560
 of the parent in education in the 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.810
 cognitive development to access the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.480
 parents need to press for at least three 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.730
 seconds we have a method section in 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.410
 Dr. Lucangeli explains to us 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.150
 precisely what is the philosophy of lit 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.350
 smiling corn and how this was born 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.760
 project and therefore how 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.000
 have been designed for this application 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.500
 we have a report that tells us which ones 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.990
 were the activities carried out by the 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.790
 baby but above all tells us level for 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.800
 application level I hope that 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.030
 you can read it what are the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.920
 insights objectives and also the 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.930
 advice so that we parents ourselves 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.600
 we can be the protagonists together 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.520
 to the child of this game adventure but 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.160
 also educational, helping the child 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.600
 same to solve problems but also to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.460
 further develop knowledge e 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.870
 emphasize when dressing that his 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.970
 smaller mesh europe queue or 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.620
 bigger than a little brother's 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.200
 smaller both for own advice 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.710
 in practical easy to use from 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.490
 apply which represent a bridge between 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.590
 not only 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.180
 the application is the child but 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.650
 the application of the child and also the 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.500
 life in the family, therefore, degree 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.370
 application fully in education 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.500
 in the educational and home journey is a 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.970
 link is a section dedicated to the 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.100
 settings where we can do 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.350
 send indicating our mail as 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.540
 then see the dedicated field each 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.420
 time the child exceeds a level of 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.940
 game 37 provided in this app the 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.950
 system automatically sends an email 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.630
 so in the report session we can then 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.300
 go and read what he learned but 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.280
 especially besides tweets and checking 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.710
 his performances mostly go to 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.570
 see how to improve with him the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.470
 his learning we can choose if 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.480
 receive only game notifications or 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.830
 go also to receive news of the 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.240
 design how you can know when 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.310
 the next ones will be published 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.160
 applications we have the possibility that 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.810
 wanting to cancel any accounts 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.080
 on other apps there is the possibility of 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.560
 go to the website delete smiling mgr 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.139
 see what the news is and the news 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.919
 away saying back inside 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.840
 the application rather piangiamoci own 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.819
 back on the home page we choose the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.330
 flip in this case we touch the 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.330
 things that move 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.130
 and hungry in this case we will see this 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.580
 small group and so on 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.680
 the application has a cost of 3 euros e 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.600
 99 in this that usually comes 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.770
 considered quite high on the app store 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.020
 for applications 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.360
 I certainly think it is right 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.710
 definitely convenient because we are 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.630
 truly downloading an application that 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.850
 it has not only fun but has the 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.540
 have fun playing you learn that is 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.980
 exploits the cognitive power of the game 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.170
 to be able to go to develop the 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.610
 intellectual functions of the child and in the 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:01.180
 doing so does not isolate the child on the screen 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.400
 but he goes to get him to take 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.750
 an adventure in which it can be 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.540
 protagonist together with mum dad who 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:09.220
 they can help him along this path 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.520
 along these seven levels of development 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.190
 educational application experience 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.810
 totally original that definitely there 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.730
 advice for commentary information 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.080
 anything else could be shown below 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.480
 video comments for next 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.370
 reviews also of applications for 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.900
 children and kids you can write me here 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.620
 above on a children's play channel 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.390
 and boys 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.390
 see you soon bye bye david
