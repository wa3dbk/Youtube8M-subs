00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello tankers at the microphone zogan and this 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.820
 12 release transfer insane experience and 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.200
 however before the main part of the release 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.889
 commercial break 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.400
 you have a crazy idea for the experiment and at 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.800
 we have gold as much as 1000 gold will receive 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.900
 author of the idea that we take the issue of a 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.119
 for participation and help filming you can 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.550
 get 200 gold for all the details 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.420
 are in the group vk link in the description 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.909
 under the video, well, that we are starting to create science 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.909
 and mock the world of tanks 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 for an aperitif we have prepared refined 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.730
 183 mm dish we decided 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.600
 check 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.190
 But can a huge projectile like me from 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.190
 183 millimeter cannon fly through 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.800
 what a gap between huge tanks 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.600
 is he a point or is it now 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.610
 he is a full physical subject we 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
 put the two Mauses almost point blank 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 each other and placed behind them as cm 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.350
 test filter 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.190
 we did the first few shots 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.140
 bounce 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.140
 but no one was going to give up 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.420
 having tried a couple of times we such 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.030
 shoved a huge manga pig 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.030
 narrow gap between the German giants 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.860
 thus, we have proved that unfortunately 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:18.560
 shells in our game are still server 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.970
 points are they physical objects say that 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.860
 break not build 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.780
 but nevertheless how good that we are with you 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.790
 playing in the virtual world and to 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.560
 repair any destroyed building or 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.100
 a broken tree stands simply 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.960
 restart the card taking into account 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.780
 we decided to try this fact 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.630
 shoot our traditional suffered 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.360
 e100 tower so that it fell on a tree 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.430
 but at the same time to check whether the flown away 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.530
 after the explosion of the tank tower break it 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.350
 tree or not as executioner of course 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.990
 of 183 was chosen well, and on the background we 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.040
 launched a robin to e100 was still 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.040
 harder and more offensive 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.320
 a couple of dough enough for the barrel 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.630
 a torn off tower hooked a tree trunk and 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.019
 she fell but we need dry facts 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.720
 the trunk is not the one needed short and 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 accurate flight of the tank head itself right in 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.019
 purpose and 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.739
 reflecting on the masses of tanks and towers 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.110
 we decided to replace the e100 with 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:26.390
 Bulldog for his tower is much easier 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.489
 German still a couple of tests and finally 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.850
 we got to knock over burning 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.920
 the turret right on the green tree which 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.519
 under the weight of the steel pot immediately 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.519
 tumbled down 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.490
 dangerous this thing tower always hold on 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:50.060
 away from tanks that are weak on my 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:52.550
 treasure to spit against the wind is to do 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.580
 to my own detriment and what if I really want 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.100
 something to check and seemingly someone already 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.200
 stepped on this rake however not up 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.120
 the end 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.280
 the essence of the experience as always simple to us 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.110
 I wanted to check whether the projectile would return 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.230
 back to the point of departure if 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.330
 shoot straight at yourself so that it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.920
 find out we took a few american 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.920
 art and started trying 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.199
 after suicide bombardment in 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.150
 within half an hour our art has turned out 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.820
 spit in the face of gravity 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.080
 us turn bounced shell 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.080
 back here is the ruler 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.770
 so stay alert and respected 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.169
 Artavoda wrong pressing left 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:17.419
 mouse buttons can cause serious 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:20.030
 the consequences she is this 12th edition of insane 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.340
 experiences comes to an end if you like 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.470
 our transfer is bolder click like under 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.130
 video and tell about him fighting 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.740
 comrades 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.990
 and subscribe to the best channel 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.270
 on the game world of tanks wot fan not to 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.820
 skip the following issues for you 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.759
 michael's brave tank crews and I tried 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.270
 gypsy good luck to you in your madness and to 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.270
 see you soon
