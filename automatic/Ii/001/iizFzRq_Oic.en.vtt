actually<00:01:34.020> two<00:01:34.259> ways<00:01:34.470> around<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:39.240> truth<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
actually two ways around the truth is

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.090 
actually two ways around the truth is
going<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:40.890> that's

the main route there but through that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.850 
the main route there but through that
gate<00:01:47.540> there's<00:01:48.540> another<00:01:48.780> path<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.440> can<00:01:49.500> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
gate there's another path you can just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.969 
gate there's another path you can just
see<00:01:51.350> going<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:54.289> it<00:01:55.289> comes<00:01:55.530> back<00:01:55.649> around
