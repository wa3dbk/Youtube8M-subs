most intensive time of year for us to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
most intensive time of year for us to
last<00:01:04.589> about<00:01:04.769> two<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> half<00:01:05.189> hours<00:01:05.580> from

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
start to finish this year's a little bit

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.620 
start to finish this year's a little bit
more<00:01:08.220> intense<00:01:08.549> we're<00:01:09.210> doing<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.450> lot<00:01:09.570> more

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
more intense we're doing a lot more

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
more intense we're doing a lot more
we're<00:01:10.110> running<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> lot<00:01:10.560> more<00:01:10.740> doing<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> lot

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
we're running a lot more doing a lot

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
we're running a lot more doing a lot
more<00:01:11.310> agility<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.970> stuff<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.020> think<00:01:13.560> we're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
more agility and stuff so I think we're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.960 
more agility and stuff so I think we're
gonna<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.979> lot<00:01:14.220> better<00:01:14.369> shape<00:01:14.610> than<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.880> were

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
gonna be a lot better shape than we were

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.679 
gonna be a lot better shape than we were
last<00:01:15.030> year<00:01:15.390> yeah<00:01:16.220> faster<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:18.060> explosive

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
last year yeah faster more explosive

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
last year yeah faster more explosive
because<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> supposed<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.270> work

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
because we do a supposed to work

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.249 
because we do a supposed to work
Tuesdays<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.350> Thursdays<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:24.080> not<00:01:25.080> seeing

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
Tuesdays and Thursdays so not seeing

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.420 
Tuesdays and Thursdays so not seeing
more<00:01:25.520> disposal<00:01:26.520> more<00:01:26.909> faster<00:01:27.750> than<00:01:27.900> almost

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
more disposal more faster than almost

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.740 
more disposal more faster than almost
I've<00:01:29.430> been<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.729> for<00:01:29.939> almost<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.570> whole<00:01:30.689> year
