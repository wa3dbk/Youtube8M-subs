first so once we're going to show you
how<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.510> use<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:49.900> first<00:01:50.050> and<00:01:50.260> i'ma<00:01:50.409> show<00:01:50.470> you

how to use it first and i'ma show you
how<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.740> build<00:01:50.950> it<00:01:51.159> second<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:52.030> basically<00:01:52.420> it

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
how to build it second so basically it

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.690 
how to build it second so basically it
works<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:52.960> once<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.320> activate<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:54.159> redstone

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
works is once you activate this redstone

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.140 
works is once you activate this redstone
that's<00:01:55.570> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.840> trigger<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.920> piston<00:01:57.550> to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
that's going to trigger this piston to

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.120 
that's going to trigger this piston to
move<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.630> slime<00:01:58.900> block<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.470> that<00:01:59.650> is<00:01:59.950> just

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
move this slime block and that is just

moving on f3 if you look at my f3 you
can<00:02:49.629> see<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> coordinates<00:02:50.260> moving<00:02:50.769> one<00:02:51.219> block

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
can see the coordinates moving one block

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.569 
can see the coordinates moving one block
at<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.579> time<00:02:51.609> 40<00:02:52.030> 41<00:02:52.269> 42<00:02:52.719> 43<00:02:52.840> 44<00:02:53.319> 45<00:02:53.769> it's

if you want to so if you want to check
out<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.510> local<00:02:58.870> village<00:02:59.109> well<00:02:59.290> it's<00:02:59.379> kind<00:02:59.530> of

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
out that local village well it's kind of

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.140 
out that local village well it's kind of
far<00:02:59.709> back<00:02:59.890> now<00:03:00.099> you'll<00:03:00.489> just<00:03:00.670> place<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.909> glass

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
far back now you'll just place a glass

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.690 
far back now you'll just place a glass
block<00:03:01.569> now<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.989> reason<00:03:02.319> this<00:03:02.439> works<00:03:02.769> excuse

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
block now the reason this works excuse

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.479 
block now the reason this works excuse
me<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:04.000> because<00:03:04.629> pistons<00:03:05.500> can<00:03:05.650> only<00:03:05.859> push<00:03:06.220> up

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
me is because pistons can only push up

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.229 
me is because pistons can only push up
to<00:03:07.060> swell<00:03:07.569> or<00:03:07.950> slam<00:03:08.950> blocks<00:03:09.250> can<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.819> think<00:03:09.879> push

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
to swell or slam blocks can I think push

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.179 
to swell or slam blocks can I think push
only<00:03:10.389> up<00:03:10.569> to<00:03:10.689> 12<00:03:10.900> blocks<00:03:11.049> at<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> time<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.739> that

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
only up to 12 blocks at a time and that

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.280 
only up to 12 blocks at a time and that
is<00:03:12.430> my<00:03:12.579> facebook<00:03:12.790> going<00:03:13.209> off<00:03:13.359> and<00:03:13.540> twelve

is my facebook going off and twelve
blocks<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.980> perfect<00:03:15.489> amount<00:03:15.939> of<00:03:16.180> blocks

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
blocks is the perfect amount of blocks

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.300 
blocks is the perfect amount of blocks
that<00:03:17.230> this<00:03:17.379> takes<00:03:17.560> place<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.010> moment<00:03:18.189> you

this piston to get itself ready for

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.640 
this piston to get itself ready for
action<00:03:41.799> now<00:03:42.430> it's<00:03:42.849> simply<00:03:43.329> a<00:03:43.450> matter<00:03:43.599> of<00:03:43.959> once

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
you've done that go ahead and fly back

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.780 
you've done that go ahead and fly back
where<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.629> were<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.049> then<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.280> same

business as before you're going to try
and<00:03:50.169> hit<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.709> piston<00:03:51.609> there<00:03:51.849> and<00:03:52.120> then<00:03:52.569> you

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
and hit that piston there and then you

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.140 
and hit that piston there and then you
need<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:52.959> make<00:03:53.139> sure<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:54.099> are<00:03:54.340> not<00:03:54.639> going<00:03:55.000> to

get<00:03:55.540> fallen<00:03:56.169> behind<00:03:56.290> on<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.010> submarine

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
get fallen behind on the submarine

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.909 
get fallen behind on the submarine
because<00:03:57.879> if<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.150> miss<00:03:58.359> it<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:59.109> will<00:03:59.440> not<00:03:59.709> be

00:03:59.909 --> 00:03:59.919 
because if you miss it you will not be

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.530 
because if you miss it you will not be
able<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.159> catch<00:04:00.340> up<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.729> so<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.120> guess<00:04:01.329> I<00:04:01.479> will

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
able to catch up to it so I guess I will

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.330 
able to catch up to it so I guess I will
go<00:04:01.750> ahead<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:01.989> show<00:04:02.199> you<00:04:02.260> how<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:02.829> looks<00:04:02.859> out

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
oh god it's gonna strip travel well this

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.050 
oh god it's gonna strip travel well this
is<00:04:08.139> how<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.319> thing<00:04:08.560> looks<00:04:08.699> when<00:04:09.699> you're<00:04:09.819> not

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:11.919 
in it and as you can see it is moving

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.129 
in it and as you can see it is moving
way<00:04:12.639> faster<00:04:12.669> than<00:04:13.389> you're<00:04:13.659> gonna<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.930> able<00:04:13.989> to

way faster than you're gonna be able to

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.039 
way faster than you're gonna be able to
catch<00:04:14.319> up<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.590> it<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:14.949> it<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.639> make<00:04:15.940> sure<00:04:16.049> you

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
that aside let's go ahead and build it

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.110 
that aside let's go ahead and build it
now<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.130> isn't<00:04:51.370> a<00:04:51.550> 9<00:04:51.820> by<00:04:52.450> 3<00:04:52.840> by<00:04:53.620> 3<00:04:54.219> dimensions<00:04:55.029> so

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
now it isn't a 9 by 3 by 3 dimensions so

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.830 
now it isn't a 9 by 3 by 3 dimensions so
it's<00:04:55.240> actually<00:04:55.479> pretty<00:04:55.599> cool

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
it's actually pretty cool

never<00:05:00.639> thought<00:05:00.970> I<00:05:01.000> would<00:05:01.300> see<00:05:01.480> this<00:05:01.660> happen<00:05:01.990> so

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
never thought I would see this happen so

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.020 
never thought I would see this happen so
let's<00:05:02.860> go<00:05:02.949> and<00:05:03.100> build<00:05:03.190> it<00:05:03.310> I'm<00:05:03.400> in<00:05:03.490> game<00:05:03.639> mode<00:05:03.699> 1

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
let's go and build it I'm in game mode 1

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.969 
let's go and build it I'm in game mode 1
for<00:05:04.270> this<00:05:04.360> we<00:05:04.840> will<00:05:04.930> place<00:05:05.139> that<00:05:05.380> down<00:05:05.560> just<00:05:05.620> so

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
for this we will place that down just so

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:07.260 
for this we will place that down just so
that<00:05:06.130> we<00:05:06.190> in<00:05:06.250> place<00:05:06.430> the<00:05:06.550> slime<00:05:06.760> block<00:05:06.970> in<00:05:07.150> the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
that we in place the slime block in the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.870 
that we in place the slime block in the
air<00:05:07.419> go<00:05:08.050> ahead<00:05:08.199> and<00:05:08.290> follow<00:05:08.590> up<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.130> around<00:05:09.639> as

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
air go ahead and follow up and around as

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.140 
air go ahead and follow up and around as
follows<00:05:10.510> go<00:05:10.630> boom<00:05:10.930> boom<00:05:11.350> boom<00:05:12.040> boom<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:13.030> then

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
follows go boom boom boom boom and then

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.900 
follows go boom boom boom boom and then
boom<00:05:13.410> put<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.530> regular<00:05:15.190> piston<00:05:15.400> right<00:05:15.699> there

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
boom put a regular piston right there

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.340 
boom put a regular piston right there
probably<00:05:16.360> should<00:05:16.540> not<00:05:16.780> have<00:05:16.960> done<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.260> that

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
probably should not have done it in that

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.480 
probably should not have done it in that
order<00:05:17.530> shucks

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
order shucks

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.370 
order shucks
okay<00:05:18.760> so<00:05:19.120> place<00:05:19.300> it<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.510> that<00:05:19.720> you're<00:05:20.139> going

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
okay so place it like that you're going

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.680 
okay so place it like that you're going
to<00:05:20.470> want<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.860> redstone<00:05:21.310> block<00:05:21.460> right<00:05:22.000> there

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
to want a redstone block right there

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.080 
to want a redstone block right there
you<00:05:23.350> want<00:05:23.590> another<00:05:23.949> piston<00:05:24.610> right<00:05:24.850> there

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
you want another piston right there

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.030 
you want another piston right there
that's<00:05:25.419> going<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.720> get<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.110> ready<00:05:26.440> if<00:05:26.710> you<00:05:26.860> will

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
that's going to get it ready if you will

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.159 
that's going to get it ready if you will
and<00:05:27.610> this<00:05:27.850> can<00:05:28.060> be<00:05:28.150> kind<00:05:28.300> of<00:05:28.419> a<00:05:28.510> complex<00:05:28.930> build

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
and this can be kind of a complex build

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.330 
and this can be kind of a complex build
so<00:05:29.320> make<00:05:29.500> sure<00:05:29.530> you<00:05:29.770> follow<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.310> instructions

as<00:05:31.120> I<00:05:31.930> give<00:05:32.169> them<00:05:32.380> because<00:05:32.560> it<00:05:32.800> can<00:05:32.830> kind<00:05:33.370> of

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
as I give them because it can kind of

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.940 
as I give them because it can kind of
get<00:05:33.550> messy<00:05:33.850> if<00:05:33.940> you<00:05:34.030> don't<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.930> another<00:05:35.560> piston

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
get messy if you don't so another piston

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.830 
get messy if you don't so another piston
goes<00:05:36.160> right<00:05:36.430> there<00:05:36.700> this<00:05:37.419> is<00:05:37.479> where<00:05:37.720> your

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
goes right there this is where your

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.590 
goes right there this is where your
decorations<00:05:38.350> can<00:05:38.470> come<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.800> place<00:05:39.479> you'll<00:05:40.479> go

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
decorations can come in place you'll go

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.670 
decorations can come in place you'll go
right<00:05:40.630> there<00:05:40.900> eventually<00:05:41.110> you'll<00:05:41.530> want

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
right there eventually you'll want

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.930 
right there eventually you'll want
another<00:05:41.889> slime<00:05:42.220> block<00:05:42.430> here<00:05:42.729> in<00:05:42.850> the

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
meanwhile place a pressure plate down

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.110 
meanwhile place a pressure plate down
but<00:05:45.760> do<00:05:45.970> not<00:05:46.270> step<00:05:47.229> on<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.620> first<00:05:47.889> or<00:05:48.550> this<00:05:48.850> baby

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
but do not step on it first or this baby

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.210 
but do not step on it first or this baby
will<00:05:49.389> start<00:05:49.600> taking<00:05:50.110> off<00:05:50.260> like<00:05:50.590> it<00:05:50.770> did<00:05:50.800> last

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
will start taking off like it did last

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.250 
will start taking off like it did last
recording<00:05:51.700> I<00:05:51.789> attempted<00:05:52.150> to<00:05:52.210> do<00:05:52.389> this<00:05:52.570> on<00:05:52.750> so

sorry<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.830> lose<00:06:33.400> my<00:06:33.550> mind<00:06:33.700> anyways<00:06:34.630> anyways

sorry I lose my mind anyways anyways
anyways<00:06:35.139> so<00:06:35.710> you'll<00:06:35.860> put<00:06:36.039> your<00:06:36.160> two<00:06:36.280> fence

anyways so you'll put your two fence

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.310 
anyways so you'll put your two fence
gates<00:06:36.760> right<00:06:36.940> here<00:06:37.180> place<00:06:37.840> them<00:06:37.990> down<00:06:38.139> make

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
gates right here place them down make

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.980 
gates right here place them down make
sure<00:06:38.349> that<00:06:38.620> they<00:06:38.740> are<00:06:38.830> actually<00:06:39.370> open

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
sure that they are actually open

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.330 
sure that they are actually open
otherwise<00:06:40.990> you<00:06:41.680> will<00:06:41.830> not<00:06:41.950> get<00:06:42.190> the

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340 
otherwise you will not get the

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.159 
otherwise you will not get the
air-breathing<00:06:42.550> pocket<00:06:43.419> like<00:06:43.570> we<00:06:43.690> had<00:06:43.810> before

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
air-breathing pocket like we had before

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.140 
air-breathing pocket like we had before
now<00:06:44.650> for<00:06:44.979> the<00:06:45.039> most<00:06:45.190> part<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.639> submarine<00:06:46.030> is

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
now for the most part the submarine is

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.700 
now for the most part the submarine is
done<00:06:46.330> but<00:06:46.450> there's<00:06:46.630> one<00:06:46.900> final<00:06:47.229> touch<00:06:47.530> and

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
done but there's one final touch and

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.350 
done but there's one final touch and
this<00:06:47.830> or<00:06:47.979> the<00:06:48.039> stick<00:06:48.250> that<00:06:48.430> leave<00:06:48.760> me<00:06:48.910> bouncing

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
this or the stick that leave me bouncing

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.029 
this or the stick that leave me bouncing
this<00:06:49.900> is<00:06:50.080> where<00:06:50.169> the<00:06:50.229> sticky<00:06:50.440> piston<00:06:50.830> comes

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 
this is where the sticky piston comes

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.300 
this is where the sticky piston comes
into<00:06:51.310> play<00:06:51.520> so<00:06:52.440> make<00:06:53.440> sure<00:06:53.470> you've<00:06:53.830> added<00:06:54.099> the

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
into play so make sure you've added the

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.839 
into play so make sure you've added the
pressure<00:06:54.610> plate<00:06:54.970> first<00:06:55.479> and<00:06:56.250> then<00:06:57.250> add<00:06:57.610> the

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 
pressure plate first and then add the

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:00.839 
pressure plate first and then add the
sticky<00:06:58.180> piston<00:06:58.539> right<00:06:58.690> here<00:06:58.930> now<00:06:59.680> now<00:07:00.400> it's

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:00.849 
sticky piston right here now now it's

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:03.990 
sticky piston right here now now it's
complete<00:07:01.270> and<00:07:01.479> before<00:07:02.440> I<00:07:02.470> show<00:07:02.800> you<00:07:03.000> it
