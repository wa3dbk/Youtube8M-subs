the<00:00:08.230> basic<00:00:08.650> fundamental<00:00:09.190> difference<00:00:09.580> between

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
the basic fundamental difference between

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.759 
the basic fundamental difference between
album<00:00:10.389> builder<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:10.809> every<00:00:11.170> other<00:00:11.200> photo

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
album builder and every other photo

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.610 
album builder and every other photo
design<00:00:12.690> program<00:00:13.690> out<00:00:13.870> there<00:00:13.900> on<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.230> planet

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
design program out there on the planet

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.040 
design program out there on the planet
is<00:00:14.740> that<00:00:14.920> album<00:00:15.370> builder<00:00:15.820> works<00:00:16.420> with<00:00:16.779> our

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
is that album builder works with our

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.620 
is that album builder works with our
trademark<00:00:17.920> drop<00:00:18.430> zones<00:00:18.730> and<00:00:18.880> what<00:00:19.029> happens<00:00:19.480> is

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
trademark drop zones and what happens is

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.200 
trademark drop zones and what happens is
drop<00:00:19.930> zones<00:00:20.290> can<00:00:20.710> include<00:00:21.130> any<00:00:21.550> number<00:00:22.180> of

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
drop zones can include any number of

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.259 
drop zones can include any number of
images<00:00:22.540> so<00:00:22.840> this<00:00:23.140> design<00:00:23.619> has<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.670> drop<00:00:24.939> zones

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
images so this design has to drop zones

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.220 
images so this design has to drop zones
now<00:00:25.480> we<00:00:25.539> can<00:00:25.930> remove<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.250> we<00:00:28.029> can<00:00:28.240> add<00:00:28.510> images

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
now we can remove and we can add images

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.609 
now we can remove and we can add images
to<00:00:29.289> that<00:00:30.010> drop<00:00:30.340> zone<00:00:30.699> without<00:00:31.689> fundamentally

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
to that drop zone without fundamentally

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.619 
to that drop zone without fundamentally
changing<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.370> layout<00:00:33.580> and<00:00:33.940> what<00:00:34.120> that<00:00:34.269> does

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
changing the layout and what that does

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.070 
changing the layout and what that does
is<00:00:34.660> it<00:00:34.900> gives<00:00:35.290> us<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.769> flexibility<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:37.269> have

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
is it gives us the flexibility to have

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.830 
is it gives us the flexibility to have
one<00:00:38.530> design<00:00:39.309> with<00:00:39.579> infinite<00:00:40.149> possibilities

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
one design with infinite possibilities

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.569 
one design with infinite possibilities
and<00:00:41.020> then<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.230> also<00:00:41.440> gives<00:00:41.829> you<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.040> lot<00:00:42.430> of

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
and then it also gives you a lot of

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.779 
and then it also gives you a lot of
control<00:00:43.000> over<00:00:43.270> how<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.860> works<00:00:45.309> you<00:00:45.460> can<00:00:45.610> move

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
control over how that works you can move

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.970 
control over how that works you can move
images<00:00:46.329> between<00:00:47.430> designs<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.719> can<00:00:50.050> swap

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
images between designs you can swap

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.450 
images between designs you can swap
images<00:00:51.879> within<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.449> design<00:00:52.870> very<00:00:53.620> easily<00:00:53.980> and

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
images within a design very easily and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.860 
images within a design very easily and
you<00:00:55.180> can<00:00:55.570> alter<00:00:56.170> how<00:00:56.500> that<00:00:56.770> design<00:00:57.250> looks<00:00:57.870> just

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
you can alter how that design looks just

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.430 
you can alter how that design looks just
by<00:00:59.079> tweaking<00:00:59.410> the<00:01:00.219> drop<00:01:00.550> zones<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.170> drop

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
by tweaking the drop zones so the drop

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.730 
by tweaking the drop zones so the drop
zone<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:02.890> really<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:04.059> powerful<00:01:04.869> mechanism

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
zone is really the powerful mechanism

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.240 
zone is really the powerful mechanism
that<00:01:06.220> drives<00:01:06.390> album<00:01:07.390> builder<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:08.350> once<00:01:09.100> you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
that drives album builder so once you

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.460 
that drives album builder so once you
get<00:01:09.369> used<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.880> how<00:01:10.149> drop<00:01:10.509> zones<00:01:10.810> work<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.289> can

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
get used to how drop zones work you can

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.710 
get used to how drop zones work you can
create<00:01:11.770> automated<00:01:12.399> designs<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.240> tweak<00:01:13.479> them

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
create automated designs and tweak them

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.230 
create automated designs and tweak them
like<00:01:13.929> I<00:01:14.050> did<00:01:14.200> here<00:01:14.229> or<00:01:14.890> you<00:01:15.490> can<00:01:15.640> create<00:01:16.030> custom

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
like I did here or you can create custom

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.620 
like I did here or you can create custom
designs<00:01:17.140> in<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:18.069> matter<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.429> seconds<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.209> do<00:01:19.599> a

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
designs in a matter of seconds to do a

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.870 
designs in a matter of seconds to do a
custom<00:01:19.929> design<00:01:20.380> all<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:21.069> need<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.250> do<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:21.490> drag

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
custom design all you need to do is drag

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.169 
custom design all you need to do is drag
an<00:01:22.090> image<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:23.160> you<00:01:24.160> have<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> drop<00:01:24.700> zone<00:01:24.729> and

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
an image and you have a drop zone and

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.400 
an image and you have a drop zone and
that<00:01:25.360> drop<00:01:25.690> zone<00:01:25.959> can<00:01:26.170> be<00:01:26.200> moved<00:01:27.190> resized

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
that drop zone can be moved resized

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.609 
that drop zone can be moved resized
change<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.849> affects<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.479> image<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.110> then

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
change how it affects the image and then

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.669 
change how it affects the image and then
you<00:01:32.800> can<00:01:33.009> drag<00:01:33.340> groups<00:01:33.970> of<00:01:34.209> images<00:01:34.690> over<00:01:35.319> you

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
you can drag groups of images over you

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.190 
you can drag groups of images over you
can<00:01:35.860> remove<00:01:36.280> images<00:01:37.000> from<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.569> drop<00:01:37.869> zone

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
can remove images from that drop zone

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.900 
can remove images from that drop zone
add<00:01:38.849> images<00:01:39.849> and<00:01:40.289> tweak<00:01:41.289> how<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.310> drop<00:01:42.610> zone

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
add images and tweak how the drop zone

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.320 
add images and tweak how the drop zone
treats<00:01:43.479> a<00:01:43.690> design<00:01:44.729> additionally<00:01:45.729> when<00:01:46.300> a

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
treats a design additionally when a

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.449 
treats a design additionally when a
bride<00:01:46.690> comes<00:01:46.720> and<00:01:47.170> make<00:01:47.289> changes<00:01:47.860> we<00:01:48.310> have<00:01:48.340> a

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
bride comes and make changes we have a

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.969 
bride comes and make changes we have a
fundamental<00:01:48.789> design<00:01:49.239> we<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.319> add<00:01:50.560> to<00:01:50.950> that

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
fundamental design we can add to that

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.940 
fundamental design we can add to that
design<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:52.750> can<00:01:52.929> remove<00:01:53.319> an<00:01:53.500> image<00:01:53.709> from<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
design we can remove an image from the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.109 
design we can remove an image from the
design<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:55.890> we<00:01:56.890> can<00:01:57.039> even<00:01:57.250> scroll<00:01:57.789> through

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
design and we can even scroll through

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.570 
design and we can even scroll through
and<00:01:58.360> we<00:01:58.539> can<00:01:58.750> swap<00:01:59.319> an<00:01:59.590> image<00:02:00.039> from<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.640> design

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
and we can swap an image from the design

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.029 
and we can swap an image from the design
so<00:02:03.580> drop<00:02:04.300> zones<00:02:04.660> give<00:02:04.959> you<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.170> lot<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.770> power

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
so drop zones give you a lot of power

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.999 
so drop zones give you a lot of power
allows<00:02:06.819> you<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.349> freeform<00:02:08.349> your<00:02:08.560> design<00:02:08.860> you

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
allows you to freeform your design you

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.660 
allows you to freeform your design you
can<00:02:09.069> swap<00:02:09.489> verticals<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.090> horizontals<00:02:10.179> and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
can swap verticals and horizontals and

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.490 
can swap verticals and horizontals and
stay<00:02:12.670> with<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> same<00:02:13.180> design<00:02:13.569> concept<00:02:14.200> so

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
stay with the same design concept so

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.680 
stay with the same design concept so
what<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> encourage<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.000> do<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.180> play

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
what I encourage you to do is play

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.050 
what I encourage you to do is play
around<00:02:16.960> with<00:02:17.140> drop<00:02:17.380> zones<00:02:17.680> drag<00:02:18.640> groups<00:02:18.910> of

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
around with drop zones drag groups of

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.280 
around with drop zones drag groups of
images

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
images

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.809 
images
play<00:02:20.500> around<00:02:20.769> with<00:02:21.010> how<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.159> auto<00:02:21.430> layouts

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
play around with how the auto layouts

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.599 
play around with how the auto layouts
work<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.269> how<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.390> can<00:02:22.599> tweak<00:02:22.900> them<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.609> then

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:24.609 
work and how you can tweak them and then

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.250 
work and how you can tweak them and then
you'll<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.030> fundamental<00:02:25.480> concept<00:02:26.079> and

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
you'll get the fundamental concept and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.780 
you'll get the fundamental concept and
that<00:02:26.379> will<00:02:26.560> help<00:02:26.739> you<00:02:26.859> design<00:02:27.129> better<00:02:27.489> it'll

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that will help you design better it'll

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.369 
that will help you design better it'll
help<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.150> design<00:02:28.390> faster<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:29.140> more

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
help you design faster and more

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.280 
help you design faster and more
effective<00:02:29.950> so<00:02:30.549> we'll<00:02:31.299> go<00:02:31.480> deeper<00:02:31.840> into<00:02:31.959> drop

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
effective so we'll go deeper into drop

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.080 
effective so we'll go deeper into drop
zones<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.950> image<00:02:33.250> editing<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.760> all<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:33.969> that

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
zones and image editing and all of that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.270 
zones and image editing and all of that
and<00:02:34.269> later<00:02:34.450> tutorials<00:02:35.109> but<00:02:35.319> definitely<00:02:36.099> play

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
and later tutorials but definitely play

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.039 
and later tutorials but definitely play
around<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.730> fundamental<00:02:37.450> difference<00:02:37.900> of

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
around the fundamental difference of
