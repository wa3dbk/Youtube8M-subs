the next step is to go to turn off turn
off<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:21.620> Jets<00:02:22.620> whatever<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.250> then<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.730> ahead

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
off the Jets whatever and then go ahead

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.400 
off the Jets whatever and then go ahead
and<00:02:24.060> pull<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> drain<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.870> let<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.080> all<00:02:25.140> drain

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
and pull the drain to let it all drain

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.190 
and pull the drain to let it all drain
out<00:02:25.560> then<00:02:26.099> add<00:02:26.310> more<00:02:26.550> water<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:28.080> this

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
out then add more water and then this

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.420 
out then add more water and then this
rinse<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.620> out<00:02:28.769> to<00:02:28.950> get<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.160> whole<00:02:29.280> system

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
rinse it out to get the whole system

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
rinse it out to get the whole system
rinsed<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.510> chemical<00:02:30.959> produced

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
rinsed out of the the chemical produced

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.479 
rinsed out of the the chemical produced
from<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.130> however<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.680> see<00:02:35.160> look

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
from that however you can see look

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.570 
from that however you can see look
pretty<00:02:35.940> far<00:02:36.390> down<00:02:36.660> there<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.769> gloves

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
pretty far down there I have gloves

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.300 
pretty far down there I have gloves

that to wash it right away I don't want

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.229 
that to wash it right away I don't want
to<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.700> we're<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.060> is

to do that so what we're going to do is

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.479 
to do that so what we're going to do is
go<00:02:54.510> ahead<00:02:54.599> have<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> nice<00:02:55.500> wire<00:02:55.739> hanger<00:02:56.160> I'm

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
go ahead have a nice wire hanger I'm

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.370 
go ahead have a nice wire hanger I'm
going<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:56.849> ahead<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.150> use<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.690> drag<00:02:58.290> this

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
going to go ahead and use just drag this

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.850 
going to go ahead and use just drag this
thing<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:59.489> open<00:02:59.579> up<00:02:59.849> the<00:03:00.030> drain<00:03:00.860> hope

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
thing here to open up the drain hope

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.930 
thing here to open up the drain hope
this<00:03:02.130> works

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
this works

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.990 
this works
I<00:03:02.970> practice<00:03:03.720> practice<00:03:04.349> this<00:03:04.470> beforehand<00:03:05.040> I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
I practice practice this beforehand I

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.600 
I practice practice this beforehand I
work<00:03:06.599> pretty<00:03:06.750> well<00:03:06.900> but<00:03:07.410> we'll<00:03:07.560> see

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.500 

I<00:03:12.140> think<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.200> use<00:03:13.350> the<00:03:13.470> wrong<00:03:13.620> end<00:03:13.890> actually

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
I think I use the wrong end actually

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.540 
I think I use the wrong end actually
give<00:03:15.510> a<00:03:15.540> shot<00:03:21.470> my<00:03:22.470> cut<00:03:22.890> back<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.430> would

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
give a shot my cut back to you would

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.130 
give a shot my cut back to you would
actually<00:03:23.700> have<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.120> going<00:03:26.780> all<00:03:27.780> right<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.020> we

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
actually have it going all right so we

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.990 
actually have it going all right so we
got<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.470> ah<00:03:29.240> just<00:03:30.240> missed<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:30.600> um<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:32.940> go

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
got it ah just missed it um here we go

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.530 
got it ah just missed it um here we go
so<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.480> got<00:03:33.660> it<00:03:33.750> now<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.140> was<00:03:34.350> going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.650> drain

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
so we got it now I was going to drain

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.120 
so we got it now I was going to drain
and<00:03:36.540> maybe<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:37.050> will<00:03:37.200> go<00:03:37.410> ahead<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.740> um

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and maybe I will go ahead and um

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.150 
and maybe I will go ahead and um
let's<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.460> Farnum<00:03:38.940> down<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:40.470> ground<00:03:40.830> glove

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
let's get Farnum down to ground glove

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.790 
let's get Farnum down to ground glove
them<00:03:41.280> just<00:03:41.400> go<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.610> pull<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.500> this<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.680> going

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
them just go and pull it this is going

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.620 
them just go and pull it this is going
to<00:03:43.860> take<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:44.190> ever<00:03:44.760> at<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.180> rate<00:03:45.420> so

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
to take for ever at this rate so

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.250 
to take for ever at this rate so
Manchester<00:03:47.330> keep<00:03:48.330> trying<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.780> get<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.020> just

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
Manchester keep trying to get it just

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.580 
Manchester keep trying to get it just
fully<00:03:49.560> open<00:03:50.040> instead<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.270> a<00:03:51.480> crack<00:03:52.110> as

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
fully open instead of just a crack as

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.180 
fully open instead of just a crack as
you<00:03:52.800> can<00:03:52.950> see<00:03:53.130> right<00:03:53.280> here<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.970> I<00:03:54.920> know<00:03:55.920> I

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
you can see right here it is I know I

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.590 
you can see right here it is I know I
could<00:03:56.550> have<00:03:56.640> been<00:03:56.700> I'll<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.150> correctly<00:03:57.300> I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
could have been I'll do this correctly I

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.700 
could have been I'll do this correctly I
could<00:03:57.780> have<00:03:57.870> just<00:03:58.020> like<00:03:58.140> wrap<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.530> wire

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
could have just like wrap the wire

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.360 
could have just like wrap the wire
around<00:03:58.740> the<00:04:00.080> thing<00:04:01.080> there<00:04:01.290> before<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.250> even

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
around the thing there before I even

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.730 
around the thing there before I even
started<00:04:02.760> this<00:04:02.880> project<00:04:03.390> or<00:04:04.080> process<00:04:04.320> whatever

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
started this project or process whatever

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.560 
started this project or process whatever
and<00:04:05.280> then<00:04:05.400> that<00:04:05.640> way<00:04:05.790> -<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:06.360> would<00:04:06.450> have<00:04:06.510> been

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
and then that way - that would have been

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.450 
and then that way - that would have been
probably<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.470> better<00:04:07.620> answer<00:04:07.980> than<00:04:08.130> once<00:04:08.340> I

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
probably the better answer than once I

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.460 
probably the better answer than once I
was<00:04:08.580> done<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:08.910> could<00:04:09.150> just<00:04:09.300> pull<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.750> the

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
was done I could just pull it and the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.650 
was done I could just pull it and the
whole<00:04:10.620> thing<00:04:10.650> would<00:04:10.920> come<00:04:11.040> up<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.240> wire<00:04:12.390> -

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
whole thing would come up and the wire -

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.240 
whole thing would come up and the wire -
so<00:04:12.990> they<00:04:13.170> wouldn't<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.950> do<00:04:14.100> what<00:04:14.190> I'm

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
so they wouldn't have to do what I'm

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.870 
so they wouldn't have to do what I'm
doing<00:04:14.280> right<00:04:14.490> now<00:04:14.640> I'm<00:04:14.910> holding<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.420> here<00:04:16.880> but

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
doing right now I'm holding it here but

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.060 
doing right now I'm holding it here but
that<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.239> works

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.520 

not<00:04:25.070> ideal<00:04:25.550> Lenalee<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:27.080> gets<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.290> job<00:04:27.470> done
