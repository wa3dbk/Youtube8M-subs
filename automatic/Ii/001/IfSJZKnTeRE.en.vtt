can't show it any further than this what
we<00:00:46.110> need<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.829> run<00:00:47.730> over<00:00:48.059> here<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
we need to do now is run over here and

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
we need to do now is run over here and
climb<00:00:50.550> up<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:55.399> pull<00:00:56.399> another<00:00:57.829> block<00:00:58.829> out

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
climb up here and pull another block out

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
climb up here and pull another block out
this<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.239> actually<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.809> pull

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
this one we can actually actually pull

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
this one we can actually actually pull
out<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:03.830> easier<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:05.010> instead<00:01:05.909> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
out it is easier I think instead of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.859 
out it is easier I think instead of
pushing<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.720> also

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
pushing it in and you know you can also

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.200 
pushing it in and you know you can also
any<00:01:10.170> know<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.560> show<00:01:11.070> me<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.400> side<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
any know like show me to the side so it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.310 
any know like show me to the side so it
won't<00:01:12.479> hinder<00:01:13.460> hinder<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.549> way<00:01:14.760> anymore<00:01:20.030> so

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
won't hinder hinder your way anymore so

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.109 
won't hinder hinder your way anymore so
all<00:01:22.320> right<00:01:22.530> actually<00:01:23.340> now<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> gets<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.970> little

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
all right actually now it gets a little

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.760

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
what do we get here a lever safe crystal

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.700 
what do we get here a lever safe crystal
and<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.720> door<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:28.080> actually<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.230> did<00:02:29.470> not<00:02:29.650> I

and the door and actually it did not I

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.310 
and the door and actually it did not I
hope<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.400> didn't<00:02:31.060> open<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.390> door<00:02:31.600> next<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.170> us

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
hope it didn't open the door next to us

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.870 
hope it didn't open the door next to us
that's<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.830> main<00:02:33.010> thing<00:02:33.040> you're<00:02:33.460> like<00:02:33.670> oh

that's the main thing you're like oh

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.290 
that's the main thing you're like oh
that<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.320> was<00:02:35.560> easy<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.130> just<00:02:36.280> need<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
that that that was easy you just need to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.920 
that that that was easy you just need to
pull<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> lever<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> door<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.590> open<00:02:39.930> it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
pull the lever and the door is open it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900 
pull the lever and the door is open it
would<00:02:41.080> be<00:02:41.200> nice<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.830> was<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.070> way<00:02:42.460> but<00:02:42.520> hey

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
would be nice if it was that way but hey

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.110 
would be nice if it was that way but hey
we're<00:02:43.240> doing<00:02:43.360> 11<00:02:44.320> level<00:02:44.800> 13<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.850> this<00:02:46.090> is

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
we're doing 11 level 13 so this is

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.350 
we're doing 11 level 13 so this is
getting<00:02:46.740> higher<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:51.220> expectations<00:02:52.180> get

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
getting higher the expectations get

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.290 
getting higher the expectations get

open and very well hidden we find some
use<00:05:59.530> Eclipse<00:05:59.890> here<00:06:00.160> so<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.700> won't<00:06:01.300> miss<00:06:01.540> them

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
use Eclipse here so I won't miss them

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.030

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
and this is the key to the pyrometer a

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.850 
and this is the key to the pyrometer a
permit<00:06:06.880> I<00:06:07.240> don't<00:06:08.110> know<00:06:08.229> it<00:06:08.380> doesn't<00:06:08.710> look<00:06:08.800> like
