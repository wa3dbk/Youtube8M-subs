reigns from a relatively aggressive
player<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.480> think<00:00:33.719> calling<00:00:34.110> with<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.320> 7<00:00:34.649> suited

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.510 
player I think calling with a 7 suited
is<00:00:35.130> okay<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.559> think<00:00:37.559> he's<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:37.980> better<00:00:38.399> off

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
is okay I think he's actually better off

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.310 
is okay I think he's actually better off
re<00:00:39.180> raising<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.809> though<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.140> would<00:00:40.290> much

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
re raising here though I would much

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.450 
re raising here though I would much
prefer<00:00:40.500> re-raise<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.399> around<00:00:42.090> 2,400<00:00:43.370> with<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
prefer re-raise to around 2,400 with the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880 
prefer re-raise to around 2,400 with the
intention<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.879> folding<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.510> shove<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.770> what

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
intention of folding if I shove and what

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.340 
intention of folding if I shove and what
that<00:00:47.039> does<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.760> hands<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.390> 7<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.140> any<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that does with hands like a 7 and any a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
that does with hands like a 7 and any a
sex<00:00:49.710> hand<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.700> puts<00:00:51.329> your<00:00:51.420> opponent

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
sex hand is that it puts your opponent

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
sex hand is that it puts your opponent
in<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> really<00:00:52.079> tricky<00:00:52.320> spot<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:53.670> if<00:00:53.910> I'm

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
in a really tricky spot because if I'm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.520 
in a really tricky spot because if I'm
sage<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.570> card<00:00:54.809> shark<00:00:55.020> sitting<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.469> there

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
sage a card shark sitting over there

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.020 
sage a card shark sitting over there
with<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.980> Sten<00:00:56.340> he's<00:00:56.520> probably<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.879> gonna

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
with a Sten he's probably just gonna

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.840 
with a Sten he's probably just gonna
have<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> fold<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.039> it's<00:00:59.039> also<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> let

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
have to fold and it's also going to let

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.029 
have to fold and it's also going to let
you<00:00:59.969> avoid<00:01:00.359> tricky<00:01:00.989> post<00:01:01.140> flop<00:01:01.410> situations

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you avoid tricky post flop situations

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.759 
you avoid tricky post flop situations
where<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.399> flop<00:01:02.640> something<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.149> top<00:01:03.390> pair

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
where you flop something like top pair

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.170 
where you flop something like top pair
so<00:01:04.769> right<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.460> much<00:01:05.760> prefer<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so right here I would much prefer a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.010 
so right here I would much prefer a
re-raise<00:01:07.010> instead<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> call<00:01:08.780> from<00:01:09.780> apt<00:01:09.930> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
re-raise instead of a call from apt to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.950 
re-raise instead of a call from apt to
bruin<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.530> reason<00:01:10.740> or<00:01:11.250> he<00:01:11.880> could<00:01:12.000> fold<00:01:12.210> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
bruin for that reason or he could fold I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.020 
bruin for that reason or he could fold I
think<00:01:13.350> folding<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.950> absurd<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.700> lot<00:01:14.939> of

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
think folding is not absurd a lot of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
think folding is not absurd a lot of
players<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.420> think<00:01:15.600> oh<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.020> 7

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
players will think oh you have a 7

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.570 
players will think oh you have a 7
suitor<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> button<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> call

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
suitor on the button you have to call

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.649 
suitor on the button you have to call
but<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.290> certainly<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.799> true<00:01:20.540> just<00:01:21.540> cuz

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
but that is certainly not true just cuz

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480 
but that is certainly not true just cuz
you<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> hand<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.680> looks<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.310> has

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you have a hand that looks like it has

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.679 
you have a hand that looks like it has
some<00:01:23.520> value<00:01:23.790> does<00:01:24.030> not<00:01:24.060> mean<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
some value does not mean you have to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.660 
some value does not mean you have to
play<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> an<00:01:25.110> example<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.950> something

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
play it an example of that is something

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.030 
play it an example of that is something
like<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> small<00:01:27.150> pair<00:01:27.390> under<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> gun<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.860> do

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
like a small pair under the gun you do

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.469 
like a small pair under the gun you do
not<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.400> play<00:01:29.549> fucking<00:01:29.939> pocket<00:01:30.299> fives

under<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> gun<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.049> example<00:01:31.590> when<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.770> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
under the gun for example when you have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.340 
under the gun for example when you have
20<00:01:32.579> big<00:01:32.729> blinds<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.049> losing

do not think this is that bad and the
reason<00:01:46.560> i<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> bad<00:01:47.520> is

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
reason i think this is not that bad is

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120 
reason i think this is not that bad is
because<00:01:47.880> my<00:01:48.119> opponent<00:01:48.509> does<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.290> lot<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
because my opponent does have a lot of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.249 
because my opponent does have a lot of
backdoor<00:01:50.670> flush<00:01:50.939> draws<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.659> straight<00:01:52.020> draws

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
backdoor flush draws and straight draws

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.069 
backdoor flush draws and straight draws
notice<00:01:52.680> any<00:01:54.920> 853<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.189> Spade<00:01:57.000> will<00:01:57.420> give<00:01:57.570> him<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
notice any 853 or Spade will give him a

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
notice any 853 or Spade will give him a
decent<00:01:58.799> had<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> continue<00:01:59.490> with<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> turn

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
decent had to continue with on the turn

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.780 
decent had to continue with on the turn
and<00:02:00.350> also<00:02:01.350> an<00:02:01.649> ace<00:02:01.799> could<00:02:02.219> easily<00:02:02.549> give<00:02:02.700> him

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and also an ace could easily give him

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.209 
and also an ace could easily give him
the<00:02:02.850> best<00:02:03.000> hand<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.390> maybe<00:02:03.450> even<00:02:03.600> 27<00:02:04.219> little

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
the best hand or maybe even 27 little

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.260 
the best hand or maybe even 27 little
does<00:02:05.340> he<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.490> I'm<00:02:05.700> sitting<00:02:05.939> over<00:02:06.090> here<00:02:06.119> with

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
does he know I'm sitting over here with

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.570 
does he know I'm sitting over here with
ace<00:02:06.479> Queen<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.979> his<00:02:08.039> pair<00:02:08.280> outs<00:02:08.429> are

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
ace Queen and all of his pair outs are

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.420 
ace Queen and all of his pair outs are
stone<00:02:08.879> dead<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.679> he's<00:02:10.679> drawing<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.039> backdoor

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
stone dead and he's drawing to backdoor

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.980 
stone dead and he's drawing to backdoor
flush<00:02:11.819> her<00:02:11.970> straight

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
flush her straight

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.560 
flush her straight
but<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.580> don't<00:02:14.850> think<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.150> float<00:02:15.390> here

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
but I actually don't think a float here

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.570 
but I actually don't think a float here
is<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.810> bad<00:02:16.050> um<00:02:16.380> if<00:02:16.680> he<00:02:16.830> wants<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.160> raise<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
is that bad um if he wants to raise the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.070 
is that bad um if he wants to raise the
flop<00:02:17.820> he<00:02:18.360> doesn't<00:02:18.600> really<00:02:18.690> have<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.900> whole<00:02:19.050> lot

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
flop he doesn't really have a whole lot

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.740 
flop he doesn't really have a whole lot
of<00:02:19.200> equity<00:02:19.670> let's<00:02:20.670> go<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.180> flop<00:02:21.390> bat

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
of equity let's go back to the flop bat

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.930 
of equity let's go back to the flop bat
notice<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.620> when<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.770> bet<00:02:22.980> 1500<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.670> he<00:02:23.790> makes

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
notice of when I bet 1500 if he makes

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.460 
notice of when I bet 1500 if he makes
it's<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.270> 3500<00:02:26.660> not<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> whole<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.170> good<00:02:28.290> can

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's a 3500 not a whole lot of good can

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.810 
it's a 3500 not a whole lot of good can
come<00:02:28.500> because<00:02:28.890> he's<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.160> end<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.370> having<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
come because he's one end up having to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.250 
come because he's one end up having to
bet<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> decent<00:02:30.480> amount<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> river<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
bet a decent amount on the river and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.200 
bet a decent amount on the river and
that's<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.950> decent<00:02:32.670> amount<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> turn

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
that's not a decent amount on the turn

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.750 
that's not a decent amount on the turn
and<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:33.570> probably<00:02:34.250> commit<00:02:35.250> himself<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and then probably commit himself on the

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.860 
and then probably commit himself on the
river<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.090> that's<00:02:36.210> not<00:02:36.390> really<00:02:36.450> what<00:02:36.780> he

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
river and that's not really what he

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.140 
river and that's not really what he
wants<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.320> here<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.770> if<00:02:38.580> he's<00:02:38.880> going<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.090> do

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
wants to do here so if he's going to do

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.090 
wants to do here so if he's going to do
anything<00:02:39.330> besides<00:02:39.600> fold<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.470> think<00:02:40.680> calling<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
anything besides fold I think calling is

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.710 
anything besides fold I think calling is
the<00:02:41.220> only<00:02:41.370> option<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.880> he<00:02:44.880> actually<00:02:45.030> gets<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
the only option and he actually gets the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.920 
the only option and he actually gets the
most<00:02:45.840> beautiful<00:02:46.380> turn<00:02:46.560> card<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> deck<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
most beautiful turn card in the deck and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.230 
most beautiful turn card in the deck and
I<00:02:49.340> guess<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> five<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.640> Spades<00:02:50.790> little<00:02:51.120> bit<00:02:51.210> a

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
I guess a five of Spades little bit a

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.850 
I guess a five of Spades little bit a
little<00:02:51.300> bit<00:02:51.480> better<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:52.130> can't<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.220> greedy<00:02:53.430> I

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
little bit better but can't be greedy I

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.990 
little bit better but can't be greedy I
checked<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.040> he<00:02:56.190> decides<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:56.730> ahead<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
checked and he decides to go ahead and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.490 
checked and he decides to go ahead and
bet<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.420> actually<00:02:57.600> like<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.080> bet<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> think

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
bet and I actually like this bet I think

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.410 
bet and I actually like this bet I think
if<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:58.950> not<00:02:59.280> have<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.490> queen<00:02:59.820> he's<00:03:00.210> going<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
if I do not have a queen he's going to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.210 
if I do not have a queen he's going to
find<00:03:00.600> him<00:03:00.720> I'm<00:03:00.900> gonna<00:03:01.140> find<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.470> fold<00:03:01.680> here<00:03:02.040> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
find him I'm gonna find a fold here a

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.950 
find him I'm gonna find a fold here a
lot<00:03:02.520> of<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.730> time<00:03:02.910> I<00:03:02.940> may<00:03:03.240> continue<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.600> pocket

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
lot of the time I may continue a pocket

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.100 
lot of the time I may continue a pocket
fives<00:03:04.170> and<00:03:04.650> against<00:03:05.490> pocket<00:03:05.790> fives<00:03:06.050> after<00:03:07.050> the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
fives and against pocket fives after the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.550 
fives and against pocket fives after the
bruin<00:03:07.350> has<00:03:07.500> plenty<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.860> equity<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.550> I<00:03:09.560> actually

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
bruin has plenty of equity so I actually

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.810 
bruin has plenty of equity so I actually
don't<00:03:10.770> hate<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.070> bed<00:03:11.280> at<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.460> and<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.640> think

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
don't hate this bed at all and I think

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.620 
don't hate this bed at all and I think
this<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:11.940> pretty<00:03:12.240> good<00:03:12.530> if<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:15.150> did<00:03:15.330> decide<00:03:15.570> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
this is pretty good if I did decide to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.940 
this is pretty good if I did decide to
float<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:15.960> flop<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.380> he<00:03:16.560> did<00:03:16.710> I<00:03:16.740> would

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
float the flop like he did I would

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.610 
float the flop like he did I would
certainly<00:03:17.130> bet<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.610> turn<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:19.230> rivers<00:03:19.470> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
certainly bet this turn the rivers the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.400 
certainly bet this turn the rivers the
king<00:03:19.860> and<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.400> sort<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:21.060> nail<00:03:22.050> in<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
king and this is sort of the nail in the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.020 
king and this is sort of the nail in the
coffin<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.920> F<00:03:23.070> de<00:03:23.220> Bruin<00:03:23.490> because<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.880> going

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
coffin of F de Bruin because it's going

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.500 
coffin of F de Bruin because it's going
to<00:03:24.090> force<00:03:24.450> him<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.780> bluff<00:03:25.850> even<00:03:26.850> though<00:03:27.180> in

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
to force him to bluff even though in

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.430 
to force him to bluff even though in
reality<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.770> not<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.190> great<00:03:29.640> bluff<00:03:29.880> card

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
reality this is not a great bluff card

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.250 
reality this is not a great bluff card
because<00:03:31.850> he<00:03:32.850> F<00:03:33.090> de<00:03:33.450> Bruin<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:33.960> should<00:03:34.110> not

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
because he F de Bruin really should not

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.870 
because he F de Bruin really should not
have<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> king<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:34.800> often<00:03:35.460> at<00:03:35.580> all<00:03:35.670> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
have a king that often at all and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.390 
have a king that often at all and
because<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.300> if<00:03:36.780> J<00:03:37.770> card<00:03:38.010> shark<00:03:38.280> is

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
because of that if J card shark is

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.670 
because of that if J card shark is
competent<00:03:38.820> which<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.240> am<00:03:39.390> confident<00:03:39.840> I'm<00:03:40.500> gonna

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
competent which I am confident I'm gonna

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.680 
competent which I am confident I'm gonna
find<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.010> call<00:03:41.220> here<00:03:41.490> with<00:03:41.520> any<00:03:41.820> Queen<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.450> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
find a call here with any Queen and I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.930 
find a call here with any Queen and I
think<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.960> queen<00:03:43.230> makes<00:03:43.650> up<00:03:43.800> a<00:03:43.920> lot<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.490> my<00:03:44.640> range

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
think a queen makes up a lot of my range

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.630 
think a queen makes up a lot of my range
when<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.620> bet<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.740> flop<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.160> then<00:03:47.250> check<00:03:47.460> call

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
when I bet the flop and then check call

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.100 
when I bet the flop and then check call
the<00:03:47.760> turn<00:03:47.940> granted<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.660> don't<00:03:48.780> think<00:03:48.930> he<00:03:48.990> thinks

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
the turn granted I don't think he thinks

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.450 
the turn granted I don't think he thinks
I<00:03:49.260> have<00:03:49.380> ace<00:03:49.560> Queen<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:49.920> probably<00:03:50.280> have

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
I have ace Queen I probably have

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.700 
I have ace Queen I probably have
something<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.940> Queen<00:03:51.780> 10<00:03:52.080> or<00:03:52.230> queen<00:03:52.440> Jack

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
something like Queen 10 or queen Jack

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.040 
something like Queen 10 or queen Jack
which<00:03:52.950> may<00:03:53.640> find<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.030> fold<00:03:54.270> I<00:03:54.540> mean<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.870> won't

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
which may find a fold I mean I won't

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.670 
which may find a fold I mean I won't
find<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.380> full<00:03:55.560> but<00:03:55.740> some<00:03:55.860> people<00:03:56.100> may<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
find a full but some people may and

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.490 
find a full but some people may and
because<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:59.270> these<00:04:00.270> over<00:04:00.600> cards<00:04:01.020> really

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
because of that these over cards really

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.550 
because of that these over cards really
induce<00:04:01.800> people<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.190> bluff<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:05.990> if<00:04:06.990> I'm<00:04:07.320> saying

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
induce people to bluff and if I'm saying

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.560 
induce people to bluff and if I'm saying
enough<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:07.950> bruin<00:04:08.250> spot<00:04:08.490> I<00:04:08.700> would<00:04:08.940> I'm<00:04:09.450> not

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
enough to bruin spot I would I'm not

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.670 
enough to bruin spot I would I'm not
gonna<00:04:09.690> lie<00:04:09.780> i'd<00:04:09.930> probably<00:04:10.110> go<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.440> find<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
gonna lie i'd probably go and find a

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.620 
gonna lie i'd probably go and find a
bluff<00:04:10.860> as<00:04:11.010> well<00:04:11.190> but<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.820> really<00:04:12.090> not<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
bluff as well but it's really not the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.970 
bluff as well but it's really not the
greatest<00:04:13.020> bluff<00:04:13.350> card<00:04:13.560> even<00:04:13.680> though<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:13.920> looks

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
greatest bluff card even though it looks

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.039 
greatest bluff card even though it looks
good<00:04:14.340> because<00:04:14.550> it<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.880> big<00:04:15.120> scary<00:04:15.480> king<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
good because it is a big scary king and

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.010 
good because it is a big scary king and
a<00:04:16.950> lot<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.310> draws<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.520> mess<00:04:17.850> so<00:04:20.900> it's<00:04:21.900> a

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
a lot of the draws a mess so it's a

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.960 
a lot of the draws a mess so it's a
tricky<00:04:22.500> spot<00:04:22.620> because<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.310> also<00:04:23.520> something

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
tricky spot because it also something

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.190 
tricky spot because it also something
worth<00:04:24.180> mentioning<00:04:24.570> is<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.690> because<00:04:24.930> the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
worth mentioning is that because the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.180 
worth mentioning is that because the
drawers<00:04:25.410> miss<00:04:25.740> J<00:04:26.430> card<00:04:26.700> sharks<00:04:26.970> me

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
drawers miss J card sharks me

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.950 
drawers miss J card sharks me
much<00:04:27.340> more<00:04:27.520> willing<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.940> look<00:04:28.120> after<00:04:28.420> Brewin

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
much more willing to look after Brewin

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.370 
much more willing to look after Brewin
up<00:04:29.050> with<00:04:29.260> a<00:04:29.290> queen<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.870> I<00:04:31.870> really<00:04:32.170> don't<00:04:32.320> think

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
up with a queen and I really don't think

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.450 
up with a queen and I really don't think
Jake<00:04:32.620> our<00:04:32.770> trucks<00:04:33.010> don't<00:04:33.070> have<00:04:33.220> anything

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
Jake our trucks don't have anything

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.130 
Jake our trucks don't have anything
besides<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.970> queen<00:04:34.180> or<00:04:34.210> like<00:04:34.540> I<00:04:34.630> said<00:04:34.840> pocket

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
besides a queen or like I said pocket

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.020 
besides a queen or like I said pocket
fives<00:04:35.320> which<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.890> guess<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.220> would<00:04:36.520> fold<00:04:36.700> pocket

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
fives which I guess I would fold pocket

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.840 
fives which I guess I would fold pocket
fives<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.540> to<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.690> shove<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:39.340> anyways<00:04:39.610> after

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
fives here to a shove so anyways after

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.660 
fives here to a shove so anyways after
Bruin<00:04:40.290> goes<00:04:41.290> all-in<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.890> I<00:04:42.040> find<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.370> call<00:04:42.550> with

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
Bruin goes all-in and I find a call with

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.250 
Bruin goes all-in and I find a call with
ace<00:04:42.790> Queen<00:04:45.570> something<00:04:46.570> we're<00:04:46.840> thinking<00:04:47.200> about

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
ace Queen something we're thinking about

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.740 
ace Queen something we're thinking about
here<00:04:47.530> though<00:04:47.710> is<00:04:47.770> is<00:04:48.040> it<00:04:48.700> smarter<00:04:49.270> instead<00:04:49.510> of

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
here though is is it smarter instead of

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.380 
here though is is it smarter instead of
shoving<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.470> bet<00:04:50.650> something<00:04:50.920> like<00:04:51.300> 4,000<00:04:52.300> on

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
shoving to bet something like 4,000 on

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.200 
shoving to bet something like 4,000 on
the<00:04:52.480> river<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:53.400> I<00:04:54.400> think<00:04:54.730> the<00:04:54.820> fold<00:04:55.060> equity

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
the river and I think the fold equity

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.420 
the river and I think the fold equity
you're<00:04:55.510> going<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.720> get<00:04:55.870> by<00:04:56.230> betting<00:04:56.470> 4,000<00:04:57.250> is

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you're going to get by betting 4,000 is

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.460 
you're going to get by betting 4,000 is
almost<00:04:58.060> equal<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:58.900> fold<00:04:59.110> equity<00:04:59.230> you're

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
almost equal to the fold equity you're

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.750 
almost equal to the fold equity you're
going<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.650> get<00:04:59.710> by<00:04:59.830> shoving<00:05:00.220> against<00:05:00.550> a<00:05:00.610> good

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
going to get by shoving against a good

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:09.780 
going to get by shoving against a good
player<00:05:01.860> because<00:05:04.980> if<00:05:08.400> what<00:05:09.400> am<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:09.520> trying<00:05:09.580> to

with I'm probably unfold any bed as well

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.030 
with I'm probably unfold any bed as well
so<00:05:25.090> I<00:05:25.120> think<00:05:25.240> betting<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:25.840> extra<00:05:26.470> eight

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
so I think betting that extra eight

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.680 
so I think betting that extra eight
thousand<00:05:27.580> ships<00:05:27.760> really<00:05:28.090> doesn't<00:05:28.360> accomplish

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
thousand ships really doesn't accomplish

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.600 
thousand ships really doesn't accomplish
too<00:05:29.470> much<00:05:29.680> because<00:05:29.890> I'm<00:05:30.070> still<00:05:30.280> going<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.430> call

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
too much because I'm still going to call

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.010 
too much because I'm still going to call
with<00:05:30.760> any<00:05:30.820> Queen<00:05:31.120> regardless<00:05:31.600> of<00:05:31.690> how<00:05:31.750> much<00:05:31.870> he

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
with any Queen regardless of how much he

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.580 
with any Queen regardless of how much he
bats<00:05:32.230> and<00:05:33.810> because<00:05:34.810> that<00:05:34.990> I<00:05:35.020> think<00:05:35.320> betting

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
bats and because that I think betting

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.440 
bats and because that I think betting
small<00:05:35.919> here<00:05:36.130> on<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.310> river<00:05:36.400> is<00:05:36.669> a<00:05:36.700> better<00:05:37.120> bet

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
small here on the river is a better bet

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.130 
small here on the river is a better bet
than<00:05:37.750> an<00:05:38.350> all-in<00:05:39.480> anyways<00:05:40.480> though<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.720> think

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
than an all-in anyways though I think

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.820 
than an all-in anyways though I think
we're<00:05:41.710> F<00:05:42.070> de<00:05:42.310> Bruin<00:05:42.520> really<00:05:42.790> messed<00:05:43.000> up<00:05:43.210> was

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
we're F de Bruin really messed up was

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.890 
we're F de Bruin really messed up was
way<00:05:44.830> back<00:05:45.100> your<00:05:45.340> pre<00:05:45.580> flop<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.419> lot<00:05:46.810> of

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
way back your pre flop and a lot of

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.180 
way back your pre flop and a lot of
players<00:05:47.050> don't<00:05:47.320> really<00:05:47.500> think<00:05:47.650> that<00:05:47.770> preflop

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
players don't really think that preflop

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.280 
players don't really think that preflop
decisions<00:05:48.640> matter<00:05:48.940> that<00:05:49.240> much<00:05:49.450> but<00:05:50.169> whenever

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
decisions matter that much but whenever

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.830 
decisions matter that much but whenever
you're<00:05:50.530> playing<00:05:50.770> shallow<00:05:51.070> stacks<00:05:51.460> poker<00:05:51.840> your

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
you're playing shallow stacks poker your

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.450 
you're playing shallow stacks poker your
preflop<00:05:53.169> decisions<00:05:53.620> are<00:05:53.860> extraordinarily

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
preflop decisions are extraordinarily

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.220 
preflop decisions are extraordinarily
important<00:05:55.240> so<00:05:56.230> you<00:05:57.990> need<00:05:58.990> to<00:05:59.080> make<00:05:59.200> sure

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
important so you need to make sure

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.600 
important so you need to make sure
you're<00:05:59.440> playing<00:05:59.650> well<00:05:59.800> preflop<00:06:00.220> and<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.490> way

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
you're playing well preflop and the way

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.010 
you're playing well preflop and the way
this<00:06:00.850> entire<00:06:01.240> situation<00:06:01.480> could<00:06:01.870> have<00:06:01.900> been

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
this entire situation could have been

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.440 
this entire situation could have been
avoided<00:06:02.190> would<00:06:03.190> be<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.430> just<00:06:03.490> reread<00:06:03.940> preflop

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
avoided would be to just reread preflop

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.060 
avoided would be to just reread preflop
and<00:06:04.720> that<00:06:04.810> would<00:06:04.930> have<00:06:05.050> ended<00:06:05.290> the<00:06:05.500> situation

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:06.070 
and that would have ended the situation

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.800 
and that would have ended the situation
or<00:06:06.760> would<00:06:07.000> have<00:06:07.090> got<00:06:07.180> shoved<00:06:07.390> on<00:06:07.540> he<00:06:07.720> could

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
or would have got shoved on he could

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.180 
or would have got shoved on he could
have<00:06:07.930> he<00:06:08.200> could<00:06:08.380> have<00:06:08.500> easily<00:06:08.620> folded<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.160> a

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
have he could have easily folded to a

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.900 
have he could have easily folded to a
shove<00:06:09.460> so<00:06:10.620> that's<00:06:11.620> that's<00:06:12.010> my<00:06:12.220> main<00:06:12.460> complaint

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
shove so that's that's my main complaint

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.850 
shove so that's that's my main complaint
with<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.180> hand<00:06:13.390> and<00:06:13.540> also<00:06:13.810> the<00:06:14.020> river<00:06:14.350> shove

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
with the hand and also the river shove

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.010 
with the hand and also the river shove
instead<00:06:15.340> of<00:06:15.430> a<00:06:15.550> smallish<00:06:16.270> type<00:06:16.540> bluff<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.870> try

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
instead of a smallish type bluff to try

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.650 
instead of a smallish type bluff to try
to<00:06:17.080> get<00:06:17.230> me<00:06:17.290> off<00:06:17.410> my<00:06:17.560> weaker<00:06:17.830> hands<00:06:18.660> even

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
to get me off my weaker hands even

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.000 
to get me off my weaker hands even
though<00:06:19.900> i<00:06:19.930> do<00:06:20.050> think<00:06:20.140> on<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.470> river<00:06:20.620> the<00:06:20.770> bluff

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
though i do think on the river the bluff

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.670 
though i do think on the river the bluff
is<00:06:21.160> not<00:06:22.090> really<00:06:22.690> that<00:06:22.720> great<00:06:23.140> seeing<00:06:23.470> that<00:06:23.560> I'm

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
is not really that great seeing that I'm

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.770 
is not really that great seeing that I'm
probably<00:06:23.800> never<00:06:24.010> folding<00:06:24.400> a<00:06:24.490> queen<00:06:24.700> so<00:06:25.660> if<00:06:25.720> you

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
probably never folding a queen so if you

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.850 
probably never folding a queen so if you
guys<00:06:25.900> have<00:06:26.080> any<00:06:26.169> questions<00:06:26.350> or<00:06:26.650> comments
