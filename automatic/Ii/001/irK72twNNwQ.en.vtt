 he talks to them left 0 41 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.920
 hello friends on this second day misfortune everything about which we go as 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.139
 is to load them how to place them and even how to create their own that we carry 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.070
 well the first thing they have to do 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.689
 is loading a program called zani wilder that can not count on the 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.480
 video information 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.630
 once downloaded this baritone program download 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.640
 and here is an icon like this 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.050
 lan double click view the good run would accept this next option 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.370
 next next 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.470
 next in following 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.800
 here this is very important 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 decide what you want to create a folder called kernel 3 pounds 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.200
 they will say yes 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.140
 where the one in this long just after that in it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.100
 You have to install it exactly where it is 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.890
 dt a san andreas 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 so that psc has done this program for other things we look for rockstar games 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.360
 piquete san andrés there 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.100
 the next one since it says that if you see it cut 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 then I in my case of bases that not because I have it is the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.380
 pre-selection yes 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.390
 next good and install it good 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.549
 once 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.549
 echoes ossandón will be taking out loans 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.060
 here it is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.520
 i 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.640
 the folder will disappear as it is yamaha that I read 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.340
 if it is not through the normal standard 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.750
 lares 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.990
 and now you will not disappear this is will not disappear logical that 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.990
 the one who is here will disappear 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.800
 this will show what is underlined 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.670
 inc 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.720
 if they do not have but it stands out that the Arabs 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.890
 it means that you have to play the game for the first time 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.060
 to get that folder out 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.810
 the good case in another case 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 they have to create a folder called cleo tests 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.840
 this folder well in uppercase with it 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.389
 with the dallas wanted 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.389
 cooper not be latin honored floor here 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.539
 lan double click lead to put all the files that end fft xt 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.669
 p with that folder that the fire came in 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:26.929
 let's download a motorcycle 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.179
 anyone 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.179
 Petén placed as it is that we do so 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.519
 and here it will appear 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.269
 or you can see here they are 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.859
 many I think moats 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.919
 do not confuse the leads with the mochis the motilones in the torso of the 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.439
 same in the previous day 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.719
 in my case I want to lose myself this month after the example with this 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.799
 download it here good onde here 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.839
 or if the times querol I think moss on the other hand are not well 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.379
 but I have the dose download 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.379
 merits of the download 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.859
 as they were here is 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.389
 they open it 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.589
 i 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:18.169
 there are many things about this situation the most basic thing here 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:19.949
 good 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.569
 here is a folder that was created 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.930
 it means that what's in this folder is this 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.780
 has to pass the folder I think we created just created 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.569
 buick conasami 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.079
 and here is one that is called gt a tres busti ng 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.349
 it means we have to replace these are the gestures ies I follow him 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.419
 the previous one saw how to do 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.539
 well nel of that does not mean that all the mods cores that you 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.799
 download those two folders will not seem like 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.910
 of many monstre clone will appear other files as pont as 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.639
 or with interpreter point extensions 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.460
 or with dotted extensions down with extensions 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.570
 kernel point or extension pse-ee gifts are issued 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.789
 but if you do not know 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:08.979
 please read and watch other videos of how is the motorcycle hack straight 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.119
 what happens is that if you do something wrong you can get to throw the fire 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.049
 good the cases I believed foal another fire over here they are efe 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:21.810
 what is it like 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.810
 the memory in case it arrives in the previous 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:27.990
 well once this is done 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.979
 what you have to do is go through this is why you're think I finished point 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.460
 bs almost all the points of that almost all quilombos will end like this 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.509
 to finish point c is 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:42.210
 one 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.379
 let's continue this disappear 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.210
 hoon 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.430
 a 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.970
 a lead with the extension point east this 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.300
 as object see here 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.759
 this xt 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:58.080
 Pedro has to go to this folder in Zacatecas to believe that there are as 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.729
 I had done before 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.800
 but in this case that point is 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.509
 here all the 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.509
 2 the points explained is what happens here 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.360
 now the next point 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.360
 percent and a 2 12 and 7 to 3 and the cinema 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.199
 and go unzip these are you want 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 picasso unzip here 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:29.360
 nash decompressed already can be for this 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.889
 now you have to replace replace these two files as sam do as 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.889
 with the iem and managers those should know that you 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.689
 let's go the folder adopt gamesa and what is the file that we are going to 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.039
 replace 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.400
 tells us 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.139
 dorrego bimbo in this case is a person 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.169
 which we are going to replace those who lead a person 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.839
 so how do we see people 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.059
 with this program and here you can download it in the information the videos 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:02.999
 they open it 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.189
 and once that program is opened 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.110
 sorry this program believe it 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.749
 the network does not have to be in the folder of 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.749
 st a san andrés just like the moss is here 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.849
 this side is not this good program we do 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:18.619
 for if we look for 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:21.369
 the name that we are going to replace 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.849
 it's called double or a type 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.849
 we looked for it 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.759
 once found we can observe it here 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.479
 it's like someone from the fb and 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.439
 now what we're going to do at home what with him and mg all 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:41.939
 and one of the past with him and mg bulls we can see here as we were left 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:44.939
 now we are not going to see and how we are left at stake 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.560
 good and how can be observed a bit cloudy is what makes the clamor and we 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.469
 must leave a fifth line here is 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:59.939
 now despite the 111 days with some flowers in this case I do not know why 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.939
 He did not come out with those little flowers but he comes out with little flowers 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.849
 if you are tired of the law always appearing out there 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:12.089
 and wants to see it appear there in a separate note as all life as 

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.819
 for example, here 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:16.159
 that lends 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:19.159
 we are here some mountains 

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:23.080
 well that kaka must do is a milestone is a deadly shot of a 

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.240
 teleportation is the open downloads 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.909
 cheese's that you have left to appear here 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:30.449
 well, very easy 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.729
 they minimize the game
