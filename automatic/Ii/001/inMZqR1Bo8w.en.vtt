00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
just thinking about it as I was watching

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
just thinking about it as I was watching
it<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:24.600> doflamingo<00:01:24.840> appeared<00:01:25.439> for

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
it because when doflamingo appeared for

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
it because when doflamingo appeared for
the<00:01:25.619> first<00:01:25.680> time<00:01:25.979> I'm<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.400> oh<00:01:26.549> my<00:01:26.610> god<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is so badass I got chills and everything

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
is so badass I got chills and everything
and<00:01:29.939> he's<00:01:30.270> such<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> goofy<00:01:31.020> looking<00:01:31.350> character

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
and he's such a goofy looking character

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
and he's such a goofy looking character
and<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.520> fact<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> matter<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.150> every

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
and the fact of the matter is every

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.870 
and the fact of the matter is every
character<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.500> one<00:01:34.890> piece<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.490> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
character in one piece is like really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.789 
character in one piece is like really
outlandish<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.049> ridiculous<00:01:37.680> looking

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
outlandish and just ridiculous looking

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.850 
outlandish and just ridiculous looking
even<00:01:38.250> by<00:01:38.369> anime<00:01:38.820> standards<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:40.350> think<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
even by anime standards and I think for

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
even by anime standards and I think for
a<00:01:40.920> series<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.579> able<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> make<00:01:42.000> characters

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
a series to be able to make characters

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560 
a series to be able to make characters
that<00:01:42.600> look<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.049> crazy<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.850> awesome<00:01:45.090> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that look this crazy be really awesome I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
that look this crazy be really awesome I
think<00:01:46.200> that's<00:01:46.380> quite<00:01:46.530> an<00:01:46.770> accomplishment<00:01:46.909> but

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
think that's quite an accomplishment but

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.219 
think that's quite an accomplishment but
the<00:01:48.060> fight<00:01:48.240> between<00:01:48.390> smoker<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:48.990> doflamingo

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the fight between smoker and doflamingo

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
the fight between smoker and doflamingo
does<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.920> disappoint<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.970> intense

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
does not disappoint it's really intense

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.899 
does not disappoint it's really intense
especially<00:01:51.540> when<00:01:52.229> doflamingo<00:01:53.220> finally<00:01:53.759> makes

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
especially when doflamingo finally makes

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.090 
especially when doflamingo finally makes
his<00:01:54.000> first<00:01:54.270> land<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.750> punk<00:01:54.990> hazard<00:01:55.200> he<00:01:55.829> throws

so I'm glad that they're finally getting

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.430 
so I'm glad that they're finally getting
into<00:03:34.890> his<00:03:35.040> story<00:03:35.430> cuz<00:03:36.209> obviously<00:03:36.450> he<00:03:37.050> has<00:03:37.200> ties

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
into his story cuz obviously he has ties

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.860 
into his story cuz obviously he has ties
to<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.739> lot<00:03:37.920> of<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> big<00:03:38.310> boys<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.940> can't

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to a lot of the big boys and I can't

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.150 
to a lot of the big boys and I can't
wait<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:39.989> see<00:03:40.200> how<00:03:40.320> that's<00:03:40.500> going<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.830> pan<00:03:40.980> out

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
wait to see how that's going to pan out

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.500 
wait to see how that's going to pan out
obviously<00:03:41.820> it<00:03:41.880> looks<00:03:41.940> like<00:03:42.150> they're<00:03:42.269> gonna<00:03:42.360> be

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
obviously it looks like they're gonna be

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.540 
obviously it looks like they're gonna be
heading<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.900> dress<00:03:43.230> Rosa<00:03:43.590> I<00:03:43.950> think<00:03:44.430> that's

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
heading to dress Rosa I think that's

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.699 
heading to dress Rosa I think that's
where<00:03:44.700> doflamingo<00:03:45.150> actually<00:03:45.720> came<00:03:45.989> from<00:03:46.290> so

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
where doflamingo actually came from so

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.170 
where doflamingo actually came from so
this<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.310> be<00:03:47.430> pretty<00:03:47.580> interesting

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
this is going to be pretty interesting

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.960 
this is going to be pretty interesting
but<00:03:49.170> like<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.410> said<00:03:49.440> wasn't<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.250> perfect<00:03:50.430> episode

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
