00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.389
 an 

00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:03.440
 is being developed in Peru 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.629
 value chains with five products like the camu camu 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.879
 and is that they have always been used by Peruvians 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.879
 but today they are entering formentera 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.439
 both the national market and the international market 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.449
 we have tried to visit the places 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.269
 where these value chains are being developed 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.269
 rivas hits that this one did not have 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.720
 the value chain is a mechanism 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.060
 that ensures the good performance of all those involved in the process 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.190
 from production the interest rates 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.220
 final consumption 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.670
 international cooperation among them the Swiss in the German 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.890
 through your program 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.700
 They try to reverse the poverty situation of small producers 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.560
 through the benefit of their own work 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.619
 We believe that we have to develop as 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.130
 today that the guys chains 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.790
 i show sidereally you may implement those concepts in five 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.850
 chains are three chains mainly 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.710
 of the network area of ​​the mountains 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.800
 We are working in the Indian hammock with 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.470
 and even arasti also that chaín yes and camu camu are two crops that grow 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.780
 mainly in the jungle or also in the jungle 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.750
 and we want that truly 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.660
 kopolar with the different actors of those chains to see in what way 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.860
 we could improve 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.530
 the operation of the chain the production network the processing and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.530
 also marketing 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.189
 the camu camu is a native species of Amazonian futsal rather cultivated 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.950
 mainly the departments of ucayali and lorente 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.250
 by the way this one 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.950
 Scientific studies have determined that the vitamin content 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.160
 c in the camu camu is much superior to the oranges and the same 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.949
 but not only that 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:20.519
 they also discovered that the camu camu 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.329
 It has an extraordinary capacity 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.629
 to capture free radicals or those substances 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.429
 that degenerate body cells 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.429
 causing early diseases and the deficit 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.349
 in the activity 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.540
 The harvest and cultivation of the camu camu takes about three thousand 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.959
 rural families throughout the Peruvian Amazon 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.989
 including the grower extractors merchants and people who give service 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.569
 freezing and transport 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.709
 there are also present by indigenous families like the Huitotos 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.709
 with falls yagual sticky shocks 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:08.099
 what we have identified from the camu camu li chain 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:10.489
 it's no secret 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.609
 is that the cie this chain is oriented mainly to the market 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.529
 Asian more specifically to the Japanese market 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.159
 our contribution 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.650
 stampeded the training that is already giving 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.009
 yes efe 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:29.939
 after emitting some some additional burials like 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.859
 business management tools 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.950
 as administrative management tools that allow to complement 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:40.349
 the work that iaph is doing rather in the part on ethics in the 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.269
 productive part p 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.239
 i can have 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.829
 organizations associations 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.719
 that can handle this product in a way 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:54.839
 as the market demands 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:56.579
 in the photo 20 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.329
 the champion per kilo 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.109
 note we are going to have 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.809
 approximately 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:03.079
 establishes 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.399
 but weekend foal we camp 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:06.669
 Elegant 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.919
 paying necessary added 2 palermo 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.669
 exponentially green stick 

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:20.579
 she with is a two-year native domesticated boat 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.180
 and the value chain is developing 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.960
 in the area of ​​San Marcos 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.219
 nothing happens in the region 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:33.010
 Japan is a species 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.379
 Christmas Day 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.229
 whose roots and leaves are 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.229
 thought of as the mobile 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.110
 traditional consumption 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.020
 I attributed it to the day with anti-inflammatory properties 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.889
 for the urinary tract investigate 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.610
 scientifically proven 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.659
 although yangon's roots contain codes like sweets 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.229
 of not attending to the wounded 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.860
 that the other six 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.219
 she is medicinal 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.520
 especially 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.439
 to reduce it club joseph in the blood and against stress and some other 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.689
 so that it is possible to take advantage 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.639
 almost the entire plant 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.099
 actually she with is an interesting product for us 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.849
 And I think that 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.479
 also for international demand 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.100
 the international market of the entity with 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.080
 there are different countries but on the other the main ones are 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.880
 Japan 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.639
 U.S 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.650
 the others are good the most 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.979
 consuming and demand of this product 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.999
 the tara is a tree from the dry areas of the inter-Andean valleys ischia 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.550
 entered the international markets in a very interesting way 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.030
 the value chain develop the dry valleys of the network 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.529
 I never again 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:56.869
 Bites a native product 

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:59.860
 and it grows with more demand of something 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.860
 and in recent years a value still selling 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:06.839
 the Avai will advance me, several products are obtained 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.930
 the tara gum is obtained from the seed separating the shell and the 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.839
 driver 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:18.499
 and the food industry as flies is used as a stress agent 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.589
 haskell income and in the industry in 2000 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.930
 the tarantini powder or the morning 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.590
 the weak finance industry is used to replace 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.460
 chemical products 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.599
 and also as a clarifier in the manufacture of wines and beers 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:43.050
 Calico acid medium powder is not used pharmaceutical industry 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.849
 also the processes of engraving 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:50.150
 necessary corrections therefore it is an opportunity 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.030
 in general 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.449
 very good income 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.779
 for poor families this region 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:56.819
 the market is insured 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:00.969
 therefore, we have to work in that direction at the different levels 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.689
 locally 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:05.330
 at the regional level and at the national level 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.840
 invest in new research technologies for new uses
