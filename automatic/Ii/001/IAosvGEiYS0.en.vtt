think that right now we talked about

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.070 
think that right now we talked about
that<00:02:33.489> we<00:02:33.909> looked<00:02:34.209> at<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.569> fact<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.870> Dale

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080

he's he look like car got loose

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.119 
he's he look like car got loose
underneath<00:03:28.930> me<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.879> that<00:03:30.879> happens<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:32.129> was

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
underneath me and that happens I was

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.100 
underneath me and that happens I was
trying<00:03:33.340> to<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.670> wasn't<00:03:34.239> good<00:03:34.390> on<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.569> bottom<00:03:34.750> so

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
trying to I wasn't good on the bottom so

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.780 
trying to I wasn't good on the bottom so
I<00:03:35.170> moved<00:03:35.410> up<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.890> top<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.310> run<00:03:36.459> as<00:03:36.549> good<00:03:36.730> as

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
I moved up to the top to run as good as

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.610 
I moved up to the top to run as good as
I<00:03:36.849> could<00:03:36.910> up<00:03:37.209> there<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.599> he'd<00:03:38.379> been<00:03:38.500> running

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
I could up there and he'd been running

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.710 
I could up there and he'd been running
the<00:03:38.829> bottom<00:03:39.099> so<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.579> figured<00:03:39.940> we'd<00:03:40.150> race<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.569> out

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the bottom so I figured we'd race it out

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.069 
the bottom so I figured we'd race it out
and<00:03:41.160> he<00:03:42.160> got<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.579> great<00:03:42.760> run<00:03:43.000> around<00:03:43.269> 1<00:03:43.600> &amp;<00:03:43.750> 2<00:03:43.870> and

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
and he got a great run around 1 &amp; 2 and

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.430 
and he got a great run around 1 &amp; 2 and
nearly<00:03:44.260> caught<00:03:44.530> by<00:03:44.739> me<00:03:44.950> but<00:03:45.930> he<00:03:46.930> gave<00:03:47.109> me<00:03:47.139> room

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
nearly caught by me but he gave me room

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.160 
nearly caught by me but he gave me room
on<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.430> outside<00:03:48.459> off<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.060> 2<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.630> wouldn't

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
on the outside off of 2 so I wouldn't

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.900 
on the outside off of 2 so I wouldn't
say<00:03:50.319> that<00:03:50.350> was<00:03:50.709> intentional<00:03:51.280> going<00:03:51.459> into<00:03:51.700> 3

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
say that was intentional going into 3

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.339 
say that was intentional going into 3
because<00:03:52.359> if<00:03:52.510> he<00:03:52.660> wanted<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:52.989> he<00:03:53.139> could<00:03:53.260> have

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
because if he wanted to he could have

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.220 
because if he wanted to he could have
just<00:03:53.500> cemented<00:03:53.950> fence<00:03:54.160> off<00:03:54.280> too<00:03:54.489> but<00:03:55.230> we'd

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
just cemented fence off too but we'd

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.720 
just cemented fence off too but we'd
been<00:03:56.440> racing<00:03:56.739> each<00:03:56.829> other<00:03:56.980> earlier<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.609> had

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
been racing each other earlier and had

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.849 
been racing each other earlier and had
no<00:03:57.849> problem<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.810> think<00:03:59.109> I've<00:03:59.500> done<00:03:59.739> that

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
no problem so I think I've done that

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.410 
no problem so I think I've done that
before<00:03:59.980> if<00:04:00.340> it's<00:04:00.549> what<00:04:00.790> happened<00:04:01.120> if<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.299> got

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
before if it's what happened if you got

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.449 
before if it's what happened if you got
loose<00:04:01.630> underneath<00:04:01.900> me<00:04:02.109> but<00:04:02.319> I<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.480> know

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
