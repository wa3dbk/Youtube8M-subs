going to take a stack of 8 and 1/2 by 11
paper<00:00:28.950> just<00:00:29.910> put<00:00:30.180> it<00:00:30.270> in<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.450> feed<00:00:30.599> tray<00:00:30.779> here

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
paper just put it in the feed tray here

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.630 
paper just put it in the feed tray here
now<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.399> handle<00:00:32.700> up<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.850> 11<00:00:33.210> by<00:00:33.300> 17<00:00:34.610> which<00:00:35.610> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
now can handle up to 11 by 17 which is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.920 
now can handle up to 11 by 17 which is
where<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:35.969> guides<00:00:36.149> are<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.570> set<00:00:36.750> right

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
where the guides are actually set right

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.799 
where the guides are actually set right
now<00:00:36.960> I'm<00:00:37.230> going<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> adjust<00:00:37.680> those<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.629> 8<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
now I'm going to adjust those to 8 and a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.869 
now I'm going to adjust those to 8 and a
half<00:00:39.840> by<00:00:39.930> 11<00:00:42.230> we're<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> lower<00:00:43.589> that

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
half by 11 we're going to lower that

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.340 
half by 11 we're going to lower that
once<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:44.999> have<00:00:45.179> it<00:00:45.300> set<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> width<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
once you have it set to the width of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.660 
once you have it set to the width of the
paper<00:00:46.499> that<00:00:46.710> you're<00:00:46.800> handling<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.309> tighten

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
paper that you're handling just tighten

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.599 
paper that you're handling just tighten
these<00:00:47.839> little<00:00:48.839> thumb<00:00:49.050> screws<00:00:49.350> down<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.519> you

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
these little thumb screws down and you

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.009 
these little thumb screws down and you
can<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.659> actually

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
can see right in here that this actually

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.559 
can see right in here that this actually
has<00:00:52.140> three<00:00:52.469> friction<00:00:52.920> wheels<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.550> these<00:00:54.329> are

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569 
has three friction wheels and these are

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:56.000 
has three friction wheels and these are
designed<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.899> quickly<00:00:55.050> pull<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.499> paper<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
designed to quickly pull the paper in

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.700 
designed to quickly pull the paper in
evenly<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:57.510> get<00:00:57.659> an<00:00:57.780> accurate<00:00:58.079> fold<00:00:58.530> every

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
evenly to get an accurate fold every

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.559 
evenly to get an accurate fold every
time<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.219> skew<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.909> accurate<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.449> this

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
time the skew is very accurate at this

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.469 
time the skew is very accurate at this
machine<00:01:00.929> I<00:01:01.850> really<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.089> 3<00:01:03.329> roller

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
machine I really like the 3 roller

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.090 
machine I really like the 3 roller
system<00:01:03.749> versus<00:01:04.350> many<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.800> other<00:01:04.920> machines

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
system versus many of the other machines

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.270 
system versus many of the other machines
that<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> single<00:01:06.300> roller<00:01:07.280> this

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that have it just a single roller this

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.860 
that have it just a single roller this
is<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> friction<00:01:08.909> feed<00:01:09.060> machine<00:01:09.390> though<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.840> be

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
is a friction feed machine though so be

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.450 
is a friction feed machine though so be
aware<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.320> if<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.500> paper<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.920> coated<00:01:11.370> or

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
aware that if your paper is coated or

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.660 
aware that if your paper is coated or
glossy<00:01:11.970> these<00:01:12.750> wheels<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.320> slip<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.219> that<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
glossy these wheels can slip on that and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.819 
glossy these wheels can slip on that and
cause<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> jam<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:16.259> you're<00:01:16.409> concerned<00:01:16.710> about

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
cause a jam if you're concerned about

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:19.730 
cause a jam if you're concerned about
jams<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.149> you're<00:01:18.270> using<00:01:18.299> glossy<00:01:19.079> or<00:01:19.350> slick

jams or if you're using glossy or slick
paper<00:01:19.979> are<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.280> recommend<00:01:20.670> upgrading<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
paper are you recommend upgrading to a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
paper are you recommend upgrading to a
pneumatic<00:01:22.979> or<00:01:23.100> air<00:01:23.310> suction<00:01:23.640> feed<00:01:23.909> version<00:01:24.329> of

pneumatic or air suction feed version of
this<00:01:24.710> once<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:25.950> paper<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.399> place

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this once you have your paper in place

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.990 
this once you have your paper in place
up<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> 450<00:01:27.869> sheets<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.200> paper<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:29.000> just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
up to 450 sheets of paper at a time just

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
up to 450 sheets of paper at a time just
lift<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.600> up<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.770> puts<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> paper

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
lift this up it puts the paper

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.770 
lift this up it puts the paper
underneath<00:01:32.549> those<00:01:32.789> wheels<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.539> it<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
underneath those wheels because it is a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
underneath those wheels because it is a
drop-in<00:01:34.229> system<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.219> not<00:01:35.340> need<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> pre

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
drop-in system you do not need to pre

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
drop-in system you do not need to pre
fan<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> paper<00:01:36.360> which<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.869> personally<00:01:37.259> really

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
fan the paper which I personally really

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.649 
fan the paper which I personally really
like<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:38.520> easy<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.149> machine

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
like it's very easy to get this machine

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.849 
like it's very easy to get this machine
to<00:01:39.750> feed<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> paper<00:01:40.289> so<00:01:40.710> not<00:01:40.829> very

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
to feed the paper so not very

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.480 
to feed the paper so not very
complicated<00:01:42.649> now<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.950> paper<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
complicated now that the paper is in the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.849 
complicated now that the paper is in the
machine<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.539> need<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.350> select<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
machine all I need to do is select the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.740 
machine all I need to do is select the
fold<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> create<00:01:47.880> over<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.659> on

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
fold that I want to create over here on

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.889 
fold that I want to create over here on
the<00:01:48.840> right<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.109> can<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:50.250> single<00:01:50.609> fold<00:01:50.939> Z

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
the right you can see the single fold Z

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.950 
the right you can see the single fold Z
fold<00:01:52.229> C<00:01:53.130> fold<00:01:53.490> gate<00:01:54.149> fold<00:01:54.420> their<00:01:54.659> various

fold C fold gate fold their various

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
fold C fold gate fold their various
folds<00:01:55.289> on<00:01:55.380> here<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.890> case<00:01:56.100> I'm<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
folds on here in this case I'm going to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
folds on here in this case I'm going to
create<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.700> C<00:01:57.090> fold<00:01:57.359> because<00:01:57.630> that's<00:01:57.750> actually

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
create a C fold because that's actually

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.770 
create a C fold because that's actually
where<00:01:58.109> the<00:01:58.200> most<00:01:58.380> common<00:01:58.679> folds<00:01:58.979> created<00:01:59.780> this

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
where the most common folds created this

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
where the most common folds created this
machine<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.979> determine<00:02:02.340> what<00:02:02.820> width<00:02:03.060> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
machine can determine what width you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.880 
machine can determine what width you
have<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.509> set<00:02:03.719> at<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.409> length<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
have it set at in the length of the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
have it set at in the length of the
paper<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.179> will<00:02:06.299> actually<00:02:06.420> automatically

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
paper and it will actually automatically

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.810 
paper and it will actually automatically
adjust<00:02:07.320> itself<00:02:07.710> for<00:02:07.950> 8<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.160> half<00:02:08.190> by<00:02:08.310> 11<00:02:08.789> or

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
adjust itself for 8 and a half by 11 or

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.520 
adjust itself for 8 and a half by 11 or
11<00:02:09.090> by<00:02:09.149> 17<00:02:09.479> in<00:02:09.720> fact<00:02:09.869> there's<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.110> sensor<00:02:10.410> right

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
11 by 17 in fact there's a sensor right

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.950 
11 by 17 in fact there's a sensor right
back<00:02:10.740> here<00:02:11.190> where<00:02:11.730> if<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:11.940> cover<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.240> up<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
back here where if you cover that up you

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.570 
back here where if you cover that up you
can<00:02:13.110> kind<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.320> see<00:02:13.470> here<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.950> changes

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
can kind of see here that that changes

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.690 
can kind of see here that that changes
it<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.750> tell<00:02:16.020> again<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.890> length<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.520> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
it can tell again the length and the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.880 
it can tell again the length and the
width<00:02:17.879> of<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.120> paper<00:02:18.300> ok<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.319> now<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> machine

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
width of the paper ok so now the machine

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.619 
width of the paper ok so now the machine
is<00:02:19.920> adjusted<00:02:20.340> itself<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.819> C<00:02:21.090> fold<00:02:21.390> I'm<00:02:21.599> going

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
is adjusted itself to a C fold I'm going

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.090 
is adjusted itself to a C fold I'm going
to<00:02:21.870> hit<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.019> test<00:02:22.230> button<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.709> should

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
to hit the test button it should

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.330 
to hit the test button it should
pull<00:02:23.220> two<00:02:23.850> sheets<00:02:24.120> through<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.630> fold<00:02:24.810> those

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.520 

so<00:02:32.050> there<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.319> sea<00:02:33.560> fold<00:02:34.150> very<00:02:35.150> neat

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
so there you have a sea fold very neat

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.449 
so there you have a sea fold very neat
very<00:02:36.530> accurate<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.340> set

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
very accurate and you can just set

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.610 
very accurate and you can just set
select<00:02:41.180> whichever<00:02:41.420> fold<00:02:41.720> you<00:02:41.840> want<00:02:42.080> it<00:02:42.410> can

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
select whichever fold you want it can

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.009 
select whichever fold you want it can
also<00:02:42.830> hold<00:02:43.220> custom<00:02:43.910> folds<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.780> if<00:02:44.870> you'd<00:02:44.989> like

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
also hold custom folds so if you'd like

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.809 
also hold custom folds so if you'd like
to<00:02:45.170> play<00:02:45.620> around<00:02:45.739> with<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.980> settings<00:02:46.160> adjust

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
to play around with the settings adjust

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.790 
to play around with the settings adjust
these<00:02:46.940> folding<00:02:47.599> plates<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.140> accommodate<00:02:48.560> a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
these folding plates to accommodate a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.400 
these folding plates to accommodate a

that<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.060> pre-programmed<00:02:53.900> in<00:02:54.050> this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
that is not pre-programmed in this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.420 
that is not pre-programmed in this
machine<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.799> do<00:02:54.980> that

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
machine you can do that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.670 
machine you can do that
that's<00:02:55.910> very<00:02:56.120> versatile<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.690> way<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.500> once

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
that's very versatile that way and once

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.080 
that's very versatile that way and once
you<00:02:57.769> have<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> fold<00:02:58.280> set<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.760> want<00:02:58.940> to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
you have a fold set that you want to

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.000 
you have a fold set that you want to
create<00:02:59.269> you<00:02:59.989> just<00:03:00.140> hit<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.349> start<00:03:00.530> button<00:03:00.590> it
