00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
so uh she's no speed demon but

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.850 
so uh she's no speed demon but
considering<00:02:02.420> just<00:02:02.630> how<00:02:02.750> bad<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:03.590> track

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
I'm just driving more kindly but it just

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.850 
I'm just driving more kindly but it just
felt<00:02:33.860> okay<00:02:34.489> maybe<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.660> mix<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
felt okay maybe it's just the mix and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.820 
felt okay maybe it's just the mix and
match<00:02:37.160> with<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.540> brushed<00:02:39.260> motor<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.620> don't

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
match with the the brushed motor I don't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.530 
match with the the brushed motor I don't
run<00:02:39.980> those<00:02:40.100> brush<00:02:40.400> motors<00:02:40.760> all<00:02:40.910> that<00:02:41.120> often

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
run those brush motors all that often

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.210 
run those brush motors all that often
but<00:02:42.110> even<00:02:42.380> when<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.739> run<00:02:42.920> them<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.130> the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
but even when I have run them in the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.270 
but even when I have run them in the
past<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.880> don't<00:02:44.840> know<00:02:44.930> something<00:02:45.860> just<00:02:45.890> doesn't

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
past I don't know something just doesn't

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.580 
past I don't know something just doesn't
feel<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.970> bad<00:02:47.030> about<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.870> time<00:02:48.140> so

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
feel that bad about it this time so

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.930 
feel that bad about it this time so
there's<00:02:48.770> slightly<00:02:49.010> different<00:02:49.459> suspension

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
there's slightly different suspension

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.790 
there's slightly different suspension
tuning<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.510> very<00:02:50.720> slightly<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.380> know<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
tuning on it very slightly I know the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.560 
tuning on it very slightly I know the
body<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.220> heavier<00:02:52.610> especially<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.390> back

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
body is heavier especially in the back

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.310 
body is heavier especially in the back
compared<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.940> normal<00:02:56.050> normal<00:02:57.050> truck

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
compared to the normal normal truck

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.250 
compared to the normal normal truck
style<00:02:57.650> bodies<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:59.330> also<00:02:59.480> leaning<00:02:59.930> more

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
style bodies and it's also leaning more

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.780 
style bodies and it's also leaning more
in<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.500> back<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:00.860> it's<00:03:00.980> giving<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.250> more<00:03:01.430> grip

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
in the back so it's giving it more grip

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.990 
in the back so it's giving it more grip
on<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.950> outside<00:03:03.950> wheel<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.580> turn<00:03:04.760> on<00:03:04.910> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
on the outside wheel in a turn on the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.740 
on the outside wheel in a turn on the
outside<00:03:05.360> rear<00:03:05.690> wheel<00:03:06.440> in<00:03:06.680> a<00:03:06.709> turn<00:03:06.980> but<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.000> don't

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
outside rear wheel in a turn but I don't

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.110 
outside rear wheel in a turn but I don't
know<00:03:08.810> what<00:03:09.019> what<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:09.470> is<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:10.100> just<00:03:10.459> didn't

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
know what what it is but I just didn't

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.880 
know what what it is but I just didn't
have<00:03:11.180> any<00:03:11.239> complaints<00:03:11.720> about<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.930> out<00:03:12.140> here

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
we should have more speed of course but

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.410 
we should have more speed of course but

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.729 
rundown it's at the end of its of its
charge<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:22.040> in<00:03:22.670> all<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:23.420> was<00:03:24.230> okay<00:03:24.530> with<00:03:24.680> it

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
charge but in all I was okay with it

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.320 
charge but in all I was okay with it
thing<00:03:25.130> looked<00:03:25.340> thing<00:03:25.700> looked<00:03:25.910> pretty<00:03:26.150> decent

still<00:03:26.930> my<00:03:27.739> biggest<00:03:28.100> draw<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.519> this<00:03:28.640> one<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:29.090> the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
still my biggest draw to this one is the

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.800 
still my biggest draw to this one is the
look<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.780> body<00:03:30.019> on<00:03:30.709> it<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:31.250> has<00:03:32.090> has<00:03:32.780> a

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
look of that body on it but has has a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.720 
look of that body on it but has has a
lot<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.079> body<00:03:33.530> roll<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.160> turns<00:03:34.370> but<00:03:34.670> it

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
lot of body roll in the turns but it

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.640 
lot of body roll in the turns but it
really<00:03:35.030> wasn't<00:03:35.269> bothering<00:03:35.660> me

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
really wasn't bothering me

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.150
