 friends speaks to them angel angel rocha 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.350
 then he will teach you how 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.450
 we can change in a custom room the 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.450
 font that is the typeface that 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.269
 come as you can see this one here in 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.429
 this case we are going to use cyanogenmod 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.619
 installed in our l9 is very easy to 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:20.720
 do we do not need any requirement to 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.179
 to have only one thing that we are going to do is go to 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.499
 play store and download the following 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.499
 application called 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.380
 installer is this the one from here 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.110
 black folder with a letter we are going to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.170
 click on install we click on 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 accept and we wait for a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.690
 Once it is installed we will give it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690
 click on open 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.030
 let's wait for the 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.460
 previews end up putting 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.260
 that is, show us what it would look like 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.260
 the source as you can see is changing 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.710
 let's wait for all the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.710
 you really are pretty 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.229
 once you have commissioned everything 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.369
 first thing we're going to do is give button 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:25.270
 capacitive and we're going to click on baku 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.829
 restore let's click on baku 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.929
 and we are going to wait for it to end 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.329
 do this we do it because when 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.149
 we change the font in case we do not like it 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.829
 and we want to enter the one that comes 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.960
 originally we only give in restore 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.979
 but that we will see later a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.200
 Once you have finished doing the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.939
 only backup they have to do is 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.079
 select your source in this case I will 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.810
 select this one that says amazing the 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.579
 selection that you like him 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.579
 click on install 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.520
 will ask for superuser permissions will 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.520
 they grant them 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.600
 it will disappear that you need to restart it 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.820
 yes, and we wait for him to turn on 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.500
 once you have turned on you will have the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.840
 changed source 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.940
 let's wait here the device already 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.370
 ignited the first change we see to 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.040
 first sight is that the name of telcel 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.200
 already changed like him and that connect 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 the charger let's proceed to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.390
 unlock it let's go to the settings 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.200
 and here you can see that the style 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.849
 from source and in exchange we already have this 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.849
 letter that I chose that was amazing 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.210
 that would be all the truth is a process 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.970
 very simple to change the source of 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.620
 our from our custom room for 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.250
 return it to normal 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.400
 it is enough that we open the application that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.660
 we download font installer we give 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 capacitive button 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:05.210
 the cob restores click on restore 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.410
 we give in restore and we wait for it 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.410
 do the restoration 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.020
 once done we give it that if we wish 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.350
 restart and this would be all in regards 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.850
 turn on the device we will have 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.650
 again in the original source we are going to 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.650
 wait now to finish the video 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.650
 here and fire as you can see then 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.380
 the name of telcel returned to his 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.260
 normality like everything else 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.660
 we proceed to unlock it, we go to the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.150
 settings 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.840
 and we have the source again 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.819
 original 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.550
 I hope you liked it and more than anything 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.060

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.060
