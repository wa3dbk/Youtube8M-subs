00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
live is like this and an angle like that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.150 
live is like this and an angle like that
and<00:02:35.810> then<00:02:36.020> what<00:02:36.200> you<00:02:36.380> want<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.620> begin<00:02:36.710> sewing

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.860 
and then what you want to begin sewing
and<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:39.380> tip<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.860> never<00:02:40.190> late<00:02:40.640> like<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.090> like

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
and one tip is never late like this like

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.390 
and one tip is never late like this like
straight<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:42.530> that<00:02:42.560> because<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.250> not

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
straight like that because it's not

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.130 
straight like that because it's not
going<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.670> work<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.360> could<00:02:44.540> either<00:02:44.720> do<00:02:45.110> it

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
going to work you could either do it

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.250 
going to work you could either do it
like<00:02:45.410> this<00:02:45.680> or<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.850> way<00:02:47.150> what<00:02:47.570> I<00:02:47.900> don't<00:02:48.200> know

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260

ok so this section is going to be the
closure<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:22.020> here<00:03:24.500> ok<00:03:26.120> ok<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.870> piece

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
closure right here ok ok so this piece

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.260 
closure right here ok ok so this piece
is<00:03:28.410> going<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.740> full<00:03:28.950> closure<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.940> it

is going to be full closure and it

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.630 
is going to be full closure and it
should<00:03:30.420> look<00:03:30.570> like<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:31.980> don't<00:03:32.010> have<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
should look like this you don't have to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.870 
should look like this you don't have to
split<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.150> one<00:03:33.530> ok<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:34.920> willing<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.370> do<00:03:35.610> is

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
split this one ok so willing to do is

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.760 
split this one ok so willing to do is
put<00:03:36.300> some<00:03:36.600> glue<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.950> web<00:03:38.190> right<00:03:38.850> there
