00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
and but when you get to about four as

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
and but when you get to about four as
you<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.390> then<00:01:48.630> SAT<00:01:48.960> surgical<00:01:51.290> if<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.439> go<00:01:52.530> one

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you see then SAT surgical if you go one

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.420 
you see then SAT surgical if you go one
up<00:01:53.299> it's<00:01:54.299> suggested<00:01:55.020> does<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.399> you

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
up it's suggested does it but if you

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.780 
up it's suggested does it but if you
have<00:01:56.670> another<00:01:57.180> half<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.079> heart<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.860> won't<00:01:59.100> at

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
have another half a heart it won't at

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.840 
have another half a heart it won't at
all<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.780> when<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> gets<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:02.189> stage<00:02:02.490> here

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
all so when it gets to this stage here

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.649 
all so when it gets to this stage here
it<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.659> jiggled<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
it was that jiggled like that

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.740 
it was that jiggled like that
and<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.799> that's<00:02:06.920> respond<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:07.549> when<00:02:08.330> is<00:02:08.450> he<00:02:08.539> of

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
and so that's respond and when is he of

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.550 
and so that's respond and when is he of
course<00:02:08.929> jiggle<00:02:09.440> still<00:02:11.050> let's<00:02:12.050> just<00:02:12.260> get<00:02:12.440> it

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
course jiggle still let's just get it

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.949 
course jiggle still let's just get it
back<00:02:12.709> here<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.879> have<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.090> hard<00:02:14.299> texture<00:02:14.660> so

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
back here we have the hard texture so

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.570 
back here we have the hard texture so

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:15.039 
just the our texture and was basically

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:16.740 
just the our texture and was basically
just<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.430> same<00:06:15.640> is<00:06:15.789> just<00:06:15.940> really<00:06:16.210> really<00:06:16.360> big

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:36.249 
use this and we have this X cube here as

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:38.730 
use this and we have this X cube here as
well<00:06:36.550> this<00:06:37.210> is<00:06:37.360> a<00:06:37.569> small<00:06:37.870> scale<00:06:38.199> from<00:06:38.439> what<00:06:38.650> it

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
well this is a small scale from what it

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.519 
well this is a small scale from what it
showed<00:06:39.069> you<00:06:39.449> now<00:06:40.449> have<00:06:40.539> the<00:06:40.569> armor<00:06:41.020> so<00:06:41.259> this<00:06:41.439> is

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:41.529 
showed you now have the armor so this is

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:48.929 
showed you now have the armor so this is
just<00:06:41.650> this<00:06:41.889> here<00:06:44.789> also<00:06:45.789> quite<00:06:46.060> easy<00:06:47.939> yeah

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:48.939 
just this here also quite easy yeah

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:51.269 
just this here also quite easy yeah
that's<00:06:49.150> basically<00:06:49.300> it<00:06:49.659> and<00:06:49.960> and<00:06:50.740> that's<00:06:50.979> all

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:51.279 
that's basically it and and that's all

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:53.010 
that's basically it and and that's all
the<00:06:51.460> Express<00:06:51.759> of<00:06:51.879> you<00:06:52.029> that's<00:06:52.270> for<00:06:52.509> making<00:06:52.689> it

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
the Express of you that's for making it
