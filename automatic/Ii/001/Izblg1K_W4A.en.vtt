00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
like they did in Ocarina of Time 3d s

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.289 
like they did in Ocarina of Time 3d s
where<00:02:05.689> they<00:02:05.810> base<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:06.229> off<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.819> art<00:02:08.000> style

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
that was shown the concept art style

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.120 
that was shown the concept art style
which<00:02:10.910> was<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:12.410> was<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.769> was<00:02:12.890> realistic

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
which was very it was it was realistic

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.009 
which was very it was it was realistic
but<00:02:13.549> I<00:02:13.580> was<00:02:13.700> also<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:14.030> little<00:02:14.269> bit<00:02:14.360> cartoony<00:02:14.600> at

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
but I was also a little bit cartoony at

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.870 
but I was also a little bit cartoony at
the<00:02:15.080> same<00:02:15.230> time<00:02:15.410> it<00:02:15.709> wasn't<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.670> wasn't

being<00:04:26.930> a<00:04:27.050> ninja<00:04:27.259> he's<00:04:28.009> at<00:04:28.130> night<00:04:28.340> he's<00:04:28.610> must<00:04:28.820> be

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
being a ninja he's at night he's must be

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.960 
being a ninja he's at night he's must be
based<00:04:29.090> on<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.630> hero<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.889> happy<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.610> i<00:04:31.669> have

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
based on the hero so happy and i have

high man dreams or what i really want to
see<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.669> i<00:04:35.300> think<00:04:36.020> would<00:04:36.199> be<00:04:36.320> cool<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:36.800> it

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
see and i think would be cool is that it

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.060 
see and i think would be cool is that it
has<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.550> analog<00:04:38.120> buttons<00:04:38.750> as<00:04:38.930> well<00:04:39.110> with<00:04:39.620> the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
has the analog buttons as well with the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.490 
has the analog buttons as well with the
motion<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:41.030> i<00:04:41.389> would<00:04:41.810> really<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.349> have

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
motion so i would really like to have

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.020 
motion so i would really like to have
because<00:04:42.830> there<00:04:42.949> is<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.280> joystick<00:04:43.699> there<00:04:43.909> is

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
because there is the joystick there is

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.580 
because there is the joystick there is
the<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.690> buttons<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.199> everything<00:04:45.440> like<00:04:45.500> that

the the buttons and everything like that

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.170 
the the buttons and everything like that
on<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.010> tablet<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:46.550> i<00:04:46.580> think<00:04:46.669> would<00:04:46.880> be<00:04:46.970> cool

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
on the tablet so i think would be cool

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.350 
on the tablet so i think would be cool
if<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.360> went<00:04:47.780> back<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.740> some<00:04:49.699> sort<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:49.970> analog

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
if it went back to some sort of analog

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.450 
if it went back to some sort of analog
