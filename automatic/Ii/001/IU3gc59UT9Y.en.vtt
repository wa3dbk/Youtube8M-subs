00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 Bell 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.850
 and is that you can not imagine what I had to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.090
 to do for my parents to give me 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.090
 permission 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.329

 happens is that clarita had to play 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.630
 Chess with his grandfather long plays 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.840
 flight and the worst is that not yet 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.530
 ends in the game only missing that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.860
 come savior I told you about the brush 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:50.590

 already hurry up and you go to Antarctica 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.640
 is that you never know what it holds 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.250
 Fate life is full of 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.520
 surprises especially with a mom like 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.520
 mine 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.049
 yes mom 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.590
 Boys 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.590
 we have to set up the camp 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.310
 can someone tell me where to plug in and 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.710
 play but save this is a camp 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.410
 our mission is to connect with the 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.270
 nature our magical environment but 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.860
 If we are in the square, besides 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.710
 vacations and games are not vacations 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.790
 also that 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.790
 allows everything 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.300
 is they are not going to help you cancel the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.670
 quiet project so that you 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.570
 figures if you're from summer be 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.570
 just starting 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.790
 because justly 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.090
 the day that the vacation begins has 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.090
 what to rain 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.680
 It is very rare I never think xunta 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.960
 that behind all this there is a 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.540
 extraterrestrial conspiracy that 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.460
 conspiracies nor eight rooms this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.190
 question did not happen when I was young 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.800
 before summer was summer and in 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.300
 winter winter for me that the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.300
 Pachamama is angry 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.330
 what would he have wanted to say flowery not 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.580
 I understood nothing the only thing clear is that the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.860
 camp went to the pailas the good thing 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.080
 of all this is that I am entourage 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.080
 entourage 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:48.120
 you take destitute that yes I did not do anything 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.760
 forgive my friends what happens is that 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.480
 these unexpected rains put me wrong 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.850
 but if you are a statue a statue 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.640
 clear but built based on 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.410
 wisdom and knowledge 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.800
 could be due to a wedding for this 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.130
 place I say for pollution 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.250
 I do not want to be alarmed but let me 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.450
 explain one thing if the pachamama 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.540
 I was angry as floridor said that 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.540
 would have solution the subject is something else 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.820
 complex even if you do not see it 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:30.240
 our planet is surrounded by a 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.240
 dense layer called atmosphere where where 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:37.930
 is that I put myself in continuous as they 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.020
 he said the mission of the atmosphere is 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.610
 maintain the temperature of the planet if 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.900
 not for this phenomenon 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.910
 everything would be frozen already but it has to 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.580
 see that with the rain and our 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.100
 camp what happens is that the 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.010
 industrial activities burning 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.710
 fossil fuels among other things 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.110
 have generated a greater concentration of 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.780
 gases in the atmosphere like for example 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.469
 carbon dioxide excuse don casimiro 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.990
 but 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:12.699
 they interrupt I can not go to the point 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.460
 then the accumulation of these gases 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:18.150
 causes climate change sounds like 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.310
 a science fiction movie van gaal 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.099
 I wish it were a movie the change 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.310
 climatic change is the climate 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.789
 and generates some phenomena like a 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.620
 increase in the temperature of the planet 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.469
 melting glaciers increase in the 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.740
 sea â€‹â€‹level droughts and even the 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.770
 extinction of some species 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.689
 you mean the dinosaurs do not 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.110
 but it refers to some animals and 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:49.360
 plants like like hippos and 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.639
 polar bears that are starting to 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.539
 suffer the consequences but names and 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:59.080
 some closer man if we continue 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.770
 so at this rate we are only going to be 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.590
 statues 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.500
 I always knew it, human beings do not 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.500
 they take care of the planet we are also 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.560
 human beings that this one believes cyber 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.860
 man and what can we do a lot 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.620
 things boys the future we do 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.800
 everyone can turn off all the lights that 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.840
 are not using do things so 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.879
 practices like putting the screen of 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.230
 computer in saving mode 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.600
 Energy 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.790
 ask their dads who share the 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:35.690
 car when they go to work or take them 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:39.140
 to school and of course move in 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.990
 bike when possible if we do these 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:44.360
 small actions we lower the emissions 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.180
 of greenhouse gases and so 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.970
 We both help to reduce the effects 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.970
 of climate change understand 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.229
 the camp is almost almost there and the best 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:04.830
 everything is that we still have many 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:05.639
 days of holidays ojalada without rains and 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.860
 go to sleep 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:10.410
 every day in the square and you think 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.930
 that you are going to leave my mom is a piece of cake 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.940
 with the permits to the cat 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.639
 and it does not protect you there is no permission 

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.930
 and the most 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.930
 of the week 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.460
 in the middle of the truth 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.630
 behind 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.540
 as well 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.290
 it can be
