something they call the mortal kombat

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.240 
something they call the mortal kombat
pack<00:02:38.720> actually<00:02:39.530> there's<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.769> video<00:02:39.950> i<00:02:40.069> didn't

Midway's arcade kollection i guess is

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.280
