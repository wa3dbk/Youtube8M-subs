00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.690
 and how about youtube friends here your 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.240
 expert friend on street with a new 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.760
 video and good today I'll show you how 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.490
 apply a ninja or a matrix in halo 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.730
 4 and well today I'm going to start teaching you 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.190
 what is a girl or a matrix after I go 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.590
 to teach the differences of halo 4 and 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.840
 halo reach for example the difference of 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.930
 the height of the jump the difference of 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 radar measurements etcetera let's start with 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.059
 the ninja the ninja is jumping on her back 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.609
 up the opponent and try to 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.350
 kill him omar check it does not work 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.480
 when it is battered or melee 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.170
 Now I'll show you an example so that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.170
 identify themselves 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.290
 now we continue with the matrix the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.870
 matrix is to stare at the opponent 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.600
 try to approach him jump and give a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.320
 turn 90 degrees and try to kill him 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.320
 or mark it 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 very well now I will continue with the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.350
 differences of halo 4 and halo reach good 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.009
 first of all I want to thank the friend 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.439
 498 sider for helping me with the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.619
 comparisons of halo 4 and halo reach 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.390
 good let's start with halo reach to 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.310
 beginning in halo reach to be able 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.679
 Apply a ring or a matrix on 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.890
 enemy needed to be at least in 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.600
 the first circle that your radar points to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.820
 this helped you to identify that the 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.530
 enemy was close to your position to 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.569
 then I will show you a brief 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.649
 example of the position I had to 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.649
 be the opponent 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.750
 as they saw I was barely near the 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.580
 first circle that points your radar this 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.740
 helps you identify who you are in the 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.620
 minimum position to apply a 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.290
 girl or a mother now once you already 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.110
 you were at this height you had to give 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.720
 at least three steps or two depending on 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.660
 how close the opponent is without Gary 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.120
 give the turn and you have destined it more and carlo 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.870
 then I'll show it to you 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.870
 third person 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.480
 first hit first good pass 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.640
 now let's go to halo 4 as I said 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.310
 previously to apply a ninja or 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.560
 matrix in halo reach needs up to 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.230
 opponent at least in the first 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.849
 circle of the radar but in halo 4 it is 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.310
 completely different 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.889
 good as we can see now I 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.439
 I find within the circle that is the 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:03.769
 position where you can apply a ninja 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.879
 or matrix in halo reach but in gilo 4 is 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.879
 completely different 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.770
 how can we see the radar distance 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.290
 of halo 4 is completely different to 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.600
 the halo reach because as in gilo 4 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.270
 enlarged the radar is much more difficult 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.460
 apply a ninja now I will show you the 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.340
 correct distance that is needed in the 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.850
 halo radar 4 to apply a ninja or 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.850
 matrix 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.980
 now the correct distance to be able 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.920
 apply a ninja or matrix is ​​skimming 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.020
 the two perpendicular lines that it has 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.420
 your radar the position that is being given 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.790
 now it's similar to halo radar 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.210
 reach and already when you are at that distance 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.150
 it is very easy to apply a ninja a matrix 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.940
 just taking three or two steps towards 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.820
 forward take a jump depending on the 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.670
 height of the Spartan and assassinate him or 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:20.770
 match and carlo now let's compare the 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.770
 Halo 4 and halo reach jumps 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.780
 as we can see the turn jump 4 is 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.750
 superior to halo reach good for me 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.880
 taste halo 4 is a little easier 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.919
 to apply ninja without matrices that halo 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.930
 reach and good these tips are going to 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.030
 help a lot to apply a ninja or 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.039
 matrix since if you're used to 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.009
 halo reach is going to cause you a little bit more 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.680
 I work now to conclude the subject for 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.289
 to be able to apply a ninja or matrix in gilo 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.900
 4 the enemy must at least be 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.360
 touching the two perpendicular lines 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.940
 that you have on your radar give two or three 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.960
 steps depending on the distance that is 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.610
 the enemy 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.220
 eye you have to realize that the enemy 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.560
 is not going to stay stopped is going to move and 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.490
 this is going to make it much easier for you to give 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.490
 jump and turn 90 degrees and 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.310
 try to assign it and crush it that's 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.639
 to apply the matrix now to be able 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.009
 apply the ninja is something different like 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.419
 we can see the two lines 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.030
 perpendiculars are in front of 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.060
 our radar and if they attack us from behind 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.529
 it is very difficult to know where is 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.579
 what we have to do 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:41.099
 of the two perpendicular lines and more 

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:42.719
 or less calculate how far it is 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.999
 the enemy true as a 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:47.309
 girth a very good tip that you 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.799
 I'm going to give is that you never leave for 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:52.139
 back only you are sure that you 

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:54.509
 you are going to apply the ninja since if you go 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.249
 to go back the enemy will be 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:59.579
 very sure you want to apply to a 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:02.039
 ninja then better wait for him or this 

00:05:59.579 --> 00:06:03.809
 medium they are changing on a wall to 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.119
 that you can jump and apply it very 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:09.599
 easily the enemy always tends 

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:11.489
 direct he never and well I think that's 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:13.529
 everything you should know to apply 

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:16.079
 a ninja or matrix in ice 4 is something 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.059
 simple try it and never give up 

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.249
 will never go out at the first and 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:22.289
 practice a lot and good friends of 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:24.719
 youtube that's the whole video if you liked it 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:26.999
 I like it do not forget comments 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.689
 subscribe spartan street to the 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:29.689
