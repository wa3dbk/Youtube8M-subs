00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.170 

I've<00:00:10.180> got<00:00:10.330> his<00:00:10.450> top<00:00:10.660> line<00:00:10.930> we<00:00:11.470> hotel<00:00:11.950> in<00:00:12.160> I<00:00:12.340> got

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
I've got his top line we hotel in I got

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.650 
I've got his top line we hotel in I got
his<00:00:13.299> top<00:00:13.570> line<00:00:14.280> set<00:00:15.280> in<00:00:15.490> this<00:00:15.880> is<00:00:16.059> level<00:00:16.480> and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
his top line set in this is level and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.600 
his top line set in this is level and
this<00:00:17.110> isn't<00:00:17.290> finished<00:00:17.590> yet<00:00:17.770> but<00:00:18.040> I'm<00:00:18.130> getting

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
this isn't finished yet but I'm getting

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.970 
this isn't finished yet but I'm getting
the<00:00:18.700> shape<00:00:18.939> so<00:00:19.240> this<00:00:19.689> is<00:00:19.869> level<00:00:20.230> now<00:00:20.680> I<00:00:20.710> want<00:00:20.920> to

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
the shape so this is level now I want to

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.880 
the shape so this is level now I want to
create<00:00:21.220> this<00:00:21.490> nice<00:00:21.759> angulation<00:00:22.390> here<00:00:22.930> and<00:00:23.110> you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
create this nice angulation here and you

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.310 
create this nice angulation here and you
have<00:00:24.099> to<00:00:24.220> imagine<00:00:24.759> just<00:00:25.540> pretend<00:00:25.930> this<00:00:26.050> dog

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
have to imagine just pretend this dog

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.200 
have to imagine just pretend this dog
didn't<00:00:26.739> have<00:00:26.860> the<00:00:27.009> scissor<00:00:27.250> tail<00:00:27.610> it's<00:00:27.939> the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
didn't have the scissor tail it's the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.479 
didn't have the scissor tail it's the
same<00:00:28.509> angle<00:00:28.989> you<00:00:29.140> put<00:00:29.380> on<00:00:29.529> any<00:00:29.800> other<00:00:30.009> poodle

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
same angle you put on any other poodle

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.609 
same angle you put on any other poodle
you<00:00:30.939> want<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:31.239> same<00:00:31.480> angulation<00:00:31.989> from<00:00:32.380> this

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
you want that same angulation from this

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.430 
you want that same angulation from this
bone<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.220> this<00:00:33.730> bone<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.750> bend<00:00:35.050> in<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:35.260> leg

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
bone to this bone to the bend in the leg

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.960 
bone to this bone to the bend in the leg
so<00:00:35.710> I'm<00:00:35.800> still<00:00:36.100> going<00:00:36.220> to<00:00:36.250> make<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.610> angle

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
so I'm still going to make that angle

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.870 
so I'm still going to make that angle
just<00:00:37.570> as<00:00:37.809> if<00:00:38.020> he<00:00:38.260> didn't<00:00:38.559> have<00:00:38.649> the<00:00:38.920> scissor

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
just as if he didn't have the scissor

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.639 
just as if he didn't have the scissor
tail<00:00:42.179> and<00:00:43.179> this<00:00:43.570> if<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:44.170> don't<00:00:44.320> get<00:00:44.469> this

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
tail and this if you don't get this

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.829 
tail and this if you don't get this
angle<00:00:44.980> right<00:00:45.160> it<00:00:45.460> will<00:00:45.670> throw<00:00:46.390> off<00:00:46.539> the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
angle right it will throw off the

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.400 
angle right it will throw off the
complete<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.390> trim<00:00:49.690> that<00:00:49.719> you're<00:00:50.079> doing<00:00:50.199> on

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
complete the trim that you're doing on

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.069 
complete the trim that you're doing on
this<00:00:50.500> dog<00:00:50.769> it<00:00:51.190> will<00:00:51.370> just<00:00:51.579> mess<00:00:52.480> everything<00:00:52.839> up

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
this dog it will just mess everything up

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.079 
this dog it will just mess everything up
so<00:00:53.499> you<00:00:54.190> got<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.460> make<00:00:54.579> sure<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:54.850> get<00:00:54.999> this

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
so you got to make sure you get this

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.529 
so you got to make sure you get this
angle<00:00:55.449> right<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.879> say<00:00:58.030> as<00:00:58.179> a<00:00:58.239> judge

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
angle right I have to say as a judge

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:59.759 
angle right I have to say as a judge
that's<00:00:58.780> probably<00:00:59.140> one<00:00:59.320> of<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.469> number<00:00:59.739> one

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
that's probably one of the number one

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.290 
that's probably one of the number one
things<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.339> I<00:01:00.370> think<00:01:00.429> what<00:01:00.730> they<00:01:00.879> what<00:01:01.149> they

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
things and I think what they what they

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.419 
things and I think what they what they
do<00:01:01.359> is<00:01:01.659> they<00:01:01.780> end<00:01:01.809> up<00:01:02.109> dropping<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.829> point

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
do is they end up dropping that point

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.090 
do is they end up dropping that point
down<00:01:03.730> long<00:01:04.120> actually<00:01:04.930> below<00:01:05.230> where<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:05.830> point

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
down long actually below where the point

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.220 
down long actually below where the point
of<00:01:06.190> hips<00:01:06.400> but<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.820> point<00:01:07.060> of<00:01:07.150> rump<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.170> if

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
of hips but the point of rump is so if

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.050 
of hips but the point of rump is so if
you<00:01:08.350> actually<00:01:08.470> follow<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.520> dog's<00:01:09.760> bone

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
you actually follow the dog's bone

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.120 
you actually follow the dog's bone
structure<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:11.380> tail<00:01:11.590> should<00:01:11.770> actually<00:01:11.890> be

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
structure the tail should actually be

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.490 
structure the tail should actually be
set<00:01:12.400> halfway<00:01:13.090> between<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.840> point<00:01:14.079> of<00:01:14.200> hip<00:01:14.380> and

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
set halfway between the point of hip and

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.940 
set halfway between the point of hip and
the<00:01:14.619> point<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.009> rump<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:16.210> if<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.619> point<00:01:17.799> of

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
the point of rump so if the point of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.260 
the point of rump so if the point of
rump<00:01:18.130> isn't<00:01:18.369> down<00:01:18.490> here<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:18.970> that's<00:01:19.060> what<00:01:19.240> a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
rump isn't down here so that's what a

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.609 
rump isn't down here so that's what a
lot<00:01:19.329> of<00:01:19.479> people<00:01:19.600> tend<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.020> do<00:01:20.170> is<00:01:20.350> they're<00:01:20.530> not

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
lot of people tend to do is they're not

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.139 
lot of people tend to do is they're not
actually<00:01:21.009> following<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.490> bone<00:01:21.670> all<00:01:21.909> you<00:01:22.000> need

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
actually following the bone all you need

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.370 
actually following the bone all you need
to<00:01:22.240> do<00:01:22.360> is<00:01:22.479> really<00:01:22.630> follow<00:01:22.930> this<00:01:23.079> structure

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
to do is really follow this structure

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.709 
to do is really follow this structure
and<00:01:23.979> it's<00:01:24.250> either<00:01:24.460> that<00:01:24.790> or<00:01:24.850> they<00:01:25.299> make<00:01:25.479> this

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
and it's either that or they make this

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.660 
and it's either that or they make this
shelf<00:01:26.079> like<00:01:26.439> they<00:01:26.619> used<00:01:26.829> to<00:01:26.950> do<00:01:27.100> with<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.430> show

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
shelf like they used to do with the show

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.520 
shelf like they used to do with the show
dogs<00:01:27.939> they<00:01:28.180> make<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:28.509> huge<00:01:28.869> shelf<00:01:29.200> coming

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
dogs they make this huge shelf coming

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.649 
dogs they make this huge shelf coming
out<00:01:29.649> and<00:01:29.799> that<00:01:30.310> shelf<00:01:30.610> always<00:01:31.060> makes<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.509> dog

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
out and that shelf always makes the dog

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.319 
out and that shelf always makes the dog
look<00:01:31.930> longer<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.409> body<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.070> if<00:01:33.340> you<00:01:33.909> if<00:01:34.180> you

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
look longer and body so if you if you

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.209 
look longer and body so if you if you
have<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.509> dog<00:01:34.780> with<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:35.049> nice<00:01:35.259> tail<00:01:35.560> set<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.100> you

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
have a dog with a nice tail set and you

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.700 
have a dog with a nice tail set and you
just<00:01:36.399> lay<00:01:36.610> your<00:01:36.640> comb<00:01:37.060> down<00:01:37.299> here<00:01:37.719> from<00:01:38.259> this

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
just lay your comb down here from this

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.770 
just lay your comb down here from this
bone<00:01:38.979> to<00:01:39.219> this<00:01:39.340> bone<00:01:39.640> from<00:01:39.909> your<00:01:40.000> point<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.630> hip

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
bone to this bone from your point of hip

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.660 
bone to this bone from your point of hip
to<00:01:40.930> your<00:01:41.049> point<00:01:41.259> of<00:01:41.380> rump<00:01:41.590> that's<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.340> angle

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
to your point of rump that's the angle

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.069 
to your point of rump that's the angle
we're<00:01:42.820> gonna<00:01:43.090> cut<00:01:43.270> we're<00:01:43.509> going<00:01:43.539> to<00:01:43.659> cut<00:01:43.899> in

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
we're gonna cut we're going to cut in

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.899 
we're gonna cut we're going to cut in
just<00:01:44.289> with<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.740> comb<00:01:45.009> laying<00:01:45.280> across<00:01:45.490> there

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
just with that comb laying across there

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.240 
just with that comb laying across there
you<00:01:46.420> can<00:01:46.600> see<00:01:46.810> this<00:01:47.020> angle<00:01:47.469> and<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.979> you<00:01:48.100> have<00:01:48.219> a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
you can see this angle and if you have a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.830 
you can see this angle and if you have a
hard<00:01:48.520> time<00:01:48.670> doing<00:01:48.939> that<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.360> can<00:01:49.509> put<00:01:49.719> your

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
hard time doing that you can put your

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.349 
hard time doing that you can put your
comb<00:01:50.079> in<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:51.430> put<00:01:51.609> your<00:01:51.729> comb<00:01:51.909> into<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.210> hair

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:52.359 
comb in just put your comb into the hair

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.149 
comb in just put your comb into the hair
lay<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.750> down<00:01:52.780> on<00:01:52.930> that<00:01:53.109> bone<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.799> cut<00:01:54.009> that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
lay it down on that bone and cut that

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.920 
lay it down on that bone and cut that
straight<00:01:54.490> across<00:01:54.700> that'll<00:01:55.210> set<00:01:55.420> that<00:01:55.570> angle

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
straight across that'll set that angle

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.080 
straight across that'll set that angle
in<00:01:56.079> but<00:01:56.890> since<00:01:57.130> I've<00:01:57.250> already<00:01:57.520> cut<00:01:57.700> some<00:01:57.909> off

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
in but since I've already cut some off

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.810 
in but since I've already cut some off
with<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.299> snap-on<00:01:58.780> comb<00:01:59.430> I'm<00:02:00.430> gonna<00:02:00.609> have<00:02:00.729> to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
with a snap-on comb I'm gonna have to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.469 
with a snap-on comb I'm gonna have to
scissor<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.329> in<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:03.159> another<00:02:03.789> mistake<00:02:04.240> is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
scissor this in now another mistake is

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.270 
scissor this in now another mistake is
leaving<00:02:04.869> too<00:02:05.079> much<00:02:05.229> hair<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.590> this<00:02:05.710> area<00:02:06.100> right

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
leaving too much hair in this area right

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.649 
leaving too much hair in this area right
underneath<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.880> tail<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.299> should<00:02:07.509> actually

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
underneath the tail this should actually

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.960 
underneath the tail this should actually
be<00:02:07.960> pretty<00:02:08.140> pretty<00:02:09.039> tight<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.610> underneath

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
be pretty pretty tight right underneath

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.940 
be pretty pretty tight right underneath
the<00:02:10.149> tail<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:11.260> I'm<00:02:11.320> going<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.500> go<00:02:11.620> ahead<00:02:11.740> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
the tail so I'm going to go ahead and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.350 
the tail so I'm going to go ahead and
take<00:02:12.130> this<00:02:12.340> off<00:02:12.550> before<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.120> set<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:13.480> my<00:02:13.600> angle

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
take this off before I set in my angle

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:26.680 
take this off before I set in my angle
you<00:02:16.360> take<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.990> nice<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.440> tight

are you doing you playing okay so I've
typed<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.160> angle<00:02:35.490> up<00:02:35.670> here<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.180> now<00:02:36.360> I'm

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
typed in that angle up here so now I'm

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.390 
typed in that angle up here so now I'm
going<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.690> take<00:02:36.840> my<00:02:36.990> straight<00:02:37.290> shears<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.280> I'm

going to take my straight shears and I'm

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.130 
going to take my straight shears and I'm
going<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.640> follow<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.300> angle<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.750> we<00:02:39.810> just

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
going to follow the angle that we just

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.980 
going to follow the angle that we just
talked<00:02:40.350> about<00:02:41.000> make<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.150> nice<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.720> crisp

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
basically when I set this angle in I'm

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.280 
basically when I set this angle in I'm
going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.970> follow<00:02:51.240> this<00:02:51.480> right<00:02:51.780> around<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
going to follow this right around the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.870 
going to follow this right around the
edge<00:02:52.440> of<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.710> dog's<00:02:52.890> leg<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.730> going
