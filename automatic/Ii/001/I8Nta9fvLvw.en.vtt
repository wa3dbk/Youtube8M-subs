means it was never used see scabbard is
really<00:01:00.750> nice<00:01:03.050> some<00:01:04.100> patterns<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.250> rust<00:01:05.489> here

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760

and<00:01:05.909> there<00:01:06.060> pretty<00:01:06.510> light<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.140> rust<00:01:08.360> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and there pretty light on the rust and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
and there pretty light on the rust and
one<00:01:09.600> thing<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.680> don't<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> guy

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
one thing that I don't think the guy

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.260 
one thing that I don't think the guy
even<00:01:11.580> noticed<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.409> grabbed<00:01:13.770> cuz<00:01:14.280> he

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
even noticed on what I grabbed cuz he

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
even noticed on what I grabbed cuz he
was<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.870> a<00:01:15.930> hurry<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
was kind of in a hurry and I was in a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
was kind of in a hurry and I was in a
hurry<00:01:17.520> because<00:01:17.820> he<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.240> hesitant<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.990> taking

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
hurry because he was hesitant on taking

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
hurry because he was hesitant on taking
the<00:01:19.680> hundred<00:01:19.979> dollars<00:01:20.280> cash<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.210> I'm

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the hundred dollars cash for this I'm

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.110 
the hundred dollars cash for this I'm
thinking<00:01:22.350> he<00:01:22.680> originally<00:01:23.130> wanted<00:01:23.310> more<00:01:23.790> but

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
thinking he originally wanted more but

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.920 
thinking he originally wanted more but
because<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.540> was<00:01:24.659> cash<00:01:24.930> he<00:01:25.290> took<00:01:25.500> less<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.720> says

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
because it was cash he took less it says

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.289 
because it was cash he took less it says
matching<00:01:28.440> serial<00:01:28.710> numbers<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.240> don't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
think the other two did I just kind of

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.700 
think the other two did I just kind of
glanced<00:01:33.510> at<00:01:33.659> him<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.049> don't<00:01:34.110> remember<00:01:34.440> the

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
good deal again but I don't think he's

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.570 
good deal again but I don't think he's
really<00:04:36.930> wanted<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:37.650> sell<00:04:37.919> a<00:04:37.949> lot<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> them

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
really wanted to sell a lot of them

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.170 
really wanted to sell a lot of them
because<00:04:40.250> he's<00:04:41.250> least<00:04:41.490> knows<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:41.940> there's

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
because he's least knows that there's

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.580 
because he's least knows that there's
value<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.660> on<00:04:42.960> man

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.589 
value in on man
I<00:04:43.620> think<00:04:44.010> he's<00:04:44.130> paranoid<00:04:44.820> about<00:04:45.030> losing<00:04:45.180> this

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
I think he's paranoid about losing this

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.420 
I think he's paranoid about losing this
business<00:04:46.080> which<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.470> don't<00:04:46.650> know<00:04:46.770> why<00:04:46.950> man<00:04:47.280> he's

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
business which I don't know why man he's

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.129 
business which I don't know why man he's
been<00:04:47.760> there<00:04:48.030> as<00:04:48.240> long<00:04:48.270> as<00:04:48.479> I've<00:04:48.780> lived<00:04:48.990> in

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
been there as long as I've lived in
