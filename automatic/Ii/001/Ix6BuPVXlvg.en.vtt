00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
other direction and then we have these

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.470 
other direction and then we have these
diverter<00:00:22.260> bars<00:00:22.590> at<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> ends<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.210> what

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
diverter bars at the ends and what

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.630 
diverter bars at the ends and what
they'll<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.080> they<00:00:25.289> will<00:00:25.400> keep<00:00:26.400> this

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
they'll do is they will keep this

be<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.860> line<00:00:50.190> for<00:00:50.520> example<00:00:50.670> we

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
be you know in this line for example we

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779 
be you know in this line for example we
said<00:00:51.629> well<00:00:51.840> where<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:53.219> little<00:00:53.520> green

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
said well where is that one little green

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.890 
said well where is that one little green
jar<00:00:54.149> that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
jar that

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.650 
jar that
I<00:00:55.930> can<00:00:56.710> get<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.130> green<00:00:57.400> gel<00:00:57.700> I<00:00:58.000> let<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.540> do

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
I can get that green gel I let you do

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.080 
I can get that green gel I let you do
with<00:00:58.840> it<00:00:58.870> cuz<00:00:59.680> you're<00:00:59.800> gonna<00:00:59.860> put<00:01:00.670> on<00:01:00.790> another

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
with it cuz you're gonna put on another

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.360 
with it cuz you're gonna put on another
conveyor<00:01:01.450> and<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.380> conveyor<00:01:02.740> is<00:01:02.890> gonna<00:01:03.130> take

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
conveyor and that conveyor is gonna take

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.660 
conveyor and that conveyor is gonna take
it<00:01:03.400> away<00:01:04.110> bring<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.260> down<00:01:05.500> into<00:01:06.310> another

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
it away bring it down into another

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.690 
it away bring it down into another
system<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:08.200> that<00:01:08.410> system<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:09.340> going<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.580> be<00:01:09.670> a

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
system in that system it's going to be a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.240 
system in that system it's going to be a
large<00:01:10.000> accumulation<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.990> mean<00:01:11.950> it<00:01:12.040> could<00:01:12.220> be

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
large accumulation I mean it could be

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.890 
large accumulation I mean it could be
going<00:01:12.700> into<00:01:12.850> a<00:01:12.970> straight<00:01:13.330> line<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.750> doesn't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
going into a straight line it doesn't

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.420 
going into a straight line it doesn't
have<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.260> necessarily<00:01:14.410> be<00:01:14.980> going<00:01:15.250> into

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
have to necessarily be going into
