00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.630
 suggestion that was born many, many 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 years with the First World War 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.930
 imagine nothing more 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
 today I propose ceviche toast of 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.940
 mushrooms or fungi what you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.710
 find very fresh in the market 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.629
 ingredients on screen 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 let's write very well you can do 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.100
 variations you can add or you can 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.250
 remove ingredients very from we're going to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.350
 start here we have the mushrooms and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 I've been asked a lot on the page 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.440
 facebook how clean if washed 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.890
 videos are disinfected then if you 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.760
 he's going to sauté them in a pan with oil 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.240
 and other vegetables what you have to do 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:10.610
 is to moisten a kitchen towel like 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.130
 this one or a disposable napkin 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.759
 we squeeze water well so it is not 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.759
 too wet and then we clean 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.090
 one by one that what we want to take away 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.310
 these bits here that we have of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.950
 land let's start to retire ready 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.060
 because if you do not put under the jet 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.690
 of water the mushroom the mushroom goes to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.599
 absorb all the water then not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.330
 we want that to happen this time 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.429
 if we are going to mix with liquid we are going to 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.950
 put lemon juice we are going to put 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.989
 other ingredients but I prefer that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.780
 absorb the lemon so that it absorbs 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:58.319
 water then you can also with a 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.709
 skewer but I think it's easier or 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.510
 surely more accessible a cloth to 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:10.190
 a brochita very well we have already clean 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.830
 our beautiful mushrooms and we're going to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.960
 apply it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.430
 it does not matter can not everything has to be 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:22.570
 nothing very aesthetic let's apply it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:25.750
 because our mushrooms will do the 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.960
 Meat time will be as if you 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.150
