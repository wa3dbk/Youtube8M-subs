00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950
 and 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.210

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.029

 in the organization of the company 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.070

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.660
 a relationship of trust and the organist 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.350

 Guards healthy horses

 especially watch it needs very meticulous 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.460
 you have to know these animals because 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
 that he is nurtured if he cares for them 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.210
 look at all the flaws when there is a 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.589

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.230

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.820
 that's not going to hurt her knees 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.530
 I brought here very well 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.329
 she watched we redo radios this 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.339
 morning okay we'll see the year 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.530
 yes yes it's under the knee and 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.000
 today it's his knee that makes him 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.920
 wrong and there probably a little number 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.440
 in one knee the link between the first 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.330
 boy and the coach is a link from 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.820
 more mentality they trust one in 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:15.400
 the other they help each other and this both 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.450
 passionate the role of the travel boy 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.440
 first is the maintenance of the material 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.880
 the organization of transport and 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.070
 different horses from the stable for 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.170
 which have worked so 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.910
 that everything happens for the best of the box 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.350
 from the stable to that of the racecourse 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.150
 be very careful that the flanges do not 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.760
 do not break in the race as the material is 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.840
 well maintained always took the good 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.220
 horse because from time to time 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.230
 unfortunately there are errors that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.500
 are committed practices and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.390
 horses is colors and then that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.050
 the horses always be clean nickel 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.070
 race 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.290
 so they have to take some 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.710
 decisions they have to have a lot 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.710
 autonomy
