that you don't let the windows fall

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.700 
that you don't let the windows fall
group<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.140> they<00:00:58.230> shouldn't<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
group and they shouldn't get to the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
group and they shouldn't get to the
stage<00:00:58.890> we<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.430> your<00:01:00.090> hand<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> wait

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
stage we have to use your hand to wait

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.840 
stage we have to use your hand to wait
the<00:01:00.600> window<00:01:00.949> it's<00:01:01.949> very<00:01:02.160> important<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the window it's very important also to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
the window it's very important also to
keep<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> front<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.600> winds<00:01:03.899> been<00:01:04.080> clear<00:01:04.320> as

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
keep the front when winds been clear as

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
keep the front when winds been clear as
well<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> begins<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> fall<00:01:05.760> group

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
well so if that begins the fall group

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
well so if that begins the fall group
and<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.170> react<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.710> time<00:01:07.920> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and you don't react to it in time you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.649 
and you don't react to it in time you
will<00:01:08.220> lose<00:01:08.369> marks<00:01:08.729> before<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.299> show<00:01:09.420> you<00:01:09.450> the
