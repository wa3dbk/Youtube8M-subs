machine from other Call of Duty's is
very<00:02:12.180> very<00:02:12.330> plays<00:02:12.629> out<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.870> exact<00:02:13.080> same

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
very very plays out the exact same

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.690 
very very plays out the exact same
wait<00:02:13.650> but<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.100> where<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.459> balance

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
wait but this is where the balance

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.580 
wait but this is where the balance
definitely<00:02:15.450> comes<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.140> gun<00:02:16.380> can

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
definitely comes in this gun can

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.770 
definitely comes in this gun can
probably<00:02:16.890> only<00:02:17.010> take<00:02:17.459> out<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> few<00:02:18.060> guys<00:02:18.300> out<00:02:18.510> at

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
probably only take out a few guys out at

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.570 
probably only take out a few guys out at
a<00:02:18.810> time<00:02:19.170> as<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.560> will<00:02:19.680> oh<00:02:19.800> just<00:02:20.040> overheat

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
a time as it will oh just overheat

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.040 
a time as it will oh just overheat
otherwise<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.390> probably<00:02:21.630> have<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.900> place

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
otherwise so you probably have to place

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.900 
otherwise so you probably have to place
your<00:02:22.200> igloo<00:02:22.470> key<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.100> think<00:02:23.430> about<00:02:23.700> using

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
your igloo key and think about using

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.820 
your igloo key and think about using
this<00:02:24.180> weapon<00:02:24.390> because<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.290> know<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.560> weapon

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
this weapon because we know the weapon

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.920 
this weapon because we know the weapon
is<00:02:25.950> battery-powered<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.090> overheat<00:02:27.720> if

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
is battery-powered but can overheat if

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.840 
is battery-powered but can overheat if
you<00:02:28.290> too<00:02:28.530> much<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.190> does<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.580> will<00:02:29.640> take

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
you too much and if it does it will take

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.699 
you too much and if it does it will take
a<00:02:29.880> lot<00:02:30.090> longer<00:02:30.270> actually<00:02:30.930> reload<00:02:31.260> than<00:02:31.500> just

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
a lot longer actually reload than just

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.229 
a lot longer actually reload than just
regularly<00:02:32.190> when<00:02:32.370> you're<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.700> reloading<00:02:33.120> a

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
regularly when you're just reloading a

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.420 
regularly when you're just reloading a
magazine<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.140> definitely<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.400> be

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
magazine so you definitely have to be

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.220 
magazine so you definitely have to be
careful<00:02:35.910> using<00:02:36.120> these<00:02:36.330> energy-based<00:02:37.020> weapons

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
careful using these energy-based weapons

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.559 
careful using these energy-based weapons
these<00:02:37.800> new<00:02:38.010> weapons<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.610> these<00:02:38.940> energy<00:02:39.390> based

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
these new weapons and these energy based

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.390 
these new weapons and these energy based
guns<00:02:39.870> sound<00:02:40.200> vey<00:02:40.380> interesting<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.250> unique

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400
