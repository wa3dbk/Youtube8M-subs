00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:06.319 
as you probably all know the trigger

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.720 
as you probably all know the trigger
contains<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.470> magnet<00:00:07.859> that<00:00:07.890> activates<00:00:08.519> this

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
contains a magnet that activates this

weed switch this read switch is an
on/off<00:00:10.679> switch<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.460> then<00:00:12.059> tells<00:00:12.269> our<00:00:12.540> drive

trigger shop will affect how the the the
magnet<00:00:21.150> activates<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.020> trigger<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:23.010> now

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
magnet activates the trigger right now

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.609 
magnet activates the trigger right now
the<00:00:23.279> triggers<00:00:23.760> sit<00:00:24.029> correctly<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:24.779> when

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
the triggers sit correctly because when

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.490 
the triggers sit correctly because when
I<00:00:25.650> go<00:00:25.920> ahead<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.369> pull<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.849> trigger<00:00:27.500> but

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
I go ahead and I pull the trigger but

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.560 
I go ahead and I pull the trigger but
halfway<00:00:28.859> up<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> pool<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.210> de<00:00:30.330> moda

halfway up the pool the de moda

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.049 
halfway up the pool the de moda
activates<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.859> continue<00:00:32.369> all<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.610> way

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

end the motor stays activated to stop
the<00:00:39.059> scooter<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.660> release<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> trigger

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the scooter when I release the trigger

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.139 
the scooter when I release the trigger
slowly<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:41.640> 50%<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
slowly about 50% of the way down the

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.150 
slowly about 50% of the way down the
motor<00:00:45.149> stops<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.010> it

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
motor stops so I know that it's it

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.250 
motor stops so I know that it's it
correctly

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
correctly

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.240 
correctly
sometimes<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.500> read<00:00:49.649> switch<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
sometimes the read switch is in the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010 
sometimes the read switch is in the
incorrect<00:00:50.789> position<00:00:51.000> when<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
incorrect position when it's in the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.360 
incorrect position when it's in the
incorrect<00:00:52.350> position<00:00:52.559> you'll<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.160> ahead<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
incorrect position you'll go ahead and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.330 
incorrect position you'll go ahead and
you<00:00:53.520> pull<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> trigger<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.420> it'll<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.739> but

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you pull the trigger and it'll start but

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.970 
you pull the trigger and it'll start but
as<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.640> continue<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:57.149> pull<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> trigger<00:00:57.980> all

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
as you continue to pull the trigger all

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.630 
as you continue to pull the trigger all
the<00:00:59.039> way<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.789> end<00:00:59.969> it'll<00:01:00.809> actually<00:01:00.989> stop

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
the way to the end it'll actually stop

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
the way to the end it'll actually stop
so<00:01:02.640> what<00:01:02.820> we<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so what we have to do is we have to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.440 
so what we have to do is we have to
adjust<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.949> read<00:01:05.159> switch<00:01:05.339> by<00:01:05.970> sliding<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
adjust the read switch by sliding the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350 
adjust the read switch by sliding the
read<00:01:06.600> switch<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:07.310> towards<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> trigger<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
read switch down towards the trigger in

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
read switch down towards the trigger in
order<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> read<00:01:10.200> switch<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
order for the read switch to be in the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
order for the read switch to be in the
correct<00:01:11.159> position<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.630> correct<00:01:12.930> position

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
correct position the correct position

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
correct position the correct position
again<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.670> if<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.939> go<00:01:15.090> ahead<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.420> pull<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
again is if I go ahead and I pull the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.399 
again is if I go ahead and I pull the
trigger<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:17.220> halfway<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:17.850> she<00:01:18.090> starts<00:01:18.570> all

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
trigger but halfway up she starts all

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.440 
trigger but halfway up she starts all
the<00:01:19.470> way<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> very<00:01:20.460> end<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.780> come<00:01:22.020> back

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
the way to the very end as I come back

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.399 
the way to the very end as I come back
she'll<00:01:24.450> stop

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
she'll stop

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.219 
she'll stop
so<00:01:26.979> sometimes<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:28.210> research<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.719> the<00:01:28.899> totally

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
so sometimes the research is the totally

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.990 
so sometimes the research is the totally
wrong<00:01:29.380> position<00:01:29.890> where<00:01:30.430> the<00:01:30.549> scooter<00:01:30.939> is

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
wrong position where the scooter is

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.090 
wrong position where the scooter is
permanently<00:01:31.450> activated<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:32.229> in<00:01:32.619> fact<00:01:32.860> you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
permanently activated and in fact you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.429 
permanently activated and in fact you
pull<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.430> trigger<00:01:33.610> it<00:01:34.090> stops<00:01:34.479> but<00:01:35.170> when<00:01:35.320> you

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
pull the trigger it stops but when you

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:36.300 
pull the trigger it stops but when you
release<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.710> trigger

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
release the trigger

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.850 
release the trigger
it<00:01:36.430> doesn't<00:01:36.880> stop<00:01:37.119> but<00:01:37.299> keeps<00:01:37.539> going<00:01:37.860> again

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
it doesn't stop but keeps going again

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.910 
it doesn't stop but keeps going again
that's<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.250> simple<00:01:39.729> adjustment<00:01:40.600> of<00:01:41.320> the<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.770> the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
that's a simple adjustment of the of the

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.809 
that's a simple adjustment of the of the
read<00:01:42.100> switch<00:01:42.310> into<00:01:43.119> the<00:01:43.270> correct<00:01:43.539> position<00:01:44.819> so

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
read switch into the correct position so

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.580 
read switch into the correct position so
simply<00:01:46.240> again<00:01:46.509> sliding<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.259> read<00:01:47.409> switch

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
simply again sliding the read switch

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.620 
simply again sliding the read switch
into<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.130> correct<00:01:48.399> position<00:01:48.579> so<00:01:49.060> when<00:01:49.539> you

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
into the correct position so when you

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.069 
into the correct position so when you
pull<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:49.990> trigger<00:01:50.189> halfway<00:01:51.189> up<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:52.539> activates

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
pull the trigger halfway up it activates

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.200 
pull the trigger halfway up it activates
all<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:53.920> way<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.369> very<00:01:54.549> end<00:01:54.880> no<00:01:55.060> matter

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
all the way to the very end no matter

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.510 
all the way to the very end no matter
how<00:01:55.420> hard<00:01:55.659> you<00:01:55.750> pull<00:01:56.079> it<00:01:57.009> should<00:01:57.280> still

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
how hard you pull it should still

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.330 
how hard you pull it should still
reactivate<00:01:58.119> when<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.750> release<00:01:59.099> this<00:02:00.099> should

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
reactivate when you release this should
