00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello everyone today has days and today in 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.150
 this video tutorial I will teach you to 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.210
 make a beautiful polka dot decoration 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.790
 and bows 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.950
 for this decoration we will use a brush 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.250
 of detail of the team and painting set 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.770
 acrylic wedges as a base we will use a 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.439
 light color and once dry we will proceed 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.810
 to do our French to make a 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.450
 French with acrylic we will use a 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.860
 tote and thin to delimit the line 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.380
 from French 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.720
 now we will use a thick doping to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.780
 fill in our French for this 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.730
 French use black acrylic paint for 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.190
 those people who are not provided 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.170
 be french with enamel this is a 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.230
 excellent option since it is faster and 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.269
 easy after a minute you'll already have each 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.820
 our acrylic paint now 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.800
 we will make the center of the bow with a 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.230
 Dominguez and red acrylic paint 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.530
 then we will press a doping tool 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.660
 thin to form our bun 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.610
 the tips of the bow will be a bit 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.620
 rounded to give it an effect 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 of depth 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.670
 make sure you apply enough 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.330
 red paint so you do not stay 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.330
 black shadows 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.900
 we will take the bun from the sides with 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.900
 a small ribbon 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.270
 once with our bow we will begin 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.590
 to delineate it with a brush detail and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.590
 black acrylic paint 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.759
 to give you a depth effect 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.759
 two small lines in the center 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.720
 now we see a line from the end of 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.180
 top bun towards the center joining the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.310
 the inner line does this by 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.740
 the two sides of the bun in the part 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.160
 superior only 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.350
 now I will use both of the meadow to 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.740
 make the two ties that draw from the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.740
 monkey 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.290
 once dry use the brush of italy and 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:33.999
 black cubist painting to skirt the and 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.999
 to give them better definition 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.799
 Now that we finish the bow we will add 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:48.560
 the moles with a tip doping 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.560
 medium and white acrylic paint 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.879
 [Music] 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.890
 we will wait a couple of minutes to 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.349
 dry our acrylic paint and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.330
 we will end up applying in our top 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.000
 coat or shine 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.620
 it is not necessary that we make the bow 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.720
 in all the nails for the others 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.850
 we will make a black French and what 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.600
 we will fill with moles 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.100
 now we have finished our decoration 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.660

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.030
