00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.090
 htc one 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.139
 this is the real flagship among smartphones 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.000
 competing not only samsung galaxy 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.490
 s4 but from iphone 5 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
 it's not just a powerful smartphone that works 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.350
 on quad qualcomm processor 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.460
 snapdragon 600 and having two gigabytes 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.619
 RAM 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 and at the same time very stylish model 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.650
 trendsetter design with powerful sound 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.719
 what can capture search for sevan this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000
 The first is an elegant body made 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 from aluminum with separate plastic 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.329
 inserts on the edges of the body rounded off 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.010
 so despite the crane 4.7 inches 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.160
 smartphone looks compact by 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.420
 plastic bezel goes to the perimeter of the butt 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.460
 by the way metric body more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 practical than plastic it is more convenient 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.020
 held in hand and easier to wipe off 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 dirt even with alcohol is not important 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 go overboard most of the front 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.260
 panel takes a super lcd screen with full 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.689
 hd resolution this display has no 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.119
 as vivid color as super 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.760
 amoled and worse transmits colors to the sun 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.700
 but in principle the display is quite suitable 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.530
 covered with gorilla glass 2 on top 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 there are large grids below 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.210
 speakers creating power dash 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 sound from the top left speaker 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.619
 proximity sensors are located 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.200
 illumination and 2 megapixel on the right 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.950
 front camera under the screen on the sides 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.320
 from the logo 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.229
 there are only two touch buttons back 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.600
 and home 2 with a double click cause 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.060
 list of all running applications when 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 hold google 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.180
 the menu button is not in the application starts 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.159
 virtually 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.890
 five more buttons appear in the interface 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.450
 call and I myself will change the browser and camera 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.460
 at the top 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.399
 there is a power lock button and 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.380
 audio jack on the right edge of the micro slot 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.290
 sim with a hole to open it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.570
 bottom port microusb and hole 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.299
 microphone and finally on the right side 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.880
 located two-way regulator 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.890
 volume control metal and 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 polished as concentric circles 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 This item looks very stylish 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.319
 the back panel is almost completely made of 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 aluminum but consists of separate parts 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.370
 which are associated with plastic joints 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.680
 inserts under which it is obvious 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.959
 antennas are located because any metal 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.120
 the signal below the sign will be shielded 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.379
 beats audio says that we are dealing 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.450
 with great sound 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.410
 By the way, the inscription after testing 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.569
 wear off a little 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.410
 so after a couple of months she should and 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.980
 disappear altogether 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.480
 but there's nothing you can do downstairs 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.670
 there is some service 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.370
 information in the middle of the panel is available 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.260

 LED flash yes exactly 41 10 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.690
 megapixels honor and praise the company what 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.209
 she refused to race megapixels 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.640
 which essentially gives nothing and this 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.450
 understand all 4 megapixel specialists 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.610
 This is the optimal maximum, especially for 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.390
 smartphones but used a special 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.829
 ultrapixel pixel technology 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.049
 is 2 microns 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.459
 also in the upper right corner of the back 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.940

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.940
 microphone

 all data from iphone is done this easily and 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.359
