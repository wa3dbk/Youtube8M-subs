 head my name is Franciscan doshas 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.820
 Today is Sunday afternoon and we are 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:18.990
 Here in the forest near Fürth 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.179
 different for this video is the seco 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.400
 who does not know what cdu is looking at 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.109
 like my videos egger great and the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.749
 cognitive behavioral therapy 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.509
 I have a ten-page dealer there and 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.600
 Everything for free and I explain what that 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.670
 ego is that conditioned ego 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.000
 that means that I conditioned with 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.070
 his programming with his 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 learning experience but also with his 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.940
 experience all this as a child 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.420
 has disappointment rejection goes 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.240
 mainly to defend oneself 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.680
 to have it right for example 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:01.320
 one of the ego's faces like ego for 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 conditioned means that means we come 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.000
 not as a baby on the world and say 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.829
 but I have to fall better 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.290
 i feel the neighbor's baby 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.110
 fail my father is better but 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.060
 We learn that over time 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 the society of our parents of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.420
 the media and so on and so forth 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.630
 but that's not what this video is about 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.460
 the goal is and right now at 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 Bicycling over the way in the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.880
 true sense of the word and I say 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.790
 just tell them about it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.460
 stop her eyes and look like 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.860
 makes itself felt great he seco 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 for example, writes in his 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.130
 He writes a lot about seco because he says so 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 if they recognize the seco these old ones 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.320
 pattern in us then you can do it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.210
 also changed before and older ones 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.970
 people run 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 60-70 a couple and we drive there 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.320
 bike and that is for cyclists 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.720
 and pedestrians and the two estates 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 run in the way or respectively 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.689
 right in the middle is okay we have 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.640
 We also do not ring a bell at all 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.500
 topic and we usually drive too 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.759
 not fast so Sunday driver 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.280
 so to speak and my husband rings and you 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.290
 Notice this in the thoughts they hear us 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.820
 not then do I ring mine again 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.860
 left 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.160
 because my bell works and then 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.030
 he jumps to the left and his wife 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.520
 he pushes to the right and you see 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 that this man is scared and me 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.430
 driving over yet smiles at him because I 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.970
 think hey nice place and place 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.850
 then it goes off, he says 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.770
 beautiful and I okay that was the goal 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.780
 and of course I do not have him there 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.520
 not thanks and said thank you that 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.760
 They are on the side though they are 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.650
 lost in thought were yes and practical 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.230
 a lot of cos do that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.780
 project your own displeasure 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 own anger your subconsciously haid up 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.230
 other 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.300
 Thank god I recognized that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.950
 its very good outside that he was 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.200
 has been taken over by old patterns 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.090
 and then I did not have to join that 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.310
 problem is when it's outside 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.040
 changes to the perception that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.690
 Yähnigen which is taken over yes me 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.120
 speak also of delusion 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.900
 even if I smiled has had you 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.970
 Maybe you do not think so 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.100
 but I thought 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.410
 skip it or I can give it to you 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.480
 sardonic 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.030
 that's why it's with a cdu with one 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.970
 people of the conditioning ego 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.739
 It is impossible to take over 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.660
 to speak to these people 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.430
 in psychotherapy or the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.410
 Psychology is also called this share 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.300
 ego states one speaks of it 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.239
 separate shares 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.060
 the injured children disappointed 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.030
 the annoying angry sad ones 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.870
 Children who come up will, so to speak 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 take over and then defend ourselves 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.120
 want to be right inferior 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.250
 For example, if you feel mine now 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.470
 cdu had come out i would have it 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.230
 not noticed would have jumped on it 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.040
 and would have gone through the true then 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.160
 I would have said to him as superior 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.070
 Psychotherapist listen to her 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.680
 to project dissatisfaction on me 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.480
 yes then my goal would have felt good 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.940
 because it would have thought yes but I have 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.919
 I know a lot more than he has 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.800
 no idea of ​​it unconsciously 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.360
 without end so very important that they are 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.099
 watch with yourself 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.629
 and what would have happened to me 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.219
 Aimed good because I got that 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:34.860
 he would not have realized 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:37.319
 more annoyed and painful to both 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.569
 body know each other approached 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.539
 and sometimes they probably have 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.699
 also a car like many others 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.729
 this cdu or the pain 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.039
 but often on highways or directly 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.870
 observed before traffic lights because it is 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.629
 sometimes relatively dangerous if two 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.479
 cds stand side by side or there 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.099
 Deliver a war and a cd 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.449
 collective level of need are 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.279
 to look at news 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:05.460
 These are the wars we lead in 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:08.759
 the world against animals against the environment 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.310
 but also I have against each other 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:14.490
 right the act wrong my religion 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.210
 good is not yours i am the better 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.029
 Do not start, we are not right 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.939
 they see that everything is done in a small way 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:26.969
 already in our head start begins 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.550
 there are impulses in society in 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.430
 culture to get it right 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:36.449
 my message to you or my tip 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.569
 They watch your cdu and look 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:42.990
 how often they are taken over 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:45.210
 due to external releases and how 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.639
 often they are in a state of annoyance 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.190
 to have the right to defend that 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.580
 the fear of the here and so on and so on 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.310
 on 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.860
 Your body tells you if you are 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.620
 are feeling relaxed or relaxed 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.060
 she just back against anything and 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.710
 somehow fight him 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.000
 because as you may experience 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.750
 it does not really help him to know that 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.490
 continue but stop with the 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.949
 resistance against oneself and others too 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.740
 fight and then they can do something more 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:16.710
 change as if from a cdu 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.810
 war made condition leads this 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.180
 Today was a video for advanced 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.419
 and remember what's in your head 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.180
 motto differently think better 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:29.750
 consciously live until next time 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.750
 bye
