00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.759
 Hello friends, I occasionally like 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.879
 would face some such 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.100
 abstract criticism that arises 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.289
 in the minds of people who say well here 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.960
 10 on real but what can you learn 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.529
 there for three months and I would not 3 I live 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.670
 there nevertheless we are still on the practice here 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.369
 there are six months 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.470
 here and how can people here who are there 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.010
 have studied whether there even six three months 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.620
 months can they even get there 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.420
 65,000 dollars for a feast at the start there and we 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.520
 we say yes for certain 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.310
 it may not be the case 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.550
 case and here is how to make excuses 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.190
 have this here 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.760
 man comes today 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.100
 came to us from another state 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.379
 but he 's like not 100 percent 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.480
 decided what he wants to do but so 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.000
 that's why you talked and why 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.930
 there was this information that I want with 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.540
 to share you, he says I am 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.270
 hesitate in hollywood to you 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.940
 he is with such a computer past but he is not 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.909
 do not encode do not administer as well 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.830
 how would organize some processes 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.800
 it does not matter exactly 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.570
 administrative literate specifically 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.300
 so that was a simple technical 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.520
 work to do but he may already be 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.759
 doing it for was there i don't know as well 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.289
 a peasant there is a little over 40 and now he has 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.929
 alternative whether i 'm telling what 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.060
 you have an alternative but he says in 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.940
 San Francisco has an organization 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.490
 which is called 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.979
 reactor I then went to google mean you 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.159
 found this hack there 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.940
 hey cy kei reacts like 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.890
 the reactor in the city of Sarov percent 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.850
 means and here they are teaching 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.450
 Programming means and now the course is 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.090
 they have java script on a course at 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.560
 and he says that this course has 16 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.590
 weeks I really when looked at 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.110
 page without going there specific 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.440
 disciplines and there was written that in 12 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.900
 weeks 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.820
 Well, that is not important for three months or 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.260
 four months teach programming 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.240
 on java script 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.070
 and when you come to their first 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.620
 the page there just says they 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.660
 teach programming it is written that 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.130
 the average graduate from them gets on 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:37.390
 Starting at 105,000 dollars a year at the rate of 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.070
 150 105000 dollars a year on java but not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.620
 on there not only on the java script and right now 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:47.620
 here 99 percent of them are settled 99 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.960
 percent of graduates they get 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.960
 to work for three months from 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.360
 since the end of 3 months 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.520
 and it's worth all the fun there 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.940
 by java script 18 there and a half thousand 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.920
 17 thousand I want to say a sin and yes there 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.690
 them on google and there they have all these 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.540
 stars there everything is so good 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.640
 respond here and really from to 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.770
 4000 dates given so maybe 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.870
 unhappy when 17 gave it away 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.580
 completely different pleasure here 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.950
 much more joy but the question than 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.260
 you know it turns out people don't teach them 6 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.270
 months there yes then there is no no 3 months 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.540
 will bring thorns to andre us weeks you teach 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.690
 account on the site is written 12 weeks and 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.670
 learning not testing let's say so 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.770
 very modest such a technical 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.070
 Regarding the discipline that there him than you 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.140
 good lord but learn but also java 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.540
 Script Of course from mission plastic even 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.360
 to manage you I do not know that there but 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.120
 impossible not incomparable but java 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.280
 java script programmer and there in 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.500
 Mostly mineral such a manual tester 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.300
 which we teach can be mine there we give 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.490
 little bit this automation on basically 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.890
 then they manually work that is our 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.770
 cottage is much easier but well, but in tens 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.980
 times easier ipad started twice 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.980
 time we spend on it all 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 respectively 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.000
 doc 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.940
 accordingly , we have more discipline 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.340
 simple here and 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.090
 and my wife is also not 99 percent of 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.700
 pollock 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 I don't know about 99 I think that where 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.670
 get paid 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:31.370
 17,000 admission ticket is hardly there 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:34.370
 opportunity to reach the level of 1 percent 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.070
 it needs to be but enough 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.170
 there are quite a few hundreds of students 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.050
 about also finding at least hundreds 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.760
 not tens to be technically in 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.460
 able to say what percent was there 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.100
 99 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.810
 besides actually i'm like 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.090
 a man who at 20 is already in school 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.020
 business, I can say that 99 does not happen 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.950
 because someone got sick someone changed 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.969
 plans 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.039
 by virtue of something, someone here 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.129
 well , something happened to them 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:08.969
 anything happens to people so 99 is me 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:12.999
 for the fact that some such hyperbole 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:16.029
 grotesque such but not the point I just 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:18.339
 what I say and they are all in the pros and 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:21.189
 nobody sense the asterisks there on google and 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.199
 no one says that they are crooks and no one 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.319
 doesn't say sony breeds newbies and 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.929
 no one says they are there me i'm not 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:33.909
 I know what they are there but anyway 

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:37.269
 guys just three months 17 thousand and all 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.490
 whether you are in ladies and 105,000 at the start 

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:42.550
 this is a bad investment 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.620
 Now I want to say that is, I looked 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.180
 read I think 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.460
 and someone else dares to say that more 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.260
 simple science for twice as much 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.729
 means a long period of time 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:58.810
 so harder to master 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.260
 or there we do not ascend 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.919
 Itâ€™s interesting to know what there are 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.410
 funny stuff 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.419
 and this friend who went there and 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.820
 here he is considering them he says that 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.010
 someone told him that he studied there 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.919
 them and said that right there recruiters 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.289
 comes in and take it straight from there 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.360
 from there they take away I feel and not all 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.430
 taken away because if you need three 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.289
 month statistics summed up by 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:28.870
 Employment is very obvious 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:31.530
 that as if not all, that's why not a judge 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.449
 then the book of the psyche will expel on but 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:37.510
 please gentlemen 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:41.500
 what is there in the world and how what 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:44.050
 the faded picture we present next to 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.270
 these people who are so great 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.110
 disciplines like java script there you understand 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:53.230
 and 105000 to you at the start is about to live 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:56.410
 that's who caught the firebird by the tail 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.690
 so, but maybe not everyone has 17, but 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.850
 accumulate 17000 while working as a tester 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:05.980
 maybe there is suddenly a better use 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.660
 You will not find java-script and learn in general 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.350
 friends are so jolly 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.350
 is happy
