00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.049
 hello to all and if dr nordmann 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.490
 I hope you are well 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.019
 today we will use them the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.070
 bouncing ball material two 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.300
 experiences for the price of a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.860
 it's a golden affair and it's going 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.000
 really well done his achievement is 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.320
 very similar to the experience of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.940
 last Friday it's just the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.160
 dosages that will change and that they will 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.990
 change everything today's experience 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.029
 is not glamorous at all let's be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.060
 okay so I propose to break the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060
 ice cream 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.070
 this sound really comes from the dough that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.059
 we will create 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.260
 we are going to need several 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:43.950
 containers that sticks to wood 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 food coloring and borax and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.800
 at first I will take 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 my container two hours and put there 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 fifty thousand water islands until there 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 it's not complicated we agree I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.190
 will then paid these fifty thousand 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 liters of water belong in a bottle 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 empty and now I'm going to take my 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.170
 wood glue and pour 100 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.640
 milliliters of my container two hours 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.199
 here we go now I will take 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.880
 my 100 milliliters of glue and the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.900
 add to the container containing my 50's 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.380
 milliliters of water I poured 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380
 previously 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.180
 once all the glue and well versed 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.560
 I'm going to mix everything so that the 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.750
 glue and water forms one and the same 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 liquid then mix well as it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.450
 must then for the little touch of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.010
 fancy 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.360
 I'm going to take a blue dye and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.810
 emit three to four groups in the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.190
 container 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.590
 it will give a touch of 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.980
 finesse that my future path sparkling the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.980
 high class 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.500
 now we will tackle the borax 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.640
 again firstly I put 25 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.510
 milliliters of water in the container 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.550
 smell and then I add 30 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.570
 g of borax you see that it's not 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.670
 the same dosage as for the ball 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.590
 bouncy and it's going to change the game 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.930
 labat will therefore be more compact is 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.970
 slightly harder once this mixture 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.500
 borax water carried I'm going to mix the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.830
 solution to dissolve a maximum of 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.120
 borax it seems to me not bad I come 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.530
 then naturally to this is the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.450
 borax solution in the solution of 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.400
 glue and very quickly I start to 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.900
 to mix I will mix quickly and 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.580
 for a good five minutes for a 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.950
 maximum code solutions in between 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.420
 contact with the mud racks what will 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.810
 give a bigger ball so more 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.810
 resistant 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.990
 once all the mixing done I 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.430
 will take out the dough from the container for the 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.320
 knead by hand so that everyone 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.550
 the excess glue and water parts so 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.030
 that I only have the dough left between 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.350
 hands it's great I'm going 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 now drop the dough on the top 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.260
 of a drink and you will see the magic 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.510
 of this paste that will take itself 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.440
 the shape of the glass little by little let 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.980
 do it you have time to go 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.090
 eat a cost which is to come back in 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.860
 falling in the green that way 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.210
 you're not going to trap a maximum of air 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.720
 in the green which will give us 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.720
 beautiful 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.440
 excellent 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.100
