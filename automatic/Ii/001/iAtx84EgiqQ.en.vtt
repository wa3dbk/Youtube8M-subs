00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.760 
too you can sign like some off right
there<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.700> these<00:01:51.110> as<00:01:52.110> either<00:01:52.560> ones

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770

that I tried as well these are kind of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.870 
that I tried as well these are kind of
chunky<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.740> think<00:01:58.979> these<00:01:59.189> will<00:01:59.460> work

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
chunky so I don't think these will work

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.149 
chunky so I don't think these will work
unless<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.159> chop<00:02:02.159> down<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.759> eyeshadow

unless you like chop down the eyeshadow

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.510 
unless you like chop down the eyeshadow

let's see that maybe I would need to put
two<00:04:42.670> coats<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:43.120> this<00:04:43.360> but<00:04:45.330> it's<00:04:46.330> actually<00:04:46.690> a

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
two coats for this but it's actually a

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.900 
two coats for this but it's actually a
very<00:04:46.930> pretty<00:04:47.110> color<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.740> have<00:04:48.520> not<00:04:48.700> done<00:04:48.850> this

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
very pretty color I have not done this
