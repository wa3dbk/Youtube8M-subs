I<00:04:13.129> think<00:04:13.969> it's<00:04:14.120> pretty<00:04:14.329> cool<00:04:14.539> that<00:04:14.599> they<00:04:14.840> tied

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
I think it's pretty cool that they tied

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.170 
I think it's pretty cool that they tied
something<00:04:15.530> into<00:04:15.889> unlocking<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.699> ability<00:04:17.150> I

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
something into unlocking the ability I

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.449 
something into unlocking the ability I
wish<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.659> would<00:04:17.810> have<00:04:17.930> been<00:04:18.139> max<00:04:19.099> level

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
wish it would have been max level

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.979 
wish it would have been max level
because<00:04:20.000> then<00:04:20.239> I'd<00:04:20.419> be<00:04:20.599> able<00:04:20.719> to<00:04:20.810> participate

because then I'd be able to participate

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.140 
because then I'd be able to participate
but<00:04:22.139> with<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.310> fact<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:23.639> I<00:04:23.789> need<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:23.940> do<00:04:24.120> this
