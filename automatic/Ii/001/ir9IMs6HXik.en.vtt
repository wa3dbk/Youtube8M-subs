they don't grip too much but I found

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
third quality didn't appear to be the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.100 
third quality didn't appear to be the
best<00:01:02.309> mainly<00:01:03.239> due<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.539> fact<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> most

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
best mainly due to the fact that most

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.679 
best mainly due to the fact that most
materials<00:01:04.769> used<00:01:05.040> are<00:01:05.220> plastic<00:01:05.760> although<00:01:06.360> they

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
materials used are plastic although they

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.320 
materials used are plastic although they
didn't<00:01:06.990> feel<00:01:07.140> cheap<00:01:07.439> by<00:01:07.619> any<00:01:07.770> means<00:01:08.119> they<00:01:09.119> did

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
didn't feel cheap by any means they did

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240 
didn't feel cheap by any means they did
feel<00:01:09.570> slightly<00:01:09.840> flimsy<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.979> probably

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
feel slightly flimsy and can probably

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710 
feel slightly flimsy and can probably
benefit<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.880> strip<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> metal<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
benefit from a strip of metal in the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.260 
benefit from a strip of metal in the
headband<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.260> make<00:01:13.409> them<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.619> bit<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:13.770> durable

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
headband to make them a bit more durable

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
headband to make them a bit more durable
as<00:01:15.270> such<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:15.810> I'd<00:01:16.140> be<00:01:16.259> slightly

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
as such I think I'd be slightly

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
as such I think I'd be slightly
concerned<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.220> how<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.640> fare<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.299> used

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
concerned about how they fare if used

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.710 
concerned about how they fare if used
heavily<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:20.070> fixtures<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:20.820> reasonable<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
heavily the fixtures are reasonable and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.260 
heavily the fixtures are reasonable and
the<00:01:21.840> ear<00:01:21.990> cushions<00:01:22.409> felt<00:01:22.680> quite<00:01:22.890> luxurious

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the ear cushions felt quite luxurious

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.010 
the ear cushions felt quite luxurious
even<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.360> these<00:01:24.509> aren't<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> strongest

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
even if these aren't the strongest

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.700 
even if these aren't the strongest
headphones<00:01:25.560> I've<00:01:25.710> ever<00:01:25.860> seen<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.930> K<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.470> off

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to equality being taken flat meaning

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.520 
to equality being taken flat meaning
minimal<00:01:32.220> tangling<00:01:32.780> another<00:01:33.780> bonus<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
minimal tangling another bonus is the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.249 
minimal tangling another bonus is the
length<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> cables<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.579> 1.2<00:01:36.060> meters<00:01:36.630> which

length of the cables at 1.2 meters which

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.050 
length of the cables at 1.2 meters which
has<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:37.560> been<00:01:37.770> long<00:01:37.950> enough<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.460> most<00:01:38.579> uses

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
has more been long enough for most uses

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
has more been long enough for most uses
they're<00:01:39.509> not<00:01:39.659> too<00:01:39.930> long<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> get<00:01:40.409> caught<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.890> or

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they're not too long to get caught up or

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
they're not too long to get caught up or

also<00:01:48.360> liked<00:01:48.689> how<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.930> wiring<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.380> reinforced

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
also liked how the wiring was reinforced

also liked how the wiring was reinforced
