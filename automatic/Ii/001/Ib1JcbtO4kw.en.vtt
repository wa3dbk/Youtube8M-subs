00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.400 

now<00:00:09.179> let's<00:00:09.389> take<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.599> look<00:00:09.809> at<00:00:09.929> aperture

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
now let's take a look at aperture

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.200 
now let's take a look at aperture
priority<00:00:10.650> which<00:00:11.099> means<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.910> you're<00:00:12.059> going

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
priority which means that you're going

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.850 
priority which means that you're going
to<00:00:12.269> set<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> aperture<00:00:12.900> or<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> size<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
to set the aperture or the size of that

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.919 
to set the aperture or the size of that
hole<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.519> lets<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.880> light<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.570> bigger<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
hole that lets in light the bigger the

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.750 
hole that lets in light the bigger the
hole<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.260> smaller<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.830> aperture<00:00:17.130> number<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
hole the smaller the aperture number the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
hole the smaller the aperture number the
less<00:00:17.940> depth<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.480> field<00:00:18.779> but<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> more<00:00:19.439> light

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
less depth of field but the more light

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.950 
less depth of field but the more light
the<00:00:20.189> smaller<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.970> hole<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.570> depth<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
the smaller the hole the more depth of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.750 
the smaller the hole the more depth of
field<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.380> less<00:00:22.590> light<00:00:22.859> okay<00:00:23.369> let's<00:00:23.580> take<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
field the less light okay let's take a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.950 
field the less light okay let's take a
look<00:00:23.850> at<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.150> right<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:24.930> of

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
look at that right now in the back of

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.470 
look at that right now in the back of
the<00:00:25.170> camera<00:00:25.849> what<00:00:26.849> we're<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.330> is

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the camera what we're going to do is

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.759 
the camera what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:27.599> going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.779> hit<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> display<00:00:28.380> screen

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
we're going to hit the display screen

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
we're going to hit the display screen
and<00:00:29.010> you're<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> notice<00:00:30.060> as<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.449> turn<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and you're going to notice as I turn the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.389 
and you're going to notice as I turn the
dial<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> top<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> camera<00:00:32.189> already

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
dial on the top of the camera already

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.209 
dial on the top of the camera already
set<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> AV<00:00:33.480> mode<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.290> have<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.649> set<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
set to the AV mode you have your set of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
set to the AV mode you have your set of
the<00:00:35.610> lowest<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> focal<00:00:36.840> length<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> 5.6

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the lowest at this focal length is 5.6

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.000 
the lowest at this focal length is 5.6
and<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.969> highest<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.860> 36

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and the highest is 36

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.430 
and the highest is 36
but<00:00:41.670> you'll<00:00:41.850> notice<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.780> meter<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but you'll notice the meter in the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.590 
but you'll notice the meter in the
middle<00:00:43.680> stays<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> same<00:00:44.160> that's<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.420> as

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
middle stays the same that's because as

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.490 
middle stays the same that's because as
I<00:00:45.629> turn<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:47.129> aperture<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.600> compensating

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I turn the aperture it's compensating

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.810 
I turn the aperture it's compensating
you<00:00:49.590> don't<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> until<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> hold<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you don't see that until you hold the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
you don't see that until you hold the
shutter<00:00:51.030> button<00:00:51.360> halfway<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.199> notice

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
shutter button halfway down and notice

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.729 
shutter button halfway down and notice
as<00:00:53.039> I'm<00:00:53.219> turning<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:54.329> dial<00:00:54.660> creating<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
as I'm turning the dial creating the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.420 
as I'm turning the dial creating the
different<00:00:55.890> apertures<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.660> then

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
different apertures it is then

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.819 
different apertures it is then
compensating<00:00:59.430> right<00:00:59.579> here<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.930> giving<00:01:01.739> us

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
compensating right here and giving us

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.130 
compensating right here and giving us
different<00:01:02.160> shutter<00:01:02.309> speeds<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:03.960> going

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
different shutter speeds so we're going

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.250 
different shutter speeds so we're going
to<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:07.369> 7.1<00:01:08.369> aperture<00:01:09.140> 100th<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
to go at a 7.1 aperture 100th the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
to go at a 7.1 aperture 100th the
shutter<00:01:10.500> speed<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> picture<00:01:11.310> ready

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
shutter speed just take a picture ready

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.149 
shutter speed just take a picture ready
smile<00:01:11.939> there<00:01:12.150> Kayla<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.750> gray<00:01:13.049> okay<00:01:13.950> she

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
smile there Kayla that's gray okay she

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
smile there Kayla that's gray okay she
leaned<00:01:14.369> her<00:01:14.430> head<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:14.850> fantastic<00:01:15.420> but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
leaned her head that's fantastic but

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.390 
leaned her head that's fantastic but
let's<00:01:16.049> suppose<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.860> wanted<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
let's suppose that we wanted the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.520 
let's suppose that we wanted the
background<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.330> out-of-focus<00:01:18.810> Kayla

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
background really out-of-focus Kayla

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200 
background really out-of-focus Kayla
would<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.920> stand<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.400> over<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.119> I'm

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
would you stand up over there and I'm

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.789 
would you stand up over there and I'm
going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.390> sort<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.140> trick<00:01:22.350> Trevor<00:01:22.650> our

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
going to sort of trick Trevor our

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.980 
going to sort of trick Trevor our
cameraman<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.479> position

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
cameraman into going in this position

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.719 
cameraman into going in this position
we're<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.830> where<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.490> in

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
we're going to go where it's really in

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.340 
we're going to go where it's really in
the<00:01:26.850> distance<00:01:27.299> way<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> backgrounds<00:01:28.259> out

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the distance way in the backgrounds out

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.230 
the distance way in the backgrounds out
of<00:01:28.470> focus<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.070> I'm<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.579> zoom<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.970> really

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
of focus and I'm going to zoom in really

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
of focus and I'm going to zoom in really
far<00:01:30.659> okay<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.430> background<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:32.970> really

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
far okay and the background is really

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.319 
far okay and the background is really
far<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> distance<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> want

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
far in the distance so to do that I want

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
far in the distance so to do that I want
to<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> lowest<00:01:36.930> shutter<00:01:37.650> speed<00:01:38.009> we're

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
to get the lowest shutter speed we're

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.770 
to get the lowest shutter speed we're
going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> take<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> minute<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.210> reposition

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
going to take a minute and reposition

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.679 
going to take a minute and reposition
the<00:01:39.900> back<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> camera<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> show<00:01:40.950> Trevor

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
the back of the camera to show Trevor

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.440 
the back of the camera to show Trevor
now<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.899> particular<00:01:43.020> lens<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.970> f-stop<00:01:44.970> three

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
now this particular lens is f-stop three

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
now this particular lens is f-stop three
five<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:46.020> five<00:01:46.200> six<00:01:46.470> those<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.890> lowest<00:01:47.070> F

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
five two five six those are the lowest F

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.420 
five two five six those are the lowest F

bring it all the way down to three five

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420 
bring it all the way down to three five

because I'm in the open position as i
zoom<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.000> okay<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> normally<00:01:55.649> let

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
zoom in okay it's going to normally let

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.760 
zoom in okay it's going to normally let
less<00:01:56.070> light<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> with<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.770> different

less light in and with the different
lens<00:01:59.040> elements<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.579> there<00:01:59.729> it's<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
lens elements in there it's going to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.359 
lens elements in there it's going to
bring<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> five<00:02:00.869> six<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.890> you're<00:02:02.100> three

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
bring it to five six so you're three

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
bring it to five six so you're three
five<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> way<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.600> five<00:02:03.869> six<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:05.040> at

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
five all the way to five six we're at

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.350 
five all the way to five six we're at
the<00:02:05.250> minimum<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.790> we're<00:02:05.939> going<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.119> get<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the minimum so we're going to get the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.059 
the minimum so we're going to get the
minimum<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.840> five<00:02:07.079> six<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:07.710> okay

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
minimum of five six but that's okay

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.589 
minimum of five six but that's okay
because<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> background<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.239> way<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
because the background is way in the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
because the background is way in the
distance<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.229> I'm<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.800> focus<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.430> her

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
distance and I'm going to focus on her

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.790 
distance and I'm going to focus on her
there<00:02:12.450> we<00:02:12.599> go<00:02:12.750> Kayla<00:02:13.080> give<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.319> nice

there we go Kayla give it's nice
all<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.980> backgrounds<00:02:14.430> should<00:02:14.580> go<00:02:14.700> out<00:02:14.850> of

to put it in manual focus we're zoomed

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.500 
to put it in manual focus we're zoomed
in<00:02:49.290> all<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> way<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.820> I'm<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.270> to<00:02:51.300> adjust

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
in all the way and I'm going to adjust

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.510 
in all the way and I'm going to adjust

ready give me a smile there we go

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.170 
ready give me a smile there we go
and<00:02:53.960> the<00:02:54.960> background<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:55.980> focus<00:02:56.220> so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
and the background see is in focus so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.400 
and the background see is in focus so
you<00:02:57.210> have<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.570> difference<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.200> want<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
background in focus out-of-focus you

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.030 
background in focus out-of-focus you
could<00:03:00.030> use<00:03:00.180> aperture<00:03:00.480> priority<00:03:00.840> all<00:03:01.830> right<00:03:01.950> we

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
could use aperture priority all right we

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.170 
could use aperture priority all right we
have<00:03:02.160> Kayla<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.670> screen<00:03:02.910> we're<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.060> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
have Kayla in the screen we're going to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.060 
have Kayla in the screen we're going to
have<00:03:03.360> her<00:03:03.540> running<00:03:03.990> toward<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.410> camera<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.010> to

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
have her running toward the camera so to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.830 
have her running toward the camera so to
have<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> running<00:03:05.490> toward<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> camera<00:03:06.090> we<00:03:06.630> want

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
have a running toward the camera we want

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.720 
have a running toward the camera we want
a<00:03:06.900> higher<00:03:07.080> shutter<00:03:07.440> speed<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.430> we're<00:03:08.550> going<00:03:08.640> to

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
a higher shutter speed so we're going to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.480 
a higher shutter speed so we're going to
turn<00:03:08.880> our<00:03:09.060> shutter<00:03:09.330> speed<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.990> at<00:03:10.980> least<00:03:11.220> one

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
turn our shutter speed to at least one

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.860 
turn our shutter speed to at least one
hundred<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.880> sixtieth<00:03:12.270> let's<00:03:12.540> make<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.780> two

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
hundred and sixtieth let's make it two

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.860 
hundred and sixtieth let's make it two
hundredth<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.290> second<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:14.210> 9.0<00:03:15.210> f-stop

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
hundredth of a second and 9.0 f-stop

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.560 
hundredth of a second and 9.0 f-stop
which<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.320> really<00:03:16.770> good<00:03:17.010> because<00:03:17.790> she's<00:03:18.420> going

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
which is really good because she's going

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.610 
which is really good because she's going
to<00:03:18.630> be<00:03:18.690> running<00:03:18.870> toward<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.200> camera<00:03:19.380> I'm

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
to be running toward the camera I'm

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.290 
to be running toward the camera I'm
going<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.830> be<00:03:19.890> using<00:03:20.040> manual<00:03:20.760> focus<00:03:21.180> we're

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
going to be using manual focus we're

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.390 
going to be using manual focus we're
going<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.480> zoom<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:21.810> almost<00:03:22.170> all<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.500> way<00:03:22.620> free
