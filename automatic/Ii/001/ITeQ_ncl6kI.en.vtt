00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.920 
which is something that I think you will
I<00:01:26.189> think<00:01:26.520> you'll<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.909> for<00:01:27.119> both<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.720> one

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
I think you'll have one for both and one

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.719 
I think you'll have one for both and one
thing<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.170> does<00:01:28.470> indicate<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.250> if<00:01:29.549> we

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
thing that does indicate this is if we

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.280 
thing that does indicate this is if we
zoom<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> image<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.720> can<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
zoom in on the image you can see the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.899 
zoom in on the image you can see the
file<00:01:31.470> name<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> demon<00:01:32.310> model<00:01:32.579> that's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
file name and the demon model that's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
file name and the demon model that's
labeled<00:01:33.210> phinbella<00:01:33.750> underscore<00:01:34.380> 02<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
labeled phinbella underscore 02 so

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
labeled phinbella underscore 02 so
chances<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.270> also<00:01:36.420> another<00:01:36.689> clip

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
chances are there was also another clip

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.560 
chances are there was also another clip
name<00:01:37.350> Finbar<00:01:37.860> underscore<00:01:38.430> 01<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.270> show<00:01:39.450> off

its model without the demon pins anyway

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.639 
its model without the demon pins anyway
that's<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.390> speculation<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.439> seem

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that's just speculation but it does seem

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.170 
that's just speculation but it does seem
to<00:01:43.710> make<00:01:43.890> sense<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> limb<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.970> what<00:01:45.119> you

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
to make sense so a limb know what you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
to make sense so a limb know what you
think<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> rest<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> this<00:01:46.439> week
