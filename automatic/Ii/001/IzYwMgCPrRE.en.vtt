as<00:05:40.090> you<00:05:40.270> can<00:05:40.390> see<00:05:40.600> look<00:05:40.780> at<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.020> fluid

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
as you can see look at the fluid

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.610 
as you can see look at the fluid
movements<00:05:41.980> I<00:05:42.690> mean<00:05:43.690> that<00:05:43.810> that's<00:05:44.080> almost<00:05:44.350> a

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
movements I mean that that's almost a

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.830 
movements I mean that that's almost a
honeycomb<00:05:45.070> interface<00:05:45.700> there<00:05:46.030> and<00:05:46.270> I'm<00:05:46.450> really

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
honeycomb interface there and I'm really

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.060 
honeycomb interface there and I'm really
excited<00:05:46.930> when<00:05:47.200> you<00:05:47.410> come<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.650> come<00:05:47.770> out<00:05:47.920> and

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
excited when you come to come out and

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.710 
excited when you come to come out and
this<00:05:48.790> is<00:05:48.940> basically<00:05:49.240> as<00:05:49.390> close<00:05:49.540> as<00:05:49.630> you're

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
this is basically as close as you're

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.860 
this is basically as close as you're
going<00:05:49.810> to<00:05:49.870> get<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.170> it<00:05:50.290> until<00:05:50.410> it<00:05:51.010> comes<00:05:51.190> out

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
going to get to it until it comes out
