it's<00:00:52.719> a<00:00:52.870> 540<00:00:53.710> PTO<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:55.210> could<00:00:55.389> be<00:00:55.510> switchable

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
it's a 540 PTO it could be switchable

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.559 
it's a 540 PTO it could be switchable
between<00:00:56.079> live<00:00:56.710> and<00:00:56.739> ground<00:00:57.519> either<00:00:57.909> way<00:00:58.179> it

between live and ground either way it
works<00:00:58.809> great<00:00:59.139> and<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:01.059> these<00:01:01.420> tractors<00:01:01.870> did

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
works great and this these tractors did

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.100 
works great and this these tractors did
come<00:01:02.440> with<00:01:02.859> ports<00:01:03.309> to<00:01:04.150> connect<00:01:04.570> auxiliary

hydraulics this one does not have the
connections<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.540> just<00:01:07.780> has<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.140> ports<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
connections on it just has the ports so

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.250

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
have not removed the starter to find out

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.270 
have not removed the starter to find out

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
most likely it's just a set of brushes

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.300 
most likely it's just a set of brushes
