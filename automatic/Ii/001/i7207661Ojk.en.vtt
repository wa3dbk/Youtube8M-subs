Rick traction
it<00:03:58.160> just<00:03:58.340> feels<00:03:58.520> super<00:03:58.910> planted<00:03:59.330> in<00:03:59.420> super

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
it just feels super planted in super

it just feels super planted in super

more<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.850> loose<00:04:02.030> cannon<00:04:02.270> I<00:04:03.260> know<00:04:03.920> that's<00:04:04.160> not

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
more of a loose cannon I know that's not

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.950 
more of a loose cannon I know that's not
really<00:04:04.520> saying<00:04:04.730> much<00:04:04.820> be<00:04:05.060> considering<00:04:05.570> fours

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
really saying much be considering fours

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.500 
really saying much be considering fours
and<00:04:06.110> fives<00:04:06.140> handling<00:04:07.040> system<00:04:07.340> has<00:04:07.940> everyone's

and fives handling system has everyone's

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.620 
and fives handling system has everyone's
front<00:04:08.720> end<00:04:08.810> kind<00:04:08.960> of<00:04:09.050> like<00:04:09.200> loose<00:04:09.350> cannons<00:04:09.680> but

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
front end kind of like loose cannons but

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.880 
front end kind of like loose cannons but
you<00:04:11.630> know<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.870> front<00:04:12.110> end<00:04:12.230> is<00:04:12.350> kind<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.680> loose

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
you know the front end is kind of loose

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.120 
you know the front end is kind of loose
and<00:04:13.190> it's<00:04:13.340> kind<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.820> unpredictable<00:04:14.890> but<00:04:15.890> I

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
and it's kind of unpredictable but I

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.590 
and it's kind of unpredictable but I
feel<00:04:16.580> like<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.880> could<00:04:17.030> be<00:04:17.090> fixed<00:04:17.420> just<00:04:17.450> by

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
feel like that could be fixed just by

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.000 
feel like that could be fixed just by
making<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.230> front<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.500> that<00:04:18.560> tires<00:04:18.860> a<00:04:18.950> little

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
making the front of that tires a little

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.699 
making the front of that tires a little
bit<00:04:19.220> wider<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:19.670> when<00:04:20.360> I<00:04:20.390> was<00:04:20.600> tuning<00:04:20.959> this<00:04:21.110> the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
bit wider and when I was tuning this the

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.350 
bit wider and when I was tuning this the
other<00:04:21.920> night<00:04:22.130> I<00:04:22.340> just<00:04:22.700> wanted<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.060> see<00:04:23.180> if<00:04:23.270> I

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
other night I just wanted to see if I

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
other night I just wanted to see if I
can<00:04:23.510> get<00:04:23.600> them<00:04:23.720> all<00:04:23.840> out<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.140> way<00:04:24.260> as

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
can get them all out of the way as

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.930 
can get them all out of the way as
quickly<00:04:24.590> as<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.860> could<00:04:24.920> so<00:04:25.340> maybe<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.670> missed

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
quickly as I could so maybe I missed

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.120 
quickly as I could so maybe I missed
something<00:04:26.170> and<00:04:27.170> I<00:04:27.260> didn't<00:04:27.500> really<00:04:27.620> feel<00:04:27.740> it<00:04:27.950> on

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
something and I didn't really feel it on

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.880 
something and I didn't really feel it on
the<00:04:28.220> track<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.430> was<00:04:28.640> testing<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.440> however<00:04:30.440> it

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
the track I was testing it on however it

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.830 
the track I was testing it on however it
doesn't<00:04:31.520> feel<00:04:31.640> as<00:04:31.700> slow<00:04:32.120> as<00:04:32.330> I<00:04:32.420> was<00:04:32.540> expecting

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
doesn't feel as slow as I was expecting

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.080 
doesn't feel as slow as I was expecting
out<00:04:33.110> slow<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:33.560> transitions<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:34.280> transitions

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
out slow on transitions it transitions

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.820 
out slow on transitions it transitions
fairly<00:04:35.660> quickly<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.230> still<00:04:36.470> within<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
fairly quickly but still within the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.200 
fairly quickly but still within the
realms<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.250> not<00:04:37.490> scary<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:39.160> you<00:04:40.160> know<00:04:40.310> for<00:04:41.120> the

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
realms of not scary and you know for the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.080 
realms of not scary and you know for the
most<00:04:41.360> part<00:04:41.480> reminds<00:04:41.930> me<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> lot<00:04:42.290> of<00:04:42.440> my<00:04:43.090> Cobra

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
most part reminds me a lot of my Cobra

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.500 
most part reminds me a lot of my Cobra
are<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:44.600> Forza<00:04:45.470> 4<00:04:45.760> of<00:04:46.760> course<00:04:46.970> again<00:04:47.270> that's

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
are in Forza 4 of course again that's

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.560 
are in Forza 4 of course again that's
not<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.930> same<00:04:48.140> thing<00:04:48.440> but<00:04:49.240> this<00:04:50.240> is<00:04:50.300> three

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
not the same thing but this is three

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.780 
not the same thing but this is three
different<00:04:50.900> cars<00:04:51.080> now<00:04:51.350> we're<00:04:51.620> tuned<00:04:52.340> properly

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
different cars now we're tuned properly

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.460 
different cars now we're tuned properly
they<00:04:52.910> feel<00:04:53.210> almost<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.780> same<00:04:53.960> as<00:04:54.200> they<00:04:54.320> did

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
they feel almost the same as they did

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.250 
they feel almost the same as they did
before<00:04:54.790> so<00:04:55.790> I<00:04:56.090> that's<00:04:56.660> kind<00:04:57.020> of<00:04:57.080> just

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
before so I that's kind of just

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.770 
before so I that's kind of just
solidifying<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.950> me<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.280> the<00:04:58.430> tuning<00:04:58.850> and

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
solidifying to me that the tuning and

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.510 
solidifying to me that the tuning and
the<00:04:59.810> way<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.050> cars<00:05:00.260> are<00:05:00.410> set<00:05:00.590> up<00:05:00.710> in<00:05:01.040> this<00:05:01.280> game

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
the way the cars are set up in this game

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.060 
the way the cars are set up in this game
is<00:05:02.360> just<00:05:02.800> it<00:05:03.800> makes<00:05:04.040> sense<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:04.670> talk<00:05:04.820> exact<00:05:06.070> but

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
is just it makes sense to talk exact but

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.510 
is just it makes sense to talk exact but
yeah<00:05:07.990> sounds<00:05:08.990> good<00:05:09.110> looks<00:05:09.440> good<00:05:09.740> not<00:05:10.340> in<00:05:10.460> this

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
yeah sounds good looks good not in this

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.570 
yeah sounds good looks good not in this
color<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:10.850> gotta<00:05:11.090> change<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.420> color<00:05:11.630> but<00:05:12.580> if

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
color I gotta change the color but if

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.710 
color I gotta change the color but if
anyone<00:05:13.880> knows<00:05:13.970> how<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.150> get<00:05:14.240> rid<00:05:14.360> of<00:05:14.420> this<00:05:14.510> game

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
anyone knows how to get rid of this game

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.150 
anyone knows how to get rid of this game
clip<00:05:15.410> please<00:05:15.680> let<00:05:15.890> me<00:05:15.980> know<00:05:16.070> in<00:05:16.130> the

comments<00:05:16.580> but<00:05:17.300> definitely<00:05:17.990> a<00:05:18.020> well<00:05:18.380> planted

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
comments but definitely a well planted

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.830 
comments but definitely a well planted
car<00:05:19.070> it's<00:05:19.850> fast<00:05:20.120> enough<00:05:20.420> I<00:05:20.510> don't<00:05:20.570> think<00:05:20.690> I'm

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
car it's fast enough I don't think I'm

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.670 
car it's fast enough I don't think I'm
running<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.140> much<00:05:21.320> power

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
running that much power

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.170 
running that much power
I<00:05:21.830> got<00:05:21.980> twin<00:05:22.190> turbos<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:22.580> that's<00:05:22.850> basically

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
I got twin turbos but that's basically

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.180 
I got twin turbos but that's basically
just<00:05:23.270> because<00:05:23.870> I<00:05:23.930> wanted<00:05:24.350> twin<00:05:24.590> turbos<00:05:24.950> not

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
just because I wanted twin turbos not

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.300 
just because I wanted twin turbos not
because<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.430> needed<00:05:25.640> the<00:05:25.730> power<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:28.040> I<00:05:28.130> said

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
because I needed the power like I said

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.770 
because I needed the power like I said
the<00:05:28.430> rears<00:05:28.610> really<00:05:29.000> planted<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:29.540> you're<00:05:29.690> gonna

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
the rears really planted so you're gonna

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.540 
the rears really planted so you're gonna
see<00:05:29.930> your<00:05:30.050> year<00:05:30.230> I<00:05:30.260> almost<00:05:30.560> go<00:05:30.800> I<00:05:30.980> think<00:05:31.250> a<00:05:31.310> full

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
see your year I almost go I think a full

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.050 
see your year I almost go I think a full
90<00:05:31.850> degrees<00:05:32.120> in<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.450> next<00:05:32.660> turn<00:05:34.060> it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
90 degrees in the next turn it

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.400 
90 degrees in the next turn it
definitely<00:05:35.390> didn't<00:05:35.570> mean<00:05:35.690> to<00:05:35.780> do<00:05:35.930> that<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.320> was

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
definitely didn't mean to do that it was
