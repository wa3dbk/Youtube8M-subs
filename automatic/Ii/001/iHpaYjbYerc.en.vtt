00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.520
 hello guys and girls from the internet I am 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.799
 days and today as you can see 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.930
 I'm recording inside my office and 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.660
 that's because I'm about to leave 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.590
 work and as soon as you leave work 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.410
 I'm going to dinner and I'm going to dinner 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.570
 of my favorite Korean meals in one 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.000
 of my favorite restaurants in one of 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.250
 my favorite neighborhoods of Seoul then 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.169
 I said since I'm going to do several 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.940
 things that I like because I do not 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.820
 take them with me the food that I'm going to 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.950
 eating is called mole here and probably 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.470
 the name is already known to them because 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.900
 It is a very popular food and generally 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.480
 can be found in the streets is 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.390
 swift food or street food if not 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.370
 you know this because they are being in 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.790
 English are called rice skate or 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.360
 pieces of rice cakes and come 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.400
 with a red and spicy sauce but the 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.500
 reason why I like to eat in this 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.540
 restaurant that I'm going to visit today is 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.720
 because this restaurant gives you the 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.190
 chance that you will put what 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.220
 I want to expose you 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.770
 if you want it with cheese with meat 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.140
 noodles you put what you want 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.510
 then that to me does it very very 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.760
 delicious the restaurant is in 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.790

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.640
 close to the main palace and also very 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.190
 near tucson janukovich the name of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.260
 this restaurant is box and tonada and the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.190
 name is a little interesting 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.540
 moc comes from the verb motta to eat sui 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:45.100
 the verb appointment rest gift 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.230
 money and nothing at all to leave or leave 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.180
 then the name of this restaurant 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.020
 basically it's saying that they get to 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.390
