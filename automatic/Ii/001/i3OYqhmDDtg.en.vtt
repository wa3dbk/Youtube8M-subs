like<00:00:22.550> big<00:00:23.550> bolt<00:00:23.789> goes<00:00:24.029> through<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.590> hub

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
like big bolt goes through the the hub

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.890 
like big bolt goes through the the hub
connect<00:00:26.550> there's<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.880> locking<00:00:27.510> nut<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:27.779> the
