you and one of the dangerous things is

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.930 
you and one of the dangerous things is
the<00:00:52.210> reef<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.800> substrate<00:00:54.370> underneath<00:00:54.520> the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
the reef the substrate underneath the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.240 
the reef the substrate underneath the
wave<00:00:55.090> here<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:56.610> reef<00:00:57.610> rock<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.480> coral<00:00:58.960> reef<00:00:59.350> so

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
wave here is reef rock and coral reef so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.760 
wave here is reef rock and coral reef so
we<00:01:00.400> have<00:01:00.580> an<00:01:01.300> element<00:01:01.780> de<00:01:01.989> tar<00:01:02.260> so<00:01:02.559> when<00:01:02.680> you

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
we have an element de tar so when you

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.490 
we have an element de tar so when you
fall<00:01:03.010> on<00:01:03.220> this<00:01:03.340> reef<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.690> get<00:01:04.869> scratched<00:01:05.229> up

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
fall on this reef you get scratched up

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.700 
fall on this reef you get scratched up
there<00:01:05.740> sea<00:01:05.979> urchins<00:01:06.460> shells<00:01:07.170> coral<00:01:08.170> coralline

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
there sea urchins shells coral coralline

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.140 
there sea urchins shells coral coralline
algae<00:01:08.740> seaweed<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:11.700> lot<00:01:12.700> of<00:01:12.729> people<00:01:13.030> get

algae seaweed and a lot of people get

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.510 
algae seaweed and a lot of people get
pretty<00:01:13.360> cut<00:01:13.630> up<00:01:13.780> here<00:01:13.930> but<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.040> beauty<00:01:15.490> of

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
pretty cut up here but the beauty of

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.700 
pretty cut up here but the beauty of
this<00:01:15.790> for<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.210> intermediate<00:01:16.509> event<00:01:17.170> surfer

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
this for the intermediate event surfer

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.460 
this for the intermediate event surfer
is<00:01:17.920> it<00:01:18.580> provides<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.509> consistency<00:01:20.440> of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
is it provides a consistency of

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.620 
is it provides a consistency of
substrate<00:01:21.040> that<00:01:21.250> doesn't<00:01:21.640> change<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.420> move

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
substrate that doesn't change and move

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.469 
substrate that doesn't change and move
so<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.800> when<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.250> waves<00:01:24.460> come<00:01:24.640> in<00:01:24.910> they<00:01:25.450> have

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
so that when the waves come in they have

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
so that when the waves come in they have
similar<00:01:26.170> shapes<00:01:26.500> well<00:01:26.890> after<00:01:27.250> swell<00:01:27.490> as

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
similar shapes well after swell as

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840 
similar shapes well after swell as
opposed<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.050> a<00:01:29.170> beach<00:01:29.470> break<00:01:29.800> where<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.520> sand

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
opposed to a beach break where the sand

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
opposed to a beach break where the sand
can<00:01:31.180> shift<00:01:31.509> with<00:01:31.869> currents<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.500> swell

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
can shift with currents and swell

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:49.780 
can shift with currents and swell
creating<00:01:33.880> different<00:01:34.270> pieces
