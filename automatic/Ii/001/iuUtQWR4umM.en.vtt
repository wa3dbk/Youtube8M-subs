00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
see the play but knowing that that

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.890 
when they say you're gonna come home I
thought<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.769> think<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.640> better<00:01:05.790> wait<00:01:06.150> before<00:01:06.750> we

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
thought I think we better wait before we

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
thought I think we better wait before we
tell<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.650> kids<00:01:07.829> before<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.400> tell<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.759> daughter

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.789 
and so then things just started to align
perfectly<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.970> I<00:01:15.259> waited<00:01:16.259> longer<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> longer

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
