00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
so I'll show you which combinations we

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.590 
so I'll show you which combinations we
will<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.170> boosting<00:01:08.240> their<00:01:09.240> sugar

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
will be boosting their sugar

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.700 
will be boosting their sugar
combinations<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:11.960> did<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> silver<00:01:13.350> night<00:01:13.680> I

combinations I did the silver night I
got<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.280> three<00:01:14.640> thousand<00:01:15.210> which<00:01:15.420> isn't

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
got about three thousand which isn't

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.110 
got about three thousand which isn't
that<00:01:15.750> impressive

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
that impressive

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.730 
that impressive
we'll<00:01:18.120> be<00:01:18.210> boosting<00:01:18.600> small<00:01:18.870> arms<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:20.720> also

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
we'll be boosting small arms and also

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
we'll be boosting small arms and also
there's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:23.630> pin<00:01:24.630> point<00:01:25.490> okay<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.570> also<00:01:28.470> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
there's a pin point okay and also you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.320 
there's a pin point okay and also you
don't<00:01:28.800> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.250> boost<00:01:29.430> pin<00:01:29.700> point<00:01:29.940> into<00:01:30.090> max

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
don't want to boost pin point into max

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.090 
don't want to boost pin point into max
all<00:01:30.810> right<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.229> gonna<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.680> ahead<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.950> tell

you because I'll also be making a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.280 
you because I'll also be making a
precisely<00:01:34.970> boosting<00:01:35.970> method<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:36.509> I'll<00:01:37.140> be

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
precisely boosting method and I'll be

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.180 
precisely boosting method and I'll be
head<00:01:37.470> shots<00:01:37.710> too

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
head shots too

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
okay so show you how to set this up now

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
okay so show you how to set this up now
you<00:01:47.450> got<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:49.680> nightfall<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:51.150> mission

you got to do a nightfall on mission
start<00:01:52.050> and<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.550> is<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:54.180> easy<00:01:55.310> boosting

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
start and this is a very easy boosting

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.889 
start and this is a very easy boosting
method<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> set<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:58.009> follow<00:01:59.009> this<00:01:59.190> last<00:01:59.460> night

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
method to set up follow this last night

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.870 
method to set up follow this last night
difficulty<00:02:00.899> normal<00:02:01.319> scoring<00:02:02.069> free-for-all

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
difficulty normal scoring free-for-all

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.639 
difficulty normal scoring free-for-all
so<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.960> headshots<00:02:04.410> and

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
so you can see your headshots and

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.919 
so you can see your headshots and
everything<00:02:05.630> okay

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.050 

and<00:02:11.409> this<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.799> a<00:02:11.829> little<00:02:12.189> different<00:02:12.730> than<00:02:12.939> all

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and this is a little different than all

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.699 
and this is a little different than all
the<00:02:13.090> other<00:02:13.390> ones<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.930> doesn't<00:02:14.260> involve<00:02:14.500> a

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
the other ones it doesn't involve a

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.610 
the other ones it doesn't involve a
grenade<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.870> think<00:02:16.870> I'm<00:02:16.959> going<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.260> be<00:02:17.470> doing

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
grenade I think I'm going to be doing

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.339 
grenade I think I'm going to be doing
stuff<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.459> does<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.780> don't<00:02:19.989> involve

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
stuff that does that don't involve

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.440 
stuff that does that don't involve
grenades<00:02:20.860> now<00:02:21.129> maybe

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.150 

because<00:02:27.140> with<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.440> grenade<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.890> kind<00:02:28.100> of

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
because with the grenade you kind of

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.690 
because with the grenade you kind of
need<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> delayed<00:02:29.950> explosion<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.250> grenade

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
need a delayed explosion like a grenade

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.880 
need a delayed explosion like a grenade
or<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.060> target<00:02:32.510> designator<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.380> do<00:02:33.530> it<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
or a target designator to do it and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.720 
or a target designator to do it and
that's<00:02:34.040> not<00:02:34.310> very

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
that's not very

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.280 
that's not very
oh<00:02:34.760> she<00:02:35.470> didn't<00:02:36.470> mean<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.680> do<00:02:36.800> that<00:02:38.830> okay

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
oh she didn't mean to do that okay
