then we'll take off and climb yeah and
start<00:00:45.199> climbing<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.830> next<00:00:46.280> video<00:00:46.550> will<00:00:46.970> show

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
start climbing the next video will show

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.229 
start climbing the next video will show
you<00:00:47.300> everything<00:00:47.720> from<00:00:47.960> cruise<00:00:48.680> to<00:00:49.580> descend<00:00:50.059> to

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
you everything from cruise to descend to

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.100 
you everything from cruise to descend to
approach<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.229> touchdown<00:00:51.800> okay<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:52.870> let's<00:00:53.870> get

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
approach and touchdown okay so let's get

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.049 
approach and touchdown okay so let's get
ready<00:00:54.290> first<00:00:54.680> before<00:00:55.190> we<00:00:55.309> move<00:00:55.550> as<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:55.909> can

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
ready first before we move as you can

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
see deep use of chokes on by default

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.729 
see deep use of chokes on by default
gotta<00:00:59.239> remove<00:00:59.600> that<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.500> Brown<00:01:01.070> services<00:01:02.739> be

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
gotta remove that and Brown services be

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.140 
gotta remove that and Brown services be
selecting<00:01:04.280> these<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.729> don't<00:01:04.909> need<00:01:05.030> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
selecting these you don't need the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.210 
selecting these you don't need the
external<00:01:05.570> power<00:01:05.720> for<00:01:06.320> power<00:01:06.560> box<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.040> there's

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
external power for power box and there's

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.240 
external power for power box and there's
that<00:01:07.370> we<00:01:07.430> kind<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.670> East<00:01:07.880> like<00:01:08.120> that<00:01:09.159> okay<00:01:10.159> so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:48.240 

there<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:41.270> go<00:01:42.250> okay<00:01:43.250> once<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.610> get<00:01:43.729> fish<00:01:44.000> back

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:49.250 

release<00:01:49.250> parking<00:01:49.760> brakes<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.390> yep<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.890> spec

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.360 

I'm<00:02:50.260> gonna<00:02:50.590> disconnect<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.370> pushback<00:02:53.370> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
I'm gonna disconnect the pushback and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.760 
I'm gonna disconnect the pushback and
taxi<00:02:56.940> onto<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> runway<00:02:58.210> by<00:02:58.600> applying<00:02:59.310> power

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
taxi onto the runway by applying power

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.730 
taxi onto the runway by applying power
make<00:03:02.770> sure<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.190> don't<00:03:03.400> exceed<00:03:04.200> 25<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.470> 30

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
make sure you don't exceed 25 to 30

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.280 
make sure you don't exceed 25 to 30
knots<00:03:05.950> steering<00:03:06.550> taxi<00:03:07.000> okay<00:03:07.750> now<00:03:08.050> this<00:03:08.230> is

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
knots steering taxi okay now this is

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.150 
knots steering taxi okay now this is
just<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.860> basic<00:03:09.100> taxi<00:03:09.670> procedure<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:10.950> while<00:03:11.950> I'm

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
just a basic taxi procedure so while I'm

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.100 
just a basic taxi procedure so while I'm
taxing<00:03:12.610> onto<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.030> runway<00:03:13.209> I'm<00:03:13.510> gonna<00:03:13.750> pass

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
taxing onto the runway I'm gonna pass

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.890 
taxing onto the runway I'm gonna pass
and<00:03:14.560> return<00:03:15.040> when<00:03:15.880> I'm<00:03:16.030> holding<00:03:16.270> too<00:03:16.630> short

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
and return when I'm holding too short

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.290 
and return when I'm holding too short
okay<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.450> we<00:03:19.959> are<00:03:19.990> holding<00:03:20.260> short<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.980> runway

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
okay so we are holding short of runway

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.400 
okay so we are holding short of runway
1:8<00:03:22.500> um<00:03:24.360> well<00:03:25.360> if<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.720> I'm<00:03:26.170> not<00:03:26.350> a

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
1:8 um well if you I'm not a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.230 
1:8 um well if you I'm not a
multi-player<00:03:27.040> right<00:03:27.310> now<00:03:27.490> but<00:03:27.790> when<00:03:28.030> you<00:03:28.090> have

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
multi-player right now but when you have

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.140 
multi-player right now but when you have
a<00:03:28.270> DC<00:03:28.720> make<00:03:28.930> sure<00:03:29.140> you<00:03:29.320> get<00:03:29.560> is<00:03:29.940> too<00:03:30.940> low<00:03:31.090> for

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
a DC make sure you get is too low for

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.050 
a DC make sure you get is too low for
takeoff<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:32.709> we're<00:03:32.830> gonna<00:03:32.950> go<00:03:33.610> onto<00:03:33.820> the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
takeoff so we're gonna go onto the

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.760 
takeoff so we're gonna go onto the
runway<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.810> pull<00:03:35.320> her<00:03:35.440> up

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
runway and pull her up

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.660 
runway and pull her up
were<00:03:37.400> we<00:03:37.550> put<00:03:37.760> in<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.150> grease<00:03:38.750> beats<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.680> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
were we put in the grease beats on the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.320 
were we put in the grease beats on the
aircraft

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
aircraft

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.420 
aircraft
the<00:03:41.420> copilot<00:03:41.780> should<00:03:42.380> automatically<00:03:42.980> call

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
the copilot should automatically call

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.810 
the copilot should automatically call
out<00:03:43.610> your<00:03:43.850> V<00:03:44.030> speeds<00:03:44.390> for<00:03:44.600> takeoff<00:03:45.550> if<00:03:46.550> you're

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
out your V speeds for takeoff if you're

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.060 
out your V speeds for takeoff if you're
okay<00:03:47.480> now<00:03:47.510> you're<00:03:47.840> only<00:03:47.990> allowed<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.560> reject

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
okay now you're only allowed to reject

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.980 
okay now you're only allowed to reject
to<00:03:49.160> take<00:03:49.370> off<00:03:49.550> in<00:03:49.760> case<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.270> have<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.480> stop<00:03:50.750> for

to take off in case you have to stop for

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.100 
to take off in case you have to stop for
some<00:03:51.050> reason<00:03:51.590> if<00:03:51.710> you're<00:03:51.890> under<00:03:52.250> B<00:03:52.460> 1<00:03:52.490> and<00:03:53.110> you

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
some reason if you're under B 1 and you

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.860 
some reason if you're under B 1 and you
rotate<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.710> we<00:03:54.920> are<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.400> should<00:03:55.430> be

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
rotate it we are and you should be

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:56.820 
rotate it we are and you should be
climbing<00:03:56.870> by<00:03:57.170> B<00:03:57.410> 2

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.530 

okay<00:04:57.830> now<00:04:58.100> that<00:04:58.340> we're<00:04:58.670> in<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:59.060> air<00:04:59.240> and

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
okay now that we're in the air and

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.660 
okay now that we're in the air and
climbing<00:05:02.140> she<00:05:03.140> can<00:05:03.380> take<00:05:03.860> up<00:05:04.010> your<00:05:04.160> flaps<00:05:04.460> one

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
climbing she can take up your flaps one

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.940 
climbing she can take up your flaps one
by<00:05:04.820> one<00:05:05.060> when<00:05:05.420> your<00:05:05.630> speed<00:05:05.990> approaches<00:05:06.740> the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
by one when your speed approaches the
