now I'm going to take off the power
steering<00:00:03.300> reservoir<00:00:03.449> it's<00:00:04.110> pretty<00:00:04.350> nasty<00:00:04.529> on

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
steering reservoir it's pretty nasty on

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.730 
steering reservoir it's pretty nasty on
the<00:00:04.920> inside<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.400> same<00:00:05.609> as<00:00:06.259> the<00:00:07.259> radiator

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
the inside the same as the radiator

the inside the same as the radiator
overflow<00:00:07.770> was<00:00:08.660> and<00:00:09.660> take<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.960> off<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.290> looks

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
overflow was and take it off it looks

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.339 
overflow was and take it off it looks
like<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:10.800> just<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.190> be<00:00:12.259> popping<00:00:13.259> that

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
like it's just going to be popping that

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.060 
like it's just going to be popping that
tube<00:00:13.590> off<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.130> clamp<00:00:15.680> that<00:00:16.680> tube<00:00:16.920> off

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
tube off with that clamp that tube off

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.599 
tube off with that clamp that tube off
down<00:00:17.400> there<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.119> clamp<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.609> then

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
down there with that clamp and then

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.420 
down there with that clamp and then
these<00:00:20.850> two<00:00:21.150> eight<00:00:21.300> millimeter<00:00:21.750> bolts<00:00:22.430> right

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
these two eight millimeter bolts right

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.019 
these two eight millimeter bolts right
there<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:25.039> right<00:00:26.039> there<00:00:26.070> I'm<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.910> take

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
there and right there I'm going to take
those<00:00:27.210> off<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.660> already<00:00:27.869> drained<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> power

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
those off I already drained the power

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040 
those off I already drained the power
steering<00:00:29.099> fluid<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> bottom<00:00:30.050> so

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
steering fluid out of the bottom so

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.520 
steering fluid out of the bottom so
hopefully<00:00:31.380> not<00:00:31.529> much<00:00:31.710> more<00:00:31.890> I'll<00:00:32.009> come<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.340> I

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
hopefully not much more I'll come out I

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.319 
hopefully not much more I'll come out I
got<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.710> power<00:00:35.100> steering<00:00:35.430> reservoir<00:00:35.550> off<00:00:36.059> was

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
got the power steering reservoir off was

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.310 
got the power steering reservoir off was
just<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.660> hose<00:00:37.100> that<00:00:38.100> hose<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.820> bolt<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:40.020> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
just that hose that hose a bolt there a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.630 
just that hose that hose a bolt there a
bolt<00:00:40.770> there<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.160> was<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
bolt there and there was actually a

that wasn't the case in me I tried
pulling<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> wouldn't<00:00:48.289> wouldn't

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pulling on it but I wouldn't wouldn't

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.529 
pulling on it but I wouldn't wouldn't
come<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:53.090> here's<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.239> first<00:00:54.449> hose

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
come off so here's that first hose

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.660 
come off so here's that first hose
there's<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> other<00:00:57.780> hose<00:00:59.510> and<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:00.870> one

three<00:01:06.940> points<00:01:07.690> where<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.900> screws<00:01:08.170> going<00:01:08.380> a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
three points where the screws going a

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.560 
three points where the screws going a
little<00:01:09.340> bit<00:01:09.550> of<00:01:09.640> fluid<00:01:09.790> came<00:01:10.030> out<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.420> got<00:01:10.540> all

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
little bit of fluid came out and got all

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.150 
little bit of fluid came out and got all
over<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:10.960> place<00:01:11.140> we'll<00:01:11.470> be<00:01:11.500> right<00:01:11.680> there<00:01:11.860> I'll

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
over the place we'll be right there I'll

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.380 
over the place we'll be right there I'll
be<00:01:12.250> down<00:01:12.430> there<00:01:12.550> no<00:01:12.760> big<00:01:12.880> deal<00:01:13.090> though<00:01:13.240> because

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
be down there no big deal though because

be down there no big deal though because
I'm<00:01:13.570> flushing<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.020> whole<00:01:14.140> system<00:01:15.690> so<00:01:16.690> I'm

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
I'm flushing the whole system so I'm

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.469 
I'm flushing the whole system so I'm
gonna<00:01:16.870> get<00:01:17.020> this<00:01:17.170> reservoir<00:01:17.979> cleaned<00:01:18.250> up<00:01:18.479> and

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
gonna get this reservoir cleaned up and

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.510 
gonna get this reservoir cleaned up and
when<00:01:19.690> I<00:01:19.720> get<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.930> parts<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.350> I'll<00:01:20.530> do<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.340> how-to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
when I get the parts in I'll do a how-to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.270 
when I get the parts in I'll do a how-to
on<00:01:21.820> put<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.060> back<00:01:22.180> together

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on put it back together

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.070 
on put it back together
there's<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.460> nasty<00:01:24.940> oil<00:01:24.970> looking<00:01:25.510> film<00:01:25.840> that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
there's the nasty oil looking film that

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.500 
there's the nasty oil looking film that
was<00:01:26.200> in<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.380> bottom<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:28.060> looks<00:01:28.240> like<00:01:28.390> it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
was in the bottom of it it looks like it

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.240 
was in the bottom of it it looks like it
might<00:01:28.660> be<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.840> filter<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.650> then<00:01:29.920> that's<00:01:30.070> like<00:01:30.160> a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
might be a filter and then that's like a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.219 
might be a filter and then that's like a
bypass<00:01:30.820> in<00:01:31.030> case<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.360> filter<00:01:31.570> gets<00:01:31.840> clogged

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
bypass in case the filter gets clogged

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.830 
bypass in case the filter gets clogged
over<00:01:32.590> there<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:33.850> not<00:01:34.060> sure<00:01:34.300> but<00:01:34.570> that's<00:01:34.690> what

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
over there I'm not sure but that's what

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.030 
over there I'm not sure but that's what
it<00:01:34.900> looks<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.170> to<00:01:35.260> me<00:01:35.290> so<00:01:35.590> I'm<00:01:35.680> gonna<00:01:35.770> soak

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
it looks like to me so I'm gonna soak

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.310 
it looks like to me so I'm gonna soak
this<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.460> Dawn<00:01:36.910> dish<00:01:37.150> soap<00:01:37.180> with<00:01:37.990> some<00:01:38.170> hot

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
this and Dawn dish soap with some hot

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.350 
this and Dawn dish soap with some hot
water<00:01:38.470> overnight<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.030> all<00:01:40.119> that<00:01:40.270> oil

breakdown and then rinse it real good
when<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.119> put<00:01:43.330> it<00:01:43.390> back<00:01:43.420> together<00:01:46.050> so<00:01:47.050> I'd<00:01:47.170> like

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
to run all-new power steering lines

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.029 
to run all-new power steering lines
there's<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.600> power<00:01:49.750> steering<00:01:50.110> box<00:01:50.590> kind<00:01:50.890> of

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.249 
for you guys there it is that
bottom-left<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.660> believe<00:02:01.660> goes<00:02:01.960> down<00:02:02.140> to

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
bottom-left one I believe goes down to

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.020 
bottom-left one I believe goes down to
the<00:02:02.380> middle<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.890> this<00:02:03.070> power<00:02:03.399> steering<00:02:03.729> arm

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
the middle of this power steering arm

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:11.190 
the middle of this power steering arm
down<00:02:04.270> here<00:02:04.539> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:09.390> top<00:02:10.390> left<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:10.959> goes

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
down here and then the top left one goes

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.509 
down here and then the top left one goes
all<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.590> way<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.070> left

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
all the way to the left

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.190 
all the way to the left
well<00:02:12.850> writer<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.299> vehicle<00:02:13.690> left<00:02:13.870> from<00:02:14.080> this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
well writer the vehicle left from this

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
well writer the vehicle left from this
view<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.880> bottom<00:02:15.880> right<00:02:16.090> one<00:02:16.799> goes<00:02:18.060> all<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
view that bottom right one goes all the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.990 
view that bottom right one goes all the
way<00:02:19.330> up<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.720> power<00:02:19.870> steering<00:02:20.230> pump<00:02:20.350> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
way up to the power steering pump and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.440 
way up to the power steering pump and
then<00:02:22.000> one<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.420> them<00:02:26.519> goes<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.880> buried<00:02:28.180> in

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
then one of them goes and is buried in

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.320 
then one of them goes and is buried in
there

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.450 

and<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.380> can't<00:02:34.770> really<00:02:34.890> see<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.130> goes<00:02:38.310> in

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
and I can't really see it but it goes in

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.130 
and I can't really see it but it goes in
there<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:38.820> buried<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.810> if<00:02:39.870> anybody

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
there and it's buried so if anybody

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
there and it's buried so if anybody
knows<00:02:40.260> how<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.500> get<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.830> one<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.160> or<00:02:41.460> get<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
knows how to get that one out or get a

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.800 
knows how to get that one out or get a
new<00:02:41.820> one<00:02:41.940> in<00:02:42.380> without<00:02:43.380> taking<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> axle<00:02:44.190> off

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
new one in without taking the axle off

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.290 
new one in without taking the axle off
let<00:02:45.810> me<00:02:45.840> know<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:46.380> it's<00:02:46.560> not<00:02:47.490> likely<00:02:47.790> cuz<00:02:48.150> it's

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
let me know but it's not likely cuz it's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.960 
let me know but it's not likely cuz it's
pretty<00:02:48.900> hard<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.770> I'd<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:50.880> to

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
pretty hard to get to but I'd like to

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.520 
pretty hard to get to but I'd like to
replace<00:02:51.180> all<00:02:51.420> these<00:02:51.570> lines<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.230> anybody

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
replace all these lines so if anybody

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.000 
replace all these lines so if anybody
has<00:02:52.560> any<00:02:52.650> tips<00:02:53.040> then<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.550> let<00:02:53.910> me<00:02:53.940> know<00:02:55.010> after

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
has any tips then just let me know after

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.740 
has any tips then just let me know after
looking<00:02:56.190> at<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.550> little<00:02:56.790> more<00:02:57.060> turns<00:02:57.330> out<00:02:57.510> that

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
looking at a little more turns out that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.400 
looking at a little more turns out that
hose<00:02:58.740> that's<00:02:59.010> buried<00:02:59.780> all<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.840> way<00:03:01.170> in<00:03:01.290> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
hose that's buried all the way in the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.330 
hose that's buried all the way in the
end<00:03:01.530> down<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.240> actually<00:03:03.240> just<00:03:03.750> goes<00:03:03.960> up<00:03:03.990> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
end down there actually just goes up and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.180 
end down there actually just goes up and
comes<00:03:05.340> right<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.940> other<00:03:06.030> side<00:03:06.360> right<00:03:06.630> here

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
comes right to the other side right here

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.620 
comes right to the other side right here
looks<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.460> was<00:03:08.580> already<00:03:08.610> repaired<00:03:09.300> once

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
looks like it was already repaired once

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.270 
looks like it was already repaired once
because<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.080> rubber<00:03:10.350> hose<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.070> same

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
because that rubber hose is the same

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.700 
because that rubber hose is the same
hose<00:03:11.540> so<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.570> rusted<00:03:13.110> through<00:03:13.290> over<00:03:13.560> here

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
hose so it rusted through over here

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.200 
hose so it rusted through over here
rather<00:03:13.950> than<00:03:14.070> replacing<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.790> whole<00:03:14.940> thing

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
rather than replacing the whole thing

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.270 
rather than replacing the whole thing
like<00:03:15.420> they're<00:03:15.540> supposed<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:16.040> they<00:03:17.040> just

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
like they're supposed to they just

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.800 
like they're supposed to they just
popped<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.640> rubber<00:03:17.820> hose<00:03:18.090> on<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.420> rust<00:03:18.630> it's

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
popped the rubber hose on the rust it's

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.030 
popped the rubber hose on the rust it's
rusted<00:03:19.410> part<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:20.700> do<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> patch<00:03:21.180> job<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:23.010> I

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
rusted part to do a patch job and so I

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.170 
rusted part to do a patch job and so I
think<00:03:23.280> I'm<00:03:23.340> just<00:03:23.460> going<00:03:23.610> to<00:03:23.700> try<00:03:23.820> rubbing<00:03:24.090> it

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
think I'm just going to try rubbing it

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.970 
think I'm just going to try rubbing it
running<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.540> rubber<00:03:24.720> hose<00:03:24.960> from<00:03:25.350> one<00:03:25.590> side<00:03:25.800> all

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
running a rubber hose from one side all

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.320 
running a rubber hose from one side all
the<00:03:26.070> way<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.340> other<00:03:26.430> side<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.970> just<00:03:27.150> zip

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
the way to the other side and just zip

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.300 
the way to the other side and just zip
tie<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.540> down<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.080> think<00:03:28.980> that's<00:03:29.130> actually

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
tie it down I think that's actually

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.770 
tie it down I think that's actually
gonna<00:03:29.550> work<00:03:29.700> better<00:03:29.850> than<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.210> rusted<00:03:30.600> hose

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
gonna work better than this rusted hose

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.530 
gonna work better than this rusted hose
and<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.200> part<00:03:31.410> of<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.560> rubber<00:03:31.740> hose<00:03:31.950> and

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
and the part of the rubber hose and

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.380 
and the part of the rubber hose and
turns<00:03:33.540> out<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.750> only<00:03:34.050> Q<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.620> carry<00:03:34.800> fluid

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
turns out the only Q that carry fluid

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.740 
turns out the only Q that carry fluid
are<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.630> one<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.140> this<00:03:38.070> one<00:03:38.420> both<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.630> which

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
are that one and this one both of which

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
are that one and this one both of which
mount<00:03:40.110> up<00:03:40.530> there<00:03:41.070> which<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:43.380> also<00:03:43.680> connects

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
mount up there which that also connects

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.770 
mount up there which that also connects
to<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:46.459> power<00:03:47.459> steering<00:03:47.820> cooler<00:03:48.150> which<00:03:48.630> is

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
to the power steering cooler which is

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.210 
to the power steering cooler which is
right<00:03:48.959> there<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:51.170> then<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.500> power<00:03:52.830> steering

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
right there and then the power steering

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.750 
right there and then the power steering
pump<00:03:53.340> which<00:03:53.880> is<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.600> one<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.959> goes<00:03:55.110> up<00:03:55.760> you

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
pump which is that one that goes up you

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.040 
pump which is that one that goes up you
actually<00:03:56.880> see<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.330> right<00:03:57.360> there<00:03:57.510> go<00:03:57.989> straight

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
actually see it right there go straight

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.290 
actually see it right there go straight
up<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.470> power<00:03:58.620> steering<00:03:59.070> so<00:03:59.760> all<00:03:59.970> these<00:04:00.090> power

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
up the power steering so all these power

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.760 
up the power steering so all these power
steering<00:04:00.690> lines<00:04:00.840> are<00:04:00.959> going<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.140> replace<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
steering lines are going to replace and

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.930 
steering lines are going to replace and
I'm<00:04:01.830> going<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.010> try<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.190> rub<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.520> rubber<00:04:02.700> hose

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940
