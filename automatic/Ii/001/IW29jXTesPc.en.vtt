00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.170
 peggy 3 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.660
 hello how am I that the car or some 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.400
 You will know me, not others, but I have 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.470
 been the voice 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.140
 motogp comments this season 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.000
 in telecinco good because in principle with 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.300
 the script that happens to me this I have not 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.559
 reviewed everything there are some things that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 in principle they do not conform to the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.120
 terms that you normally say but 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.730
 well, that's reviewing everything and seeing 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.600
 what little things could be changed and improved 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.739
 but good to vargas 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.149
 it rains pretty much the conditions of the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.850
 track are going to be that all the pilots 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 come out with water tires on these 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 moments it's raining a lot in the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.309
 circuit and to tell the truth it seems that the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.650
 time will remain the same during the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.290
 rest of the day here you have to stick to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 a scripted tree and things have to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 be more concrete because in addition what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.939
 they checked in this video game 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.159
 You have to say the little things because you have 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.300
 that go then linking the for what 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.670
 part of the kit program 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.440
 man imagine that the language that is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.150
 used in a live broadcast 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.560
 it's not the same as when you write 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.180
 something when there is a text when something 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.410
 scripted or whenever you have to 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.850
 ask for much more policies to say 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.850
 concrete things with time 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 greetings, talk to you with chaves del 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.160
 muriel circuit or heaven has 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.960
 cleared up after the rain that 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.970
 fell until a few hours ago left the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.680
 completely wet track has had 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.970
 always an audience not the people 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.530
 we ride him 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.330
 and mythical engineering career and already 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.100
 many years have been implemented 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.540
 the circuits are in fact the country with 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 more tests we have of 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.900
 moto gp in Spanish on four circuits 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.670
 that it looked like someone was going to fall 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.100
 for the next season and at the end if 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.430
 they all remain and that is a symptom and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.900
 a sign that there is a hobby in Spanish 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.030
 We are live from the circuit of 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 mazda in monterrey california for 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.500
 cover the American grand prize of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.600
 motorcycle gp as you can see in the images 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.090
 that we issue from the track it seems that 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.620
 will make good time during the race 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.170
 they are marquez who has come from moto2 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.980
 motogp and is already rolling in the times 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.840
 of the fastest 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.840
 Valentino Rossi after his lap Yamaha 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.550
 jorge very close very close with 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.290
 valentino and dani pedrosa who is 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.230
 The season proved very strong 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.659
 when I do it so we have 4 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.550
 very very hard contenders all of them 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:49.190
 and that very good dates of shows 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.690
