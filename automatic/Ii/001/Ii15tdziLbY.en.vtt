was about to co trillion and waste would
be<00:02:07.740> roughly<00:02:08.550> around<00:02:08.849> 30<00:02:09.720> trillion<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.890> here's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
be roughly around 30 trillion now here's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.650 
be roughly around 30 trillion now here's
the<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.580> guys<00:02:11.840> for<00:02:12.840> example

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
the thing guys for example

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.200 
the thing guys for example
back<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.440> dragon<00:02:14.800> ball<00:02:14.950> z<00:02:15.190> days<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.730> know<00:02:15.880> in

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
back the dragon ball z days you know in

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.170 
back the dragon ball z days you know in
the<00:02:16.390> early<00:02:16.810> days<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.890> someone<00:02:18.460> would<00:02:19.000> have

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
the early days if someone would have

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.930 
the early days if someone would have
been<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.870> much<00:02:20.080> stronger<00:02:20.470> than<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:21.040> maybe

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
been that much stronger than you maybe

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.850 
been that much stronger than you maybe
i'm<00:02:22.210> talking<00:02:22.540> like<00:02:22.570> above<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.200> saiyan<00:02:23.500> saga

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
i'm talking like above the saiyan saga

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.760 
i'm talking like above the saiyan saga
right<00:02:24.310> raditz<00:02:25.030> appeared<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.720> know<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.590> would

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
right raditz appeared you know it would

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.650 
right raditz appeared you know it would
mix<00:02:27.070> much<00:02:27.340> much<00:02:27.610> much<00:02:27.850> of<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.060> difference<00:02:28.570> you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
mix much much much of a difference you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.040 
mix much much much of a difference you
know<00:02:28.690> raddatz<00:02:29.320> power<00:02:29.620> level<00:02:30.010> was<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> 1200<00:02:31.050> you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
know raddatz power level was a 1200 you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.590 
know raddatz power level was a 1200 you
were<00:02:32.290> at<00:02:32.500> 600<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.370> stood<00:02:33.760> somewhat<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.510> a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
were at 600 you stood somewhat of a

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.500 
were at 600 you stood somewhat of a
chance<00:02:34.930> but<00:02:35.380> now<00:02:35.650> as<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.610> guys<00:02:36.820> can<00:02:37.000> see<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
chance but now as you guys can see the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.650 
chance but now as you guys can see the
gap<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.200> big<00:02:38.500> we're<00:02:39.220> talking<00:02:39.400> about<00:02:39.660> 1k

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
gap is so big we're talking about 1k

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.530 
gap is so big we're talking about 1k
trillion<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.440> know<00:02:41.620> in<00:02:41.980> terms<00:02:42.820> of<00:02:43.030> difference

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
trillion you know in terms of difference

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.590 
trillion you know in terms of difference
in<00:02:43.660> power<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.770> means<00:02:45.130> somewhat<00:02:45.790> hundreds<00:02:46.420> of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
in power that means somewhat hundreds of

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.010 
in power that means somewhat hundreds of
trillions<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:48.010> just<00:02:48.220> insane<00:02:49.090> guys<00:02:49.510> it

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
trillions it's it's just insane guys it

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.190 
trillions it's it's just insane guys it
is<00:02:50.380> insane<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:52.090> that's<00:02:52.810> how<00:02:52.990> much

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
is insane and that that's how much

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.860 
is insane and that that's how much
stronger<00:02:53.470> wheezes<00:02:54.070> from<00:02:54.310> beer<00:02:54.490> was<00:02:54.610> now<00:02:54.870> aside

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
stronger wheezes from beer was now aside

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.360 
stronger wheezes from beer was now aside
from<00:02:56.020> that<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.290> do<00:02:56.470> believe<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:56.950> be<00:02:57.190> ruse

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
from that I do believe that be ruse

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.300 
from that I do believe that be ruse
would<00:02:58.000> be<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.210> only<00:02:58.450> person<00:02:59.230> besides<00:02:59.530> super

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
would be the only person besides super

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.180 
would be the only person besides super
saiyan<00:03:00.580> god<00:03:00.760> goku<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.960> would<00:03:02.530> be<00:03:02.710> able<00:03:02.890> to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
saiyan god goku that would be able to

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.210

say<00:03:06.460> that's<00:03:07.030> as<00:03:07.210> far<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.170> would<00:03:08.380> go<00:03:08.650> with

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
say that's as far as I would go with

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.410 
say that's as far as I would go with
this<00:03:08.980> because<00:03:09.430> it<00:03:09.700> would<00:03:09.910> be<00:03:09.940> a<00:03:10.030> slaughter

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
this because it would be a slaughter

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.760 
this because it would be a slaughter

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
defeat him even combined because you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.730 
defeat him even combined because you
know<00:04:32.460> we<00:04:32.730> could<00:04:33.060> just<00:04:33.240> focus<00:04:33.900> on<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.350> one<00:04:34.530> and

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
know we could just focus on the one and

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.230 
know we could just focus on the one and
then<00:04:34.890> take<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.370> other<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.640> know<00:04:35.700> wouldn't

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
then take on the other you know wouldn't

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.630 
then take on the other you know wouldn't
be<00:04:36.360> that<00:04:36.660> hard<00:04:36.690> for<00:04:37.200> him<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.380> do<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.800> but

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
be that hard for him to do that but

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.580 
be that hard for him to do that but
maybe<00:04:38.880> combined<00:04:39.420> they<00:04:39.750> would<00:04:39.930> pause<00:04:40.140> a<00:04:40.170> very

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
maybe combined they would pause a very

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.220 
maybe combined they would pause a very
credible<00:04:40.950> threat<00:04:41.340> but<00:04:41.880> as<00:04:42.180> a<00:04:42.210> fight<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:43.020> ruse
