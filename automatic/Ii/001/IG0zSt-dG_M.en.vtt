00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.330 
annoying like try hards bother me
because<00:03:16.940> you<00:03:17.450> know<00:03:17.600> like<00:03:18.590> they<00:03:18.770> have<00:03:19.130> them<00:03:19.250> at

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
because you know like they have them at

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.620 
because you know like they have them at
my<00:03:19.459> locals<00:03:19.850> I'm<00:03:19.970> sure<00:03:20.090> they're<00:03:20.239> everywhere

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
my locals I'm sure they're everywhere

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.540 
my locals I'm sure they're everywhere
they<00:03:20.870> just<00:03:21.080> I<00:03:21.350> think<00:03:21.950> there's<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.280> time<00:03:22.489> and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
they just I think there's a time and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.370 
they just I think there's a time and
place<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:23.270> super<00:03:23.600> serious<00:03:23.810> where<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.230> go

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
place to be super serious where you go

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.830 
place to be super serious where you go
there's<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.709> time<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:25.070> place<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.670> have<00:03:26.390> fun<00:03:26.450> with

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
there's a time in place to have fun with

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.610 
there's a time in place to have fun with
it<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.170> just<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:28.760> know<00:03:28.870> anyway<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.440> kind

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
it and just you know anyway this is kind

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.840 
it and just you know anyway this is kind
of<00:03:30.650> vague<00:03:30.830> but<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.250> just<00:03:31.520> thought<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.700> was<00:03:31.760> an

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
of vague but I just thought it was an

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.160 
of vague but I just thought it was an
interesting<00:03:32.150> discussion<00:03:32.209> topic<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:33.020> I

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
interesting discussion topic because I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.330 
interesting discussion topic because I
don't<00:03:33.290> really<00:03:33.380> like<00:03:33.500> those<00:03:33.770> kinds<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.070> people

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
don't really like those kinds of people

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.890 
don't really like those kinds of people
and<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.730> don't<00:03:34.760> think<00:03:34.940> many<00:03:35.180> people<00:03:35.300> like<00:03:35.690> them

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
and I don't think many people like them

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.300 
and I don't think many people like them
I<00:03:36.080> think<00:03:36.500> there<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.739> difference<00:03:37.190> between

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
I think there is a difference between

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.660 
I think there is a difference between
the<00:03:37.760> try-hards<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:38.780> just<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.489> people<00:03:40.489> who

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
the try-hards and just the people who

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.250 
the try-hards and just the people who
are<00:03:40.700> meta<00:03:41.000> game<00:03:41.180> band<00:03:41.450> Wagoner's<00:03:41.840> even<00:03:42.110> they

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
are meta game band Wagoner's even they

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.100 
are meta game band Wagoner's even they
