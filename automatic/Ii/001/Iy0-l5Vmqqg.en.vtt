00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
you know he might have done a simulator

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.830 
you know he might have done a simulator
run<00:00:19.310> on<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:19.580> every<00:00:20.000> now<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.300> again<00:00:20.480> or<00:00:20.539> it

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
run on this every now and again or it

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.450 
run on this every now and again or it
might<00:00:20.960> have<00:00:21.050> done<00:00:21.140> a<00:00:21.200> low-pass<00:00:21.590> like<00:00:21.919> this<00:00:22.189> and

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
might have done a low-pass like this and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.740 
might have done a low-pass like this and
let's<00:00:23.090> watch<00:00:24.160> yes<00:00:25.160> he<00:00:25.279> comes<00:00:25.520> down<00:00:25.759> now<00:00:26.630> watch

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
piloting that's at some hull damage I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.590 
piloting that's at some hull damage I
bet<00:00:47.930> those<00:00:48.140> engines<00:00:48.589> are<00:00:49.309> not<00:00:50.030> adversely

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
bet those engines are not adversely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.829 
bet those engines are not adversely
impacted<00:00:52.150> because<00:00:53.150> you<00:00:53.449> notice<00:00:53.690> how<00:00:53.809> I

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
impacted because you notice how I

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.020 
impacted because you notice how I
started<00:00:54.170> those<00:00:54.350> props<00:00:54.680> those<00:00:54.920> props<00:00:55.250> stopped

started those props those props stopped

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.600 
started those props those props stopped
and<00:00:56.690> they<00:00:57.049> had<00:00:57.530> been<00:00:57.739> if<00:00:58.070> they<00:00:58.250> had<00:00:58.400> been

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
and they had been if they had been

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.030 
and they had been if they had been
spinning<00:00:59.210> it<00:00:59.330> would<00:00:59.420> have<00:00:59.540> spun<00:00:59.839> those<00:01:00.110> pp6

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.040 
spinning it would have spun those pp6

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.179 
spinning it would have spun those pp6

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
today we're gonna talk about a gear up

today we're gonna talk about a gear up
landing

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
landing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.440 
landing
I<00:01:09.049> know<00:01:09.200> we've<00:01:09.650> done<00:01:09.830> these<00:01:09.979> before<00:01:10.150> but<00:01:11.150> this

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
I know we've done these before but this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.880 
I know we've done these before but this
one<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.810> really<00:01:12.080> cool<00:01:12.380> because<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.799> the

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
one is really cool because of the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.219 
one is really cool because of the
technique<00:01:13.400> used<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.330> see<00:01:14.510> normally<00:01:15.049> people

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
technique used you see normally people

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.740 
technique used you see normally people
will<00:01:15.470> use<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.010> same<00:01:16.280> landing<00:01:16.729> technique<00:01:17.210> they

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
will use the same landing technique they

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.289 
will use the same landing technique they
use<00:01:18.079> when<00:01:18.829> they<00:01:19.070> landing<00:01:19.579> with<00:01:19.909> their<00:01:20.119> gear

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
use when they landing with their gear

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.719 
use when they landing with their gear
down<00:01:20.719> now<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.649> problem<00:01:22.070> with<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:22.219> is<00:01:22.579> when

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
down now the problem with that is when

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.459 
down now the problem with that is when
you<00:01:22.850> have<00:01:22.969> your<00:01:23.090> gear<00:01:23.359> up<00:01:23.390> you're<00:01:24.140> gonna<00:01:24.259> get<00:01:24.409> a

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469 
you have your gear up you're gonna get a

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.099 
you have your gear up you're gonna get a
tail<00:01:24.859> strike<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.579> I'll<00:01:26.270> force<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.719> aircraft

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
tail strike and I'll force the aircraft

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.230 
tail strike and I'll force the aircraft
onto<00:01:27.350> its<00:01:27.590> belly<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.100> cause<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> lot<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:28.789> damage

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
onto its belly and cause a lot of damage

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.300 
onto its belly and cause a lot of damage
and<00:01:29.359> potentially<00:01:30.049> minor<00:01:30.320> injuries<00:01:30.829> such<00:01:31.280> as

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
and potentially minor injuries such as

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.580 
and potentially minor injuries such as
whiplash<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.270> come<00:01:32.509> out<00:01:32.689> of<00:01:32.719> it<00:01:32.899> alive<00:01:33.200> it's

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
whiplash you come out of it alive it's

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.069 
whiplash you come out of it alive it's
just<00:01:33.770> very<00:01:34.070> shaken<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:35.450> guy<00:01:35.780> on<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.049> other

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
just very shaken this guy on the other

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.260 
just very shaken this guy on the other
hand<00:01:36.439> he<00:01:36.799> comes<00:01:37.039> in<00:01:37.219> way<00:01:37.399> faster<00:01:37.969> than<00:01:37.999> you

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
hand he comes in way faster than you

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.380 
hand he comes in way faster than you
normally<00:01:38.479> would<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.490> instead<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.729> trying<00:01:41.329> to

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
normally would and instead of trying to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.719 
normally would and instead of trying to
flare<00:01:41.899> he<00:01:42.469> what<00:01:42.740> he<00:01:42.799> does<00:01:42.979> is<00:01:43.130> he<00:01:43.159> keeps<00:01:43.520> same

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
flare he what he does is he keeps same

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.809 
flare he what he does is he keeps same
level<00:01:44.450> attitude<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.859> he<00:01:46.039> does<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.369> the

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
level attitude and as he does that the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.789 
level attitude and as he does that the
airspeed<00:01:47.270> bleeds<00:01:47.600> off<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.439> aircraft

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
airspeed bleeds off and the aircraft

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.919 
airspeed bleeds off and the aircraft
settles<00:01:49.369> gently<00:01:49.880> onto<00:01:50.299> its<00:01:50.420> belly

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
settles gently onto its belly

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.410 
settles gently onto its belly
now<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.530> reduces<00:01:52.039> the<00:01:52.280> damage<00:01:52.909> done<00:01:53.270> to<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
now this reduces the damage done to the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.020 
now this reduces the damage done to the
aircraft<00:01:53.990> and<00:01:54.200> also<00:01:54.409> gives<00:01:55.249> a<00:01:55.369> really<00:01:55.700> smooth

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
aircraft and also gives a really smooth

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.429 
aircraft and also gives a really smooth
landing<00:01:56.329> in<00:01:56.689> fact<00:01:56.960> it's<00:01:57.170> one<00:01:57.259> of<00:01:57.289> the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
landing in fact it's one of the

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.419 
landing in fact it's one of the
smoothest<00:01:57.829> landings<00:01:58.249> I've<00:01:58.429> ever<00:01:58.609> seen<00:01:58.969> now

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
smoothest landings I've ever seen now

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.770 
smoothest landings I've ever seen now
another<00:02:01.429> thing<00:02:01.549> I'd<00:02:01.850> like<00:02:01.969> to<00:02:02.090> say<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.450> he

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
another thing I'd like to say is that he

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.709 
another thing I'd like to say is that he
manages<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.229> shut<00:02:03.710> off<00:02:03.889> the<00:02:04.100> engines<00:02:04.719> before

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
manages to shut off the engines before

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.169 
manages to shut off the engines before
landing<00:02:06.259> which<00:02:06.859> is<00:02:07.039> really<00:02:07.399> cool<00:02:07.549> just<00:02:07.880> before

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
landing which is really cool just before

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.969 
landing which is really cool just before
landing<00:02:08.300> which<00:02:08.660> means<00:02:08.929> that<00:02:09.319> he<00:02:09.410> reduces<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
landing which means that he reduces the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.980 
landing which means that he reduces the
amount<00:02:10.130> of<00:02:10.220> damage<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.940> done<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.569> engines

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
amount of damage to done to the engines

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.870 
amount of damage to done to the engines
so<00:02:12.500> in<00:02:12.590> those<00:02:12.830> respects<00:02:13.459> he's<00:02:13.640> done

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
so in those respects he's done

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.449 
so in those respects he's done
everything<00:02:14.450> perfectly<00:02:15.020> now<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:15.980> know<00:02:16.130> some<00:02:16.430> of

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
everything perfectly now I know some of

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.860 
everything perfectly now I know some of

these are tiny

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.819 
these are tiny
twin-engine<00:02:27.019> plane<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.349> mean<00:02:27.500> look<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.709> the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
twin-engine plane I mean look at the

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.709 
twin-engine plane I mean look at the
size<00:02:28.129> of<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.370> runway<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:28.879> look<00:02:29.239> at<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.450> size

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:29.719 
size of that runway and look at the size

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.319 
size of that runway and look at the size
of<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:29.870> plane<00:02:30.200> he<00:02:30.829> has<00:02:31.040> plenty<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.730> space<00:02:31.939> he

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
of that plane he has plenty of space he

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.759 
of that plane he has plenty of space he
might<00:02:32.510> as<00:02:32.659> well<00:02:32.750> use<00:02:33.079> it<00:02:33.109> that's<00:02:33.469> what<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
might as well use it that's what the

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.369 
might as well use it that's what the
runways<00:02:34.129> there<00:02:34.310> for<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.659> you<00:02:35.719> know<00:02:35.870> what<00:02:35.989> use

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
runways there for so you know what use

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.800 
runways there for so you know what use
up<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.709> runway<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.310> land<00:02:37.599> faster<00:02:38.599> than<00:02:38.719> you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
up the runway and land faster than you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.720 
up the runway and land faster than you
have<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.409> it<00:02:39.769> doesn't<00:02:39.950> matter<00:02:40.219> because<00:02:40.549> if

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
have to and it doesn't matter because if

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.699 
have to and it doesn't matter because if
he<00:02:40.879> feels<00:02:41.540> uncomfortable<00:02:41.719> with<00:02:42.290> it<00:02:42.409> he<00:02:42.560> can

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
he feels uncomfortable with it he can

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.170 
he feels uncomfortable with it he can
just<00:02:42.739> go<00:02:42.980> around<00:02:43.280> his<00:02:43.519> engines<00:02:43.879> are<00:02:44.000> still

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
just go around his engines are still
