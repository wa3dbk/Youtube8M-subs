everything and this will this device

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.259 
everything and this will this device
will<00:01:46.349> automatically<00:01:47.349> turn<00:01:47.830> on<00:01:48.099> our<00:01:48.340> petal<00:01:48.849> it

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:49.269 
will automatically turn on our petal it

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:51.029 
will automatically turn on our petal it
doesn't<00:01:49.629> matter<00:01:49.720> what<00:01:50.170> kind<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.619> battle<00:01:50.800> will

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.930 
doesn't matter what kind of battle will
be<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:52.410> also<00:01:53.410> have<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.979> tell<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.340> that<00:01:54.489> this<00:01:54.759> is

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
be so also have to tell you that this is

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.080 
be so also have to tell you that this is
it<00:01:55.390> true<00:01:55.929> bypass<00:01:56.319> that<00:01:56.649> means<00:01:57.459> that<00:01:57.670> our

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
it true bypass that means that our

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.749 
it true bypass that means that our
signal<00:01:58.959> our<00:01:59.140> original<00:01:59.739> signal<00:02:00.069> from<00:02:00.580> the

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
signal our original signal from the

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.389 
signal our original signal from the
guitar<00:02:01.030> we<00:02:01.330> will<00:02:01.539> not<00:02:01.720> be<00:02:01.780> affected<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:03.250> is

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
guitar we will not be affected this is

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.600 
guitar we will not be affected this is
very<00:02:03.580> important<00:02:04.149> because<00:02:04.860> our<00:02:05.860> signal<00:02:06.369> from

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
very important because our signal from

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.150 
very important because our signal from
the<00:02:06.789> guitar<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.239> will<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.690> single<00:02:08.500> coil<00:02:08.830> or<00:02:09.099> a

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
the guitar it will be a single coil or a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.759 
the guitar it will be a single coil or a
hamburger<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.179> doesn't<00:02:10.509> matter<00:02:10.599> will<00:02:11.290> be<00:02:11.319> as

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
hamburger it doesn't matter will be as

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.550 
hamburger it doesn't matter will be as
it<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.160> will<00:02:12.640> be<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:13.269> cool<00:02:13.480> signal<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.920> now<00:02:16.560> we

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
it is will be the cool signal so now we

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.330 
it is will be the cool signal so now we
can<00:02:17.680> use<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.099> with<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.650> 9-volt<00:02:20.650> battery<00:02:21.010> and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
can use this with a 9-volt battery and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.330 
can use this with a 9-volt battery and
actually<00:02:22.060> they<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:23.050> an<00:02:23.260> anvil<00:02:23.500> battery<00:02:24.010> in

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
actually they have an anvil battery in

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.270 
actually they have an anvil battery in
the<00:02:25.349> packaging<00:02:26.349> so<00:02:26.590> they<00:02:26.830> are<00:02:26.920> very<00:02:26.980> generous

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the packaging so they are very generous

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
for us would have to buy a new one also

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.690 
for us would have to buy a new one also
a<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:31.180> can<00:02:31.450> use<00:02:31.629> it<00:02:31.750> with<00:02:32.019> them<00:02:32.230> any<00:02:32.530> kind<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.099> AC

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
a we can use it with them any kind of AC

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.089 
a we can use it with them any kind of AC
adapter<00:02:34.330> 9v<00:02:35.140> DC<00:02:35.440> adapter<00:02:36.569> ok<00:02:37.569> so<00:02:38.170> now<00:02:38.860> let's

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
adapter 9v DC adapter ok so now let's

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.160 
adapter 9v DC adapter ok so now let's
see<00:02:39.790> how<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.659> can<00:02:40.840> use<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.700> here<00:02:42.700> i<00:02:42.730> have<00:02:42.999> my

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
see how we can use this here i have my

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.480 
see how we can use this here i have my
way<00:02:44.170> petal<00:02:44.499> is<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.709> typical<00:02:45.310> cheap<00:02:45.939> whopper

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
way petal is a typical cheap whopper

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.970 
way petal is a typical cheap whopper
it<00:02:46.730> doesn't<00:02:47.030> matter<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.390> kindly<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.320> will
