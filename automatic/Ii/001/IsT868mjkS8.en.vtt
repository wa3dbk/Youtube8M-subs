00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.140
 her name was brought forward by year 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.599
 I am a woman but the company has it 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.009
 via cuts 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.009
 and bring back to vitalize 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.070
 tap water 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.119
 and led them to do that when cycling 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.419
 how does that work then these were that the list shows is really ridiculous 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.460
 from the water supply or the pressure of an agreement 25 discount tuktuks placed 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.210
 and as a result get and heavily load hoevelaken get vital water that is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.210
 transfer the frequency 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.499
 the year before 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.379
 the water or a heavy charge with it is just the phone by the pressure that you put 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.590
 shells go there anyway kallenkote a questionnaire usually takes golf 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.910
 and therefore you get vital water 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.490
 but knmg black boots with those things on violate things 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.549
 anp he gives the frequency going water has the memory 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.850
 who saves the thieves saves everything if you save 4 4 ​​who are heavily polluted 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.670
 leave them alone through the natural metal elements that 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.689
 gets it's power 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.229
 and what have we got by the water company 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.030
 everything has to go 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.450
 and we look and then one more extra drop in that sector he actually put down 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.050
 weather 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.770
 the water and the condition get the support then choose a back 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.360
 and that crystal formation is actually the sign of life 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.690
 coach frank the farmer know 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.960
 but for the whole year now we are all out of town 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.950
 what 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.870
 near a car 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 and that healthy food is the one that produces it 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.280
 And the crystals that are actually the energy values ​​were the people who made it 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.280
 want to leave a country if we need each other a hit 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 and for the tax and skater 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.080
 give that big trouble now also in eg germany 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.149
 about 7 percent back there is a closed system to use 2 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.760
 everything alright 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.129
 and we do but we do but and 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.129
 that becomes it only gets more with less 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.789
 and only then do I understand back because where the fish come today 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.460
 japan against the bergaar has always been the water 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.259
 vital 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.299
 once everything has been exported and returned to it the vision of us were blazing 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:38.999
 world 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.659
 he expects that to 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.249
 to be used to 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.650
 and that actually comes to mind more often after a few days 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.549
 comes up because it has multiple steps but is very excited 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.749
 And now I think a mystery Almere city is coming 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.079
 so hence it is growing 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.069
 but the crystal shelf life 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.369
 beh 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:08.389
 are thousands of different species but in sydney sitting together in the 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.049
 hal why leave 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:14.789
 and it is always people who form after one whole 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:16.280
 but where a third 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.480
 never heard of it because not everyone that we are higher 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:22.599
 we open again 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.290
 this euro I have never heard the importance of 9 being remarkable 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.349
 we have been working on it for 25 years 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.679
 from a percent so that is unfortunate that we prove it but this is actually 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:39.719
 everything 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.719
 to be able to deliver fun on stage 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.439
 of course i have a surly looking you are tips for never anyone in it 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 follow strokes to come 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.380
 the one that still has a little self-mockery biggest when you bared 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.649
 I say I can reinforce even more so back 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:05.459
 a few times for fifteen years something is wrong with the percent still eating
