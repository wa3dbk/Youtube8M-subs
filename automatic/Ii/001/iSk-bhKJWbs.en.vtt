00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
at the moment and i'm using these

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.990 
at the moment and i'm using these
reinforced<00:00:16.740> platforms<00:00:17.250> nor<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> road<00:00:17.670> modern

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000

platforms<00:00:18.570> so<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.289> get<00:00:19.410> any<00:00:19.529> backdrop

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
platforms so that don't get any backdrop

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.400 
platforms so that don't get any backdrop
or<00:00:20.070> anything<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.119> let's<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.750> started<00:00:21.900> on

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
or anything so let's get started on

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
again so we need to do that there and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.019 
again so we need to do that there and
each<00:00:26.580> time<00:00:26.849> i<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.390> put<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:29.029> then

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
each time i have put one there I then

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.520 
each time i have put one there I then
paint<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.840> otherwise<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.200> can't<00:00:34.410> get

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
