00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.220
 and well we are with natalia oreiro that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.410
 he just presented his album full of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.420
 circus if our new collection 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.020
 inspired by the circus of the 20s and 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.430
 30 and we set up a tent in the theater 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.230
 presenter had a circus that 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.740
 did favio posca jugglers 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.689
 acrobats monocyclists in general to that of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.510
 the playful wave you like a lot 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.420
 the carousel the exact circus I like 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.340
 I think it's something nice to play 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 fashionable has to do with us with 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.329
 what we wanted to do when it started 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.070
 our brand and we always try to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.030
 put it to play and also I am a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.890
 fan of the circus I did during 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 many years so somehow 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.350
 it's a way to remain authentic 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.879
 and I saw the little bombs I had to see 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.100
 a lot with the carousel that you 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.750
 They put in but I remembered midnight 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.520
 in allen woody paris and I do not know how 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.230
 that I saw the movie but I did 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.690
 they commented and also of 'water for 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 elephants' that is not good either, that's the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.930
 aesthetic and tell me a bit about the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.280
 latina collection 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.290
 good the collection as I told you is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
 inspired by the 5 of those years 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.590
 we always try to have a 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.299
 vintage although our silhouette 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.390
 preferred is the pencil this year also 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.680
 there are type skirts to we use genres 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 stamped by us that maybe 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.799
 you do not get to appreciate but there was 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.990
 trapeze jugglers all 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.420
 prints in our dressing room silks 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.890
 obviously red is our color or the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.080
 colorado as they like to say to many 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.810
 is our favorite color and this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.369
 season also helps us to come 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.610
 very fashionable of the colorado so also 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.899
 the blues the software and tell me a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.409
 little about the sizes because good 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.420
 very varied but the dresses with 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.060
 mermaid termination that out there are very 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.069
 tight you have for all 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.780
 such as how they handle the issue of 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.369
 Look at us, we have everything 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.080
 has what it takes for the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.399
 size law we fulfill it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.960
 It seems it is essential that all 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.149
 girls can get dressed in issues that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.039
 Encourage you to wear it depending on your 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.750
 I like the curves 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.659
 I was always good in fact now I have 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.280
 more curves than at another time and always 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.710
 It was in essence exactly that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.770
 the woman with 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.370
 curves and voluptuous represented 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.140
 much better than the single shoulder is 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.830
 as long as the trends let's say when 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:23.110
 you participate voices the design and in relation 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:28.160
 to Adriana more or less good the truth is 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.780
 that the collections are put together 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.209
 We travel to see trends always 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.590
 we try to be inspired by something that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.090
 have to do with us and follow a 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.069
 little the tendency of what is used what 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.700
 what we do together are basically the 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.760
 the most important dresses suddenly 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.970
 20 20 or 30 fundamental items and 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.980
 then what she does is make 150 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.209
 different designs inspired by those 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.190
 that we say together because 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.220
 besides I am an actress and I also have 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.470
 things to do but I say it like 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.590
 mother we do it together good and if 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.080
 I had to advise one of your 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.810

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.980

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.620

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.319
 I love I love everything 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.360
 generous let's say but hey this could 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.069
 be a good one and obviously that's the 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.560
 but I'm going to ask you about the 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.470
 pregnancy as it touched you easy difficult my 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.030

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.200
 I had this at three months luckily since 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.720
 I do not have more the first three months 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.099
 they were difficult but they go by quickly and 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.200
 I always have to think about what 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.910
 it comes that it is beautiful and with a lot 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.290
