00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:25.130
 ac-v no better favorites have not moved 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.230
 and probably a pretty exercise 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.119
 difficult to teach the dogs have 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.419
 simply horror of staying on 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.040
 square 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.710
 but thanks to some training 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.960
 course and repeat this exercise will 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:51.829
 to be controlled will prove very useful to a 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:54.260
 many of the situations start with 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.219
 the exercise so not moved you can 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.219
 also ordered him to lie down 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:13.410
 rocland at it says not moved with a voice 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.410
 close and place your hand in front of you 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.470
 wait a few seconds then 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.900
 start backing up 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.400
 the dog must not move repeat 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.170
 this exercise several times and then 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:31.660
 rewarded if your dog breaks 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.340
 order not move do not be angry 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.720
 simple act of not reacting and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.270
 the lack of rewards will be 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.140
 explicit enough for him gets annoyed 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.140
 and is counterproductive
