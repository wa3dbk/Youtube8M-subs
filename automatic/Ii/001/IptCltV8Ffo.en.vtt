00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.289
 the alert for rescue command is 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.789
 activates a boat with people 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.789
 shipwrecked on the beaches of Majagual 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 ahead 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.780
 I keep a boat here where it is 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.010
 no rope life since you need a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.010
 motorboat here in the sector 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.550
 coordination and communication are 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.550
 coldly calculated 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 struggling against the waves lifeguards 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.850
 snatch the victims one by one the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.850
 claws of death 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.200
 the lifeguards and stretcher-bearers enter 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.200
 action 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.970
 but it's yellow for risk in everything 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.970
 they show us their great preparation 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.600
 the astonished curious observe the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.320
 maneuvers of these intrepid experts 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.320
 of the rescue 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.240
 the intrepid of the air bring the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.380
 victims to this place to be 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.380
 attended by the commands 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.740
 the seriousness of your situation two of the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.020
 rescued are transferred by the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.590
 metallic birds towards a center 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.590
 assistance 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.020
 while the others were taken care of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.020
 emergency people 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.730
 all this is part of an exercise 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.930
 well coordinated 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.049
 it's a simulacrum where there is a boat 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.760
 where it seems to be dumped where by 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:28.909
 same excess loads that one of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 the waves will be overturned and made 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:36.780
 so many deep and simple rescues 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.680
 clear that this relief body is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.350
 more than prepared in this and another kind of 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:49.010
 emergencies that may occur in these 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.010
 Holidays are flowers code 21
