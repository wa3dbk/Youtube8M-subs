00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
is jose aldo losing to him twice so

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.360

appearance of mendes going up against

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.099 
appearance of mendes going up against
aldo<00:04:03.729> wouldn't<00:04:04.120> have<00:04:04.209> been<00:04:04.419> the<00:04:04.629> big<00:04:04.810> draw

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109

into a spot that I think he could be
like<00:04:39.460> the<00:04:39.550> next<00:04:39.670> jail<00:04:40.000> Sonnen<00:04:40.420> where<00:04:41.320> even

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
like the next jail Sonnen where even

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.410 
like the next jail Sonnen where even
though<00:04:41.770> he's<00:04:41.980> losing<00:04:42.370> fights<00:04:42.580> he<00:04:43.000> can<00:04:43.180> run<00:04:43.300> his

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
though he's losing fights he can run his

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.360 
though he's losing fights he can run his
mouth<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.870> point<00:04:44.140> he's<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> guy<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:44.890> you<00:04:45.130> want
