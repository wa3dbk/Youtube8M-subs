00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:09.450
 I live in hell class 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.799
 It has not been released yet , so I raised it in England and the children 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.799
 I think I could get Suezoo 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.200
 Also you're doing Carry 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.120
 I live in Tokyo so a little bit 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.930
 That strong person 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.930
 Taste 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:40.310
 Why this is it 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:45.760
 It's good come and exchange it for matching and it's Tteyuu theme card 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.540
 No Ya Well reasonably strong Kadota because mon doing I also play time 100 hours 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:52.030
 So 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.400
 If also by specific wear nice to become something tell me 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.600
 First shot 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.890
 Well just for that 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.890
 It is also that I say that they meet 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 I do not do it 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.920
 There 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.890
 Abune- 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.149
 Anyway, if you use this intimidation, it is somehow it is this hell class 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:25.550
 Maybe I think the easiest thing to capture with 16 wins is that it is a rule though 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:31.620
 To the friend 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:36.760
 I think there are people who can not exchange theme cards like that 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:41.000
 I also took advantage of the bookstore, but I became a friend and a friend 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:45.250
 I thought it was probably best to make that promise 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 It Nde perhaps this party to the next 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.410
 There is a sense of stability when Echidna enters 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.980
 Tteyuu lose 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.170
 Because there is no indication 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.170
 You can only call it a threat loop 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.230
 To this the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:09.020
 I also know that the boss has a problem that I can play out 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.740
 After this 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.050
