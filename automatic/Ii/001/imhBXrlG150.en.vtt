00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.480 

okay<00:00:03.890> this<00:00:04.890> question<00:00:05.250> is<00:00:05.910> around<00:00:07.490> proper

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
okay this question is around proper

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.900 
okay this question is around proper
operation<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.480> guess<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.139> carburetor<00:00:10.910> so

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
operation I guess of the carburetor so

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.400 
operation I guess of the carburetor so
my<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.780> question<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.650> based<00:00:14.370> around<00:00:15.410> when

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
my first question is based around when

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.310 
my first question is based around when
I'm<00:00:16.529> out<00:00:16.680> on<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> water<00:00:17.160> and<00:00:17.520> I'm

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
I'm out on the water and I'm

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.179 
I'm out on the water and I'm
transitioning<00:00:19.320> from<00:00:19.410> idle<00:00:20.480> past<00:00:21.740> idle<00:00:22.740> into<00:00:23.160> a

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
transitioning from idle past idle into a

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.670 
transitioning from idle past idle into a
higher<00:00:23.550> speed

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
higher speed

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.160 
higher speed
if<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.920> carburetor<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.820> operating<00:00:27.630> properly

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
if the carburetor is operating properly

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.599 
if the carburetor is operating properly
because<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.920> stumbling<00:00:29.429> at

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because I get a lot of stumbling at

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.410 
because I get a lot of stumbling at
times<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.260> appears<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.369> choke<00:00:33.030> function

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
times so it appears the choke function

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
times so it appears the choke function
engine<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:33.780> warm<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:34.469> now<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> madman<00:00:35.370> by

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
engine is warm right now as a madman by

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.040 
engine is warm right now as a madman by
the<00:00:35.640> way<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.410> finished<00:00:37.410> fogging<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
the way I just finished fogging it and

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.350 
the way I just finished fogging it and
so<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.950> assume<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.879> choke<00:00:42.149> plate

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
so I'm going to assume the choke plate

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
so I'm going to assume the choke plate
which<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:43.050> I'm<00:00:43.140> assuming<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.969> it's

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
which is what I'm assuming this is it's

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.680 
which is what I'm assuming this is it's
open<00:00:45.420> because<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.930> engine<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.230> warm<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:47.690> I'm

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
open because the engine is warm and I'm

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
open because the engine is warm and I'm
going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> assume<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:50.219> course<00:00:50.280> being<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> coil

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
going to assume of course being the coil

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.979 
going to assume of course being the coil
function<00:00:52.579> when<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> gets<00:00:53.910> warm<00:00:54.410> that<00:00:55.410> coil

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
function when it gets warm that coil

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.099 
function when it gets warm that coil
releases<00:00:57.989> attention<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.510> spring<00:01:00.809> allows

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
releases attention and the spring allows

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.270 
releases attention and the spring allows
the<00:01:01.579> plate<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.730> open<00:01:03.799> but<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> next<00:01:05.159> question

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
the plate to open but the next question

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.460 
the plate to open but the next question
is<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.970> don't<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.450> what<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.960> part<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
is I don't know what this part of the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
is I don't know what this part of the
carburetor<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.159> called<00:01:10.729> those<00:01:11.729> butterflies<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
carburetor is called those butterflies I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.130 
carburetor is called those butterflies I
guess<00:01:12.740> but<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.490> look<00:01:14.670> at<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.450> vacuum<00:01:15.930> pump

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
guess but if I look at the vacuum pump

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.219 
guess but if I look at the vacuum pump
operation<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:18.180> press<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
operation if I press in on it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.350 
operation if I press in on it
I<00:01:19.259> can<00:01:20.250> see<00:01:20.400> where<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.700> moving<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.090> rod

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
I can see where it's moving this rod

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
I can see where it's moving this rod
here<00:01:23.570> but<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.720> see<00:01:24.930> where<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.380> would

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
here but I don't see where it would

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
here but I don't see where it would
actually<00:01:25.860> ever<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.520> any<00:01:26.790> function<00:01:29.150> while<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
actually ever do any function while the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.510 
actually ever do any function while the
engine<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.600> running<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.470> manually<00:01:32.100> open<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
engine is running if I manually open the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.330 
engine is running if I manually open the
butterfly<00:01:35.240> that's<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.450> operation<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
butterfly that's the operation so I

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
butterfly that's the operation so I
don't<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.759> that's<00:01:38.909> good<00:01:39.090> bad<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.659> that's

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't know if that's good bad if that's

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.620 
don't know if that's good bad if that's
proper<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.729> trying<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.329> some

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
proper or not just trying to get some

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
proper or not just trying to get some
idea<00:01:43.020> from<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> most<00:01:44.460> knowledgeable<00:01:45.000> folks

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
idea from you most knowledgeable folks

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
idea from you most knowledgeable folks
if<00:01:45.540> everything<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.170> fine<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:46.829> there's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
if everything is fine or if there's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.520 
if everything is fine or if there's
something<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> need<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> look<00:01:47.549> at<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.840> was

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
something I need to look at I was

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.380 
something I need to look at I was
contemplating<00:01:49.860> removing<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> car<00:01:50.759> taking<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
contemplating removing the car taking it

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.319 
contemplating removing the car taking it
to<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> car<00:01:52.200> up<00:01:52.290> rebuilding<00:01:52.770> place<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.640> having

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
to a car up rebuilding place and having

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.880 
to a car up rebuilding place and having
them<00:01:54.509> just<00:01:54.720> go<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> check<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> out

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
them just go through it check it out

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.179 
them just go through it check it out
clean<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.369> rebuild<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.189> as

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
clean it out rebuild it you know just as

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.520
