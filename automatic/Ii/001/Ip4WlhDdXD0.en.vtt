00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
like a music video I guess where it's

like a music video I guess where it's
very<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.760> know<00:03:06.790> structured<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.320> looks

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
very you know structured and it looks

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.700 
very you know structured and it looks

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
very cool but I guess they've also

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.020 
very cool but I guess they've also

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
way that would go back to the stuff and

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.330 
way that would go back to the stuff and
I'm<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.230> gotta<00:03:50.380> remember<00:03:50.530> man<00:03:50.860> Treyarch

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
has been in development for two years on

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.010 
has been in development for two years on
this<00:03:54.040> game<00:03:54.250> by<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.030> time<00:03:55.270> advanced<00:03:55.690> warfare

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
this game by the time advanced warfare

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.630 
this game by the time advanced warfare
came<00:03:56.230> out<00:03:56.350> there's<00:03:56.560> no<00:03:56.860> way<00:03:57.190> they<00:03:57.430> could<00:03:57.610> have

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
came out there's no way they could have

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.400 
came out there's no way they could have
made<00:03:57.880> those<00:03:58.030> kind<00:03:58.300> of<00:03:58.420> critical<00:03:58.780> changes<00:03:59.200> so

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
made those kind of critical changes so

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.660 
made those kind of critical changes so
at<00:03:59.590> this<00:03:59.740> point<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.130> kind<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.340> like<00:04:00.460> all

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
at this point it's kind of like all

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.060 
at this point it's kind of like all
right<00:04:00.850> it<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.960> what<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.290> now<00:04:02.620> we<00:04:02.680> got<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
right it is what it is now we got to

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.950 
right it is what it is now we got to
figure<00:04:03.250> out<00:04:03.520> you<00:04:04.330> know<00:04:04.360> how<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.600> make<00:04:04.780> this

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
figure out you know how to make this

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.310 
figure out you know how to make this
better<00:04:05.230> I<00:04:05.500> don't<00:04:05.920> know<00:04:05.980> or<00:04:06.130> maybe<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.960> reviews

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
better I don't know or maybe the reviews

be<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.140> lot<00:04:26.320> like<00:04:26.670> advanced<00:04:27.670> warfare<00:04:27.990> it's

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
be a lot like advanced warfare it's

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.800 
be a lot like advanced warfare it's
going<00:04:29.170> to<00:04:29.230> be<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.350> lot<00:04:29.590> like<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:31.060> same<00:04:31.420> gameplay

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
going to be a lot like the same gameplay

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.840 
going to be a lot like the same gameplay
mechanics<00:04:32.650> but<00:04:32.860> it'll<00:04:33.040> just<00:04:33.190> have<00:04:33.340> Trey<00:04:33.580> arcs

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
mechanics but it'll just have Trey arcs

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.930 
mechanics but it'll just have Trey arcs
twist<00:04:34.270> on<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.830> my<00:04:36.070> opinion<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.550> I've<00:04:36.700> said

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
twist on it in my opinion like I've said

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.630 
twist on it in my opinion like I've said
before<00:04:37.740> it's<00:04:38.740> not<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.220> didn't<00:04:39.580> like

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
before it's not that I didn't like

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.210 
before it's not that I didn't like
advanced<00:04:40.150> warfare<00:04:40.630> it's<00:04:41.440> just<00:04:41.620> not<00:04:41.680> call<00:04:42.070> of

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
advanced warfare it's just not call of

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.250 
advanced warfare it's just not call of
duty<00:04:42.520> to<00:04:42.700> me<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.090> I<00:04:43.120> can<00:04:43.210> get<00:04:43.690> around<00:04:43.780> that<00:04:44.110> as

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
duty to me but I can get around that as

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.780 
duty to me but I can get around that as
long<00:04:44.410> as<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.680> game<00:04:44.860> functions<00:04:45.310> well<00:04:45.490> but<00:04:45.670> for

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
long as the game functions well but for

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.370
