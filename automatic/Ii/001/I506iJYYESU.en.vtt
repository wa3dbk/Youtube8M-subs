00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
that was a turning point for me and it

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.000 
that was a turning point for me and it
kind<00:04:20.100> of<00:04:20.220> really<00:04:20.489> bummed<00:04:20.760> me<00:04:20.940> out<00:04:22.010> looking

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
back I shouldn't have been like that but

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.800 
back I shouldn't have been like that but
it<00:04:26.760> made<00:04:27.060> me<00:04:27.240> pursue<00:04:27.510> other<00:04:28.610> things<00:04:29.810> but

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
it made me pursue other things but

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.380 
it made me pursue other things but
needless<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:32.100> say<00:04:32.130> I've<00:04:32.520> had<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.760> love<00:04:33.030> for<00:04:33.060> this

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
song for a long time and so I think it's

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.969 
song for a long time and so I think it's
a<00:04:35.669> wonderful<00:04:36.240> song<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.750> lot<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.530> people<00:04:37.770> like

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
this song it fits well on the guitar it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.630 
this song it fits well on the guitar it
uses<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.790> lot<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.890> nuances<00:04:43.890> on<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.190> guitar<00:04:44.520> we

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
uses a lot of nuances on the guitar we

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.159 
uses a lot of nuances on the guitar we
can<00:04:44.790> use<00:04:44.910> some<00:04:45.180> open<00:04:45.450> strings<00:04:45.780> as<00:04:45.990> you've

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
can use some open strings as you've

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.630 
can use some open strings as you've
heard<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:48.840> it's<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.130> but<00:04:50.130> an<00:04:50.190> arrangement<00:04:50.520> I

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
heard and so it's a but an arrangement I

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.159

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
think once you get it down you can be

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.880 
think once you get it down you can be
