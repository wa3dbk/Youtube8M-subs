00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
rules so unfortunately we don't have

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.179 
rules so unfortunately we don't have
something<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> take<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> balance<00:00:31.890> away

down here to come to a complete stop

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.500 
down here to come to a complete stop
that<00:02:35.780> takes<00:02:36.020> a<00:02:36.110> little<00:02:36.200> bit<00:02:36.320> to<00:02:36.590> get<00:02:36.680> used<00:02:36.860> to

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
that takes a little bit to get used to

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.360 
that takes a little bit to get used to
but<00:02:38.510> stopping<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:39.020> a<00:02:39.050> really<00:02:39.290> big<00:02:39.470> deal

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
but stopping is a really big deal

but stopping is a really big deal
especially<00:02:40.670> when<00:02:41.060> you're<00:02:41.150> first<00:02:41.300> starting

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
especially when you're first starting

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.150 
especially when you're first starting

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
out because if you lose control of it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.280 
out because if you lose control of it
you<00:02:43.820> can<00:02:44.000> only<00:02:44.120> get<00:02:44.300> worse<00:02:44.450> survival

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
you can only get worse survival

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.000 
you can only get worse survival
reactions<00:02:46.070> srs<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.470> one<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.620> survival

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
reactions srs and one of the survival

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.500 
reactions srs and one of the survival
reactions<00:02:49.430> just<00:02:49.580> to<00:02:49.730> hang<00:02:49.940> on<00:02:50.090> for<00:02:50.300> dear<00:02:50.330> life

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
reactions just to hang on for dear life

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.840 
reactions just to hang on for dear life
especially<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.560> lose<00:02:51.710> control<00:02:51.800> grip<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
throttle in a death grip and then you

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.520 
throttle in a death grip and then you
the<00:02:55.040> bike<00:02:55.250> jolting<00:02:56.050> accelerate<00:02:57.050> happens<00:02:57.410> all

bike go that takes a lot of training on

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.220 
bike go that takes a lot of training on
exactly<00:03:03.920> when<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.250> time<00:03:04.670> is<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.690> lot<00:03:06.140> of

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
exactly when that time is a lot of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.990 
exactly when that time is a lot of
people<00:03:06.500> tend<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.950> slam<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.460> brakes<00:03:07.700> or

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
people tend to slam on the brakes or

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.820 
people tend to slam on the brakes or
when<00:03:08.180> you're<00:03:08.300> in<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.510> corner<00:03:08.900> you'll<00:03:09.350> let<00:03:09.590> go<00:03:09.710> of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
when you're in a corner you'll let go of

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.190 
when you're in a corner you'll let go of
the<00:03:09.950> throttle<00:03:10.070> which<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.030> bike<00:03:11.210> decelerates

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
the throttle which the bike decelerates

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200 
the throttle which the bike decelerates
quickly<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.190> bike<00:03:13.370> picks<00:03:13.640> up<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.000> throws

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
quickly and the bike picks up and throws

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.120 
quickly and the bike picks up and throws
you<00:03:14.240> off<00:03:14.540> so<00:03:15.110> those<00:03:15.410> are<00:03:15.560> things<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:15.890> have<00:03:16.070> to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
you off so those are things you have to

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.940 
you off so those are things you have to
watch<00:03:16.340> out<00:03:16.550> for<00:03:16.580> especially<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.950> gravel

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
watch out for especially in a gravel

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.770 
watch out for especially in a gravel
condition<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.150> one<00:03:20.450> we<00:03:20.540> have<00:03:20.630> some

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
condition like this one we have some

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.350 
condition like this one we have some
gravel<00:03:21.110> on<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.290> parking<00:03:21.650> lot<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:23.090> we<00:03:23.210> just

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
gravel on the parking lot and so we just

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.900 
gravel on the parking lot and so we just
got<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.540> watch<00:03:23.630> out<00:03:23.840> for<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.110> as<00:03:24.290> well

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
got to watch out for that as well

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.550 
got to watch out for that as well
slipping<00:03:25.910> just<00:03:26.240> let<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.630> bike<00:03:26.810> slip<00:03:27.200> if<00:03:27.380> it's

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
slipping just let the bike slip if it's

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.960 
slipping just let the bike slip if it's
going<00:03:27.710> to<00:03:27.770> fall<00:03:28.010> else<00:03:28.370> are<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:28.700> going<00:03:28.910> to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
going to fall else are just going to
