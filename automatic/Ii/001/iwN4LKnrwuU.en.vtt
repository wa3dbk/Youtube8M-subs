out<00:00:06.810> here<00:00:07.109> there's<00:00:07.560> not<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.740> lot<00:00:07.919> of<00:00:07.950> water<00:00:08.189> that

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
out here there's not a lot of water that

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.299 
out here there's not a lot of water that
comes<00:00:08.809> we<00:00:09.809> might<00:00:10.019> only<00:00:10.170> get<00:00:10.349> three<00:00:11.070> or<00:00:11.099> four

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
comes we might only get three or four

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.160 
comes we might only get three or four
showers<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> year<00:00:12.769> without<00:00:13.769> water<00:00:14.190> it'd

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
showers here a year without water it'd

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.950 
showers here a year without water it'd
just<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.379> plain<00:00:16.619> desert<00:00:16.949> again<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:18.630> system

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
just be plain desert again the system

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.650 
just be plain desert again the system
was<00:00:19.080> installed<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.949> believer<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.789> 2012

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
was installed a believer and in 2012

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.769 
was installed a believer and in 2012
another<00:00:22.350> crime<00:00:22.650> well<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.580> system<00:00:24.359> was<00:00:24.480> put<00:00:24.660> in

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
another crime well the system was put in

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
another crime well the system was put in
basically<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> water<00:00:25.730> university<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.939> put

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
basically the water university to put

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.759 
basically the water university to put
straight<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> ball<00:00:27.840> received

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
straight from the ball received

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.080 
straight from the ball received
fluorination<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.609> there<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:29.820> no<00:00:29.939> other

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fluorination but there was no other

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.939 
fluorination but there was no other
treatment<00:00:30.599> well<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.019> black<00:00:31.230> pipe<00:00:31.470> line<00:00:31.710> right

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
treatment well the black pipe line right

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.030 
treatment well the black pipe line right
here<00:00:32.160> comes<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> bores<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.770> raw<00:00:34.770> water

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
here comes from the bores the raw water

ours<00:00:50.280> basically<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.300> an<00:00:51.390> electrochemical

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
ours basically it's an electrochemical

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.920 
ours basically it's an electrochemical
process<00:00:52.620> which<00:00:53.489> uses<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> direct<00:00:54.420> current<00:00:54.750> path

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
process which uses a direct current path

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.610 
process which uses a direct current path
between<00:00:55.170> two<00:00:55.440> electrodes<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:57.620> causes

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
between two electrodes and causes

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
between two electrodes and causes
cations<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.609> anions<00:00:59.699> which<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.329> effectively

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
cations and anions which are effectively

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.420 
cations and anions which are effectively
salts<00:01:01.379> ions<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.460> migrate<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> respective

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
salts ions to migrate to respective

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.620 
salts ions to migrate to respective
electrodes<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.909> they're<00:01:06.090> passed<00:01:06.360> into

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
electrodes and then they're passed into

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.870 
electrodes and then they're passed into
a<00:01:06.750> waste<00:01:06.990> stream<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.409> effectively

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
a waste stream so effectively

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.690 
a waste stream so effectively
desalinating<00:01:08.880> using<00:01:09.290> electricity<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.700> from

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
desalinating using electricity and from

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
desalinating using electricity and from
there<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.090> gets<00:01:12.299> passed<00:01:12.479> into<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.229> ground

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
there that gets passed into a ground

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.270 
there that gets passed into a ground
water<00:01:13.680> tank<00:01:13.950> located<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> town

in ESO which is a essential services
officer<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:29.120> go<00:01:29.330> around<00:01:29.420> test<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:29.990> every<00:01:30.200> day

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
officer we go around test that every day

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.220 
officer we go around test that every day
check<00:01:32.090> that<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.330> chlorine<00:01:32.690> levels<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.170> are

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
check that the chlorine levels that are

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.680 
check that the chlorine levels that are
acceptable<00:01:33.740> within<00:01:34.400> tolerances<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.300> now<00:01:35.480> also

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
acceptable within tolerances we now also

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.050 
acceptable within tolerances we now also
have<00:01:35.990> another<00:01:36.250> bigger<00:01:37.250> system<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:37.820> which<00:01:37.910> is

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
have another bigger system in which is

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.880 
have another bigger system in which is
electrolysis<00:01:38.600> I've<00:01:38.900> system<00:01:39.350> which<00:01:39.530> gets<00:01:39.770> with

brackish this out of it and it comes out

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.380 
brackish this out of it and it comes out
if<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:46.100> put<00:01:46.250> it<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.370> a<00:01:46.430> glass<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:46.910> comes<00:01:47.120> out<00:01:47.270> as

good<00:02:07.229> clean<00:02:07.380> waters<00:02:07.890> probably<00:02:08.340> one<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
good clean waters probably one of the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.870 
good clean waters probably one of the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
best things for health yeah so it's a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.729 
best things for health yeah so it's a
big<00:02:12.060> difference<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.599> town<00:02:12.840> any<00:02:13.140> community

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
big difference in a town any community
