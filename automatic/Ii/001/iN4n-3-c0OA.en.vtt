00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.420
 I with Juan Pablo GonzÃ¡lez have traveled 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 for many years to different 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 international tournaments we are very good 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.930
 friends and co-workers he has 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.300
 demonstrated all his effort throughout 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.430
 of these years demonstrating it with 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.580
 results that is more important in the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.160
 high performance sport and that's a 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.230
 characteristic of all the gymnast of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.539
 I think they are very hard and that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
 is a value to be rescued also within 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.620
 this sport I think you have to value 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.679
 that and you have to keep working with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.089
 clear goals to us makes us very 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:44.039
 ok this kind of events these 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.319
 controls at national level since we 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.780
 motivate us to continue improving and 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:52.819
 continue training with sights now the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.819
 2014 South American Games 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.560
 the theme of infrastructure is 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.960
 fundamental in high sport 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.800
 performance I believe that little by little there 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.050
 to go decentralizing a little 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.540
 in supporting not only just in the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.860
 capital in santiago but also the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.960
 different regions can receive the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.570
 State support for us is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.940
 fundamental infrastructure 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.830
 of first level since we compete in that 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.570
 infrastructure and gymnastics 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.310
 characterized by sport for being a 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.680
 very detailed sport and every detail 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.780
 influences performance while the better 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.710
 leaves in its structure better results 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.710
 we will also be able to obtain 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.810
 ah 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.349
 I take this opportunity to appeal to all 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.659
 State authorities in charge of 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.180
 financing and support for sports 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.040
 regional so they can support the club 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.349
 and so they can support gymnastics 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.819
 we are on a rise in this sport myself 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.379
 that in my performance in the games 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.329
 Olympics motivated many children I think 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.620
 that is the minute to support this 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:56.390
 serious sport at a professional level 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.829
 so we can have many more 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.829
 Olympic finalists in the future 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.160
 ah
