well<00:01:04.140> propane<00:01:04.650> went<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.189> high<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.820> then<00:01:06.979> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
well propane went up so high and then it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
well propane went up so high and then it
just<00:01:08.159> got<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> looking<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.450> needed<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
just got to looking like I needed to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.530 
just got to looking like I needed to
redo<00:01:10.290> my<00:01:10.320> breeders<00:01:10.830> too<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.820> just<00:01:12.119> tried<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
redo my breeders too so I just tried to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.899 
redo my breeders too so I just tried to
kill<00:01:13.290> two<00:01:13.500> birds<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.130> stone<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
kill two birds with one stone there and

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.200 
kill two birds with one stone there and
sort<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.270> beat<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:17.009> cost<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.700> propane

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
sort of beat the the cost of the propane

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.390 
sort of beat the the cost of the propane
and<00:01:18.630> course<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.200> propane<00:01:19.650> went<00:01:19.890> down<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and course then propane went down so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910 
and course then propane went down so
right<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> figured<00:01:22.259> let's<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.500> back<00:01:22.710> up

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
right so I figured let's go back up

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.679 
right so I figured let's go back up

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
doesn't have a lot of static pressure so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.080

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.910 
down to the bottom it just kind of comes
down<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.030> lays<00:02:17.209> down<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.660> floor<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.560> why

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
down and lays down on the floor so why

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.309 
down and lays down on the floor so why
is<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.310> bad<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:19.970> does<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.239> mean<00:02:20.540> well<00:02:21.080> we

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
is this bad what does this mean well we

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.470 
is this bad what does this mean well we
want<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.620> use<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.040> air<00:02:22.160> coming<00:02:22.580> in<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.180> mix

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
want to use the air coming in to mix

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.180 
want to use the air coming in to mix
with<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> warm<00:02:24.110> air<00:02:24.319> that's<00:02:24.530> at<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.769> top<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.130> the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
with a warm air that's at the top of the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.880 
with a warm air that's at the top of the
ceiling<00:02:25.630> -<00:02:26.630> because<00:02:27.230> you've<00:02:27.380> paid<00:02:27.590> for<00:02:27.799> that

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
ceiling - because you've paid for that

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.250 
ceiling - because you've paid for that
air<00:02:28.670> through<00:02:29.090> heating<00:02:29.660> the<00:02:29.750> propane<00:02:30.110> or

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
air through heating the propane or

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.650 
air through heating the propane or
whatnot<00:02:30.440> so<00:02:31.310> in<00:02:31.670> essence<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.480> just

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
whatnot so in essence this is just

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.050 
whatnot so in essence this is just
bringing<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.019> cold<00:02:33.260> air<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:34.400> it'll<00:02:34.670> move<00:02:34.819> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
bringing in cold air and it'll move the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140 
bringing in cold air and it'll move the
it'll<00:02:35.739> get<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.860> chicks<00:02:37.130> cold<00:02:37.459> which<00:02:37.819> is<00:02:37.970> not

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
it'll get the chicks cold which is not

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.830 
it'll get the chicks cold which is not
what<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.450> want

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
what we want

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.449 
what we want
and<00:02:39.319> it's<00:02:39.530> not<00:02:39.680> mixing<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> hot<00:02:40.280> air<00:02:40.430> that

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
and it's not mixing the hot air that

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.640 
and it's not mixing the hot air that
you've<00:02:40.760> already<00:02:40.880> paid<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.170> how

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
you've already paid for and this is how

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.930 
you've already paid for and this is how
it's<00:02:42.860> supposed<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.400> look

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
it's supposed to look

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.539 
it's supposed to look

the aesthetic pressure is low because of

these<00:03:00.739> vents<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.239> you<00:03:02.359> bring<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.690> air<00:03:02.840> you

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
these vents so as you bring in air you

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.539 
these vents so as you bring in air you
tend<00:03:03.230> to<00:03:03.260> make<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.500> problem<00:03:03.829> even<00:03:03.950> worse<00:03:04.250> even

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
tend to make the problem even worse even

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.060 
tend to make the problem even worse even
in<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.209> tightest<00:03:05.630> buildings<00:03:06.049> leaks<00:03:06.350> can<00:03:06.709> and

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
in the tightest buildings leaks can and

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.660 
in the tightest buildings leaks can and
will<00:03:07.250> occur<00:03:07.630> okay<00:03:08.630> go<00:03:08.900> ahead

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.180 

so<00:03:12.630> if<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:12.960> were<00:03:13.050> sealing<00:03:13.440> up<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.680> house<00:03:13.920> we

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
so if we were sealing up this house we

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.020 
so if we were sealing up this house we
