00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello everyone today i will show how 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.880
 still pulls the tablet in the form you returned 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:16.699
 7 player modern combat 5 on this tablet 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.340
 except his power is not bad and without a screen 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:25.289
 good kick is still very huge 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.720
 plus these are two frontal speakers plus 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.329
 late Ventre playing music very much 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 loudly more accurate speakers are very loud 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.610
 give out very good sound quality and 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 bass and give even 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 that is now the ruble on the volume 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:48.420
 I will be heard more than a game of course 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.710
 same period at maximum settings as 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 see let's play network game 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.309
 find let's find 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.809
 freedom of faith let's see about myself 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.090
 I will probably say nothing so 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.640
 have either played or watched 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.820
 review on the tandoor 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.850

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.850
 match and we are now on what to play 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.350
 everyone went to see the gameplay then 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.930
 there is a game going very smoothly without 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.930
 jerking 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.930
 lily of the valley 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.479
 and you look like me and 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.280
 a little freaked out himself term 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.430
 sitting in the number 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.440
 plump low loved 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.250
 and I guess I'll play the mouse 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.370
 I hope he can see everything perfectly 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.659
 five 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.660
 After all, let's switch over to a scout 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:13.890
 Immediately visible to all because 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.890
 because I want to listen 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.419
 Thorium man 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:09.020
 5 made myself a comiccon fashion stalker 3 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.229
 seconds now and the hole is not probably 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.229
 finish 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.630
 gameplay is given at all 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:39.510

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.510

00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:43.460
 or what else 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:54.270

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:59.040

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:01.850
