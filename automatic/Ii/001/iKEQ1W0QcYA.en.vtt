00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
problem of bacteria growing on towels we

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.709 
problem of bacteria growing on towels we
realized<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.429> there's<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:14.849> many<00:00:14.969> germs<00:00:15.360> so

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
realized that there's so many germs so

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.840 
realized that there's so many germs so
much<00:00:15.870> bacteria<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.710> we're<00:00:16.920> reusing<00:00:17.160> and

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
much bacteria that we're reusing and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.939 
much bacteria that we're reusing and
putting<00:00:18.449> back<00:00:18.480> onto<00:00:18.869> our<00:00:19.109> bodies<00:00:19.439> after<00:00:19.800> we've

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
putting back onto our bodies after we've

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.740 
putting back onto our bodies after we've
cleaned<00:00:20.189> ourselves<00:00:20.699> from<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> showers<00:00:21.359> or

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
cleaned ourselves from the showers or

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.509 
cleaned ourselves from the showers or
even<00:00:21.960> coming<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> pool<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
even coming out of the pool so we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.070 
even coming out of the pool so we
started<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.029> figure<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.480> how<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:24.750> we

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
started to figure out how can we

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
started to figure out how can we
eliminate<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.010> bacteria<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:26.939> came<00:00:27.119> up<00:00:27.240> with

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
eliminate this bacteria we came up with

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
eliminate this bacteria we came up with
eliminating<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> towel<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.680> course<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
eliminating the towel of course you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.980 
eliminating the towel of course you
don't<00:00:29.279> use<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> towel<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.029> body<00:00:30.390> dry<00:00:30.720> or

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
don't use a towel you can body dry or

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.459 
don't use a towel you can body dry or
air<00:00:31.050> dry<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.489> takes<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:33.450> 20-30<00:00:34.200> minutes

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
air dry but that takes in 20-30 minutes

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.170 
air dry but that takes in 20-30 minutes
we<00:00:35.160> wanted<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> be<00:00:35.550> able<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> come<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
we wanted to be able to come up with a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
we wanted to be able to come up with a
solution<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.960> 30<00:00:37.320> seconds<00:00:37.739> or<00:00:37.860> less<00:00:37.890> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
solution that so 30 seconds or less and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
solution that so 30 seconds or less and
actually<00:00:38.940> felt<00:00:39.120> good<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.510> did<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.469> took

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
actually felt good as you did it it took

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.010 
actually felt good as you did it it took
us<00:00:40.800> two<00:00:41.010> years<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.579> build<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.239> machine<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.899> make

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
us two years to build a machine to make

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.569 
us two years to build a machine to make
something<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.559> worked<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.010> make<00:00:44.280> something

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
something that worked and make something

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.670 
something that worked and make something
that<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.789> were<00:00:44.879> happy<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.629> then<00:00:46.289> we

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
that we were happy with and then we

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.200 
that we were happy with and then we
basically<00:00:47.039> put<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.789> money<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.059> had<00:00:48.180> left

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
basically put all the money we had left

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
basically put all the money we had left
into<00:00:48.870> building<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> prototype<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.129> that's

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
into building the prototype and that's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.680 
into building the prototype and that's
something<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
something you're going to see in this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.170 
something you're going to see in this
video<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.800> options<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.430> hot<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.640> cold<00:00:53.820> air

down<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.190> body<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.300> started<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.049> look<00:01:04.739> at

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
down off your body we started to look at

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
down off your body we started to look at
what<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.189> created<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.909> started<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
what we created and we started to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.510 
what we created and we started to
improve<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.530> said<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.189> add

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
improve that and we said what can we add

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.390 
improve that and we said what can we add
to<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.420> added<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.780> scale<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.740> widen<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to this we added a scale we widen the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
to this we added a scale we widen the
base<00:01:11.430> made<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> little<00:01:12.720> bit<00:01:12.930> more<00:01:13.080> sleeker

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
base made it a little bit more sleeker

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
base made it a little bit more sleeker
we<00:01:13.979> expect<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:15.030> boost<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> body

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
we expect that to really boost the body

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840 
we expect that to really boost the body

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
when we started our goal was to get a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
when we started our goal was to get a
body<00:01:23.009> dryer<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.640> every<00:01:24.060> home<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.390> America

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
body dryer into every home in America

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
body dryer into every home in America
and<00:01:25.020> once<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.040> were<00:01:26.100> able<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> start<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.210> that

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
and once we were able to start on that

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
and once we were able to start on that
journey<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.930> achieving<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.530> goal<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:29.520> have

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
journey of achieving that goal we have

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.319 
journey of achieving that goal we have
site<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.689> actually<00:01:31.110> move<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.650> larger<00:01:32.329> prototype
