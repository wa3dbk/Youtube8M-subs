I<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.550> it<00:01:29.580> taped<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.210> side

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
I have it taped on the other side

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.770 
I have it taped on the other side
I<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:32.010> once<00:01:32.190> moving<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.729> these<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.300> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I was once moving one of these and the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.390 
I was once moving one of these and the
whole<00:01:33.810> box<00:01:34.229> started<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.740> shift<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
whole box started to shift kind of

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
whole box started to shift kind of
diagonally<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.720> because<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.050> only<00:01:37.200> had<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
diagonally and it's because I only had a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.160 
diagonally and it's because I only had a
tape<00:01:37.620> here<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.940> tape<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.360> all<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.080> way

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
tape here so now I tape it all the way

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530 
tape here so now I tape it all the way
across<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.800> flap<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.370> then<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> put<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.120> X

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
across the flap and then I put one X

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
across the flap and then I put one X
here<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.620> one<00:01:43.830> X<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.700> give

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
here and one X here and that will give

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.440 
here and one X here and that will give
it<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> strength<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.720> stay<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:47.700> square<00:01:48.150> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
it the strength to stay in in square and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230 
it the strength to stay in in square and
the<00:01:49.170> whole<00:01:49.290> box<00:01:49.500> won't<00:01:49.710> shift<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.190> way<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:51.090> as

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the whole box won't shift this way so as

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
the whole box won't shift this way so as
your<00:01:51.360> goal<00:01:51.540> as<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:51.900> carrying<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> heavy

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
shifting you're not sure what's going on

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.990 
shifting you're not sure what's going on
inside<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.320> box<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.920> good<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.340> make

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
inside the box that's not good so make

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.450 
inside the box that's not good so make
sure<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> secure<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.350> here<00:01:59.250> and

here and you should be good this is an
18<00:02:02.280> inch<00:02:02.430> cube<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.299> generally<00:02:03.930> big

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
18 inch cube and that's generally big

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.960 
18 inch cube and that's generally big
enough<00:02:04.380> for<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.680> three-tiered<00:02:05.190> cake<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.760> is

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
enough for a three-tiered cake that is

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.130 
enough for a three-tiered cake that is
on<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> 16<00:02:06.780> or<00:02:07.170> an<00:02:07.440> 18<00:02:07.830> inch<00:02:07.979> board<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.019> if<00:02:10.019> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
on a 16 or an 18 inch board and if you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.160 
on a 16 or an 18 inch board and if you
have<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.709> four<00:02:11.219> tiered<00:02:11.459> cake<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.879> did

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
have a four tiered cake I did

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.640 
have a four tiered cake I did
over<00:02:12.319> two<00:02:12.590> tiers<00:02:12.890> stacked<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:15.140> top<00:02:15.349> two<00:02:15.620> I

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
over two tiers stacked and the top two I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.110 
over two tiers stacked and the top two I
would<00:02:15.860> take<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.190> separate<00:02:16.520> container<00:02:16.819> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
would take in a separate container and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.390 
would take in a separate container and
assemble<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.660> on-site<00:02:18.160> because<00:02:19.160> that's<00:02:19.340> a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
assemble it on-site because that's a

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.070 
assemble it on-site because that's a
little<00:02:19.580> it's<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.030> little<00:02:20.060> heavy<00:02:20.420> number<00:02:20.840> one

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
little it's a little heavy number one

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.380 
little it's a little heavy number one
and<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:22.040> taller<00:02:22.520> it<00:02:22.700> gets<00:02:22.849> obviously<00:02:23.270> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and the taller it gets obviously the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.820 
and the taller it gets obviously the
more<00:02:23.540> likely<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:23.989> to<00:02:24.050> fall<00:02:24.319> over<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.650> I

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
more likely it is to fall over and I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.960 
more likely it is to fall over and I
don't<00:02:24.890> deliver<00:02:25.220> anything<00:02:25.550> with<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> center

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
don't deliver anything with the center

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.030 
don't deliver anything with the center
down<00:02:26.120> some<00:02:27.080> people<00:02:27.200> use<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.500> center<00:02:27.709> dial<00:02:27.890> but

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
down some people use the center dial but

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.370 
down some people use the center dial but
I<00:02:28.099> don't<00:02:28.250> do<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.790> two<00:02:29.480> tiers<00:02:29.750> or<00:02:30.140> three

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
I don't do that so two tiers or three

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.130 
I don't do that so two tiers or three
tiers<00:02:30.590> if<00:02:30.739> it's<00:02:30.890> smaller<00:02:31.220> cake

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
tiers if it's smaller cake

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.540 
tiers if it's smaller cake
make<00:02:33.140> sure<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.410> tape<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:33.890> way<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.370> way

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
make sure you tape it this way this way

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.640 
make sure you tape it this way this way
this<00:02:34.580> way<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.600> make<00:02:35.989> sure<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.230> flaps<00:02:36.440> are

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
this way and make sure the flaps are

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.780 
this way and make sure the flaps are
going<00:02:36.800> on<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:36.980> right<00:02:37.100> way<00:02:37.220> on<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> inside<00:02:37.670> of

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
going on the right way on the inside of

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.110 
going on the right way on the inside of
the<00:02:37.850> box<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.420> you<00:02:38.630> should<00:02:38.810> be<00:02:38.930> fine
