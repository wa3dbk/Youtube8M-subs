00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 his cell what told me that's it 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.339
 sting but I do not know how to push 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.049
 here we are for a new 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.630
 game presentation and this time 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.769
 it's a flash game a little flash game 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.090
 available the description is that you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.769
 can play directly without 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 install it is directly on a 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.230
 website 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.330
 so the goal of the game is simply 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 to pick up the most goods towards 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.689
 possible by passing your hand between a 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.400
 guillotine 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.840
 and yes so you 're lucky because 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.070
 you go tomorrow so here we go 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.630
 try our luck we will try to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.369
 collect as much money as possible 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.430
 so it's really a didier game for 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.680
 fans of greenbacks increases them 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.510
 wide percent like all the guys who 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 are never satiated at the level of 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.170
 money here is where you have 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.219
 several rounds a bit like 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.760
 like in the show that wants to win 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.530
 millions 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 except this time it's not 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
 questions you pick up but you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.360
 put down really poor vault tomorrow more 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.969
 early 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.640
 so here we go so the first 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.829
 level is pretty simple and you play 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.290
 with the mouse so 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.510
 so there is 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.340
 so see you have bonuses and if 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.210
 sometimes for example the jelly the 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.460
 guillotine 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.660
 so here's no I do not want others 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.650
 skirts so here we will go to level 2 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.600
 so that's really a question of 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.460
 speed and reflexes and you can 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.950
 escape from biÃ© at a time like I 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.970
 want to show also here is where 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 you have these little bonuses of 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.740
 the vacuum that is really fire now 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.090
 so the vacuum without bag and cuttings 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.930
 suck all beers and so you 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.030
 finish directly 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.400
 so I can tell you that until 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.170
 level 3 same is worth it to him 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.090
 make his part 34 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.860
 it gets complicated me I arrived 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 I believe in 5 so good luck to you 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.330
 if you can go much more mature in 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:51.670
 frankly I do not produce arrived 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.670
 more at concentrations 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:07.990
 here I have a defense in case 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.990
 no I lost my defense and here at 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.480
 I had a double to tell you but there 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.130
 but the sound when you make cuts 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.320
 and it's just terrible that's what makes me 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.490
 startle each time so there 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.840
 you see so I lost the hand 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.210
 right and I also wanted to show you 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.660
 when you take too much time to 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:28.330
 take my ticket yesterday yeah here you go 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.330
 cut like that automatically 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.940
 it annoys me because every time I 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.220
 joke 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 here is I hope river sava line or fcz 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:50.800
 and even aspire decentration ya twenty 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.820
 six thousand dollars 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.959
 after you also have money bonuses 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.730
 sometimes 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.530
 there, for example, to know how 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.410
 it gets harder and more voices were yesterday 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.730
 has two guillotine I'll make me 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.500
 cups and now I managed to nab 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.209
 flow at the same time 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.680
 so here I froze them it's very 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:20.370
 well I hurry look here I have 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.540
 could win thanks to the stuff that froze 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:33.510
 and of course guillotine which are 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:36.239
 young and no or miss at billere and 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.050
 here I managed to go up to 106 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.239
 thousand dollars 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.130
 so the question I also ask myself 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.780
 will you be able to sacrifice 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.730
 one of your kidneys to have this sum 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.350
 I think not about those at the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.350
 next video and urban friends all
