many<00:01:03.780> takes<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.229> took<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> do<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
many takes it took that do to get that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.760 
many takes it took that do to get that
shot<00:01:05.309> though<00:01:05.750> but<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> gotta<00:01:06.990> say<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> agree<00:01:07.590> with

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
shot though but I gotta say I agree with

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.580 
shot though but I gotta say I agree with
you<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.250> not<00:01:08.939> one<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:09.900> favorite<00:01:10.260> Maps

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you this is not one of my favorite Maps

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.170 
you this is not one of my favorite Maps
I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.070> flat<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.549> straight<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.119> that

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
I think it's flat and straight and that

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760 
I think it's flat and straight and that
makes<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> sort<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.810> tactically<00:01:13.380> less

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
makes it sort of tactically less

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.990 
makes it sort of tactically less
interesting<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.640> agree<00:01:15.150> now<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.750> said<00:01:17.000> what's

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
loader and that's all it's like

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.770 
loader and that's all it's like
at<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.409> reasonable<00:01:57.220> pace<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:57.790> so<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:57.939> miss<00:01:58.270> it

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
at a reasonable pace and so I miss it

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.630 
at a reasonable pace and so I miss it
he's<00:01:59.290> shuffling<00:01:59.979> around<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:02.530> didn't<00:02:03.490> get

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
he's shuffling around so I didn't get

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.429 
he's shuffling around so I didn't get
footage<00:02:03.939> of<00:02:04.180> it<00:02:04.299> but<00:02:04.479> at<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.020> end<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.350> this

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
footage of it but at the end of this

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.200 
footage of it but at the end of this
match<00:02:05.619> you'll<00:02:05.920> see<00:02:06.039> a<00:02:06.070> quick<00:02:06.340> glimpse<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.939> found

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
match you'll see a quick glimpse I found

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.529 
match you'll see a quick glimpse I found
a<00:02:07.329> valve<00:02:07.659> at<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.590> end<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.039> mat<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:10.030> maybe

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
a valve at the end of the mat so maybe

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.330 
a valve at the end of the mat so maybe
it's<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:11.020> Dawnbreaker<00:02:11.530> where<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.069> turn<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
it's like Dawnbreaker where you turn the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's like Dawnbreaker where you turn the
valves<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:12.849> each<00:02:12.970> side<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.360> then<00:02:13.450> there's<00:02:13.599> a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
valves on each side and then there's a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.990 
valves on each side and then there's a
big<00:02:14.050> explosion<00:02:14.410> yeah<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.400> maybe<00:02:15.700> they've

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
big explosion yeah so maybe they've

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.280 
big explosion yeah so maybe they've
built<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.720> something<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.560> actually<00:02:19.290> what

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
built in something that is actually what

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.280 
built in something that is actually what
would<00:02:20.440> be<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.709> right<00:02:20.860> way<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.099> put<00:02:21.340> this

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
would be the right way to put this

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.780 
would be the right way to put this
deserving<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.500> an<00:02:23.650> oil<00:02:23.860> refinery<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.670 
I think just for this expansion though
right<00:02:42.459> well<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.750> they<00:02:43.989> cut<00:02:44.170> an<00:02:44.260> overall

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
right well I think they cut an overall

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.289 
right well I think they cut an overall
deal<00:02:44.860> because<00:02:45.040> number<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.310> PlayStation<00:02:45.880> 3<00:02:46.150> had

our other three videos second assault is

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.710 
our other three videos second assault is
all<00:02:59.859> about<00:03:00.190> rehashing<00:03:00.940> fan<00:03:01.120> favorites<00:03:01.600> I

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
all about rehashing fan favorites I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.449 
all about rehashing fan favorites I
think<00:03:02.019> if<00:03:02.109> you<00:03:02.230> were<00:03:02.320> already<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.920> fan<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.220> these

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
think if you were already a fan of these

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.550 
think if you were already a fan of these
maps<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.030> will<00:03:04.060> want<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.540> return<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.019> them<00:03:05.230> yes

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
maps you will want to return to them yes

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.800 
maps you will want to return to them yes
if<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.310> were<00:03:06.430> not<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.640> fan<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.030> these<00:03:07.120> Maps<00:03:07.359> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
if you were not a fan of these Maps the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.840 
if you were not a fan of these Maps the
only<00:03:08.140> one<00:03:08.320> I<00:03:08.350> think<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.890> will<00:03:09.040> draw<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.489> in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
only one I think that will draw you in

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.699 
only one I think that will draw you in
is<00:03:10.000> Caspian<00:03:10.570> because<00:03:11.079> they've<00:03:11.230> had<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> major

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
is Caspian because they've had a major
