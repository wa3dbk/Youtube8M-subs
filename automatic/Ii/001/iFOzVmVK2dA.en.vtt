you guys about the truth exotic rocket
launcher<00:00:07.049> I've<00:00:07.290> had<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.740> one<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:07.950> quite<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
launcher I've had this one for quite a

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.799 
launcher I've had this one for quite a
while<00:00:08.429> now<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.700> it's<00:00:08.940> fully<00:00:09.120> upgraded<00:00:09.570> so<00:00:09.690> you

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
while now so it's fully upgraded so you

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.020 
while now so it's fully upgraded so you
can<00:00:09.960> see<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.410> benefits<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.950> has<00:00:11.010> if<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.519> put

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
can see the benefits it has if you put

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.249 
can see the benefits it has if you put
your<00:00:12.150> time<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.540> effort<00:00:12.719> into<00:00:12.840> getting<00:00:13.049> this

upgraded<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.429> now<00:00:14.580> let's<00:00:14.790> go<00:00:14.880> over<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> perks

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
upgraded so now let's go over the perks

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.840 
upgraded so now let's go over the perks
and<00:00:16.170> upgrades<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.920> everything<00:00:17.310> good<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.609> it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and upgrades and everything good that it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
and upgrades and everything good that it
has<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.350> only<00:00:19.590> exotic<00:00:20.279> weapon<00:00:20.609> that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
has it is the only exotic weapon that

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.550 
has it is the only exotic weapon that
has<00:00:20.850> avoid<00:00:21.060> damage<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.140> always<00:00:22.260> handy

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
has avoid damage so it's always handy

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.099 
has avoid damage so it's always handy
having<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.420> let's<00:00:24.420> see<00:00:24.539> what<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.750> says<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
having it and let's see what it says is

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.950 
having it and let's see what it says is
it's<00:00:25.380> where<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.160> seek<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.730> Lamar<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.720> don't

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
it's where you seek it Lamar I don't

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
it's where you seek it Lamar I don't
know<00:00:28.019> who<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.170> guy<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.410> door<00:00:28.830> girl<00:00:29.510> how<00:00:30.510> was

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
know who that guy is door girl how was

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
know who that guy is door girl how was
two<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> mag<00:00:31.500> fire<00:00:31.890> rate<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.250> quite<00:00:32.460> low

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
two in the mag fire rate is quite low

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.639 
two in the mag fire rate is quite low
but<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.570> rocket<00:00:33.960> launcher<00:00:34.320> blast

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
but then it is a rocket launcher blast

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
but then it is a rocket launcher blast
radius<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.190> pretty<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.550> full<00:00:35.880> velocity<00:00:36.570> is

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
radius is pretty much full velocity is

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
radius is pretty much full velocity is
really<00:00:37.469> high<00:00:37.590> stability<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.250> good<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> reload

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
really high stability is good and reload

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
really high stability is good and reload
is<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.420> quick<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.440> start<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.950> left

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
is really quick so start for the left

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.830 
is really quick so start for the left
here<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.610> hard<00:00:41.910> launch<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.570> velocity

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
here we have hard launch more velocity

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.190 
here we have hard launch more velocity
and<00:00:43.260> blast<00:00:43.469> radius<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:44.100> increased<00:00:44.430> recoil

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
and blast radius for increased recoil

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.590 
and blast radius for increased recoil
warhead<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.440> veneers<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.670> velocity<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
warhead of veneers more velocity and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.319 
warhead of veneers more velocity and
blast<00:00:48.809> radius<00:00:49.050> increased<00:00:49.710> recoil<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.340> then

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
blast radius increased recoil and then

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
blast radius increased recoil and then
we<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.629> combined<00:00:52.140> launch<00:00:52.500> greatly<00:00:53.460> reduced

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
we have combined launch greatly reduced

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090 
we have combined launch greatly reduced
recoil<00:00:53.940> significant<00:00:54.930> penalty<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> velocity

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
recoil significant penalty to velocity

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.580 
recoil significant penalty to velocity
now<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> want<00:00:56.940> more<00:00:57.510> stability<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.440> can

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
now if you want more stability you can

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770 
now if you want more stability you can
obviously<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.489> have<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.539> one

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
obviously get that one I have this one

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
obviously get that one I have this one
just<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:01.859> more<00:01:02.070> velocity<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
just because it's got more velocity and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
just because it's got more velocity and
blast<00:01:02.910> radius<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.350> you've<00:01:04.500> got<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
blast radius and then you've got that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.380 
blast radius and then you've got that
one<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.280> seemed<00:01:05.460> grenades<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
one is well over seemed grenades and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
one is well over seemed grenades and
horseshoes<00:01:06.530> rockets<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.799> weapon<00:01:08.100> will

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
horseshoes rockets from this weapon will

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.399 
horseshoes rockets from this weapon will
destiny<00:01:08.610> early<00:01:09.119> based<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.659> proximity<00:01:09.869> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
destiny early based on proximity to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
destiny early based on proximity to
targets<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:11.430> obviously<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
targets now obviously this is kind of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.750 
targets now obviously this is kind of
annoying<00:01:13.409> sometimes<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.369> you're<00:01:14.520> trying

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
annoying sometimes so if you're trying

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.090 
annoying sometimes so if you're trying
to<00:01:14.880> shoot<00:01:15.119> like<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> big<00:01:15.570> go<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.409> distance<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
to shoot like a big go in a distance and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.940 
to shoot like a big go in a distance and
a<00:01:17.220> little<00:01:17.549> guy<00:01:17.670> runs<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> front<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.950> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a little guy runs in front the the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.350 
a little guy runs in front the the
rocket<00:01:20.250> would<00:01:20.369> actually<00:01:20.729> aim<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> little

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
rocket would actually aim for the little

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.359 
rocket would actually aim for the little
guy<00:01:21.509> take<00:01:21.900> him<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.290> instead<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.979> big<00:01:23.189> like

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
guy take him out instead of the big like

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.630 
guy take him out instead of the big like
that<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:24.090> go<00:01:24.659> further<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.400> be

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
that they go further back so it can be

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.080 
that they go further back so it can be
annoying<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.040> upgrade<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> damage<00:01:29.520> obviously

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
annoying and upgrade to damage obviously

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
annoying and upgrade to damage obviously
and<00:01:30.390> then<00:01:30.540> you've<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.689> javelin<00:01:31.290> increases

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
and then you've got javelin increases

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.789 
and then you've got javelin increases
warhead<00:01:32.369> velocity<00:01:32.939> heavy<00:01:33.659> payload<00:01:34.200> increases

reload this weapon even faster but as

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
reload this weapon even faster but as
you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.590> high<00:01:40.740> reload

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you can see it's got really high reload

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
you can see it's got really high reload
speed<00:01:41.549> anyway<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.509> best<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.079> upgrade

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
speed anyway so it's best to upgrade

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.200 
speed anyway so it's best to upgrade
something<00:01:44.009> else<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.369> obviously<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.030> want

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
something else but obviously if you want

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.350 
something else but obviously if you want
the<00:01:45.360> faster<00:01:45.750> reload<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.259> go<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.680> one

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
the faster reload then go for that one

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.179 
the faster reload then go for that one
prototype<00:01:48.360> true<00:01:48.810> seeker<00:01:49.229> rounds<00:01:49.770> fired<00:01:49.979> from

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
prototype true seeker rounds fired from

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.530 
prototype true seeker rounds fired from
this<00:01:50.310> weapon<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.759> seek<00:01:50.939> their<00:01:51.149> targets

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
this weapon and seek their targets

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.300 
this weapon and seek their targets
aggressively<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.560> basically<00:01:52.979> means

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
aggressively now that basically means

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.230 
aggressively now that basically means
like<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:55.079> firing<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:56.240> rocket

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
like if you if you're firing a rocket

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.109 
like if you if you're firing a rocket
and<00:01:57.630> then<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.250> enemy<00:01:59.250> runs<00:01:59.520> away<00:01:59.759> or<00:01:59.939> like

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
and then the enemy runs away or like

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
and then the enemy runs away or like
hides<00:02:00.420> behind<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.810> wall<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.259> rocket<00:02:01.649> would

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
hides behind a wall the rocket would

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.340 
hides behind a wall the rocket would
actually<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.399> smack<00:02:02.670> into<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.030> wall

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
actually just smack into the wall

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.010 
actually just smack into the wall
because<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.619> aggressively<00:02:05.659> targets<00:02:06.659> them<00:02:06.840> but

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
because it aggressively targets them but

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.779 
because it aggressively targets them but
if<00:02:07.110> they're<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.649> over<00:02:07.860> i<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.039> open<00:02:08.220> area

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
if they're if it's over i can open area

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.010 
if they're if it's over i can open area
then<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.119> obviously<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.509> good<00:02:09.660> thing<00:02:09.899> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
then that's obviously a good thing and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.740 
then that's obviously a good thing and
but<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.520> annoying<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.090> i<00:02:12.239> will<00:02:12.450> try<00:02:12.660> i

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
but it can be annoying but i will try i

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
but it can be annoying but i will try i
try<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.200> show<00:02:13.470> that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
try and show that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
try and show that
this<00:02:13.860> video<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:14.820> chance<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.840> our

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
this video if I get chance and then our

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.130 
this video if I get chance and then our
saw<00:02:16.320> just<00:02:16.650> upgrades<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.400> damage<00:02:17.900> right<00:02:18.900> let's

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
saw just upgrades to damage right let's

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.590 
saw just upgrades to damage right let's
go<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.590> if<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.920> find<00:02:20.160> stuff<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> shoot<00:02:23.600> so

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
go see if we can find stuff to shoot so

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.430 
go see if we can find stuff to shoot so
let<00:02:24.900> me<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:26.420> right<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.870> example<00:02:27.960> if

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
let me just see right so for example if

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
let me just see right so for example if
there<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.770> an<00:02:28.890> enemy<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.340> hovering<00:02:29.970> around

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
there was an enemy like hovering around

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.650 
there was an enemy like hovering around
here<00:02:30.690> or<00:02:31.350> behind<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.280> rock<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.270> jumped

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
here or behind this rock and you jumped

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.110 
here or behind this rock and you jumped
up<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.990> fire<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.370> enemy<00:02:35.790> moved

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
up to fire and then the enemy moved

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.510 
up to fire and then the enemy moved
closer<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.750> water<00:02:37.050> rocket<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.980> rocket<00:02:38.250> would

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
closer to water rocket the rocket would

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.630 
closer to water rocket the rocket would
probably<00:02:38.820> hit<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.320> boulder<00:02:40.320> there<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.740> so

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
probably hit the boulder there and so

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
probably hit the boulder there and so
let's<00:02:41.820> just<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.060> what<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.270> looks<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.510> for

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
let's just see what it looks like for

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
let's just see what it looks like for
firing<00:02:42.930> this<00:02:43.170> thing<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.420> yeah<00:02:45.540> big<00:02:45.960> explosion

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680

dead bonus alright well what the hell

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.370 
dead bonus alright well what the hell
tsunami<00:03:10.140> oh<00:03:11.090> happy<00:03:12.090> Oh<00:03:14.090> idiot<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:16.020> let's<00:03:16.230> go

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
tsunami oh happy Oh idiot right let's go

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.220 
tsunami oh happy Oh idiot right let's go
up<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:16.740> all<00:03:17.460> right<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.330> stoop<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.020> one

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
up here all right so it's stoop this one

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.140 
up here all right so it's stoop this one
but<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.930> quite<00:03:22.230> aggressive<00:03:22.800> it<00:03:23.070> but<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
but it is quite aggressive it but like I

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.570 
but it is quite aggressive it but like I
think<00:03:24.630> if<00:03:24.750> Y<00:03:24.990> is<00:03:25.050> like<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.709> Rockets<00:03:26.070> shoot<00:03:26.370> off

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
think if Y is like the Rockets shoot off

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.310 
think if Y is like the Rockets shoot off
a<00:03:26.790> lot<00:03:27.060> quicker<00:03:27.390> than<00:03:27.630> our<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.020> rocket

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
a lot quicker than our the rocket

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.980 
a lot quicker than our the rocket
launches<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:28.830> I've<00:03:28.920> found<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.810> I'm<00:03:30.810> going

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
launches that I've found and I'm going

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.390 
launches that I've found and I'm going
to<00:03:31.050> try<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.200> find<00:03:31.440> some<00:03:31.680> more<00:03:31.800> enemies<00:03:32.220> for

that because of the aggressive tracking
on<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.090> weapon<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:28.170> you<00:04:28.380> can<00:04:28.620> lose<00:04:28.890> quite<00:04:29.160> a

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
on this weapon that you can lose quite a

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.200 
on this weapon that you can lose quite a
few<00:04:29.490> rockets<00:04:30.150> and<00:04:30.330> wasting<00:04:31.760> see<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.880> shoot

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
few rockets and wasting see you shoot

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.900 
few rockets and wasting see you shoot
out<00:04:33.390> there<00:04:33.860> as<00:04:34.860> you<00:04:35.100> can<00:04:35.220> see<00:04:35.430> it<00:04:35.550> turned

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
out there as you can see it turned
