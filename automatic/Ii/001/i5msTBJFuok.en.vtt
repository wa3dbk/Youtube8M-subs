has<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:30.260> one<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.440> relatives<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.040> had

cancer and they could take care of him I
think<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.489> was<00:03:35.579> dr.<00:03:35.880> Baltar's<00:03:36.239> telling<00:03:36.630> them

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
think it was dr. Baltar's telling them

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.030 
think it was dr. Baltar's telling them
he<00:03:37.260> knew<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:39.290> alternative<00:03:40.290> medicine<00:03:40.470> he<00:03:40.859> could

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
he knew of alternative medicine he could

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.629 
he knew of alternative medicine he could
get<00:03:41.239> when<00:03:42.239> they<00:03:42.389> made<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:43.019> him<00:03:43.489> he<00:03:44.489> was

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
get when they made it for him he was

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.460 
get when they made it for him he was
already<00:03:44.880> told<00:03:45.599> that<00:03:45.810> he<00:03:45.900> was<00:03:45.989> going<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:46.290> die

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
already told that he was going to die

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.520 
already told that he was going to die
and<00:03:47.250> he<00:03:47.310> now<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.750> know<00:03:48.870> he's<00:03:49.139> still<00:03:49.349> running

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and he now you know he's still running

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.520 
and he now you know he's still running
around<00:03:49.880> so<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.389> guess<00:03:51.660> he<00:03:51.810> didn't<00:03:52.109> die<00:03:52.260> he

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
around so I guess he didn't die he

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.879 
around so I guess he didn't die he
worked<00:03:53.750> like<00:03:54.750> pass<00:03:55.019> on<00:03:55.260> what<00:03:55.440> I've<00:03:55.560> learned
