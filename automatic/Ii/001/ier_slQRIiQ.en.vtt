that's<00:00:42.739> not<00:00:42.949> very<00:00:42.980> good<00:00:43.220> is<00:00:43.430> it<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:44.059> point<00:00:44.360> in

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
that's not very good is it the point in

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.000 
that's not very good is it the point in
the<00:00:44.510> game<00:00:44.540> where<00:00:44.720> I<00:00:44.930> realized<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.650> Leafs<00:00:45.830> were

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
the game where I realized the Leafs were

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.680 
the game where I realized the Leafs were
in<00:00:46.100> big<00:00:46.340> trouble<00:00:46.370> is<00:00:46.879> when<00:00:47.090> they<00:00:47.269> had<00:00:47.480> that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
in big trouble is when they had that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.979 
in big trouble is when they had that
significant<00:00:48.650> two-man<00:00:49.070> advantage<00:00:49.100> and

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
significant two-man advantage and

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.509 
significant two-man advantage and
ultimately<00:00:50.989> did<00:00:51.290> nothing<00:00:51.650> with<00:00:51.769> it<00:00:51.830> and<00:00:52.160> even

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
ultimately did nothing with it and even

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:53.920 
ultimately did nothing with it and even
in<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:52.730> minute<00:00:53.000> or<00:00:53.090> two<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.300> follow<00:00:53.629> they<00:00:53.870> were

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
in the minute or two to follow they were

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.600 
in the minute or two to follow they were
one<00:00:54.170> man<00:00:54.379> down<00:00:54.620> there<00:00:54.860> were<00:00:54.979> two<00:00:55.159> men<00:00:55.370> down

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
one man down there were two men down

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.729 
one man down there were two men down
their<00:00:55.940> best<00:00:56.180> defenders<00:00:56.839> have<00:00:57.229> got<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.710> be

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
their best defenders have got to be

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.500 
their best defenders have got to be

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
that still the Leafs just couldn't

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.329 
that still the Leafs just couldn't
generate<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.290> momentum<00:01:03.680> they<00:01:03.799> needed<00:01:04.129> it

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339
