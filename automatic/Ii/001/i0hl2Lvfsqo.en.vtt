I'm<00:01:48.840> gonna<00:01:48.930> leave<00:01:49.110> them<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.439> plastic

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
I'm gonna leave them in the plastic

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
I'm gonna leave them in the plastic
casing<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.579> fun<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.930> it's

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
casing just for fun and because it's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.600 
casing just for fun and because it's
probably<00:01:52.290> easier<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.710> drink<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.040> way<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.460> it

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
probably easier to drink that way but it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.899 
probably easier to drink that way but it
stays<00:01:53.820> chilled<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.770> gonna<00:01:55.890> do<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
stays chilled so what I'm gonna do is I

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.149 
stays chilled so what I'm gonna do is I
need<00:01:57.060> all<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.329> equipment<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.899> I'm<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:58.979> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
need all the equipment is I'm going to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
need all the equipment is I'm going to
mix<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.939> cocktail<00:02:00.390> shake<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.380> ice<00:02:01.560> pour

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
mix the cocktail shake it with ice pour

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.039 
mix the cocktail shake it with ice pour
it<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.610> these<00:02:02.759> ice<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.180> guys<00:02:03.360> here<00:02:03.659> we're

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it in these ice little guys here we're

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.380 
it in these ice little guys here we're
ready<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> quarter<00:02:04.680> ounce<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> that's<00:02:06.270> not

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
ready to a quarter ounce so that's not

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.469 
ready to a quarter ounce so that's not
really<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.719> much<00:02:07.700> but<00:02:08.700> since<00:02:09.239> there's<00:02:09.420> four

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
really that much but since there's four

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.750 
really that much but since there's four
different<00:02:09.690> alcohols<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.649> should<00:02:10.920> make<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.400> nice

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
different alcohols it should make a nice

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.650 
different alcohols it should make a nice
little<00:02:12.060> drink

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
little drink

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.310 
little drink
and<00:02:13.290> if<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.560> have<00:02:13.710> more<00:02:13.950> than<00:02:14.130> enough<00:02:15.320> should

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and if we have more than enough should

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.660 
and if we have more than enough should
be<00:02:16.440> an<00:02:16.560> ounce<00:02:16.680> full<00:02:17.010> because<00:02:17.220> there's<00:02:17.430> four<00:02:17.640> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
be an ounce full because there's four of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.890 
be an ounce full because there's four of
them<00:02:17.790> there's<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.210> quarter<00:02:18.510> ounce<00:02:18.690> so<00:02:18.810> you

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
them there's a quarter ounce so you

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.940 
them there's a quarter ounce so you
should<00:02:19.050> end<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.290> with<00:02:19.410> an<00:02:19.500> ounce<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:19.890> we

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
should end up with an ounce or so we

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
should end up with an ounce or so we
fill<00:02:20.130> both<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.460> these<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:21.330> science<00:02:21.990> has<00:02:22.050> proven

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
fill both of these if science has proven

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.710 
fill both of these if science has proven
to<00:02:23.000> tell<00:02:24.000> me<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.210> right<00:02:24.330> things<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:27.510> just

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
to tell me the right things it just

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.910 
to tell me the right things it just
doesn't<00:02:27.960> seem<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.350> nice<00:02:28.530> because<00:02:28.770> they're

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
doesn't seem like a nice because they're

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.220 
doesn't seem like a nice because they're
so<00:02:29.100> little<00:02:29.460> oh<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:32.010> smell<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.400> hazelnut<00:02:32.850> now

so little oh I smell the hazelnut now

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.050 
so little oh I smell the hazelnut now
he's<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.470> not<00:02:34.650> in<00:02:34.860> chocolate<00:02:35.520> with<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> little

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
he's all not in chocolate with a little

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.280 
he's all not in chocolate with a little
coffee<00:02:36.480> liqueur<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:38.390> little<00:02:39.390> more<00:02:39.570> almonds

coffee liqueur a little more almonds

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
coffee liqueur a little more almonds
this<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.680> gonna<00:02:40.830> be<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> nutty<00:02:41.550> little<00:02:41.940> American

this is gonna be a nutty little American
dream<00:02:44.240> maybe<00:02:45.240> they<00:02:45.390> could<00:02:45.540> have<00:02:45.600> called<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.960> a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
dream maybe they could have called it a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.450 
dream maybe they could have called it a
nutty<00:02:46.380> American<00:02:46.890> dream<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.130> don't<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.340> what

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
nutty American dream I don't know what

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.980 
nutty American dream I don't know what
makes<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.790> American<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:49.370> don't<00:02:50.370> think<00:02:50.400> all

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
makes it American I don't think all

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.540 
makes it American I don't think all
Americans<00:02:51.990> like<00:02:52.560> nuts<00:02:52.800> because<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.100> have<00:02:53.280> nut

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
Americans like nuts because we have nut

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.950 
Americans like nuts because we have nut
trees<00:02:53.820> or<00:02:54.180> whatever<00:02:54.510> they<00:02:55.080> grow<00:02:55.320> on<00:02:55.350> nut<00:02:56.310> trees

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
trees or whatever they grow on nut trees

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.250 
trees or whatever they grow on nut trees
nut<00:02:57.960> cheese<00:02:59.120> nuts<00:03:00.120> totally<00:03:00.720> growing<00:03:01.050> a<00:03:01.110> tree

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
nut cheese nuts totally growing a tree

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.730 
nut cheese nuts totally growing a tree
or<00:03:01.500> underground<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:02.400> remember<00:03:03.650> if<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
or underground I don't remember if you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.870 
or underground I don't remember if you
know<00:03:04.860> where<00:03:05.010> nuts<00:03:05.220> are<00:03:05.370> growing<00:03:05.610> let<00:03:05.730> me<00:03:05.790> know

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
know where nuts are growing let me know

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.690 
know where nuts are growing let me know
huh<00:03:09.410> it<00:03:10.410> probably<00:03:10.740> does<00:03:10.890> vary<00:03:11.160> where<00:03:11.490> nuts

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
huh it probably does vary where nuts

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.090 
huh it probably does vary where nuts
come<00:03:12.000> from<00:03:12.290> where<00:03:13.290> do<00:03:13.350> your<00:03:13.470> nuts<00:03:13.650> come<00:03:13.860> from

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
come from where do your nuts come from

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.920 
come from where do your nuts come from
where's<00:03:14.520> my<00:03:14.670> top<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.240> you<00:03:15.330> hit<00:03:15.480> pass<00:03:15.690> that

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
where's my top can you hit pass that

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.920 
where's my top can you hit pass that
over<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.230> me<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:20.220> already<00:03:20.430> grabbed<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.930> so

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
over to me you already grabbed it so

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.590 
over to me you already grabbed it so
we're<00:03:22.050> gonna<00:03:22.140> shake<00:03:22.440> that<00:03:22.710> up<00:03:26.330> little<00:03:27.330> small

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
we're gonna shake that up little small

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.730 
we're gonna shake that up little small
in<00:03:27.780> there<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.110> it<00:03:28.200> should<00:03:28.380> be<00:03:28.560> nice<00:03:28.680> and

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
in there but it should be nice and

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:50.230 
in there but it should be nice and
chilly<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:47.180> didn't<00:03:48.180> bring<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:48.360> over<00:03:48.660> right<00:03:48.720> now

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
chilly I didn't bring it over right now

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.150 
chilly I didn't bring it over right now
so<00:03:52.160> we<00:03:53.160> make<00:03:53.370> two<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.670> these<00:03:53.880> micro<00:03:54.630> shots

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
so we make two of these micro shots

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.720 
so we make two of these micro shots
looks<00:03:56.160> kind<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.430> like<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.580> dark<00:03:56.880> beer<00:03:57.240> oh<00:03:58.730> it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
looks kind of like a dark beer oh it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.890 
looks kind of like a dark beer oh it
looks<00:03:59.910> like<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.180> makes<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.390> little<00:04:00.480> more<00:04:00.690> than<00:04:00.870> I

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
looks like it makes a little more than I

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.380 
looks like it makes a little more than I
thought<00:04:01.850> that's<00:04:02.850> physics<00:04:03.570> messing<00:04:03.990> with<00:04:04.020> you

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
thought that's physics messing with you

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.010 
thought that's physics messing with you
so<00:04:06.470> it's<00:04:07.470> kind<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.680> slushy<00:04:08.630> what<00:04:09.630> you<00:04:09.750> can't

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
so it's kind of slushy what you can't

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.450 
so it's kind of slushy what you can't
see<00:04:10.290> but<00:04:10.530> you've<00:04:10.680> already<00:04:10.830> seen<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.370> was

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
see but you've already seen it so it was

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.450 
see but you've already seen it so it was
made<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> cut<00:04:12.360> like<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.720> dark<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.460> brown

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
made is it cut like that dark and brown

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.380
