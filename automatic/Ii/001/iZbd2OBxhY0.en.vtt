move it no matter how hard we tried sure

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.980 
move it no matter how hard we tried sure
enough<00:02:24.100> once<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.310> woke<00:02:25.520> up<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.390> started

enough once it woke up it started
walking<00:02:27.590> through<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.890> building<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.240> get

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
walking through the building just to get

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.750 
walking through the building just to get

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
we still have the fence but at any time

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.220 
we still have the fence but at any time

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
they could walk up and crush the Visitor

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.310 
they could walk up and crush the Visitor
Center<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.210> have<00:03:05.210> faith<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.230> they<00:03:07.010> won't
