00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello everybody welcome to another video 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 What does gustavo teacher say about the blog? 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.950
 google or even with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 in today's class we will address the function 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.300
 very cool of the core that the possibility 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.760
 to do slide show in a way 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.650
 very simple an open program that we 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.210
 Let's do initially is import the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 work material 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 then in the project panel you give two 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 clicks on this area 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 navigate to the part where your 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.440
 images selects them all 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 example in addition to the images or 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.329
 also import an audio file that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.190
 will serve as a background target with 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.180
 imported material we will now create a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.950
 slideshow 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 I usually do the following I 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.370
 I select all the images and then 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 selected I come in the file menu of my 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.949
 design show you can still use the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.020
 shortcut against v 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.000
 see how it was created slide show 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.039
 places a number here for each one 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.280
 of these slides in this case from 1 to 14 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.380
 because we have 14 images and we can still 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.320
 make some changes as per 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.540
 example is to change the display order 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.580
 these photos here 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.409
 if I want to, for example, put this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.659
 third image as first I go 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 apply on the same hold and drag 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.470
 to the first position 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.259
 if you want to put this second with this 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.970
 the latter as the second safe and secure 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.369
 dragged the second position 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.470
 then see that it is something extremely 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.810
 simple to do here in the panel 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.090
 monitor you can give a player observe 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 the previous one as it is running out of stadium 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.930
 at first it puts the time of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.650
 duration of six seconds for each 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.740
 Image 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.720
 maybe we have the slideshow rolling there 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.750
 it's just very simple we have a picture 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.320
 and a dry cut between images and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.470
 other 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.470
 let's make a good modification 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.469
 come here slide show options you can 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.380
 for example putting an audio of hunger 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.299
 so you will click this button 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.960
 hold and drag to the audio that is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.330
 in your project dashboard that we now have a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.800
 background audio always give us already 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.800
 we can hear and we crave 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.500
 Ok, so cool , we still have it. 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.740
 two more options 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.870
 this first box if you mark it 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.450
 makes your show design stay with the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.220
 same time as the silvio 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.950
 in this case we have an oil file 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.650
 four minutes and 45 seconds then 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.240
 marking this box our slideshow 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.500
 will keep this same time of 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.110
 duration 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.930
 see that his landmark here he recalculates the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.820
 time of each slide and it shows you that 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.460
 I teach English since he stayed 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.970
 cadenced and now with 20 seconds and 10 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.500
 fronts also notes that its brand 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.930
 first box the second one stays 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.780
 disabled then uncheck first 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.970
 now I can score this week the second 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.890
 audio option is the audio loop as the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.160
 His own name says that he will be giving 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.460
 on the audio until all the images are 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.620
 displayed next we have option 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.930
 slide the milk where you can determine 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.150
 that manually a duration time for 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.060
 each of those defeats which then 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.250
 select this here and I'll put five 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.560
 for example the nail 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.630
 now our ancestors stayed there with 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.150
 five seconds 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.010
 the next option is defunct 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.650
 come here without any transition and give a 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.570
 dry cut then another image but if 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.450
 You click on this drug - we have here 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.270
 some options among which we occurs 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.780
 under the black the staff uses 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.990
 enough 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.150
 we put here the crosse am ok the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.790
 Truth now comes another preview as it goes 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.790
 stay the serve 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.560
 then note that it is now that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.860
 cut meant a smooth transition 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 among the boys only that it is still the image 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.050
 Static you can put 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.970
 these images by selecting 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.530
 this next option here it will put 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.250
 bread roll 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.709
 edeson to another option if you mark it 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.710
 will make each slide only pass 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.910
 to the next image if you press the 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.860
 forward button 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.080
 I do not particularly like marking 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.730
 stop using this option so always 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.460
 I leave unchecked 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.910
 or we have these settings here 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.810
 Let's go, now, let 's play and let's go. 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:45.440
 that was because the images are now 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.440
 with smooth transition and also smooth transition 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.690
 finally we can still do the 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.030
 next is we can click with the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.740
 right click on one of these images and 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.870
 I came here in the transition option and 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.530
 customize a transition so that it 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.420
 know 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.490
 let's put for example in this third 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.010
 the tradition of black 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.290
 then we default to the prodes listen 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.630
 but in this third it will put the 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.520
 Deputy brief let's see an example 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.470
 then the third slide into the fourth 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.780
 let's have some other time there 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.760
 black see it then let's get started 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.700
 the second year of the second to 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.430
 Third, let's have a project, I'm there. 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.690
 is now from third to fourth 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.690
 everything will come 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:34.300
 ok so people that is if you like 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.340
