there<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.500> here's<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> base<00:01:34.860> i'm<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
there and here's the base i'm going to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.140 
there and here's the base i'm going to
put<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.490> important

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

if<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.630> build<00:01:39.810> cheap<00:01:40.140> stuff

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
if you're going to build cheap stuff

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.260 
if you're going to build cheap stuff
like<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:41.060> I<00:01:42.439> always<00:01:43.460> cut<00:01:44.460> toothpicks<00:01:45.090> in

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
like this I always cut toothpicks in

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.510 
like this I always cut toothpicks in
half<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:45.869> second<00:01:46.290> material<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
half and that's second material so that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.740 
half and that's second material so that
way<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.409> when<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.439> put<00:01:49.799> these<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.250> there

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
way when I when I put these on there

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.310 
way when I when I put these on there
they're<00:01:51.750> gonna

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.780 

those<00:01:59.320> toothpicks<00:01:59.619> are<00:02:00.040> going<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.310> stick<00:02:00.579> up

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
those toothpicks are going to stick up

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.679 
those toothpicks are going to stick up
through<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.740> foam<00:02:03.009> core<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.700> hold<00:02:04.450> them<00:02:04.600> in

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
through the foam core and hold them in

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.160 
through the foam core and hold them in
place<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.960> lot<00:02:05.590> better<00:02:05.890> so<00:02:06.570> okay<00:02:07.570> I'll<00:02:07.780> check

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
place a lot better so okay I'll check

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.479 
place a lot better so okay I'll check
back<00:02:08.380> in<00:02:08.590> when<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:09.069> assembled<00:02:11.430> okay<00:02:12.430> so

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
back in when this is assembled okay so

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.960 
back in when this is assembled okay so
here's<00:02:13.180> both<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.340> buildings<00:02:15.340> assemble

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
here's both of the buildings assemble

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.600 
here's both of the buildings assemble
then<00:02:16.380> those<00:02:17.380> guys<00:02:17.680> are<00:02:17.860> just<00:02:17.980> down<00:02:18.190> there<00:02:18.400> for

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.650 
scale but see I've done the outside of
each<00:02:25.930> building<00:02:26.530> with<00:02:26.769> a<00:02:27.069> little<00:02:27.340> sidewalks

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.920 

and<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:33.430> think<00:02:33.880> these<00:02:34.030> are<00:02:34.090> just<00:02:34.480> about<00:02:34.870> ready

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
and I think these are just about ready

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.789 
and I think these are just about ready
to<00:02:35.319> be<00:02:35.560> painted<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.720> look<00:02:38.290> at<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> back<00:02:38.769> of

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
to be painted you look at the back of

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.100 
to be painted you look at the back of
them<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.519> these<00:02:41.040> these<00:02:42.040> are<00:02:42.100> all<00:02:43.110> removable

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
them here these these are all removable

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.720 
them here these these are all removable
and<00:02:45.269> sit<00:02:46.269> down<00:02:46.299> on<00:02:46.540> there<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.049> haven't<00:02:47.730> decided

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
and sit down on there I haven't decided

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.220 
and sit down on there I haven't decided
yet<00:02:49.209> whether<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.230> want<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:51.540> glue<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.750> stuff<00:02:53.019> in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
yet whether I want to glue this stuff in

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.780 
yet whether I want to glue this stuff in
there<00:02:53.500> or<00:02:53.680> whether<00:02:53.830> I'm<00:02:54.040> just<00:02:54.310> going<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.549> let

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
there or whether I'm just going to let

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.100 
there or whether I'm just going to let
it<00:02:55.860> kind<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.010> float<00:02:57.069> in<00:02:57.489> there<00:02:57.900> probably<00:02:58.900> just

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
it kind of float in there probably just

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.759 
it kind of float in there probably just
let<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.470> float<00:02:59.769> that<00:03:00.130> way<00:03:00.720> it'll<00:03:01.720> store<00:03:02.079> easier

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
let it float that way it'll store easier

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.590 
let it float that way it'll store easier
but<00:03:05.250> yeah<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:08.049> assemblage<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.709> I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
but yeah that's the assemblage and I

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.080 
but yeah that's the assemblage and I
guess<00:03:10.890> I'll<00:03:11.890> show<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.310> show<00:03:12.760> them<00:03:12.820> to<00:03:13.000> you

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
guess I'll show you show them to you

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.789 
guess I'll show you show them to you
