00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.679
 let's try to integrate now the 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.290
 secante locates a lacerating kubica is 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.030
 an integral that again appears a lot 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.970
 in the integrals by substitution 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.740
 trigonometric and you will not be 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.170
 solving every one that seems to you 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.779
 remember the secant and the secant 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.430
 cubic we have to memorize new 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.220
 to ask and that of square secant 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.080
 that the square secant is an anti 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.059
 derived the integral from change 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.410
 square of angle people true 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.070
 then that you have no problem 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.130
 because to solve this we are going to do 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.610
 the trick of separating 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:47.820
 in square secant by secant that is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.010
 we're going to separate it into two factors one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.950
 square and another simple you'll be of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 I agree that this is the same as singing 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.320
 and we're going to secant kubica and we're going to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.140
 try to integrate it by parts 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.720
 then we have to make a and a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.780
 notice that it integrates directly 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.080
 then I will do it as it should and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.479
 I will say then that is equal to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.640
 drying of tit and I'll put your 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.360
 differential and should 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.670
 is equal to square secant of 30 can 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.170
 have here I will put your literal 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:29.020
 here for depriving of here so that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.930
 then integrating the derivative of the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.100
 secant is she herself is sung in the 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.909
 angle by tangent of the angle by in 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.440
 difference 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.210
 sing loudly 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.150
 the square secant component is going to be 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.450
 tangent of the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.380
 and its drift is knowing people blotting 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.480
 then we are ready to do 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.730
 our formula return less the 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.760
 integral should by then look 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.740
 to write secant cubic holds by 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.970
 tit is the same as the integration formula 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.440
 by parts it tells us or by b then a 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.670
 back would be blotting and tangent 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.190
 less the integral must by dv then 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.110
 would be b for the pont of accused and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580
 we have such people and tangent 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.520
 multiplying itself because you will stay 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 square tangent then it would be 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.969
 enchant dt is multiplying the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.980
 square tangent of tit per d 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.859
 we already have as one who says a result 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.549
 this partial is already part of the 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:45.750
 result but we need to solve this 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:47.549
 interest yes and how are we going to do it 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.040
 we are going to have to resort to a 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.260
 trigonometric identity and this one already 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.190
 you know 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.500
 identity agreement says 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.710
 the tangent and the cic are related 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.680
 one more square people of a friend is 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.540
 equal to square shikanti of water by 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.060
 so the square tangent is equal to 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.630
 the square secant minus 1 then 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.220
 let's replace the we would be 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:21.350
 enchant by tangent less the integral 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:25.210
 of secant that multiplies to be sung and 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.430
 square minus 1 for your differential 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.890
 effect our multiplication and already 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.540
 you will be seeing what will happen here 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.370
 then it would be 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:40.540
 it's because of that tango song minus the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.780
 integral conical secant 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.790
 - secant 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.269
 for your differential 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.799
 I do not know if you see it but here we have another 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.409
 time the integral that we were 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.810
 resolving originally that means 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.700
 that is going to be cyclical you remember 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.480
 that little word we saw in integration 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.609
 by parts then we're going to have to 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.450
 separate it into two integrals is going to 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:12.950
 want secant matter less people 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.299
 large people the cubic secant plus minus 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.759
 for less gives you more the integral of the 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.639
 blotting ok and that 's the same here 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:25.220
 Sacate that is equal to public secant of 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.910
 tit by detects then these two are 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.090
 same I'll pass it on the other side with 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.919
 opposite sign here is an equal I can 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.289
 pass it on the other side with a sign 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.930
 otherwise then how many are you going to have 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.240
 here you have one and the other one is going to 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.370
 add you will be two true 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.610
 then we could say that this is what 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.580
 same as twice the integral of the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.919
 cubic ante set of tit by detects and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.919
 this one I'll take it to the other side 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.970
 then we will be blotted 30 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:02.389
 by tangent of the tit plus the integral of 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.360
 the secant is already solved the 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.000
 we solved in another video you remember that 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.120
 we said that it was x 1 but it was a 1 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.789
 convenenciero and already you know it what you 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.770
 does it give you the natural logarithm 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.770
 of the secant 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.570
 ok then and now what will happen 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.700
 because they did not ask me what 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.620
 will integrate the secant kubica twice 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.780
 nothing else they told me member 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.880
 basically funny how I get rid of 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.920
 this 2 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.140
 make this 2 that is multiplying 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.480
 what are you going to happen then we come to 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.900
 our result and the cube eclac 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.490
 of tit is equal to some means you are of 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.760
 agreement that passes dividing as a 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:53.020
 means that things of the enchant by the 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.710
 tangent plus the natural logarithm of the 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.190
 cij before the angle plus the tangent of the 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.400
 more constant angle 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.790
 if you want to memorize the integral of the 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.860
 secante kubica is the integral of the 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.400
 blotter that you already know it involves 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.330
 a natural logarithm sum 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.930
 plus 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:18.509
 multiplication natural homelessness and 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.719
 all divided between 2 ok 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:24.889
 there you have it, we have to memorize it 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.889
 of memory
