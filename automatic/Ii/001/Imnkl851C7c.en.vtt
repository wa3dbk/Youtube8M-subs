what are we looking at when we look at

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.540 
what are we looking at when we look at
the<00:05:02.630> two<00:05:02.960> glasses<00:05:03.260> here<00:05:03.880> well<00:05:06.160> with<00:05:07.160> my<00:05:07.310> shot

I'm<00:05:11.090> looking<00:05:11.330> at<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.900> white<00:05:12.530> line<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:13.070> the

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
I'm looking at the white line is the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.440 
I'm looking at the white line is the
amount<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.200> water<00:05:15.440> volume<00:05:16.010> okay<00:05:16.940> in<00:05:17.180> that

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
amount of water volume okay in that

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.230 
amount of water volume okay in that
twenty<00:05:17.810> two<00:05:17.930> seconds<00:05:18.260> of<00:05:18.350> extraction<00:05:19.030> okay

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
twenty two seconds of extraction okay

the crema above it is what you get from
the<00:05:22.910> extraction<00:05:23.650> so<00:05:24.650> ideally<00:05:25.070> like<00:05:25.310> as<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:25.820> rule

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
the extraction so ideally like as a rule

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.240 
the extraction so ideally like as a rule
of<00:05:26.150> thumb<00:05:26.180> I<00:05:26.630> can<00:05:26.900> tell<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.290> that<00:05:27.500> is<00:05:27.800> going

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
of thumb I can tell that that is going

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.730 
of thumb I can tell that that is going
to<00:05:28.340> be<00:05:28.400> fairly<00:05:28.640> close<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:29.330> what<00:05:29.480> I<00:05:29.510> require<00:05:29.960> for
