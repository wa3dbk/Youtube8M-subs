00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
try and get everyone a dig deep I think

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.960 
try and get everyone a dig deep I think
that's<00:00:25.439> that's<00:00:26.160> pretty<00:00:26.460> well<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.580> principle

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
that's that's pretty well the principle

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.640 
that's that's pretty well the principle
behind<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.019> throughout<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> tournament

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
behind it but throughout the tournament

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.169 
behind it but throughout the tournament
I<00:00:28.859> think<00:00:29.070> you'll<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.220> things<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.090> an

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I think you'll see things but it's an

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.299 
I think you'll see things but it's an
evolving<00:00:30.500> you'll<00:00:31.500> evolve<00:00:31.769> over<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> two

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
evolving you'll evolve over the two

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.670 
evolving you'll evolve over the two
weeks<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.200> such<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> sudden

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
weeks because this is such a sudden

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.459 
weeks because this is such a sudden
thing<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.610> happen<00:00:35.969> oh<00:00:36.230> I'd<00:00:37.230> like<00:00:37.380> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
thing to have happen oh I'd like to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.540 
thing to have happen oh I'd like to
think<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.829> raise<00:00:37.980> close<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> million

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
think we can raise close to a million

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.290 
think we can raise close to a million
dollars<00:00:38.940> yeah<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:40.100> hope<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:42.090> seems

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
dollars yeah I hope so it just seems

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
dollars yeah I hope so it just seems
such<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> small<00:00:43.050> insignificant<00:00:43.770> amount<00:00:44.370> when

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
such a small insignificant amount when

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
such a small insignificant amount when
you<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.570> billions<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.260> billions

people<00:01:44.369> roll<00:01:44.820> into<00:01:45.119> town<00:01:45.330> understand<00:01:45.899> what's

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
people roll into town understand what's

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.279 
people roll into town understand what's
going<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:47.360> think<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.780> give<00:01:49.170> him

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
going on I think you have on give him

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.350 
going on I think you have on give him
behind<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.820> think<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.030> fully

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
behind it I don't think we fully

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.999 
behind it I don't think we fully
understand<00:01:51.990> what's<00:01:52.170> going<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.470> yet<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.740> think

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
understand what's going on yet I think

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
understand what's going on yet I think
you<00:01:53.070> won't<00:01:53.220> realize<00:01:53.520> until<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> waters

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you won't realize until all the waters

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.730 
you won't realize until all the waters
were<00:01:54.509> seeded<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.640> I<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.380> that's<00:01:58.560> going

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
were seeded and I I think that's going

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.160 
were seeded and I I think that's going
to<00:01:58.830> be<00:01:58.950> there<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.390> know<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.539> everyone<00:02:00.929> going
