00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.080
 again want to feed the beast with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.000
 of course and last time I was here 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.849
 been busy with the graph secretly 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.290
 and now I'm going to show some cools well 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.870
 I do not mean that the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.060
 do not rest course but as if this is 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.330
 very very fat i am going to show this once 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.850
 his want son dam power of craft 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.470
 how you want to pronounce it I am still going 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.000
 don't let syrian makes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.970
 I will shortly go deeper into the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.750
 because it is so matte 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.940
 in minecraft a point 6 or bicycle bus a 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.149
 point 6 and I play on my channel there 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 is very different thanks to what it is now 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.680
 in then it is in input 4 and that is one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.399
 older version that star everything works very well 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.920
 very different 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.940
 I first have to take a look at how that works 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.219
 everyone is sitting 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 since I'm used to the one point 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.460
 6 version so if you possessed anchor 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 to see that you can on my channel 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 sing if you want 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.960
 In this case we are going to talk about it 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.039
 the one pleasure point 7 version of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.270
 tomcraft 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.979
 is but sit three she I am not precise 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.890
 raid I'm going to show all once I have 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.799
 here the first three because they are because 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.610
 holds fifty on that print 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.210
 peace one of the depth holds show fifty 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 dirty herman of the church 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.430
 because a thousand dirty well these are kind of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 basic because you can't do much 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.860
 great things to do so that late 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.740
 I just take a look outside the cool side 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.340
 wanna fire ashore or lightning 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 won or frost rat or the niles one of 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 activation and the wall or i could 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.439
 straight the first that first the wall or 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.090
 fire i grab slaves to pick it up 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.579
 demonstrate 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.040
 so we will do that today angolo 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.480
 was crazy 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.480
 cold and 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.940
 a driburg 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.800
 ok well it is very simple what this 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.000
 because does want or fire you hear him 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.130
 maybe already 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.710
 he streetfire and that is very cool 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.630
 you can set anyone on fire 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 touch bossuyt stand of course is no 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.590
 Flippers then you can put everyone in one 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.850
 heavy stitches that sees and that is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.770
 of course very epic to just 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.330
 naturally also works on multiplayer 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.670
 servers 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.170
 so you can also put people in fixet on it 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.090
 servers 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.950
 if you are interested in it 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.840
 our shirt itself does them wall of lightning 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.170
 only with less mate the more 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.350
 lightning as the name says i like them 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 very nice full sound effects there 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.620
 and this one shoots 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.170
 lightning of course like you might 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.130
 though being through so see as you see is the 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.160
 ranch 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:52.160
 pass as far as I can and still get there 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.160
 and furthermore do not know if they look 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.019
 yes if you hold shift then you have 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.430
 apparently you get two when they close in the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.920
 be around 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.930
 it's fine not just the following that is 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.090
 the walls frost 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.950
 all sounds very standard 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.129
 yes from the stuck then you know so had this 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.440
 he shoots his things and I have 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.900
 saying it looks pretty funny 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.010
 nice effect nice nice animation 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.019
 of course 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.970
 drops to the ground it is normal 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.829
 because it melts I think the fat 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.079
 of course you do this then it is 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:29.150
 it back again or is not quite right 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.799
 but still it looks cool and 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.739
 why 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.810
 ok the next that is the true role or the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.560
 nine health because 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.109
 and you will see 9 vague base things here 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.700
 in and allow it 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.510
 and yes then maybe vague what the fuck 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.099
 is that she looks a little weird 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.090
 you might think I switch us 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.489
 to 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.049
 survival check a bit nicer because then it works 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.699
 this because if you do the right mouse button 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:03.400
 then you will be some sort of yes beasts 

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:06.199
 i don't know when hans don't come here 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.030
 ah don't fuck because normally they are my you 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.650
 with that 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.389
 I do n't know what doesn't work here 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.690
 it doesn't really matter 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.489
 you have the ideas here cement i place 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.739
 where they what so not exactly 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.859
 how it works you will but me 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.320
 also all away as normal after this 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.449
 used then come from press and that 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.360
 everyone who attacks you is attacking me 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:34.010
 they attack moscow bob's that will be all 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:36.889
 very well it turned out so and are here briefly 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.490
 each having a post on top 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.490
 by creeper 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.649
 so naturally after me 

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:49.679
 yes as you see that cap that goes full 

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:52.679
 steam on attacks and the poor colin 

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:54.689
 who tries sees the rock or the boss 

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:57.059
 attacks because the bed is also kind of 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.329
 bad when you see 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:02.219
 muscle still had purpose drop yes if you 

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:04.079
 who will stand on it and do not work wetsus 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:06.509
 no, because they are post anbos actually 

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:09.419
 deep apps where as you see they do their 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:14.610
 work well so that's nice then I go this one 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:19.079
 just finish the fire or lightning 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.999
 barrage okay well that it fixtures 

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:24.329
 the following is so because or extra patch and 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:26.789
 this one has two thousand expensive pillaji that 

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:29.879
 is more than one that my pickaxe hero 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.829
 he does is he chops very very fast items 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:38.429
 he specializes in stone 

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:40.469
 and androids when you see he has one 

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:43.799
 after the race is pretty good in itself 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:46.199
 which not as i said he specializes 

00:05:43.799 --> 00:05:48.869
 itself into fast door branches and fastest one 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:52.439
 heel oh god you did not have a stone 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:54.479
 maybe handy to just finish 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:57.689
 what stone where stone why do I see it 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:59.159
 no oh wait I see of course 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.379
 page 2 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:04.379
 okay in everything flashed of course 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:06.479
 completely beautiful and then had chopping away 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.579
 with the becoming expression it goes pretty well 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.749
 fast actually and gives another nice one 

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:12.929
 effect 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:15.509
 if you look beautiful the next and that 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:16.889
 is for now the last because is the man 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.769
 completes what you can do with it 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.009
 doing is changing lures into others 

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:22.009
 blocks 

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:26.009
 I imagine what this change grass 

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:28.529
 Then you have to make sure you have enough 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.529
 glass blocks in in story if works 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.969
 what you do salt shift pressed 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:35.399
 right mouse button on grass 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.259
 do you go here if you like good food 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:40.349
 just a block changes into it 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.239
 with the right mouse button all blocks and you 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.339
 will see that he grasses out again in story 

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:46.229
 hence you used enough 

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:47.790
 Doctors don't have collapse 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.580
 also works with wood 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.260
 if you see it has a certain range like 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.360
 Push in the chefs and then keep seeing 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.770
 here too here 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.140
 soon that little item frame thingy and 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.880
 that so you can see this range that it so 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.830
 works 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.160
 so you also get stone back 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.980
 I have 44 now 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.030
 yes i just love you 60 and then go 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.840
 just this one 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.670
 I now have 60 shifts like me 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.530
 this all change to center 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.050
 had six off but is the wood because 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.930
 I gained a lot of course 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.540
 handy with the weather in this 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.200
 michael also go around and very much 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.030
 easy 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.620
 blocks sin you need it 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.410
 to demolish 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.670
 rather that what the once got for now 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:39.330
 your questions leave it in the responses 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:41.580
 I take I take I answer of course 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:43.790
 just all questions must be serious often 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.440
 are those such a yes what is your shoe size 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.180
 subscribe to the storms and became yes
