00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.139 
really heard of before but I just saw it
on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.680> display<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.399> loved<00:02:05.640> how<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.820> looked

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
on the display and I loved how it looked

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.180 
on the display and I loved how it looked
and<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.570> another<00:02:06.780> light<00:02:07.170> matte<00:02:07.530> tone<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.099> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
and it's another light matte tone but it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.650 
and it's another light matte tone but it
has

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
has

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.510 
has
bit<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.870> a<00:02:09.020> purplish<00:02:09.560> tint<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.370> I<00:02:10.430> think

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
bit of a purplish tint to it so I think

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.340 
bit of a purplish tint to it so I think
it'll<00:02:10.790> go<00:02:10.850> really<00:02:11.180> well<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.780> purple<00:02:12.200> I

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
it'll go really well with a purple I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.410 
it'll go really well with a purple I
look<00:02:12.620> to<00:02:13.160> kind<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.370> blend<00:02:13.520> out<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.760> edges<00:02:13.910> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
