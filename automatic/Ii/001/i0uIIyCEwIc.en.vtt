go this is the the carry case that comes
with<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.170> system<00:00:19.350> obviously<00:00:20.340> if<00:00:20.429> you<00:00:20.580> order

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
with the system obviously if you order

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.050 
with the system obviously if you order
it<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:21.929> quite<00:00:22.140> solid<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:23.099> the<00:00:23.250> touch

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
it it's quite solid to the touch

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.790 
it it's quite solid to the touch
I<00:00:24.089> mean<00:00:24.570> all<00:00:24.720> feels<00:00:24.990> quite<00:00:25.170> solid<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.619> got<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
I mean all feels quite solid it's got a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
I mean all feels quite solid it's got a
rubberized<00:00:26.279> handles<00:00:27.029> whenever<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> wherever

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
rubberized handles whenever it wherever

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.099 
rubberized handles whenever it wherever
the<00:00:28.109> eeper<00:00:28.380> handles<00:00:28.800> are<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> physics

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the eeper handles are all of the physics

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.050 
the eeper handles are all of the physics
are<00:00:31.289> actually<00:00:31.619> got<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> rubber<00:00:32.369> coating<00:00:32.640> around

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
are actually got a rubber coating around
