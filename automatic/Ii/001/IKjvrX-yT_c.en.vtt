this so now it's updated let me just go

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760 
this so now it's updated let me just go
ahead<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.149> block<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.380> i<00:01:49.409> believe

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
ahead and put that block in so i believe

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.440 
ahead and put that block in so i believe
yep<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> can<00:01:51.180> see<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.420> can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
yep there we go as you can see we can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.249 
yep there we go as you can see we can
update<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> one<00:01:53.009> key<00:01:53.700> position

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
update right in that one key position

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.630 
update right in that one key position
unfortunately<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:56.009> where<00:01:56.250> design

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
unfortunately with this one where design

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.719 
unfortunately with this one where design
you<00:01:56.850> have<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.329> cut<00:01:58.200> one<00:01:58.530> block<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.369> really

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
you have to cut one block in this really

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.389 
you have to cut one block in this really
weird<00:01:59.939> spots<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.560> just<00:02:01.799> make<00:02:02.130> this

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
weird spots you can like just make this

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.830 
weird spots you can like just make this
like<00:02:02.790> I<00:02:02.969> don't<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.570> two

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
like I don't know you can have two

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
like I don't know you can have two
things<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.799> then<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.430> something<00:02:05.729> like

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
things here and then do something like

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
things here and then do something like
oh<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.509> glow<00:02:06.990> stone<00:02:07.259> blocks<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:07.829> i

have my torches just something like that

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.390 
have my torches just something like that
unfortunately<00:02:11.220> that's<00:02:11.459> how<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> design<00:02:12.000> work

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
unfortunately that's how the design work

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.640 
unfortunately that's how the design work
if<00:02:13.209> about<00:02:13.450> some<00:02:13.659> torque<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.530> have<00:02:14.620> a

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
if about some torque you have to have a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.350 
if about some torque you have to have a
block<00:02:14.920> there<00:02:15.129> because<00:02:15.519> that<00:02:15.700> little<00:02:15.819> redstone

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
block there because that little redstone

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.690 
block there because that little redstone
update<00:02:16.659> or<00:02:17.530> whatever<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:18.010> good<00:02:18.129> college<00:02:18.519> and

and go to the bottom really quickly so
the<00:02:37.090> bottoms<00:02:37.420> down<00:02:37.540> here<00:02:37.989> at<00:02:38.439> the<00:02:38.890> bottom<00:02:39.069> we

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
the bottoms down here at the bottom we

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.800 
the bottoms down here at the bottom we
of<00:02:39.700> course<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.060> want<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.239> put<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> few<00:02:40.689> blocks

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.490 
see it is like adding the update into
the<00:03:13.840> block<00:03:14.049> it's<00:03:14.379> just<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:16.349> right<00:03:17.349> down

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
the block it's just like right down

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.129 
the block it's just like right down
