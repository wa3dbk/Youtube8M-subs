some<00:00:25.730> of<00:00:25.789> the<00:00:25.850> older<00:00:26.060> ones<00:00:26.240> are<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.750> bit<00:00:26.810> sketchy

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
some of the older ones are a bit sketchy

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.130 
some of the older ones are a bit sketchy
looking<00:00:27.530> so<00:00:28.010> this<00:00:28.430> is<00:00:28.550> pretty<00:00:28.730> cool<00:00:29.140> so

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
looking so this is pretty cool so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.189 
looking so this is pretty cool so
looking<00:00:30.619> at<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:30.830> side<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.160> the<00:00:31.220> box<00:00:31.400> here<00:00:31.760> you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199 
looking at the side of the box here you

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.869 
looking at the side of the box here you
see<00:00:33.199> front<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:33.650> back<00:00:33.739> of<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.040> kit<00:00:34.309> it's

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
see front and back of the kit it's

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.420 
see front and back of the kit it's
obviously<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.330> painted<00:00:35.780> version<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:37.190> over

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
obviously a painted version and over

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.939 
obviously a painted version and over
here<00:00:37.580> I<00:00:37.610> guess<00:00:37.879> is<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.480> concept<00:00:39.050> art<00:00:39.320> of<00:00:39.620> the

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
here I guess is the concept art of the

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:47.649 
here I guess is the concept art of the
Mobile<00:00:40.250> Suit<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:44.870> other<00:00:45.229> side<00:00:46.150> so<00:00:47.150> here<00:00:47.449> it<00:00:47.540> is

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
Mobile Suit the other side so here it is

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:49.960 
Mobile Suit the other side so here it is
here<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.290> pose<00:00:48.589> that<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.070> is<00:00:49.309> on<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.610> front

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
here in the pose that it is on the front

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.570 
here in the pose that it is on the front
of<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.210> box<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:51.559> see<00:00:51.589> the<00:00:51.830> claws<00:00:52.070> here<00:00:52.400> that

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
of the box you see the claws here that

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.090 
of the box you see the claws here that
detach<00:00:53.170> I'm<00:00:54.170> guessing<00:00:54.559> includes<00:00:54.920> these

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
detach I'm guessing includes these

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.460 
detach I'm guessing includes these
stands<00:00:55.580> here<00:00:55.729> for<00:00:55.940> them<00:00:56.170> some<00:00:57.170> articulation

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
stands here for them some articulation

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.259 
stands here for them some articulation
of<00:00:57.860> the<00:00:57.949> head<00:00:58.129> and<00:00:58.339> body<00:01:00.820> from<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:01.970> pictures

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
of the head and body from the pictures

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.149 
of the head and body from the pictures
it<00:01:02.299> looks<00:01:02.540> like<00:01:02.750> they're<00:01:03.620> tickle<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:04.010> sheen

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
it looks like they're tickle a sheen

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.480 
it looks like they're tickle a sheen
isn't<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:04.729> bad<00:01:05.650> so<00:01:06.650> I<00:01:06.680> guess<00:01:06.860> we<00:01:07.010> will<00:01:07.070> see<00:01:07.280> that

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
isn't so bad so I guess we will see that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.010 
isn't so bad so I guess we will see that
later<00:01:07.549> on<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.030> review<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:11.299> smaller

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
later on the review and this smaller

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.690 
later on the review and this smaller
picture<00:01:12.619> here<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:12.950> think<00:01:15.250> shows<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.460> kit

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
picture here I think shows the kit

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.250 
picture here I think shows the kit
unpainted<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.600> I'm<00:01:17.690> not<00:01:17.810> sure<00:01:17.930> if<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:18.140> very

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
unpainted and I'm not sure if it's very

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.890 
unpainted and I'm not sure if it's very
clear<00:01:18.440> here<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:18.980> the<00:01:19.210> in<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:20.330> video<00:01:20.450> or<00:01:20.750> not

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
clear here in the in the video or not

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.110 
clear here in the in the video or not
but<00:01:21.230> you<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:21.860> see<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:22.220> is<00:01:22.400> that<00:01:22.550> kind<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:22.910> weird

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
but you can see it is that kind of weird

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.840 
but you can see it is that kind of weird
brown<00:01:23.750> shade<00:01:24.380> you<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:24.920> see<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.280> pictures<00:01:25.640> off

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
brown shade you can see in pictures off

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.880 
brown shade you can see in pictures off
lately<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.850> let's<00:01:29.150> crack<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.540> open<00:01:29.630> and<00:01:29.930> see

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
lately so let's crack it open and see

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.410 
lately so let's crack it open and see
what<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.130> runners<00:01:31.370> look<00:01:31.580> like<00:01:31.760> what's<00:01:32.180> one<00:01:32.390> of

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
what the runners look like what's one of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.270 
what the runners look like what's one of
the<00:01:32.540> biggest<00:01:32.570> concerns<00:01:33.530> with<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:33.800> kid<00:01:34.130> is

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
the biggest concerns with this kid is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.140 
the biggest concerns with this kid is
the<00:01:34.580> coloring<00:01:35.320> of<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.890> darker<00:01:37.460> purple<00:01:37.640> here

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
the coloring of the darker purple here

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.570 
the coloring of the darker purple here
so<00:01:38.900> we'll<00:01:39.380> see<00:01:39.590> how<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.770> turns<00:01:40.400> out<00:01:42.520> okay<00:01:43.520> so

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
so we'll see how that turns out okay so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.120 
so we'll see how that turns out okay so
let's<00:01:43.880> take<00:01:44.240> a<00:01:44.600> look<00:01:45.230> at<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.440> first<00:01:45.740> one<00:01:46.010> right

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
let's take a look at the first one right

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.800 
let's take a look at the first one right
here<00:01:46.340> here<00:01:46.520> we're<00:01:46.670> already<00:01:47.120> into<00:01:47.420> some<00:01:47.570> of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
here here we're already into some of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.930 
here here we're already into some of
this<00:01:47.900> dark<00:01:49.000> purple<00:01:50.000> oh<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:51.110> not

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
this dark purple oh and it's not

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.420 
this dark purple oh and it's not
actually<00:01:53.050> as<00:01:54.050> bad<00:01:54.470> as<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.770> thought<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.250> would<00:01:55.370> be

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
actually as bad as I thought it would be

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.770 
actually as bad as I thought it would be
camera<00:01:58.430> really<00:01:58.730> isn't<00:01:58.970> picking<00:01:59.240> up<00:01:59.330> the<00:01:59.420> color

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
camera really isn't picking up the color

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.570 
camera really isn't picking up the color
so<00:02:00.110> well<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:00.730> it<00:02:01.730> is<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.560> dark<00:02:03.560> maroon<00:02:03.950> II<00:02:04.370> color

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
so well but it is a dark maroon II color

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.020 
so well but it is a dark maroon II color
it's<00:02:04.790> not<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.120> purple<00:02:05.510> that<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.780> should<00:02:06.050> be

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
it's not the purple that it should be

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.149 
it's not the purple that it should be
but<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.330> guess<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:08.929> not<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:09.409> bad<00:02:09.560> seeing<00:02:09.890> here

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
but I guess it's not so bad seeing here

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.100 
but I guess it's not so bad seeing here
a<00:02:10.190> lot<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.550> parts<00:02:11.000> like<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.690> waist<00:02:13.269> shield

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
a lot of parts like the waist shield

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.850 
a lot of parts like the waist shield
I<00:02:16.240> think<00:02:17.240> this<00:02:17.420> is<00:02:17.540> part<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.110> head<00:02:18.440> and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
I think this is part of the head and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.020 
I think this is part of the head and
side<00:02:19.790> skirts<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.300> whatnot<00:02:21.760> next<00:02:22.760> piece<00:02:23.000> here

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
side skirts and whatnot next piece here

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:31.400 
side skirts and whatnot next piece here
is<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:25.190> dark<00:02:25.700> blue<00:02:26.180> parts
