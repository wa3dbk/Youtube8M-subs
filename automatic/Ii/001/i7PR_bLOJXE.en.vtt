00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.190

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.190
 the 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.840
 m 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.840
 at 

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:54.399
 not 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.179
 and 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.179
 not 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.029
 here they are 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.070
 at 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:31.950
 it's clear we validate the kayak will be 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.950
 not valid 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.030
 but it's not very accustomed to actually 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:50.350
 we accelerate the european champion to 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.750
 adie laval for a first time it's him 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.250
 kayaking is fun 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.040
 boarding and on it's really 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.910
 nice acceleration all that was really 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.860
 something awesome 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.780
 rolled the small variant etc polo 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.010
 it gives it really back and the 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.110
 trajectories and all that is really 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.880
 something great against the 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.260
 big problem that I had and who got me 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.180
 does most of it is obviously 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.290
 the balanced we quickly made of 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.770
 the press reports that we are in the process of 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.080
 prove and finally at the turning point but 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.910
 hey it was great that it gives 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.440
 want to redo you know 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:24.360
 how do you know how that's 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.360
 pass to your turn to throw you in the water 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.819
