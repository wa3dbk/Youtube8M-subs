00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.660
 hello together, dear spectators, it is 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.390
 again video time here in the blog and we 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.729
 Just want one at this point 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.640
 small addition to the last video 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.940
 in the last video we have with help 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.070
 a flash on deck against the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.170
 daylight outside here in zingst in 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.830
 this apartment is taking pictures 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.000
 So we had a video in that 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.740
 outside the sun or 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.210
 the daylight was and we just in the room 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.310
 had too little light and there one 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.000
 indirect soft natural light 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.490
 have set 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.340
 Now there is a little old nation 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.369
 We are talking about being in 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.410
 In this case , the available light falls a bit 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.630
 support and then actually 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.910
 completely forego the daylight 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 In this case , we take pictures in the 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.560
 dark room in there we have none 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.780
 real light source and both the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.280
 daylight as well as the light we did 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.020
 can artificially turn on here so 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.240
 the chandeliers or the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.159
 other are not around it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.729
 strong enough for the photo really perfect 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.670
 to expose 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.039
 and there we do a little trick 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.440
 we are looking for the beautiful ambience light 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.539
 out and support it with that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.640
 rise up in this case, I looked 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.140
 the ambient light with those of the 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.220
 Light bulbs from the chandeliers 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.530
 chosen from a very simple 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880
 because we have there back there 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.739
 a little bit of it too 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.050
 and the daylight really only comes 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.450
 from this side of this window 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.290
 and that would be relatively dark there 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.290
 been behind 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.239
 I look for a light I have 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.620
 already said that art is in this 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.510
 fall and I support that 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.520
 like back then with a joke interior 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
 Indirectly I announced the flash 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.970
 flashes the lightning put on the table 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.980
 There in the room purely so that 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.989
 reflecting Lich comes back more accurately 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.709
 on me that means the verena stands 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.150
 after here 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.190
 we play with it a bit 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.900
 mirror image and and the whole thing 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.090
 here in the background and us 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 then take a picture in the dark room 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.340
 So I have a mixture 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.840
 the art light here through the strong 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.269
 chandelier as well as a bit 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.920
 weak back there but that will be 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.739
 I strongly support it 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.050
 70 80 percent supported by this 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.880
 warm fellows flash light as then 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.810
 with flash light as then with correction 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.430
 foil as then manual in spite of the ttsc 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.930
 I'm just using it manually 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.700
 performance and as far as I know 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.470
 has its performance at sixteenth or 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.630
 Eighth of you can just here 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.220
 Show hidden what exactly 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.500
 performance was and with it you can 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.260
 wonderful photograph dazzle this time 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.290
 14 24 mm full format there is a lot 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.380
 wide-angle look so very close picture 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.500
 look it is very very very yes in the middle 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.819
 actually just before the model and through 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.560
 the fixed focal length keep the 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.370
 Distortions still a bit in 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.780
 border 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.580
 but you have to pay attention 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.780
 trend models in the middle 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.150
 Of course, do not grab the edge 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 but in the middle and then one 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.750
 a little bit up and down on the square 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.510
 best so that just the distortions 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.480
 not completely crass to the strongest 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.690
 edges and pages can hit yes 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.310
 great picture blur wide angle whole 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.799
 very quite abstruser air with these 24 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.380
 mm objective to an incredibly beautiful 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.450
 frontal into the light comes from the front 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.180
 and there's nothing left to say 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.610
 was another picture of verena 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.530
 Try one of them 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.590
 different light sources in the room and 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.459
 brings thereby pictures on a whole 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.459
 different quality level
