00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 oh yes my name is sergio from here and I 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.609
 I bring you another call of duty video 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.820
 coast this time I will show you how 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.790
 get more squat points and good as 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.030
 you know what the four points are 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.859
 essential for us for all this 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.740
 the game because with the squadrons 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 we can unlock all the weapons that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 we need or all the weapons that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.289
 we want we can also unlock 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.990
 all the accessories that we need 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.689
 we also need them to unlock 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.210
 our secondary weapons our this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.430
 grenade launcher rocket launchers also 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.059
 our temples our grenades 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.710
 lethal we win the tactics 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.540
 our perks obviously with him the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 Persians this you need a certain level 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.340
 to unlock it and also 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.660
 you need squat points and this one also 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.579
 we need squat points to 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.370
 unlock all of our picks 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.500
 all the kilos tics that we have this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 we need squat wings to be able 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.370
 unlock the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.310
 and good to the way we 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.810
 We get square point is right now is 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.020
 leveling up and every time you 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.259
 level ups you get 2 square points and 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.259
 good 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.090
 that 's you that's this very slow for me 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.340
 seem because there are more ways in which 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.829
 we can get more squat 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.810
 points and good then the first way 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.509
 that we can get more squat points is 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.939
 obvious is this easily is rising from 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.590
 faster level then I'll have them 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.719
 another video where I tell them how 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.340
 level up faster but by 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.119
 right now this we skip the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.119
 next point 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.240
 let's move on to this thing called 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.670
 operations operations and this is a 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.430
 certain type of challenges that we 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.850
 we can complete complete so that we 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.550
 Give squat points and good every time you 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.380
 complete is a squat point to forgiveness every 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.650
 once you complete an operation or a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.570
 challenge they will give you a squat point and 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.840
 good as you can see we have 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.370
 five operations and this and if they complete 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.200
 the five operations are going to give you more 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.110
 squat points as you can see in 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.560
 the right hand at the bottom there 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.840
 something that says operations conclude and says 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.820
 2 and then you get a sign of a squat 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.500
 wayne and well that what it means is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.290
 that if you complete two operations of 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.660
 these are going to give you an extra squat point 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.120
 if you complete three squat darts 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.850
 extra points and complete four go 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.950
 to give three four extra ins and if 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.420
 complete five you will get four squat 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.459
 extra points 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 these operations change every two 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.180
 weeks and if you get to complete 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.380
 these operations before two 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.230
 weeks you can 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.760
 buy more operations for about four 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.650
 days and get more squat pons 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.159
 another way by which we can 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.180
 get more squat points is completing 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.879
 the little challenge of flowers as 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.640
 you will know every time you 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.190
 You find this briefcase by yourself when 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.440
 you kill someone is going to give you a 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.720
 small challenge that are called field 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.480
 orders to the challenges are not so 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.299
 difficult are easy to are something 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.280
 seemed like this that says I have 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.739
 that killing someone with has its head 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.909
 I have to kill someone when this one 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:33.170
 whether I am kneeling or kneeling as 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.989
 tell me that this one is lying down has to 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.879
 with chest to the ground that I killed someone 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.730
 to this one behind or that kills someone 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.340
 with my knife or something like that and 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.769
 this is very easy the figures are very 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.870
 easy and every time you complete a 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.840
 they'll give you a squat they put like that 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.030
 that a is 4 today is very valuable in this 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.590
 game so I would recommend that you 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.129
 you go 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:02.540
 do these little challenges so that 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.670
 you can get more squat pons and 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.040
 well there is a challenge of the flowers that 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.319
 not everyone knows how to do and this 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.299
 challenge is that you have to humiliate your 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.430
 enemy and good the way we're going to 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.799
 humiliate our enemy is that you're going 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.739
 to make a Tibet and if you do not know what is it 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.380
 what is a tip is that when you kill 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.630
 your enemy will go to his corpse and you 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.400
 You'll crouch and stop constantly and 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.280
 this is called a tea bag is a certain 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.680
 kind of humiliation and if you do that 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.750
 how are you going to see right now and you're 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.150
 to say or the game is going to tell you that you have 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.490
 completed the flowers and they will give you 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.620
 this the squat point 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.979
 and good for the last tip of how 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.780
 get more squat points to what 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.900
 you have to do is play the mode 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.660
 game of squats so with it and in the mode 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.090
 of squats game and good this in 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.970
 I do not really have it confirmed 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.130
 that I have not played much squats I have not 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.099
 played the game mode of squats a lot 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.259
 and this this information only me the 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:07.410
 have happened like this is that this will have to 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:11.039
 but confirm what my sources 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.800
 they tell me is that if you play more this is the 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:17.610
 game mode of squats you get more 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.509
 squat points that if you play the modes 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.639
 regular collector and coast and good 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.789
 guys in the remember that to get 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:29.330
 more squat points we're going to have to go up 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.190
 of the fastest level we're going to have to 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.130

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.259
