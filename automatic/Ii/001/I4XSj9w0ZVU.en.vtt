00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
caught any of my previous videos what

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.939 
caught any of my previous videos what
we're<00:00:24.330> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.539> doing<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:25.170> finding<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we're going to be doing is finding a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
we're going to be doing is finding a
chest<00:00:26.250> close<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> junction<00:00:26.910> because<00:00:27.330> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
chest close to the junction because that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.970 
chest close to the junction because that
just<00:00:27.480> makes<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.900> run<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.320> much<00:00:28.470> better<00:00:28.680> instead

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
just makes a run so much better instead

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.859 
just makes a run so much better instead
of<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.279> linking<00:00:29.760> materials<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.720> can

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
of just linking materials which you can

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
of just linking materials which you can
link<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> five<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.679> total<00:00:31.830> either<00:00:32.640> for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
link up to five in total either for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.819 
link up to five in total either for
materials<00:00:33.600> one<00:00:33.780> chest<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.500> five

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
materials one chest or just five

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.860 
materials one chest or just five
materials<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.550> general<00:00:35.940> that's<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> limit<00:00:36.809> of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
materials in general that's the limit of

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.479 
materials in general that's the limit of
this<00:00:37.079> strategy<00:00:37.320> there's<00:00:37.739> also<00:00:37.890> other<00:00:38.129> limits

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this strategy there's also other limits

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.799 
this strategy there's also other limits
that<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> touched<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> other<00:00:39.270> videos<00:00:39.600> but

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
that I touched on the other videos but

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
that I touched on the other videos but
just<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.469> bigger<00:00:40.649> maps<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.219> cannot

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
just like the bigger maps you cannot

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
just like the bigger maps you cannot
cross<00:00:42.030> pretty<00:00:42.480> much<00:00:42.600> there's<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> halfway

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
cross pretty much there's a halfway

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.010 
cross pretty much there's a halfway
point<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.430> time<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.090> cannot<00:00:45.450> respond

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
point at which time you cannot respond

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.240 
point at which time you cannot respond
materials<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> half<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.039> map

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
materials from that half of the map

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
materials from that half of the map
which<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.300> fine<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:48.660> really<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.200> don't

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
which is fine because really you don't

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
which is fine because really you don't
want<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.649> too<00:00:49.829> far<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.610> as<00:00:50.850> i

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
want to be too far you can see that as i

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.520 
want to be too far you can see that as i
started<00:00:51.300> i<00:00:51.420> found<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> chest<00:00:51.960> first<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> from

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
started i found the chest first and from

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
started i found the chest first and from
there<00:00:52.680> i'm<00:00:52.800> like<00:00:52.949> ok<00:00:53.190> let's<00:00:53.399> find<00:00:53.579> some<00:00:53.820> other

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
there i'm like ok let's find some other

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
there i'm like ok let's find some other
spirit<00:00:54.420> bloom<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.690> start<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.050> chain<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
spirit bloom and start this chain and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.139 
spirit bloom and start this chain and
you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.309> tell<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.699> one<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.000> pretty

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
you can tell that other one is pretty

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
you can tell that other one is pretty
far<00:00:57.390> but<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> start<00:00:58.230> somewhere<00:00:58.469> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
far but you got to start somewhere it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
far but you got to start somewhere it
took<00:00:59.129> me<00:00:59.309> about<00:00:59.520> 15<00:01:00.000> minutes<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.960> run

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
took me about 15 minutes to get this run

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.779 
took me about 15 minutes to get this run
to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.500> efficient<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.460> guys<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.699> going

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
to be efficient and you guys are going

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.000 
to be efficient and you guys are going
to<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> final<00:01:03.420> run<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.019> what<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> piece

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to see the final run of what I piece

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
to see the final run of what I piece
together<00:01:05.220> because<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> main<00:01:06.060> thing<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
together because the main thing here is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.670 
together because the main thing here is
that<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.080> learn<00:01:07.140> how<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.320> put<00:01:07.560> your

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
that you have to learn how to put your

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.940 
that you have to learn how to put your
run<00:01:07.860> together<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.380> beginning<00:01:10.500> once

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
run together so at the beginning once

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
run together so at the beginning once
you<00:01:11.040> find<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.400> chest<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:12.119> even<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.689> just

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
you find your chest or even if it's just

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.910 
you find your chest or even if it's just
material<00:01:13.020> if<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.650> you're<00:01:13.770> interested

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
material if that's all you're interested

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
material if that's all you're interested
in<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.030> find<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.330> close<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
in you want to find one close to the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
in you want to find one close to the
junction<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.340> go

junction that's going to be your to go

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.070 
junction that's going to be your to go
one<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:17.939> typically<00:01:18.390> i<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
one but typically i like to make it a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.760 
one but typically i like to make it a
chest<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.780> you're<00:01:21.900> first<00:01:22.080> starting<00:01:22.229> make

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
chest so when you're first starting make

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.590 
chest so when you're first starting make
sure<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.430> chest<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.909> responding

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
sure that the chest is responding

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.940 
sure that the chest is responding
because<00:01:24.750> even<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.590> some<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.890> are

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
because even when you have some that are

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.230 
because even when you have some that are
close<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> junction<00:01:26.610> there'd<00:01:27.030> actually

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
close to the junction there'd actually

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
close to the junction there'd actually
not<00:01:27.689> close<00:01:27.930> enough<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.409> they<00:01:28.530> won't<00:01:28.710> respond

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
not close enough and they won't respond

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
not close enough and they won't respond
so<00:01:29.790> before<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.270> ahead<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> yourself<00:01:30.990> make

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
so before you get ahead of yourself make

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690 
so before you get ahead of yourself make
sure<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.560> your<00:01:31.680> primary<00:01:32.220> ones<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.610> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
sure that your primary ones that you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460 
sure that your primary ones that you
definitely<00:01:32.939> want<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.360> keep<00:01:33.570> our<00:01:33.750> respawning

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
definitely want to keep our respawning

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
definitely want to keep our respawning
i'm<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.740> okay<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.100> one<00:01:35.280> stayed<00:01:35.549> great<00:01:35.939> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
i'm like okay this one stayed great so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.850 
i'm like okay this one stayed great so
from<00:01:36.689> there<00:01:36.869> I<00:01:36.900> started<00:01:36.990> looking<00:01:37.530> around<00:01:37.619> for

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
from there I started looking around for

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.770 
from there I started looking around for
something<00:01:38.070> closer<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.670> found<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.060> one

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.910 

well<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.079> least<00:01:43.229> close<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.799> other

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
well it's at least close to the other

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.170 
well it's at least close to the other
one<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.220> was<00:01:44.340> getting<00:01:44.640> which<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> decent

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
one that I was getting which is a decent

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.969 
one that I was getting which is a decent
start<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.780> there's<00:01:46.290> multiple<00:01:46.680> things<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
start but there's multiple things that

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.230 
start but there's multiple things that
we're<00:01:47.070> doing<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.579> only<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:47.909> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
we're doing here not only are we just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.399 
we're doing here not only are we just
getting<00:01:48.360> material<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.200> actually

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
getting material but it's actually

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.560 
getting material but it's actually
changing<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> response<00:01:50.610> on<00:01:50.790> other<00:01:51.000> parts<00:01:51.270> so

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
changing the response on other parts so

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.179 
changing the response on other parts so
as<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.840> come<00:01:52.049> back<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.560> actually<00:01:52.740> look<00:01:53.040> for

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
as I come back I actually look for

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.310 
as I come back I actually look for
something<00:01:53.369> closer<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.030> closer<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:55.200> can

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
something closer and closer you can

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.899 
something closer and closer you can
actually<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.770> three<00:01:56.100> spirit<00:01:56.460> blooms<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
actually get three spirit blooms that

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.240 
actually get three spirit blooms that
spawn<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.469> side<00:01:58.740> there<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.009> on

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
spawn a lot to that side there is on

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.310 
spawn a lot to that side there is on
that<00:01:59.460> left<00:01:59.700> side<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.090> those<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.049> actually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that left side and those are actually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.569 
that left side and those are actually
the<00:02:01.409> ones<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> end<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:01.920> getting<00:02:02.219> after<00:02:02.549> a

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
the ones that I end up getting after a

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.130 
the ones that I end up getting after a
little<00:02:02.820> bit<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.479> what<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:03.750> doing<00:02:03.780> is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
little bit so what you're doing is

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.929 
little bit so what you're doing is
pretty<00:02:04.469> much<00:02:04.619> changing<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> run<00:02:05.579> trying

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
pretty much changing up the run trying

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.340 
pretty much changing up the run trying
to<00:02:06.000> get<00:02:06.090> different<00:02:06.299> things<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> respawn<00:02:07.140> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
to get different things to respawn and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.600 
to get different things to respawn and
you<00:02:07.439> keep<00:02:07.560> your<00:02:07.740> eye<00:02:07.770> open<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.399> work

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you keep your eye open as you work

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.430 
you keep your eye open as you work
through<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:08.879> run<00:02:09.179> until<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.259> ones

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
through your run until you get the ones

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.720 
through your run until you get the ones
that<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.679> close<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.190> possible<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that are the close as possible to the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.309 
that are the close as possible to the
junction

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
junction

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.899 
junction
and<00:02:12.620> as<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.799> can<00:02:12.920> see<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.219> chest<00:02:13.519> was<00:02:13.760> not

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
and as you can see this chest was not

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.160 
and as you can see this chest was not
going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.150> stay<00:02:14.359> that's<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.959> thing<00:02:15.079> about

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
going to stay that's the thing about

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.720 
going to stay that's the thing about
chess<00:02:15.499> you<00:02:15.709> you<00:02:15.890> just<00:02:16.040> can't<00:02:16.280> get<00:02:16.459> them<00:02:16.609> to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
chess you you just can't get them to

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.500 
chess you you just can't get them to
come<00:02:16.879> back<00:02:17.060> when<00:02:17.359> they're<00:02:17.510> far<00:02:17.719> away<00:02:19.510> but

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
come back when they're far away but

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.580 
come back when they're far away but
that's<00:02:20.689> all<00:02:20.840> right<00:02:20.870> from<00:02:21.200> there<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.469> just

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
that's all right from there you just

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.170 
that's all right from there you just
keep<00:02:21.739> trucking<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.249> I<00:02:22.280> found<00:02:22.579> this<00:02:22.819> one<00:02:22.879> and

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
keep trucking on I found this one and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.699 
keep trucking on I found this one and
now<00:02:23.269> this<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:23.689> is<00:02:23.959> actually<00:02:24.260> pretty<00:02:24.469> close

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
now this this is actually pretty close

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.239 
now this this is actually pretty close
to<00:02:24.889> the<00:02:24.920> junction<00:02:25.159> I<00:02:25.549> can<00:02:26.060> get<00:02:26.329> one<00:02:27.109> two<00:02:27.709> three

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:28.249 
to the junction I can get one two three

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.470 
to the junction I can get one two three
it's<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.670> three<00:02:28.849> run<00:02:28.969> but<00:02:29.150> that's<00:02:29.269> fine<00:02:29.450> i

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
it's a three run but that's fine i

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.240 
it's a three run but that's fine i
actually<00:02:29.930> want<00:02:30.109> to<00:02:30.260> link<00:02:30.500> these<00:02:30.680> get<00:02:31.010> them<00:02:31.129> to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
actually want to link these get them to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.860 
actually want to link these get them to
respawn<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:31.939> from<00:02:32.180> there<00:02:32.359> i'm<00:02:32.540> gonna<00:02:32.629> add

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
respawn and from there i'm gonna add

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.410 
respawn and from there i'm gonna add
another<00:02:33.019> one<00:02:33.349> and<00:02:33.790> that's<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.000> area<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.269> i'm

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
another one and that's the area that i'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.610 
another one and that's the area that i'm
talking<00:02:35.689> about<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.019> get<00:02:36.139> one<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.260> respond

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
talking about you can get one to respond

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.050 
talking about you can get one to respond
oh<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:36.980> then<00:02:37.129> i<00:02:37.159> caught<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:37.639> one<00:02:37.700> out<00:02:37.939> of<00:02:37.969> the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
oh and then i caught this one out of the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.280 
oh and then i caught this one out of the
corner<00:02:38.359> of<00:02:38.389> my<00:02:38.450> eye<00:02:38.510> but<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:39.019> get<00:02:39.169> even

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
corner of my eye but you can get even

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.839 
corner of my eye but you can get even
another<00:02:39.590> one<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.889> spawn<00:02:40.099> up<00:02:40.219> on<00:02:40.340> the<00:02:40.430> top<00:02:40.639> and

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
another one to spawn up on the top and

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.759 
another one to spawn up on the top and
when<00:02:41.569> i<00:02:41.599> was<00:02:41.749> playing<00:02:41.870> with<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.079> buddy<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:42.620> had

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
when i was playing with a buddy we had

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.500 
when i was playing with a buddy we had
sponded<00:02:43.280> together<00:02:43.549> and<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:43.969> was<00:02:44.120> actually<00:02:44.269> a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
sponded together and it was actually a

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.420 
sponded together and it was actually a
really<00:02:44.719> good<00:02:44.810> run<00:02:45.169> until<00:02:45.469> he<00:02:45.709> fell<00:02:45.889> behind<00:02:46.040> and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
really good run until he fell behind and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.420 
really good run until he fell behind and
then<00:02:46.489> it<00:02:46.639> messed<00:02:46.819> up<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.150> respawn<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:49.010> when

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
then it messed up the respawn so when

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.770 
then it messed up the respawn so when
you<00:02:49.579> are<00:02:49.730> doing<00:02:49.879> this<00:02:50.090> with<00:02:50.329> somebody<00:02:50.629> else

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
you are doing this with somebody else

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.270 
you are doing this with somebody else
you<00:02:50.900> guys<00:02:51.019> do<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.439> to<00:02:51.560> stay<00:02:51.739> close<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.040> each

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
you guys do have to stay close to each

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.670 
you guys do have to stay close to each
other<00:02:52.400> when<00:02:52.609> you<00:02:52.639> guys<00:02:52.849> go<00:02:53.090> from<00:02:53.449> the<00:02:53.680> ishtar

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
other when you guys go from the ishtar

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
other when you guys go from the ishtar
cliffs<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.879> shattered<00:02:56.569> coast<00:02:56.810> which<00:02:57.109> is

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
cliffs to the shattered coast which is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.349 
cliffs to the shattered coast which is
where<00:02:57.799> we're<00:02:58.069> farming<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.699> between<00:02:59.030> those<00:02:59.180> two

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
where we're farming in between those two

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.459 
where we're farming in between those two
areas<00:03:01.449> so<00:03:02.449> I'm<00:03:02.510> gonna<00:03:02.629> let<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:03.019> clip<00:03:03.290> play

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
areas so I'm gonna let this clip play

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.099 
areas so I'm gonna let this clip play
out<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.739> real<00:03:03.769> time<00:03:04.129> so<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.370> guys<00:03:04.489> can<00:03:04.669> see<00:03:05.109> how

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:06.109 
out in real time so you guys can see how

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.330 
out in real time so you guys can see how
long<00:03:06.290> it<00:03:06.409> actually<00:03:06.500> takes<00:03:06.709> which<00:03:07.069> is<00:03:07.189> actually

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
long it actually takes which is actually

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.770 
long it actually takes which is actually
a<00:03:07.519> minute<00:03:07.790> 20<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.150> you're<00:03:08.269> doing<00:03:08.329> about<00:03:08.599> 50

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
a minute 20 so you're doing about 50

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.270 
a minute 20 so you're doing about 50
runs<00:03:09.109> an<00:03:09.319> hour<00:03:09.439> which<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.799> not<00:03:09.919> bad<00:03:09.949> that's

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
runs an hour which is not bad that's

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.119 
runs an hour which is not bad that's
going<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.459> be<00:03:10.579> 200<00:03:11.030> plus<00:03:11.299> an<00:03:11.840> hour<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.349> this<00:03:12.980> is

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
going to be 200 plus an hour and this is

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.860 
going to be 200 plus an hour and this is
one<00:03:13.250> of<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> longer<00:03:13.760> runs<00:03:13.939> that<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.150> found<00:03:14.449> but

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
one of the longer runs that I found but

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.360 
one of the longer runs that I found but
it's<00:03:15.169> still<00:03:15.409> more<00:03:15.620> efficient<00:03:15.980> than<00:03:16.040> actually

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
it's still more efficient than actually

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.679 
it's still more efficient than actually
running<00:03:16.549> around<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.909> level<00:03:17.120> normally<00:03:17.540> which

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689 
running around the level normally which

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.179 
running around the level normally which
typically<00:03:18.169> gets<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.470> about<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.680> hundred<00:03:18.859> hours

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:19.189 
typically gets you about a hundred hours

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.289 
typically gets you about a hundred hours
so<00:03:19.489> this<00:03:19.699> is<00:03:19.819> going<00:03:19.909> to<00:03:20.000> double<00:03:20.269> your

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
so this is going to double your

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.390 
so this is going to double your
productivity<00:03:20.720> plus<00:03:21.139> some<00:03:21.409> because<00:03:22.189> of<00:03:22.310> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
productivity plus some because of the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.800 
productivity plus some because of the
chest<00:03:22.669> and<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.879> ability<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.359> get<00:03:23.479> more<00:03:23.689> than

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
chest and the ability to get more than

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.089 
chest and the ability to get more than
one<00:03:23.989> spirit<00:03:24.319> bloom<00:03:24.470> at<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.650> time<00:03:24.799> which<00:03:25.069> is

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
one spirit bloom at a time which is

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.550 
one spirit bloom at a time which is
really<00:03:25.370> good<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.900> if<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.049> really<00:03:27.319> want<00:03:27.530> to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
really good and if you really want to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.050 
really good and if you really want to
get<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.709> nice<00:03:27.829> run<00:03:28.069> like<00:03:28.189> I<00:03:28.280> said<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.669> riskier

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
get a nice run like I said the riskier

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.689 
get a nice run like I said the riskier
bloom<00:03:29.299> that<00:03:29.540> do<00:03:30.349> spawn<00:03:30.650> just<00:03:30.919> ahead<00:03:31.069> of<00:03:31.189> me<00:03:31.459> and

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:31.699 
bloom that do spawn just ahead of me and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:34.179 
bloom that do spawn just ahead of me and
if<00:03:32.060> you<00:03:32.180> get<00:03:32.359> all<00:03:32.540> those<00:03:32.750> well<00:03:33.169> and<00:03:34.099> then

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
if you get all those well and then

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.530 
if you get all those well and then
you're<00:03:34.310> going<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.459> have<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.609> very<00:03:34.939> nice<00:03:35.180> run<00:03:35.419> in

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
you're going to have a very nice run in

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.129 
you're going to have a very nice run in
your<00:03:35.629> hands<00:03:37.479> so<00:03:38.479> remember<00:03:38.689> at<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.019> beginning

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
you're just looking for the materials

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.229 
you're just looking for the materials
closest<00:03:41.419> to<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.720> junction<00:03:42.049> and<00:03:42.349> don't<00:03:43.220> go<00:03:43.879> in

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
closest to the junction and don't go in

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.569 
closest to the junction and don't go in
with<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.930> intention<00:03:45.439> of<00:03:45.530> farming<00:03:46.069> usually<00:03:46.549> I

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
with the intention of farming usually I

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.009 
with the intention of farming usually I
like<00:03:46.699> to<00:03:46.879> go<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:47.329> with<00:03:47.479> the<00:03:47.659> intention<00:03:47.989> of

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
see them I'm like awesome and then I

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.179 
see them I'm like awesome and then I
take<00:03:58.639> advantage<00:03:59.060> of<00:03:59.180> them<00:03:59.379> if<00:04:00.379> you<00:04:00.590> do<00:04:00.769> find<00:04:01.040> a

take advantage of them if you do find a

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.459 
take advantage of them if you do find a
chest<00:04:01.430> so<00:04:01.549> ever<00:04:01.729> that<00:04:01.879> gives<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.239> like<00:04:02.509> the

chest so ever that gives you like the
