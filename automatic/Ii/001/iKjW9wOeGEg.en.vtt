was<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.950> as<00:01:49.950> far<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:50.399> i<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> pretty<00:01:50.970> early

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
was a as far as i know a pretty early

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
was a as far as i know a pretty early
track<00:01:51.960> maybe<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> grand<00:01:53.340> scheme<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
track maybe not in the grand scheme of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.510 
track maybe not in the grand scheme of
things<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:54.149> uh<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.680> still<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.799> some<00:01:55.920> nice

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
things but uh I still have some nice

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.260 
things but uh I still have some nice
textures<00:01:57.030> except<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.540> bright<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.350> a

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
textures except this bright that's a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.030 
textures except this bright that's a
super<00:02:00.270> bright<00:02:00.509> track<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.590> feels<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.890> it's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
super bright track it feels like it's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.880 
super bright track it feels like it's
like<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.850> Sun<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.420> super<00:02:03.840> bright<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
like the Sun it's super bright but the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370 
like the Sun it's super bright but the
skybox<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.549> sick<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.180> clouds<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.140> everything

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
skybox is sick the clouds and everything

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.150 
skybox is sick the clouds and everything
in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> background<00:02:07.979> that's<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.459> actually

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
in the background that's a actually

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.340 
in the background that's a actually

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
say but that looks really good if the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.900 
say but that looks really good if the
track<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.260> huge<00:02:18.560> challenge<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.220> love<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
track is a huge challenge I love the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.460 
track is a huge challenge I love the
stuff<00:02:20.090> in<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.330> background<00:02:20.510> even<00:02:20.930> I<00:02:21.260> can't

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
stuff in the background even I can't

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.660 
stuff in the background even I can't
even<00:02:21.530> tell<00:02:21.740> what<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> is<00:02:22.010> I'll<00:02:22.250> right<00:02:22.490> over

then check it out ah actually down sided

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.820 
then check it out ah actually down sided
a<00:02:26.480> jump<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.870> don't<00:02:27.290> even<00:02:27.380> know<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.770> stuff

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
kind of an inside dub little jump up on

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.520 
kind of an inside dub little jump up on
here<00:02:47.270> step<00:02:47.630> off<00:02:48.280> miss<00:02:49.280> that<00:02:49.520> bump<00:02:49.990> maybe<00:02:50.990> step

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
here step off miss that bump maybe step

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.890 
here step off miss that bump maybe step
on<00:02:51.710> step<00:02:52.040> off<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.730> wasn't<00:02:53.180> rotting<00:02:53.600> like<00:02:53.840> a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
on step off if I wasn't rotting like a

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.930 
on step off if I wasn't rotting like a
dummy<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:55.220> we'll<00:02:55.400> just<00:02:55.550> take<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:55.880> easy

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
dummy here we'll just take it easy

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.400 
dummy here we'll just take it easy
though<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.910> a<00:02:59.180> choke<00:02:59.780> up<00:02:59.960> on<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.200> in

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
though and just a choke up on that in

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.840 
though and just a choke up on that in
case<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:00.980> course<00:03:01.280> Oh<00:03:03.190> some<00:03:04.190> craziness<00:03:04.700> so

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
case it of course Oh some craziness so

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.790 
case it of course Oh some craziness so
you<00:03:04.940> can<00:03:05.060> see<00:03:05.240> this<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.570> kind<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.960> shrunken

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
you can see this is kind of shrunken

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.860 
you can see this is kind of shrunken
down<00:03:06.860> here<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.760> don't<00:03:08.450> know<00:03:08.510> if<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:08.720> could

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
down here so I don't know if you could

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.480 
down here so I don't know if you could
roll<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.350> or<00:03:09.620> if<00:03:09.710> you<00:03:09.830> should<00:03:09.980> just<00:03:10.130> hit<00:03:10.250> it<00:03:10.310> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
roll that or if you should just hit it a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.520 
roll that or if you should just hit it a
different<00:03:10.670> way<00:03:10.820> but<00:03:10.940> has<00:03:11.660> less<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:12.110> lip<00:03:12.320> than

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
different way but has less of a lip than

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.460 
different way but has less of a lip than
the<00:03:12.650> outside<00:03:12.800> at<00:03:13.130> least<00:03:14.050> figure<00:03:15.050> out<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.290> way<00:03:15.410> to

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
the outside at least figure out a way to

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.350 
the outside at least figure out a way to
get<00:03:15.620> through<00:03:15.830> these<00:03:15.950> step<00:03:16.580> on<00:03:16.730> step<00:03:16.910> off<00:03:17.090> their

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
get through these step on step off their

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.170 
get through these step on step off their
triple<00:03:17.930> out<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.550> guess<00:03:19.550> I<00:03:19.670> didn't<00:03:19.820> triple<00:03:20.060> out

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
triple out I guess I didn't triple out

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.890 
triple out I guess I didn't triple out
triple<00:03:20.870> now<00:03:21.230> triple<00:03:21.740> out<00:03:22.330> big<00:03:23.330> old<00:03:23.570> bowl

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
triple now triple out big old bowl

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.340 
triple now triple out big old bowl
corner<00:03:24.320> here<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:24.830> hook<00:03:24.950> this<00:03:25.160> up<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.350> over

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
corner here just hook this up and over

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.920 
corner here just hook this up and over
kind<00:03:27.770> of<00:03:28.450> make<00:03:29.450> it<00:03:29.480> work<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:31.630> this<00:03:32.630> is<00:03:32.780> where<00:03:32.900> I
