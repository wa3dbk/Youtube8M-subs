in<00:00:18.210> one<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> playbooks<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:19.949> release

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
in one of the playbooks that we release

it's out of our strong scheme we have

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.950 
it's out of our strong scheme we have
revised<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.820> little<00:00:24.029> bit<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.480> make<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.660> more

effective if you have that scheme this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.080

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
that the full back on the wheel route

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
that the full back on the wheel route
can<00:01:21.119> hit<00:01:21.270> him<00:01:21.420> against<00:01:21.720> most<00:01:22.229> man<00:01:22.470> coverages

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
can hit him against most man coverages

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.770 
can hit him against most man coverages
especially<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.700> have<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.909> basketball<00:01:24.299> back

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780

room<00:01:25.130> substituting<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.340> halfback<00:01:27.290> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
room substituting with a halfback you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
room substituting with a halfback you
also<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> tide<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> whip<00:01:29.880> route

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
also have the tide in on the whip route

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
also have the tide in on the whip route
which<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> beat<00:01:31.229> man<00:01:31.439> coverage<00:01:31.470> most

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
which is going to beat man coverage most

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.600 
which is going to beat man coverage most
the<00:01:32.280> time<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:33.740> this<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.070> absolutely

you<00:02:29.960> see<00:02:30.140> loose<00:02:30.320> covers<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:30.890> outside<00:02:31.250> you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
you see loose covers on the outside you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.450 
you see loose covers on the outside you
can<00:02:31.970> usually<00:02:32.120> hit<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.110> outside<00:02:33.320> left<00:02:33.890> same

way you do man coverage I think is a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.280 
way you do man coverage I think is a
little<00:02:36.980> bit<00:02:37.340> different<00:02:38.240> timing<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:38.780> he<00:02:39.200> is

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
little bit different timing but he is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.890 
little bit different timing but he is
