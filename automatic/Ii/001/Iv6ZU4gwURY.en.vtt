00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.170
 Often often in laughter around his 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
 to have booty that's clear 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.449
 and the solarium is also right 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.070
 often visit damaged on the skin 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 can affect and we naturally want 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.239

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 I go to every week so once in 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.690
 I go every week or every 14 days 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.969
 once in the solarium but really more 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.850
 not and what my secret is 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.620
 I'll tell you that before 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.390
 I already have many 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.910
 Experiences of tanning cream made it 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.670
 and not the best, so I wanted it now 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.440
 also try a cream and in the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.480
 most sectors gear and I have 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.309
 simply the next product brought no matter 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.809
 what was on it and I had already 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 I made such bad experiences 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.590
 have the clean room already scream correctly 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.960
 get bad rash 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.960
 or maybe it knows most of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.060
 you that look forward to the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.549
 also replace as for example 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.930
 in Saxony where you sweat a lot and inn 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.119
 en suite human disorders or 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.909
 general uneven and flat 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.350
 it will give you countless experiences 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.180
 and that's why I'm a little bit 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.009
 Inquired I wanted a little bit more 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.299
 look at it what I want to lead me 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.159
 but also a bit of quality 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.740
 looked and I have just one 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.869
 product is found and that's it 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.479
 here from eco sonja that one 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.100
 Australian product and really 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.730
 really good ingredients so 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.190
 the main ingredient is everything 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.310
 then also has avocado extracts in it 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.260
 as well as catania rose oil so 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.510
 really really good ingredients 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.360
 It is super easy to apply it 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.190
 is also a couple of moisture complexes 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.840
 So the skin is anna and feels 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.060
 Not dry and it is 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.710
 really even you do not have any 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.270
 red or yellow sting so I am with the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.070
 Product really satisfied, I'm glad 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.150
 that I found it and that means 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.580
 also invisible th 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.920
 because if we bears the overnight on 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.740
 and each bed is then drives the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.540
 textiles that's sometimes like that 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.610
 then the whole bedding is full and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.530
 you have to wash first and it's her 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.300
 just let him move in and that 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.990
 horse just not from that I think so too 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.970
 really good and that's why I wanted 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.460
 just because a big demand 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.470
 was everyone I ask what I asked 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.240
 for my skin when the trees and 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.850
 As I said from the solarium a bit 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.350
 to get away and not skin 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.720
 I take this too much damage 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.830
 Recommend product should be cold 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.810
 really look at it when you get involved 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.670
 Self obsolete let the ingredients 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.730
 not only buys the cheapest 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.400
 but really looks important because he 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.680
 It's a painful end to your skin 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.390
 biggest organ what we have and what in 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.770
 The skin finally succeeded in penetrating 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.200
 in the body that's why you have to look at it 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.650
 Pay attention to what you take and also 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.150
 have interest in him I pack up 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.800
 put a link in the description below 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.590

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.480
 discount so you love that was mine 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.910
 advice as well that was my answer 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.010
 on your question what I mean I skin 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.810
 Of course, do not show yourself to buy 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.620
 you can do it yourself 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.360
 to use joy 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.130
 but I advise you if you are 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.020
 a self buys the looks 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.390
 has natural ingredients and that it does so 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.610
 little pollutants as possible on yours 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.070
 skin smears is really important that 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.390
 just my tip is in demand that is mine 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.340
