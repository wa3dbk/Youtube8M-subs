00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
right-click everywhere and yeah I I just

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.950 
right-click everywhere and yeah I I just
noticed<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.360> missed

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
noticed that I missed

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
noticed that I missed
Armidale<00:01:49.350> gloves<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.340> these<00:01:50.790> two<00:01:51.030> drops<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Armidale gloves so these two drops I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.109 
Armidale gloves so these two drops I
almost<00:01:51.869> missed<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.280> am<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.579> sure<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:53.790> they

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
almost missed and I am not sure if they

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
almost missed and I am not sure if they
increase<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> effigy<00:01:55.170> drop<00:01:55.409> rate<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.100> got

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
increase the effigy drop rate but I got

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.260 
increase the effigy drop rate but I got
5<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.060> 500<00:01:57.810> kills<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.100> more<00:01:59.460> common<00:01:59.939> than

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
5 in 500 kills so it's more common than

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.990 
5 in 500 kills so it's more common than
it<00:02:00.420> used<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:01.189> maybe<00:02:02.189> I'm<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.549> lucky<00:02:02.759> or

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it used to be maybe I'm just lucky or

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149 
it used to be maybe I'm just lucky or
maybe<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.930> actually<00:02:03.960> increase<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> drop

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
maybe they actually increase the drop

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.520 
maybe they actually increase the drop
rate<00:02:05.509> what<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.899> price<00:02:07.140> shaking

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
rate what I'm going to be price shaking

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.809 
rate what I'm going to be price shaking
though<00:02:07.710> you're<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.250> see<00:02:08.399> only<00:02:08.489> two

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
though you're going to see only two

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.330 
though you're going to see only two
refugees<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.379> opened<00:02:10.830> 3<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
refugees that is because I opened 3 of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.730 
refugees that is because I opened 3 of
them<00:02:11.520> but<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.270> check<00:02:12.510> my<00:02:12.660> adventures

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
them but you can check my adventures

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.880 
them but you can check my adventures
all<00:02:13.800> five<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.310> them<00:02:14.610> should<00:02:14.880> be<00:02:14.910> in<00:02:15.240> there<00:02:15.890> so

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
all five of them should be in there so

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.440 
all five of them should be in there so
yeah<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.430> think<00:02:17.520> that's<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.030> that's<00:02:18.150> all<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
yeah I think that's it that's all I

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.110 
yeah I think that's it that's all I
wanted<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.900> talk<00:02:19.290> about<00:02:19.320> Adam<00:02:19.860> until<00:02:20.120> it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
wanted to talk about Adam until it's

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080 
wanted to talk about Adam until it's
very<00:02:21.180> easy<00:02:21.510> boss<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.580> ever<00:02:23.910> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
very easy boss you know but ever the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.300 
very easy boss you know but ever the
world<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.570> just<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.080> so<00:02:25.350> crowded<00:02:25.590> way<00:02:26.250> too

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
world is just it's so crowded way too

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.760 
world is just it's so crowded way too
crowded<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.720> hard<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.020> find<00:02:28.230> worlds

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
crowded it's very hard to find worlds

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.240 
crowded it's very hard to find worlds
what<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.670> noticed<00:02:30.150> though<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:31.250> lucha

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
what I noticed though is that lucha

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.970 
what I noticed though is that lucha
worlds<00:02:32.790> tend<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.330> more<00:02:33.540> empty<00:02:33.870> than<00:02:33.990> not

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
worlds tend to be more empty than not

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.640 
worlds tend to be more empty than not
lucha<00:02:35.430> worlds<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.180> even<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:36.960> go<00:02:37.140> solo<00:02:37.590> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
lucha worlds so even if you go solo you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.860 
lucha worlds so even if you go solo you
just<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.340> should<00:02:38.520> try<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.790> lucha<00:02:39.300> worlds<00:02:39.720> as

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
just you should try the lucha worlds as

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.230 
just you should try the lucha worlds as
well<00:02:40.140> alright<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> think<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.000> time<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
well alright so now I think it's time to

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.810 
well alright so now I think it's time to
do<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> price<00:02:42.690> check<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.740> total<00:02:43.890> as<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.610> see

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
do a price check so in total as you see

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.350 
do a price check so in total as you see
I<00:02:44.850> got<00:02:45.270> six<00:02:46.020> drops<00:02:46.320> six<00:02:46.710> are<00:02:46.920> middle<00:02:47.220> drops<00:02:47.550> so

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
I got six drops six are middle drops so

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.440 
I got six drops six are middle drops so
I<00:02:48.720> would<00:02:48.960> say<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.560> average<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.150> what

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
I would say it's average this is what

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.630 
I would say it's average this is what
you<00:02:51.540> should<00:02:51.600> expect<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:52.680> 500<00:02:53.370> kills

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you should expect to get from 500 kills

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.150 
you should expect to get from 500 kills
it's<00:02:54.120> not<00:02:54.330> too<00:02:54.450> many<00:02:54.570> or<00:02:54.780> anything<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.860> it's

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
it's not too many or anything so it's

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's not too many or anything so it's
very<00:02:56.340> good<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> got<00:02:57.810> my<00:02:57.990> seventh<00:02:58.500> armadyl
