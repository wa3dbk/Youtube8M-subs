00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.060 
movie or video the angle works out just
perfectly<00:01:30.360> however<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> want<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> can

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
perfectly however if you want you can

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.039 
perfectly however if you want you can
also<00:01:32.189> use<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.970> typing<00:01:33.360> stand<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.810> like

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
by Apple put into a case itself so just

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
by Apple put into a case itself so just
look<00:01:40.470> at<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> typing<00:01:41.009> angle<00:01:41.159> here<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.610> overall

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
look at the typing angle here in overall

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
look at the typing angle here in overall
it<00:01:42.270> works<00:01:42.540> very<00:01:42.810> well<00:01:42.990> i<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.649> say<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:43.890> love
