00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
Butt Knife 2

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.910
Murder Continued

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.650
(Imouto-sama's wings are beautiful......)

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.710
(Maybe I should put on some accessory, too)

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.510
Sakuya-san is dead again by the butt!

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.110
Uu: This smells like a murder!

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.780
Imouto: Are you ok, Sakuya!?

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.380
Legal Measure

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.110
Someone help Sakuya!

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.910
Be careful! This girl is out of her mind!

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.050
Could she be the one who killed Sakuya-san!?

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.780
Wait

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.650
Let's decide the murderer fairly by a majority vote

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.780
Let's decide the murderer fairly by a majority vote
Uu: I expected nothing less from the "Brain of the Moon." A judicious decision

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.450
Raise your hand if you think Flan did it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.250
I didn't do it!

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.110
I didn't do it!
Uu: She cloned herself!

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.650
She looks innocent, but she's actually sly!

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.880
Good-Bye

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.380
But Imouto-sama's innocence has now been proven......

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.380
Damn it, who killed Sakuya-san......!?

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.980
I don't care who the murderer is, hurry and help Sakuya!

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.650
I don't care who the murderer is, hurry and help Sakuya!
Impossible......it's already too late......

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.250
I didn't even say goodbye to Sakuya...! I didn't tell her "thanks"...!

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.110
I didn't even say goodbye to Sakuya...! I didn't tell her "thanks"...!
Flan......

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.710
I'm sorry! I'm sorry for being such a powerless Oneechan!

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.380
I'm sorry! I'm sorry for being such a powerless Oneechan!
Uwaaaaaaaaaan!

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.580
Hourai Balls

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.310
Wait!

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.050
There's still a way!

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.850
There's still a way!
What did you say!?

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.980
I read this in a manga once. Apparently if you collect these 7 balls, any wish will come true

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:33.250
Uu: You mean we can revive Sakuya if we have those!

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.980
But where would we find balls like that?

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.780
But where would we find balls like that?
I ripped the page from the manga!

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.510
I hadn't thought of that!

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.250
And here is the result

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.850
Welcome back, Sakuya!

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.910
Maid's Souvenir

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.450
Welcome back, Sakuya-san

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.110
I'm back, Meiling

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.780
I tried hard!

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.110
I did my best, Sakuya!

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.450
Imouto-sama......thank you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.980
Did you bring any souvenir, my wonderful maid?

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.910
I don't have any souvenir, but please take a look

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.510
There are silver knives in my butt

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.180
Man, that looks painful

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.410
Thank you for watching
[So, when do I come in?]
