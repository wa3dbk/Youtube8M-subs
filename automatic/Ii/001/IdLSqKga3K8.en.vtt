00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.440
 as well as soccer it is also here the round belongs in Australia warmly 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.460
 welcome back to Kemper Job Â«I would like to show Werder a short time how 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.149
 she is by helicopter from Solon 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.609
 Munich have to do something different 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 Kurt apologize to Beelitz - Oliver will not be repeated on it today 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.480
 respect, think highly of 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.240
 So for the first time electricity 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.579
 and then it starts 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.239
 dpa 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:34.230
 i am in my caravan is by a single model show it like 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.170
 with the water supply is 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.740
 as well as the wastewater supply is to handle 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.400
 Of course, first of all you have to look where the water supply is, where to get it 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
 Water I've already said in the Alps and with them it is mostly 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.380
 to 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.110
 the bundle of the sink 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.270
 most of the time one of the older ones would be fresh water 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.940
 But that's not always like this 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.749
 so 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.899
 hardly any success after being in the caravan the fresh water supply 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.400
 now peile own caravan was like that 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.159
 that my foot why so 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.560
 was installed in the front of the dust coffers 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.600
 I had that myself rebuilt times because I just percent the possibility 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.320
 you had easier to change the water 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 and where to introduce weak points of theirs 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.370
 Â«When I arrived here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.500
 Of course, that was the question where is this installed or Boris in turn 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.040
 but the fully fast find it and here m 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 where to sit under the seat 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.180
 there moor protection good piece 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.380
 Photo Warner supply installed in the message 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.479
 like the comb layers for the tripwolf care because kids is a little 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.110
 Bomb your weapon after challenge 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.010
 here finish hose 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.870
 As you can see this saying is not quite clean we have been here before 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.060
 felt that he would look at the number 2 0 for the Heimelf 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.880
 the cap just does not thank you for filling up the EDA 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.399
 So that number could be from Swabia and that body makes for it 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.630
 the Transport 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.710
 with this model is like that 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.020
 that the manufacturer has found a solution 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.050
 the one called service flap 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.019
 the water tanks or the book or fill up 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.209
 to simplify 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.809
 we are talking about a Trabant 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:15.499
 but I have to say the Serbian Tabat Falls is a robust car 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.189
 so 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.099
 There are many advantages to adopting any other type 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.729
 popular car 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.299
 30 cents or similar 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.749
 Do you know who whitewashed models but in this case 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.619
 many beautiful have been charged 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.059
 then you can either in the water tank 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.760
 to push through the gaps 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.879
 also would 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.480
 carelessly see your own fist 8 and then we'll see you coming here 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.659
 to carry the sample 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.849
 the right career choice agreed 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.689
 This went to completely undressed was filled with water and in a row 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.689
 put in again 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.919
 8th 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.829
 Kucka 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:57.849
 Flap too 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.849
 what he has to do what too much as already said 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.879
 namely the whole unit out 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.669
 as he betrayed them also screwing menacing October with one in turn 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.049
 and look slightly upwards 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.179
 this is indeed installed check valve 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.229
 but anyway the water was not so full on a weight job 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.859
 cautious because of that 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.609
 the lid on it 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.109
 stand firmly 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.169
 and then the whole thing can go outside Boston 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.990
 I have filled up water now and Frenzel with this case 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.549
 April or vice versa 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.549
 the water supply nuclear bomb again pure poker 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.789
 DAPD 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.789
 to make the closure again 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:47.519
 finished 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.150
 the whole thing liquidator Kuntscher in front should be something in passing 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.379
 or leakage 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.269
 is still the 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.120
 Clientele both dar to catch the leaking water 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.869
 so and weather man and that was exhausting thing because i might 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.499
 Transporting so far is simply because I was infinite 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.319
 The car is in the sun all the time 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.319
 We did not think so even if it was the rainy season 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.929
 Group-wide suspicion that everything works 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.840
 so 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.729
 we go to the kitchen area 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.819
 ca 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:24.479
 and one here during the show at the OECD model said Wenger o'mara does it 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:25.449
 clicking 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.729
 that would have the switch criticisms in the aftermath 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.740
 just water supply strong 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 this choice is here a turn knob 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.389
 and when I wake up Bachmann CEO or run away 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.949
 because the water is running properly 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.129
 it is probably not the only one 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:47.379
 Decline on water as this obviously has the second and indeed 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.659
 the whole in the bathroom 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.310
 This is also in the tube to see if that works well 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.539
 and here too soon becomes a nightmare and a host 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.870
 Dr-ing 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.889
 here is also no failure of Sulander Scheider continued his ride 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.199
 and here, too, the water often runs perfectly 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.800
 because it was just a little bit faster, but it's about being old organ 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.839
 us exchanges are 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:12.870
 the rainwater must be played 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.699
 but they see 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:17.479
 he works 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.330
 now counteracts too high when I do that 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.280
 leave a year but have not used or longer I have the whole 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.960
 Flush system that was me in the 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.850
 that "process gives an addition to buy the application but so Thomas Schramm 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.580
 Deposits or the like 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.599
 to do there 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:35.990
 that is on the consumption on it many listened to 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.400
 then be able to play any pollutants 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.860
 I've already burned the whole team though 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.569
 to play correctly at the beginning had already been through that on the second 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.069
 and I do not do anything else like that 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:52.330
 Water march and let it run until the tank is empty 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.930
 Of course, the water has to go somewhere 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.000
 at the most different models up to the most different possibilities where 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.029
 the water then 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.409
 comes to a close 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.570
 that is, sweet caravan will be down a pipe 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.999
 where the water gets by 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.839
 But at the latest, find the world very quickly when the water is running 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.020
 lets where it comes out 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.849
 important for it 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.449
 It must always be caught if you are not directly in advance 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.460
 could probably run free through a hose 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.539
 Misurata takes a picture about it 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.740
 We design the removal or the conclusion it is up to us 

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:32.979
 some put at a housing which other containers 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.900
 I waited so brought a car 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.620
 who has the advantage you can meet here from the SC Freiburg emotions 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.619
 transport 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:42.569
 he has a clear influence 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.129
 and he has a great outing that gives athletes extra importance 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:49.270
 I have my caravan for that 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.660
 simply when loud Heinemann can uncover the departure picture and that's the whole 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.419
 normal in the container 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:00.150
 The water again from my side I hope you could have another tip 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.120
 from living or seeing how the whole thing works if we never have 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.180
 have made 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.230
 on television has no issues on issues just write me or just below 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:10.169
 the video 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.229
 a charred sign 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.729
 and accordingly still holds 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.729
 or I'll just write you back via e-mail or something similar 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.030
 to see the Belgian 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.310
 and have fun already Campaign
