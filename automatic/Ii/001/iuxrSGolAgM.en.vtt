00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.750
 so we will follow a little guide for the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.490
 disassembly you'll see it's 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.710
 definitely easier than for the iphone 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.600
 4 and 4s so it's a guide a it's 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.100
 not a tutorial this is just for 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.230
 those interested to see how he 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.210
 is mounted how can we remove the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.859
 window for example but it's not a 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.939
 tutorial the tutorials they will come in 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.020
 same time as the spare parts for 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.040
 the moment we did not receive the coins 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.239
 spare parts being procured 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.300
 but it's interesting to show you 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.540
 how is disassembled lifan bag so enough 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.680
 4s we will be interested in the iphone 5 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.780
 at first we will turn it off 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.320
 so it's not activated rock did not 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.440
 not sent the card we will turn off the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.420
 good news it's the same vices that 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.440
 opening only for the 4 or the very case 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.969
 very beginner at dawn 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.280
 so to open it just needs it 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.190
 a Phillips screwdriver with a screwdriver 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.780
 pentalobe of a sucker so this model 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.610
 where this model there I want to resume I 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.830
 here it is the simplest we go in 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.229
 a first time just open have removed 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.240
 the two vices pentalobe it's the same 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.119
 disassembly method that on the 3g and the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.800
 3gs for those who know so just 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.069
 of life stretches repeats it's not 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.240
 tutorial it's just a guide for you 

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:24.819
 explain a little bit how it's done 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.319
 tutorials they will come after or there we 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.450
 will really explain step by step 

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:30.789
 how to change the glass the battery etc 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.819
 we come to remove the two vices 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.750
 pentalobe and then simply 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.289
 with a sucker 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.550
 we will put to the home button so we 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.690
 will apply the sucker so the 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.500
 next or professional the word 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.490
 in use 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.410
 we all need it will just pulled 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.410
 to us the screen 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.320
 so we will shoot the sucker 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.250
 we can help ourselves a little bit in a 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:11.840
 opening tool as soon as it was taken off 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.840
 a little bit these recalcitrant 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.050
 that's not open 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:45.720
 so he's slightly sticking one on the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:49.799
 sides we will remove the sucker there 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.250
 can become and simply you see a 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:56.670
 little like on the 3g or a 3gs is there 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.200
 the screen remove the wafer that is there 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.090
 who will fix the screen in fact while 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:18.989
 simply 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:19.799
 so we'll do a little zoom a vi 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.150
 this is the first time I'm going 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:35.120
 demonstrate that I really do not 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:35.120
 the habit obviously 2 and 3 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:47.030
 we will remove the plate and then that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.030
 it's my screen tablecloth 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.000
 where to go from eclipsed he had yielded and the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.939
 tactile 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:08.079
 here is your screen and disassemble I redo 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:12.909
 a little zoom out so simply 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.829
 to quickly explain to you 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.699
 tutorials well right after so the screen 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.500
 with the camera facetime the battery that 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.389
 is significantly larger than on 1 that 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.400
 on a 4s I like to be the next 4s 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.660
 open for against then get it 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.789
 count you see the battery wins 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:34.720
 enough in width the motherboard the module 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:36.940
 photo back the the live jack 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.630
 who passed who is past who is 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.130
 simply went down 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.740
 so after to put it back the button 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.000
 home also who is a this level there 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.820
 which has changed also with respect to 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.229
 compared to 4 to 4s so the good 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.360
 new for all repairers and 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.199

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.310
 is that iphones 4s is really 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.539
 easy to repair for regarding 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.479
 the screen regards the back shell 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.800
