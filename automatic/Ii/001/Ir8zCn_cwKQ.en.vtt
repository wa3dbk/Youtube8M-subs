with<00:00:24.060> any<00:00:24.210> curse<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.289> it's<00:00:25.470> something

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
with any curse I think it's something

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.529 
with any curse I think it's something
that<00:00:25.920> people<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.340> in<00:00:26.490> their<00:00:26.519> mind<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.390> like

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
that people have in their mind so like

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.300 
that people have in their mind so like
he<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:27.810> told<00:00:28.080> he<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.410> cursed<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:28.830> he<00:00:28.949> believed

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
he was told he was cursed so he believed

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.859 
he was told he was cursed so he believed
it<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.609> believed<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.240> believed<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it and believed it and believed it and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.560 
it and believed it and believed it and
convinced<00:00:31.619> himself<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.040> he<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.460> cursed<00:00:32.880> but

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
convinced himself that he was cursed but

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.840 
convinced himself that he was cursed but
I<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.649> maybe<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> coincidence

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
I just think was maybe a coincidence

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
I just think was maybe a coincidence
it's<00:00:36.540> incredibly<00:00:37.350> professional<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.160> think

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
it's incredibly professional I think

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.740 
it's incredibly professional I think
it's<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> things<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.090> motivates<00:00:39.570> me

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
it's one of the things that motivates me

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.780 
it's one of the things that motivates me
most<00:00:39.960> even<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.190> days<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.670> pretty

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
most even on the days that are pretty

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.569 
most even on the days that are pretty
tough<00:00:42.590> here<00:00:43.590> whether<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.460> like

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
tough here whether it's just like

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.520 
tough here whether it's just like
workload<00:00:45.149> or<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.600> difficult<00:00:46.200> day<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
workload or a difficult day with a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
workload or a difficult day with a
particular<00:00:47.100> student<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.390> cool<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
particular student it's really cool to

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.869 
particular student it's really cool to
know<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:49.170> are<00:00:49.200> other<00:00:50.190> colleagues<00:00:50.730> in

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
know that there are other colleagues in

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.000 
know that there are other colleagues in
the<00:00:50.910> building<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.390> our<00:00:51.629> solution<00:00:52.230> oriented

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the building that our solution oriented

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.220 
the building that our solution oriented
and<00:00:53.489> always<00:00:53.789> thinking<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.600> how<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.079> make

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and always thinking of how can we make

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
and always thinking of how can we make
this<00:00:55.289> work<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:56.219> long<00:00:56.399> how<00:00:56.670> did<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this work how long how did all the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
this work how long how did all the
people<00:00:57.270> fit<00:00:57.449> there<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.899> said<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.260> it's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
people fit there so we said that it's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
people fit there so we said that it's
like<00:00:58.530> Hector<00:00:59.010> or<00:00:59.489> zeros<00:01:00.000> mom<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.750> how<00:01:00.960> are

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
like Hector or zeros mom but how are

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
like Hector or zeros mom but how are
they<00:01:01.320> really<00:01:01.500> put<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.829> check<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:03.660> lots

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
plans as well so that my lesson plans

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.109 
plans as well so that my lesson plans
really<00:01:16.259> feed<00:01:16.680> into<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.040> unit<00:01:17.250> plans<00:01:17.460> before

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
really feed into my unit plans before

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.870 
really feed into my unit plans before
coming<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.420> team<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.990> wasn't<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.670> strong<00:01:20.670> at

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
coming to team I wasn't really strong at

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.820 
coming to team I wasn't really strong at
doing<00:01:21.119> any<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.360> those<00:01:21.540> things<00:01:21.600> because<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
doing any of those things because of the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
doing any of those things because of the
heat<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> yellow<00:01:23.729> spotted<00:01:24.090> lizard<00:01:24.360> both

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
heat and the yellow spotted lizard both

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
heat and the yellow spotted lizard both
of<00:01:25.049> those<00:01:25.200> make<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> dangerous<00:01:25.880> definitely

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
of those make it dangerous definitely

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.800 
of those make it dangerous definitely
definitely<00:01:27.479> let's<00:01:28.470> jump<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.329> Elijah<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
definitely let's jump over to Elijah I

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
definitely let's jump over to Elijah I
expect<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> lot<00:01:31.590> out<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.920> students<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.340> terms

those mistakes and that makes us become

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.980 
those mistakes and that makes us become
a<00:01:47.250> better<00:01:47.430> thinker<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.329> makes<00:01:48.540> us<00:01:48.689> become<00:01:48.960> a
