00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.549
 hello everyone here and shawl in my first 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:10.220
 youtube video about gta 5 how 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.230
 get a $ 12,000 briefcase 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.400
 here we are with the franklin character 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.380
 which is what I have been told they have 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.660
 more resistance under water and for 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.340
 we can take that, do not think that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.020
 marketing you can only take one 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.850
 time because then you would say go fuck 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.680
 of trick I do not know what not 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.390
 once you take the briefcase you change 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.689
 of character and put back to the 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.520
 franklin and how would not give time to upload 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.380
 to the surface and go down because I was 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.820
 quite profound when changing 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.190
 character aside from going back to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.780
 reappear the franklin briefcase go back to 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.370
 have all of the lung capacity 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:46.100
 that you see here me on the map now 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.540
 because I have this that is marked on 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.790
 place that I want to go but I also have 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.080
 put a point of interest is here look 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.450
 in the map 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.610
 this is where the clover lives as well 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.950
 say it for this area is where he lives 3 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.860
 board and here they live there in the area 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.510
 more than rich another day will upload a video 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.049
 how to get the bugatti veyron that 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.580
 exposed free zone when on the mobile 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.920
 or on any computer that you connect 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.570
 on that page of buying cars worth 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.920
 a million dollars good keep 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.920
 let's proceed with this trick 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.020
 we were going to the place 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.960
 we have already arrived I am going back a 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.850
 little I do not know what happened to me this trick 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.729
 It is 100% reliable because I have tried it 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.700
 several times it works, you see how 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.960
 here is a good plane the tail of the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.610
 clear plane is what you have to 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.370
 find 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.660
 where is the plane's tail and theoretically 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.159
 the briefcase has to be here 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.620
 down 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.290
 let's look 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.440
 Look, you see what this shines 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.120
 this is the briefcase 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.390
 now it will be seen I will put the menu of the 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.840
 characters plus 12 thousand dollars you see here 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.930
 well over 12 thousand dollars now I change for 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.390
 example to maikel so to speak could 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.909
 change the wheat perfectly but I've 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.440
 changed to maikel 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.640
 once we have the other character 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.640
 to see if he loads the story 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.170
 once we have michael who is here 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 in a traffic jam we put 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 to franklin 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.990
 and when you can see 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.990
 so it's loaded 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.519
 the briefcase is another 12,000 and 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.299
 so the times it takes 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.299
 well bye
