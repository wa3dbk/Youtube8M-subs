00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.420
 module to connect from cartes to 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.689
 arduino 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:29.480
 do it yourself we can of course on ebay 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:34.280
 buy this type of module but there are 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:37.730
 such situations when the project needs 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.970
 Connect the sd card and the module with you is not 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.909
 have this way we can carry help 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:49.839
 make such adapters by soldering with glue and 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:53.500
 self sd card module 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.500
 let's increase 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.330
 it is better 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.920
 this aspen it is connected now 4 types 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.480
 programs for it can be assigned to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.480
 some other pink 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.120
 well and let's test ours 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.960
 homemade of de module for this 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:57.100
 open the built-in library for sd 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:59.860
 cards example red in right here it is who is not 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.930
 know you can always change pin cs 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.930
 about 4 on some other 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.399
 Well, here we will send here 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.600
 write such string to text file 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:22.500
 let's replace it with this line here and 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:24.940
 we will load when opening serial monitor and 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 here we will be recorded 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:35.350
 read from the string our module works 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.850
 fine i by the way connected it now 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.340
 power to 5 volts even 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.950
 it's risky but here on three cards 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.750
 everything worked fine for me none 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.750
 the card has not failed 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.519
 The method that I used video tutorials 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.630
 he is risky 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.580
 everything went well for me but if u 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.550
 you have some sort of valuable sd card better 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:08.680
 use a voltage divider or 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:11.709
 even better sd card adapter if you 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.970
 valuable card or valuable information on it 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:18.550
 so I think safer 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.010
 I have a review of this module on the channel 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.630
 did 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 can see use the module
