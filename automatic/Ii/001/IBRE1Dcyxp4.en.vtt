00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
for the sake of time once you once you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.139 
for the sake of time once you once you
do<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:03.030> thing<00:02:03.240> comes<00:02:03.450> off<00:02:03.570> pretty<00:02:03.810> easy

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
do it this thing comes off pretty easy

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.389 
do it this thing comes off pretty easy
you<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.240> pick<00:02:06.600> right<00:02:06.840> off<00:02:07.039> you<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.220> set<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you just pick right off you just set it

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.110 
you just pick right off you just set it
aside<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.869> that's<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.950> back<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.129> your<00:02:11.400> TV

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
aside and that's the back of your TV

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.640 
aside and that's the back of your TV
it's<00:02:12.390> basically<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.080> cover<00:02:13.319> here

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it's basically just a cover here

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.100 
it's basically just a cover here
the<00:02:13.739> inside<00:02:14.099> of<00:02:14.129> your<00:02:14.930> wonderful<00:02:15.930> television

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the inside of your wonderful television

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.390 
the inside of your wonderful television
that<00:02:16.590> went<00:02:16.769> bad<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:18.659> right<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.530> is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that went bad on you and right here is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.240 
that went bad on you and right here is
the<00:02:20.640> inverter<00:02:20.939> board<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.390> went<00:02:21.540> bad<00:02:21.689> on<00:02:21.720> me

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
the inverter board that went bad on me

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.619 
the inverter board that went bad on me
now<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.579> actually<00:02:23.879> the<00:02:23.970> new<00:02:24.120> one<00:02:24.360> but

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
now this is actually the new one but

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.899 
now this is actually the new one but
I've<00:02:25.349> already<00:02:25.590> taken<00:02:25.769> out<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.159> old<00:02:26.189> one<00:02:26.519> for

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
I've already taken out the old one for

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.550 
I've already taken out the old one for
the<00:02:26.970> sake<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.180> time<00:02:27.420> I'll<00:02:28.019> show<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:28.439> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the sake of time I'll show you what the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.830 
the sake of time I'll show you what the
cover<00:02:28.769> looks<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.549> over<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.629> on<00:02:30.659> this

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
cover looks like on it over here on this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.449 
cover looks like on it over here on this
side<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.319> slave<00:02:31.620> it's<00:02:31.920> basically<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
side is the slave it's basically the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.420 
side is the slave it's basically the
same<00:02:32.640> cover<00:02:32.939> and<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.010> pop<00:02:35.280> off

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
same cover and you just you just pop off

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.160 
same cover and you just you just pop off
the<00:02:35.609> four<00:02:35.819> screws<00:02:36.120> there's<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.629> there<00:02:36.959> one

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
the four screws there's one there one

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.470 
the four screws there's one there one
there<00:02:37.349> one<00:02:38.340> up<00:02:38.489> there<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.700> then<00:02:38.970> one<00:02:39.120> up<00:02:39.269> there

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
there one up there and then one up there

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.599 
there one up there and then one up there
pull<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.319> off<00:02:40.549> and<00:02:41.780> that<00:02:42.780> board<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.609> exposed

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
pull that off and that board is exposed

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.099 
pull that off and that board is exposed
then<00:02:44.849> in<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.299> then<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.569> just<00:02:45.780> take<00:02:45.900> off

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
then in it and then you just take off

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.009 
then in it and then you just take off
the<00:02:46.230> little<00:02:46.379> ribbons<00:02:46.970> there's<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.150> ribbon<00:02:48.540> here

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
the little ribbons there's a ribbon here

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.160 
the little ribbons there's a ribbon here
a<00:02:49.579> ribbon<00:02:50.579> here<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.239> then<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.690> ribbon<00:02:52.049> down

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
a ribbon here and then a ribbon down

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.830 
a ribbon here and then a ribbon down
here<00:02:52.680> any<00:02:53.609> ribbon<00:02:53.970> attached<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.569> board

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
here any ribbon attached to that board

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
here any ribbon attached to that board
and<00:02:55.019> yours<00:02:55.170> may<00:02:55.379> be<00:02:55.409> a<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.739> different<00:02:56.040> or

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and yours may be a little different or

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.559 
and yours may be a little different or
whatnot<00:02:56.609> you<00:02:56.819> know<00:02:57.060> different<00:02:57.420> brands

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
whatnot you know different brands

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.309 
whatnot you know different brands
different<00:02:57.690> things<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.840> take<00:03:00.989> all<00:03:01.200> the

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
different things just take all the

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.690 
different things just take all the
ribbons<00:03:01.620> off<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.950> are<00:03:02.069> attached<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.549> and

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
ribbons off that are attached to it and

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.250 
ribbons off that are attached to it and
it'll<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.120> come<00:03:03.359> off<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.750> mean<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.989> can<00:03:04.109> just

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it'll just come off I mean you can just

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.229 
it'll just come off I mean you can just
pull<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.500> off<00:03:04.650> no<00:03:05.280> problem<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:08.239> as

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
pull it off no problem and then as

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.789 
pull it off no problem and then as
always<00:03:09.920> I'll<00:03:10.920> tell<00:03:11.159> you<00:03:11.280> just<00:03:11.510> assemble<00:03:12.510> it

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
always I'll tell you just assemble it

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.890 
always I'll tell you just assemble it
back<00:03:13.799> in<00:03:14.459> reverse<00:03:14.849> of<00:03:15.150> what<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:15.420> did<00:03:15.540> taking

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
back in reverse of what you did taking

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.990 
back in reverse of what you did taking
it<00:03:15.989> apart<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.560> then<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.459> should<00:03:17.519> be<00:03:17.790> good<00:03:17.819> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
it apart and then you should be good to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.909 
it apart and then you should be good to
go<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:19.079> my<00:03:19.290> inverter<00:03:19.680> board<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:22.620> little

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
go now on my inverter board this little

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.670 
go now on my inverter board this little
chip<00:03:23.160> right<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:24.230> then<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.260> won't<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.590> able

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
chip right here then you won't be able

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.949 
chip right here then you won't be able
to<00:03:25.799> see<00:03:26.099> on<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.669> video<00:03:26.760> even<00:03:27.359> if<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.629> had<00:03:27.780> my

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
to see on the video even if I had my

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.039 
to see on the video even if I had my
other<00:03:28.260> board<00:03:28.530> but<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.549> happens<00:03:29.970> is<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.629> you

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
other board but what happens is if you

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.500 
other board but what happens is if you
look<00:03:31.079> real<00:03:31.500> closely<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:32.250> way<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:32.940> tell<00:03:33.239> if

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
look real closely the way to tell if

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.830 
look real closely the way to tell if
your<00:03:33.540> which<00:03:34.079> one's<00:03:34.290> bad<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:35.239> real<00:03:36.239> close<00:03:36.540> on

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
your which one's bad is real close on

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.309 
your which one's bad is real close on
that<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.230> these<00:03:37.319> chips<00:03:37.650> you'll<00:03:38.400> see<00:03:38.639> a<00:03:38.669> pin

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
that one of these chips you'll see a pin

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.319 
that one of these chips you'll see a pin
that<00:03:40.319> just<00:03:40.680> looks<00:03:41.040> black<00:03:41.370> all<00:03:41.909> these<00:03:42.090> pins

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
that just looks black all these pins

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.939 
that just looks black all these pins
should<00:03:42.510> look<00:03:42.659> silver<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.349> are<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.560> this<00:03:43.739> on

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
should look silver that are on this on

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.479 
should look silver that are on this on
this<00:03:44.099> chip<00:03:44.849> if<00:03:45.419> you<00:03:46.049> find<00:03:46.319> a<00:03:46.409> black<00:03:46.650> pin<00:03:46.919> then

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
this chip if you find a black pin then

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.159 
this chip if you find a black pin then
more<00:03:47.790> than<00:03:47.940> likely<00:03:48.150> that's<00:03:48.479> the<00:03:48.690> bad<00:03:48.840> board

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
more than likely that's the bad board

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.710 
more than likely that's the bad board
and<00:03:49.440> also<00:03:49.560> like<00:03:50.069> in<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.519> chip<00:03:50.760> itself<00:03:50.970> right

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
and also like in the chip itself right

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.860 
and also like in the chip itself right
where<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:51.989> black<00:03:52.169> pin<00:03:52.849> meets<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:54.090> chip<00:03:54.329> there

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
where the black pin meets the chip there
