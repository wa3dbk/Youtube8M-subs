only<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.970> five<00:01:36.150> chemistry<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:36.750> they

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
only have five chemistry because they

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
are actually sent her attacker mids but

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.219 
are actually sent her attacker mids but
this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> best<00:01:39.060> formation<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.049> all

this is the best formation to get all
six<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.680> these<00:01:40.799> players<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> can

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
six of these players in so you can

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.550 
six of these players in so you can
convert<00:01:42.540> them<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.720> see<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.350> want

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
convert them to see them if you want

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.010

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
to waste I don't really have that anyway

week foot five star skills again I'm

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.600 
week foot five star skills again I'm
amazed<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.170> sign<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.470> forgets<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:56.340> he<00:01:56.430> gets

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
amazed at sign and forgets if he gets

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
amazed at sign and forgets if he gets
from<00:01:56.820> goal<00:01:57.060> he<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.600> most<00:01:57.780> probably<00:01:57.840> school

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
from goal he will most probably school

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.770 
from goal he will most probably school
but<00:01:58.439> as<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.520> CDM<00:01:59.939> position<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
but as he is in the CDM position just so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
but as he is in the CDM position just so
i<00:02:00.840> can<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.110> chemistry<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.649> he<00:02:02.399> hasn't<00:02:02.700> had

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
i can get chemistry up he hasn't had

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.510 
i can get chemistry up he hasn't had
really<00:02:03.240> many<00:02:03.630> chances<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.320> goal<00:02:04.530> he<00:02:04.979> plays<00:02:05.250> for

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really many chances on goal he plays for

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
really many chances on goal he plays for

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
brazil an absolute bargain right there

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.040 
brazil an absolute bargain right there
then<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.739> got

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
then we got

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.820 
then we got
gonzo<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.910> guy<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:14.590> guy's<00:02:14.800> pretty

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
insane and I haven't screwed up he goes

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.440 
insane and I haven't screwed up he goes
from<00:02:17.350> him<00:02:17.530> yet<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.980> thought<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.760> did<00:02:18.880> maybe

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
from him yet I thought I did maybe

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.610 
from him yet I thought I did maybe
that's<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.720> different<00:02:19.960> guy<00:02:20.050> but<00:02:20.290> anyway<00:02:20.500> this

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
that's a different guy but anyway this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100 
that's a different guy but anyway this
guy<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:21.210> 1305<00:02:22.210> starts<00:02:22.480> killer<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.930> an

guy for 1305 starts killer is an

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.040 
guy for 1305 starts killer is an

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
album that he's passed in but CDM part

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720 
album that he's passed in but CDM part
is<00:02:28.690> good<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> rest<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.320> these<00:02:29.440> actually<00:02:30.370> just

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
is good the rest of these actually just

codes<00:02:39.250> we<00:02:39.400> got<00:02:39.490> this<00:02:39.580> guy<00:02:39.820> for<00:02:40.030> 50<00:02:40.510> these<00:02:41.500> I

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
codes we got this guy for 50 these I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.380 
codes we got this guy for 50 these I
didn't<00:02:42.100> really<00:02:42.190> pay<00:02:42.730> much<00:02:42.760> attention<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.270> this

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
didn't really pay much attention to this

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.820 
didn't really pay much attention to this
but<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.830> keep<00:02:44.830> us<00:02:45.070> 78<00:02:45.490> rated<00:02:45.940> for<00:02:46.680> was<00:02:47.680> it

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
but this keep us 78 rated for was it

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.280 
but this keep us 78 rated for was it
that<00:02:47.950> pay<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.160> him<00:02:48.570> 400<00:02:49.570> cones<00:02:49.990> you<00:02:50.110> can't

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
that pay for him 400 cones you can't

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.440 
that pay for him 400 cones you can't
really<00:02:50.410> complain<00:02:50.730> also<00:02:51.730> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:51.880> change<00:02:52.360> our

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
really complain also you can change our

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.660 
really complain also you can change our
silver<00:02:52.780> silver<00:02:53.650> left<00:02:53.830> back<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.100> Maxwell<00:02:54.520> but

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
silver silver left back to Maxwell but

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.870 
silver silver left back to Maxwell but
the<00:02:54.760> chemistry<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:56.110> guy<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.560> Valdivia

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the chemistry on this guy of Valdivia

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.670 
the chemistry on this guy of Valdivia
goes<00:02:57.880> down<00:02:58.150> slightly<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:58.900> I'd<00:02:59.020> recommend<00:02:59.200> just

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
goes down slightly so I'd recommend just

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.990 
goes down slightly so I'd recommend just
trying<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.070> find<00:03:00.190> another<00:03:00.400> league<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.730> Brazil

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
trying to find another league the Brazil

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.750 
trying to find another league the Brazil
strike<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.900> left<00:03:02.140> back<00:03:02.320> or<00:03:02.680> just<00:03:03.130> stick<00:03:03.550> with

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
strike the left back or just stick with

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.000 
strike the left back or just stick with
the<00:03:03.970> silvers<00:03:04.390> anyway<00:03:05.050> guys<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.560> has<00:03:05.740> been
