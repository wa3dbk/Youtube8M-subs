00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
know this is a slightly darker shade of

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.690 
know this is a slightly darker shade of
blue<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.410> my<00:02:44.410> camera<00:02:44.860> is<00:02:44.950> actually<00:02:45.160> picking

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
blue and my camera is actually picking

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.780 
blue and my camera is actually picking
it<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:45.940> as<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.239> very<00:02:46.989> dark<00:02:47.290> blue<00:02:47.560> but<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:48.610> is

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
it up as a very dark blue but this is

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.970 
it up as a very dark blue but this is
actually<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.180> light<00:02:49.420> blue<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.770> that

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
actually a light blue it's just that

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.150 
actually a light blue it's just that
it's<00:02:51.220> let's<00:02:51.760> say<00:02:52.000> half<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.050> shade<00:02:53.260> -<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:53.860> shade

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
it's let's say half a shade - one shade

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.280 
it's let's say half a shade - one shade
darker<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.910> it's<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.480> know<00:02:55.570> what<00:02:56.140> it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
darker then it's you know what it's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
darker then it's you know what it's
supposed<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.830> like<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:58.090> padding<00:02:59.310> insanely

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
supposed to be like the padding insanely

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.020 
supposed to be like the padding insanely
thick<00:03:00.670> for<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.940> replica<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:01.390> would<00:03:01.570> say<00:03:03.030> really

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
thick for a replica I would say really

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.830 
thick for a replica I would say really
nice<00:03:04.980> but<00:03:05.980> um<00:03:06.160> yeah<00:03:06.760> what<00:03:07.270> did<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.420> want<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.660> show

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
nice but um yeah what did I want to show

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.990 
nice but um yeah what did I want to show
you<00:03:07.900> about<00:03:08.170> these<00:03:08.380> right<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.430> after<00:03:09.610> you've

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
you about these right so after you've

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.370 
you about these right so after you've
been<00:03:10.209> wearing<00:03:10.450> these<00:03:10.690> for<00:03:10.750> a<00:03:10.989> while<00:03:11.080> you<00:03:11.350> can

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
been wearing these for a while you can

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.090 
been wearing these for a while you can
expect<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:12.040> get<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:13.080> minor<00:03:14.080> crease<00:03:14.830> right

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
expect to get this minor crease right

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.580 
expect to get this minor crease right
here<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.610> fabric<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.170> good<00:03:17.410> or<00:03:17.440> a

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
here in the fabric is this a good or a

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.400 
here in the fabric is this a good or a
bad<00:03:17.620> thing<00:03:17.800> I<00:03:18.310> don't<00:03:19.000> know<00:03:19.390> if<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.870> ask<00:03:20.080> me<00:03:20.290> it

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
bad thing I don't know if you ask me it

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.740 
bad thing I don't know if you ask me it
basically<00:03:20.800> shows<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:22.270> shoe<00:03:22.510> has

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
basically shows that the the shoe has

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.199 
basically shows that the the shoe has
enough<00:03:23.280> flexibility<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:24.370> accommodate<00:03:25.030> the

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
enough flexibility to accommodate the

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.699 
enough flexibility to accommodate the
the<00:03:25.570> range<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.930> motion<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.470> foot

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the range of motion of the foot

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.070 
the range of motion of the foot
obviously<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.519> don't<00:03:28.060> play<00:03:28.450> bowling<00:03:28.750> these

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
obviously I don't play bowling these

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.610 
obviously I don't play bowling these
have<00:03:29.800> a<00:03:29.830> look<00:03:30.010> at<00:03:30.130> my<00:03:30.720> Air<00:03:31.720> Jordans<00:03:31.780> it's<00:03:32.350> video

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
have a look at my Air Jordans it's video

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.800 
have a look at my Air Jordans it's video
to<00:03:32.709> see<00:03:33.160> why<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.430> get<00:03:34.120> replicas<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.630> know<00:03:34.780> I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
to see why I get replicas you know I

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.770 
to see why I get replicas you know I
only<00:03:35.140> wear<00:03:35.410> these<00:03:35.560> casually<00:03:36.160> but<00:03:37.090> um<00:03:37.239> yeah

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
only wear these casually but um yeah

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.960 
only wear these casually but um yeah
pretty<00:03:37.930> comfortable

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
pretty comfortable

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.550 
pretty comfortable
obviously<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.150> little<00:03:41.510> hologram<00:03:41.900> on<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.350> top

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
obviously the little hologram on the top

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.820 
obviously the little hologram on the top
is<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:46.330> sticking<00:03:47.330> out<00:03:47.600> but<00:03:47.990> it's<00:03:48.170> not<00:03:48.380> it

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
is it is sticking out but it's not it

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.280 
is it is sticking out but it's not it
doesn't<00:03:49.160> really<00:03:49.190> have<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.760> 3d<00:03:50.750> look<00:03:50.780> to<00:03:51.170> it

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
doesn't really have that 3d look to it

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.590 
doesn't really have that 3d look to it
in<00:03:51.700> person<00:03:52.700> it<00:03:52.819> does<00:03:53.060> have<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:55.610> scratch<00:03:56.209> card

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
in person it does have that scratch card

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.590 
in person it does have that scratch card
what<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:56.900> would<00:03:57.110> call<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.440> look<00:03:58.180> right<00:03:59.180> but<00:03:59.420> it's

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
what I would call it look right but it's

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.830 
what I would call it look right but it's
not<00:03:59.750> as<00:03:59.900> 3d<00:04:00.320> as<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.680> as<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.010> authentic<00:04:01.430> payer

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
not as 3d as the as the authentic payer

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.960 
not as 3d as the as the authentic payer
obviously<00:04:03.070> but<00:04:04.070> if<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:04.280> look<00:04:04.459> at<00:04:04.580> it<00:04:04.700> from<00:04:04.850> a

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
obviously but if you look at it from a

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.880 
obviously but if you look at it from a
distance<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.900> mean<00:04:06.200> you<00:04:06.500> can't<00:04:06.800> really

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
distance you I mean you can't really

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.630 
distance you I mean you can't really
tell<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.700> got<00:04:07.850> that<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.690> know<00:04:09.640> tint

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
tell it's got that you know tint

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.910 
tell it's got that you know tint
greenish<00:04:11.300> bluish<00:04:11.600> kind<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.470> tint<00:04:12.650> when<00:04:12.830> you

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
greenish bluish kind of tint when you

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.410 
greenish bluish kind of tint when you
when<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.220> tilt<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.760> side<00:04:13.850> as<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:14.239> can

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
when you tilt it to the side as you can

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.039 
when you tilt it to the side as you can
see<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:15.700> overall<00:04:16.700> it's<00:04:16.970> you<00:04:17.359> know<00:04:17.450> all<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.930> the

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
see so overall it's you know all of the

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.720 
see so overall it's you know all of the
main<00:04:18.230> features<00:04:18.470> they're<00:04:18.890> in<00:04:19.010> there<00:04:21.640> there's<00:04:22.640> a

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
main features they're in there there's a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.180 
main features they're in there there's a
little<00:04:23.030> bit<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.480> white<00:04:24.140> paint<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.770> has

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
little bit of a white paint that has

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.670 
little bit of a white paint that has
leaked<00:04:25.930> right<00:04:26.930> here<00:04:27.169> during<00:04:27.590> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
leaked right here during the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.930 
leaked right here during the
manufacturing<00:04:28.400> process

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
manufacturing process

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.540 
manufacturing process
but<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.870> nothing<00:04:30.260> major<00:04:30.440> I<00:04:30.830> mean<00:04:31.130> this<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.520> a

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
but it's nothing major I mean this is a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.390 
but it's nothing major I mean this is a
really<00:04:31.880> really<00:04:32.060> like<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.200> close-up<00:04:33.830> shot<00:04:34.100> of<00:04:34.130> it

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
really really like a close-up shot of it

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.120 
really really like a close-up shot of it
so<00:04:35.060> you'll<00:04:35.840> probably<00:04:36.080> not<00:04:36.380> be<00:04:36.590> able<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.800> see<00:04:37.010> it

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
so you'll probably not be able to see it

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.080 
so you'll probably not be able to see it
from<00:04:37.250> a<00:04:37.370> distance

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.610 

the<00:04:41.090> shank<00:04:41.419> plate<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.810> actually<00:04:41.990> pretty<00:04:42.350> good

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
the shank plate is actually pretty good

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.820 
the shank plate is actually pretty good
I<00:04:42.860> was<00:04:43.370> surprised<00:04:43.760> I<00:04:44.350> don't<00:04:45.350> know<00:04:45.500> if<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.650> can

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
I was surprised I don't know if you can

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.469

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
can tell that on the inside this is a

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.570 
can tell that on the inside this is a
really<00:05:07.910> crappy<00:05:08.690> sort<00:05:08.960> of<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.110> fabric<00:05:09.580> but

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
from a replica pair of 13s and these are

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.540 
from a replica pair of 13s and these are
obviously<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.440> decent<00:05:24.830> quality<00:05:24.919> shoes<00:05:25.310> right

if you get a really crappy pair of

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.190 
if you get a really crappy pair of
replicas<00:05:27.320> they'll<00:05:27.470> probably<00:05:27.650> fall<00:05:28.010> apart<00:05:28.100> but

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
replicas they'll probably fall apart but
