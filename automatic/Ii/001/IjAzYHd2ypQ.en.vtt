00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
and then the to swivel snap swivels or

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.740 
and then the to swivel snap swivels or
566<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> cleat<00:00:49.910> was<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> dollar<00:00:51.239> 89

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
566 and then the cleat was a dollar 89

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
566 and then the cleat was a dollar 89
so<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.860> set<00:00:55.039> got<00:00:56.039> these<00:00:56.190> pulleys<00:00:56.550> are

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so this is the set got these pulleys are

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
so this is the set got these pulleys are
at<00:00:57.000> 125<00:00:57.780> these<00:00:58.350> are<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.680> 75<00:00:59.570> my<00:01:00.570> fish<00:01:00.870> house<00:01:01.140> I'm

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
at 125 these are at 75 my fish house I'm

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.789 
at 125 these are at 75 my fish house I'm
guessing<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.570> 60<00:01:03.570> pounds<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.680> that's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
guessing it's about 60 pounds so that's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
guessing it's about 60 pounds so that's
overkill<00:01:05.580> snap<00:01:06.540> swivels<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> where<00:01:07.650> I'm

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
overkill snap swivels this is where I'm

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.600 
overkill snap swivels this is where I'm
going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> latch<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.060> ratchets<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.610> snap

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
going to latch the ratchets in snap

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.390 
going to latch the ratchets in snap
swivels<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.600> where<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.810> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.400> put

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
swivels this is where I'm going to put

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.330 
swivels this is where I'm going to put
the<00:01:14.520> ratchets<00:01:15.030> hooks<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.900> there<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.130> put

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the ratchets hooks in there and then put

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.300 
the ratchets hooks in there and then put
them<00:01:17.490> around<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:19.280> ice<00:01:20.280> house<00:01:21.350> snap<00:01:22.350> hook<00:01:22.619> great

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
