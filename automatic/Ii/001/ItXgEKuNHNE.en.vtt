00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.599

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 then stay with me 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.650
 you will need bread 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.080

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.510
 paper towel or napkin wide 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.870
 I have a coin of 2 euros but you can also 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.469
 take five rubles and any stick can 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.800
 also take a toothpick alcohol so what 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.200
 let's begin the first step we see 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.450
 I chop the stick completely 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.210
 powder to make it turn into 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.210
 homogeneous powder I have set 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.809
 when where did I get pretty petty 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.830
 grinding but still lumps can be here 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.830

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.930
 further stir sperg can 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.820
 excessive alcohol 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.009
