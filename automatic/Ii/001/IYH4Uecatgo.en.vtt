 also includes Peter Parker as his 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.250
 mentor one of the most characteristic 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.500
 remarkable morals is its origin 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.539
 African-American Hispanic and this is a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 new industry initiative by 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.619
 have an ethnic diversity to their 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.649
 superheroes and bring diverse audiences 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.840
 moral evils is a great character and a 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.880
 amazing spider-man and we received it with 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 open arms but I must 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.729
 mention that the universe 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.079
 cinematographic will continue to work 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.240
 with peter parker 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.429
 kevin fitch confirms that between 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 movie dead man let's see bands in 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.909
 who was wasp in total action for 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.470
 those who do not know her 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.450
 she is the original founder of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.009
 Avengers have the ability to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.380
 reduce its size at will 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.119
 fly with the insect wings and the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.429
 ability to shoot energy rays 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.810
 besides being the wife of camps in 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.939
 other sources 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 report that his presence will be in 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.229
 flashback form of such a memory 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.149
 that we do not know if he died or if he lost 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.119
 in the micro verse but hand time fault 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.950
 well and the recent superheroes so 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.709
 this justifies why it has been maintained 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.569
 absent for decades 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.700
 kevin fitch ensures that we will have 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.370
 after 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.349
 about all these questions but 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.319
 taking into account that we will also see a 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.209
 your daughter hope and i'm well there is a strong 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.550
 possibility that the actress evangeline 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.560
 lilly then take the wasp cloak and 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.390
 it would be amazing happening to another universe 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.519
 cinematographic in this case of the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.830
 men x then channing tatum ya 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.290
 confirmed that we are not going to see gambit in 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.349
 the next movie of x-men apocalypse 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.900
 which we are going to see apparently is a 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.400
 wolverine because a major company 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.780
 that is dedicated to making articles of 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.000
 skins for the productions of the 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.910
 movies leaked on his instagram the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.319
 design of a back pack that is exclusive 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.239
 to come back in or failing a 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.239
 personal article that they will give to the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.459
 actor hugh jackman so this charges 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.500
 greater relevance when they delete the photo 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.150
 so we can already ensure that 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.730
 wolverine is inside this movie and 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.370
 it would be the last time we see it together 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.560
 to the original team of the men xy 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.780
 talking about other comics michael keaton 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.360
 will produce or act in an adaptation 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.390
 of a comic from the boom company that 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.310
 flame imagine aliens that is about a 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.760
 secret organization that monitors and 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.459
 places 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.280
 line all the imaginary friends of 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.349
 the children that are totally 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.170
 destructive is assumed although it has not been 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.120
 confirmed that keaton is going to be the paper 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.709
 from a veteran agent who is in 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.299
 search for new members 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.640
 on the other hand matthew vaughn the 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.650
 director of the girls movies says 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.870
 who has many ideas for a prequel 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.930
 of origin of the characters of Hitler and 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.819
 big daddy and to succeed this could 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.530
 bring back the interest of the public 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.510
