pressure ulcers come in four different
stages<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.880> it's<00:00:09.059> important<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.690> able<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
stages and it's important to be able to

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.020 
stages and it's important to be able to
distinguish<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.530> differentiate<00:00:11.099> the

various stages of a pressure ulcer

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.230 
various stages of a pressure ulcer
we<00:00:14.040> ought<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.280> begin<00:00:14.370> by<00:00:14.730> though<00:00:14.940> first

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
we ought to begin by though first

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.939 
we ought to begin by though first
defining<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> pressure<00:00:16.320> ulcer<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
defining what a pressure ulcer is

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.029 
defining what a pressure ulcer is
pressure<00:00:17.940> ulcer<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.960> lesion<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.680> occurs

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
pressure ulcer is a lesion that occurs

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.340 
pressure ulcer is a lesion that occurs
in<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.430> area<00:00:20.760> where<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> constant<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
in an area where there is constant and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.650 
in an area where there is constant and
persistent<00:00:22.949> pressure<00:00:23.400> unrelieved<00:00:24.390> pressure

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
persistent pressure unrelieved pressure

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.769 
persistent pressure unrelieved pressure
this<00:00:25.619> pressure<00:00:25.680> usually<00:00:26.609> comes<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
this pressure usually comes about to the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.349 
this pressure usually comes about to the
tissue<00:00:28.019> over<00:00:28.380> bony<00:00:29.099> prominences<00:00:29.849> such<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
tissue over bony prominences such as the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
tissue over bony prominences such as the
sacrum<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> coccyx<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> heels<00:00:31.920> places

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
sacrum the coccyx or the heels places

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.280 
sacrum the coccyx or the heels places
like<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.020> think<00:00:34.140> about

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
like this and when we think about

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
like this and when we think about
pressure<00:00:34.860> ulcers<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.180> to

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
pressure ulcers and we want to

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.340 
pressure ulcers and we want to
distinguish<00:00:36.600> them<00:00:36.809> we'll<00:00:36.989> start<00:00:37.230> by

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
distinguish them we'll start by

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.229 
distinguish them we'll start by
describing<00:00:37.649> each<00:00:38.100> stage<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.850> what

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
describing each stage and what

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.510 
describing each stage and what
differentiates<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.739> characteristic<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
differentiates or is characteristic of

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
differentiates or is characteristic of
that<00:00:41.579> particular<00:00:41.940> stage<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.600> pressure<00:00:42.930> ulcer

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that particular stage of pressure ulcer

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.479 
that particular stage of pressure ulcer
ulcer<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.219> stage<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.870> pressure<00:00:46.230> ulcer

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
ulcer so stage one of a pressure ulcer

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.700 
ulcer so stage one of a pressure ulcer
there<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.700> observable<00:00:48.390> change<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> color

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
also a difference in the sensation so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
also a difference in the sensation so
when<00:01:14.490> coming<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.909> area<00:01:15.150> you'd<00:01:15.299> notice<00:01:15.570> the
