may not be able to identify it and then

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.480 
may not be able to identify it and then
what<00:01:50.229> we<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.469> is<00:01:50.499> we<00:01:50.649> tap<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:51.009> plant<00:01:51.219> onto<00:01:51.369> the

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
what we do is we tap the plant onto the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.639 
what we do is we tap the plant onto the
pot<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.329> see<00:01:52.509> we<00:01:52.659> have<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.840> good<00:01:53.469> root

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
pot you can see we have a good root

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.149 
pot you can see we have a good root
system<00:01:53.679> here<00:01:54.340> now<00:01:54.939> this<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.389> a<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:56.799> and<00:01:56.889> a<00:01:56.950> half

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
system here now this is a two and a half

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.969 
system here now this is a two and a half
and<00:01:57.429> we're<00:01:57.520> going<00:01:57.819> into<00:01:57.999> a<00:01:58.509> foreign<00:01:59.499> 1/2<00:01:59.709> inch

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
and we're going into a foreign 1/2 inch

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.999 
and we're going into a foreign 1/2 inch
pot<00:02:00.310> which<00:02:00.579> is<00:02:00.609> a<00:02:00.789> increase<00:02:01.600> of<00:02:01.630> about<00:02:02.020> two

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
pot which is a increase of about two

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.370 
pot which is a increase of about two
inches<00:02:03.399> they<00:02:03.549> could<00:02:03.729> go<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.909> bigger<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
inches they could go to bigger you

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.569 
inches they could go to bigger you
generally<00:02:05.799> don't<00:02:05.920> want<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.159> go<00:02:06.249> any<00:02:06.399> smaller

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
generally don't want to go any smaller

taught of culture over the users that

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.130

it's<00:02:24.290> a<00:02:24.800> good<00:02:24.980> idea<00:02:25.100> if<00:02:25.370> you're<00:02:25.460> planting

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880

a root ball that actually will

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.180 
a root ball that actually will
transition<00:02:41.450> out<00:02:41.750> into<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.200> new<00:02:42.320> mix<00:02:42.590> so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
transition out into the new mix so

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.979 
transition out into the new mix so
simply<00:02:43.850> don't<00:02:44.030> disturb<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.600> puts<00:02:44.840> more

stress<00:02:45.260> on<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.500> plant<00:02:45.709> that's<00:02:46.370> what<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:46.610> do<00:02:46.760> is

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
stress on the plant that's what we do is

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030 
stress on the plant that's what we do is
we<00:02:47.090> take<00:02:47.209> our<00:02:47.390> pot<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.780> empty<00:02:48.020> we<00:02:48.440> put<00:02:49.010> a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
we take our pot it's empty we put a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.310 
we take our pot it's empty we put a
little<00:02:49.190> soil<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.970> bottom<00:02:50.330> generally<00:02:51.200> you

little soil on the bottom generally you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.310 
little soil on the bottom generally you

just slightly below and then what we do
is<00:02:56.840> we<00:02:57.170> Center<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.620> plant<00:02:57.890> that's<00:02:58.070> always

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
is we Center the plant that's always

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.420 
is we Center the plant that's always
important<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.780> fill<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.200> with<00:03:00.430> potting

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
important and we fill it up with potting

want to leave a little bit of room for

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.830 
want to leave a little bit of room for
water<00:03:09.410> well<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.980> thing<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.670> as<00:03:11.600> the

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
water well the thing is is that as the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.380 
water well the thing is is that as the
plant<00:03:12.110> gets<00:03:12.680> watered<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.550> as<00:03:13.760> it<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.120> soil

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
plant gets watered and as it the soil

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.570 
plant gets watered and as it the soil
settles<00:03:14.840> you'll<00:03:14.989> see<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.350> will<00:03:15.470> be<00:03:15.590> probably

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
settles you'll see that will be probably

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.050 
settles you'll see that will be probably
a<00:03:16.610> quarter<00:03:17.120> half<00:03:17.930> an<00:03:18.080> inch<00:03:18.230> 3/8<00:03:18.530> of<00:03:18.620> an<00:03:18.769> inch

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
a quarter half an inch 3/8 of an inch

a quarter half an inch 3/8 of an inch
drop<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.420> soil<00:03:20.780> level<00:03:20.900> from<00:03:21.260> here<00:03:21.590> that

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
drop in the soil level from here that

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.800 
drop in the soil level from here that
will<00:03:21.920> allow<00:03:22.190> for<00:03:22.220> a<00:03:22.549> reservoir<00:03:23.000> as<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.540> water

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
will allow for a reservoir as you water

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.960 
will allow for a reservoir as you water
it<00:03:23.989> as<00:03:24.110> a<00:03:24.140> rose<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.010> this<00:03:25.130> gardenia<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.790> what

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
it as a rose and this gardenia is what

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.210 
it as a rose and this gardenia is what
variety<00:03:26.420> well<00:03:26.600> this<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:26.989> a<00:03:27.049> belmont<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.650> so

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
variety well this is a belmont and so

way to grow them is above 60 degrees if

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.780 
way to grow them is above 60 degrees if
you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.200> if<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.769> do<00:03:48.920> grow<00:03:49.129> them<00:03:49.310> call<00:03:49.519> make

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
you can if you do grow them call make

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.240 
you can if you do grow them call make
sure<00:03:49.970> you've<00:03:50.150> really<00:03:50.629> are<00:03:50.980> accurate<00:03:51.980> on<00:03:52.099> your

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.860 
already in a four inch pot you can see
we've<00:04:28.430> tapped<00:04:28.640> it<00:04:28.820> out<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.150> there's<00:04:29.300> a<00:04:29.510> fairly

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
we've tapped it out and there's a fairly

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.390 
we've tapped it out and there's a fairly
good<00:04:29.990> root<00:04:30.260> system<00:04:30.290> look<00:04:30.770> at<00:04:30.980> that<00:04:31.130> tray

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
good root system look at that tray

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.700 
good root system look at that tray
system<00:04:32.230> its<00:04:33.230> hang

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
system its hang

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.440 
system its hang
ready<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:34.130> be<00:04:34.280> moved<00:04:34.580> up<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:35.000> can<00:04:35.150> see<00:04:35.300> the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
ready to be moved up you can see the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.710 
ready to be moved up you can see the
heighth<00:04:35.690> of<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.990> plan<00:04:36.200> is<00:04:36.550> good-sized<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.540> so

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
heighth of the plan is good-sized and so

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.330 
heighth of the plan is good-sized and so
now<00:04:38.900> what<00:04:39.080> we're<00:04:39.230> going<00:04:39.380> is<00:04:39.590> from<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> four<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.130> A

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
now what we're going is from a four to A

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:53.260 
now what we're going is from a four to A
six<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:41.420> it's<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.440> same<00:04:42.650> procedure<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:53.090> why

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
six and it's the same procedure and why

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.630 
six and it's the same procedure and why
do<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.480> only<00:04:53.630> go<00:04:53.870> up<00:04:53.960> like<00:04:54.200> a<00:04:54.260> few<00:04:54.740> pot<00:04:54.980> sizes<00:04:55.520> a

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
do you only go up like a few pot sizes a

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.260 
do you only go up like a few pot sizes a
couple<00:04:55.940> inch

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.760 

generally<00:04:59.270> it's<00:04:59.420> a<00:04:59.510> good<00:04:59.660> idea<00:04:59.810> not<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.260> over

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
generally it's a good idea not to over

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.010 
generally it's a good idea not to over
pop<00:05:01.010> things<00:05:01.370> there<00:05:02.030> we<00:05:02.120> go<00:05:02.270> with<00:05:02.540> our<00:05:02.660> plan

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
pop things there we go with our plan

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.960 
pop things there we go with our plan
Jenna<00:05:03.680> it's<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.890> good<00:05:04.010> idea<00:05:04.100> not<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.490> over<00:05:04.790> pot

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
Jenna it's a good idea not to over pot

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.760 
Jenna it's a good idea not to over pot
things<00:05:05.210> now<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.390> could<00:05:05.810> go<00:05:06.110> from<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.470> two<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:06.710> a

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
things now you could go from a two and a

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.010 
things now you could go from a two and a
half<00:05:06.950> to<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.190> six<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:08.240> could<00:05:08.390> go<00:05:08.540> from<00:05:08.660> two<00:05:08.870> and

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
half to a six you could go from two and

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.480 
half to a six you could go from two and
a<00:05:09.050> half<00:05:09.170> to<00:05:09.350> an<00:05:09.470> eight<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:09.890> in<00:05:10.010> the<00:05:10.130> nursery

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
a half to an eight and in the nursery

a half to an eight and in the nursery
industry<00:05:10.640> it's<00:05:11.030> often<00:05:11.390> done<00:05:11.570> where<00:05:11.870> they<00:05:12.350> take

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
industry it's often done where they take

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.560 
industry it's often done where they take
a<00:05:12.560> small<00:05:12.950> plant<00:05:13.280> called<00:05:13.520> liner<00:05:13.940> which<00:05:14.360> is<00:05:14.390> a

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
a small plant called liner which is a

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.660 
a small plant called liner which is a
young<00:05:14.810> propagation<00:05:15.590> and<00:05:15.770> they<00:05:16.190> move<00:05:16.430> them<00:05:16.580> up

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
young propagation and they move them up

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.510 
young propagation and they move them up
into<00:05:16.850> big<00:05:17.090> larger<00:05:18.080> containers<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:19.130> thing<00:05:19.370> is

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
into big larger containers the thing is

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.460 
into big larger containers the thing is
is<00:05:19.700> that<00:05:19.730> there<00:05:20.090> are<00:05:20.270> some<00:05:20.600> plants<00:05:20.930> that<00:05:21.200> when

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
is that there are some plants that when

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.950 
is that there are some plants that when
they<00:05:21.620> get<00:05:21.740> stuck<00:05:22.190> into<00:05:22.400> these<00:05:22.640> big<00:05:23.060> masses<00:05:23.810> in

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
they get stuck into these big masses in

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.500 
they get stuck into these big masses in
wet<00:05:24.200> soil<00:05:24.530> you<00:05:25.340> lose<00:05:25.580> your<00:05:25.730> root<00:05:25.880> system<00:05:26.300> and

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
wet soil you lose your root system and

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.480 
wet soil you lose your root system and
the<00:05:27.500> plant<00:05:27.770> will<00:05:27.890> collapse

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
the plant will collapse

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.909 
the plant will collapse
so<00:05:28.700> for<00:05:30.010> gardeners<00:05:31.010> that<00:05:31.070> have<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.910> time<00:05:32.120> and
