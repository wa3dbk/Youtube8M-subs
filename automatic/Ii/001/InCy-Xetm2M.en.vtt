00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
it's the waterfall braid style I decided

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.799 
it's the waterfall braid style I decided
to<00:00:13.469> do<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.799> double<00:00:13.830> waterfall<00:00:14.580> braid<00:00:15.120> here<00:00:15.630> a

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
to do a double waterfall braid here a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.349 
to do a double waterfall braid here a
lot<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.470> times<00:00:16.770> when<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.279> this<00:00:17.490> style<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.060> see

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
lot of times when I see this style I see

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.599 
lot of times when I see this style I see
it<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.660> women<00:00:19.020> with<00:00:19.170> straight<00:00:19.529> hair<00:00:19.580> but<00:00:20.580> I

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
it on women with straight hair but I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.730 
it on women with straight hair but I
figured<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.390> would<00:00:21.539> give<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> try<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.680> see

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
figured I would give it a try and see

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.640 
figured I would give it a try and see
how<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> looks<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.760> curly<00:00:24.480> or<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> textured<00:00:25.380> hair

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
how it looks on curly or a textured hair

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.120 
how it looks on curly or a textured hair
so<00:00:26.189> let's<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.699> started

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.530 

so<00:00:31.130> I'm<00:00:31.280> starting<00:00:31.700> with<00:00:31.790> hair<00:00:32.090> that<00:00:32.119> was<00:00:32.480> a

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
so I'm starting with hair that was a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.570 
so I'm starting with hair that was a
stretch<00:00:33.020> twist<00:00:33.410> out<00:00:33.650> if<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.040> want<00:00:34.220> to<00:00:34.310> see<00:00:34.430> how

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
stretch twist out if you want to see how

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.850 
stretch twist out if you want to see how
I<00:00:34.610> achieved<00:00:35.150> it<00:00:35.420> check<00:00:36.110> the<00:00:36.230> description<00:00:36.710> box

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
I achieved it check the description box

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.670 
I achieved it check the description box
for<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.220> tutorial<00:00:37.850> now<00:00:38.720> what<00:00:38.960> you'll<00:00:39.170> do<00:00:39.380> is

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
for the tutorial now what you'll do is

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.720 
for the tutorial now what you'll do is
you'll<00:00:39.890> take<00:00:40.100> two<00:00:40.580> sections<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.720> hair<00:00:41.960> and

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
you'll take two sections of hair and

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.200 
you'll take two sections of hair and
then<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:43.910> twist<00:00:44.180> once<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.820> then<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:47.000> twist

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
then you twist once and then you twist

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.170 
then you twist once and then you twist
the<00:00:47.540> second<00:00:47.900> time<00:00:48.080> to<00:00:48.320> start<00:00:48.620> the<00:00:48.800> braid<00:00:49.180> now

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
the second time to start the braid now

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.060 
the second time to start the braid now
you<00:00:50.239> have<00:00:50.750> these<00:00:50.930> two<00:00:51.230> strands<00:00:51.650> of<00:00:51.860> hair

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
you have these two strands of hair

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.110 
you have these two strands of hair
you're<00:00:52.940> going<00:00:53.059> to<00:00:53.120> take<00:00:53.420> one<00:00:54.640> section<00:00:55.640> of<00:00:55.790> hair

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
you're going to take one section of hair

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.810 
you're going to take one section of hair
and<00:00:56.480> you're<00:00:57.140> gonna<00:00:57.320> pull<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.770> through<00:00:58.489> in

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
and you're gonna pull it through in

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.729 
and you're gonna pull it through in
between<00:00:59.510> those<00:00:59.840> two<00:01:00.350> other<00:01:01.480> strands<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:02.739> then

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
between those two other strands and then

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.000 
between those two other strands and then
pull<00:01:04.070> down<00:01:04.900> then<00:01:05.900> with<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.260> two<00:01:06.470> strands<00:01:06.860> that

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
pull down then with the two strands that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.110 
pull down then with the two strands that
you're<00:01:07.190> still<00:01:07.400> holding<00:01:07.550> you're<00:01:07.880> going<00:01:08.030> to

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
you're still holding you're going to

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.780 
you're still holding you're going to
twist<00:01:08.390> those<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:09.140> lock<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.890> third<00:01:10.310> piece

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
twist those to lock that third piece

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.330 
twist those to lock that third piece
into<00:01:11.630> place<00:01:11.870> in<00:01:12.110> between<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.680> two<00:01:12.890> strands

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
into place in between the two strands

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.060 
into place in between the two strands
and<00:01:14.050> then<00:01:15.050> you'll<00:01:15.980> do<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.060> process<00:01:17.510> again

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
and then you'll do the process again

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.330 
and then you'll do the process again
you'll<00:01:19.070> take<00:01:19.370> another<00:01:19.790> section<00:01:20.950> you'll<00:01:21.950> pull

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
you'll take another section you'll pull

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.280 
you'll take another section you'll pull
it<00:01:22.370> through<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.780> two<00:01:24.080> strands<00:01:25.930> fold<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:27.080> in

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
it through the two strands fold it in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.360 
it through the two strands fold it in
young<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:28.360> then<00:01:29.360> you'll<00:01:29.720> twist<00:01:30.260> those<00:01:30.890> two

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
young and then you'll twist those two

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.170 
young and then you'll twist those two
strands<00:01:31.760> again<00:01:32.050> to<00:01:33.050> lock<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.650> hair<00:01:33.890> in<00:01:34.040> place

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
strands again to lock the hair in place

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.330 
strands again to lock the hair in place
so<00:01:35.180> basically<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.899> waterfall<00:01:36.500> is<00:01:36.770> created

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
so basically the waterfall is created

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.080 
so basically the waterfall is created
with<00:01:37.460> those<00:01:37.670> same<00:01:38.000> two<00:01:38.420> strands<00:01:38.899> of<00:01:39.140> hair

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
with those same two strands of hair

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.289 
with those same two strands of hair
those<00:01:41.090> will<00:01:41.390> be<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:43.000> continuing<00:01:44.000> through<00:01:44.270> the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
those will be the continuing through the

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.399 
those will be the continuing through the
whole<00:01:44.719> braid<00:01:46.450> there's<00:01:47.450> a<00:01:47.570> close-up<00:01:47.930> shot<00:01:48.170> so

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
whole braid there's a close-up shot so

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.920 
whole braid there's a close-up shot so
you<00:01:48.619> can<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:49.039> how<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:49.430> looks<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.689> you're<00:01:50.810> just

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
you can see how it looks so you're just

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.600 
you can see how it looks so you're just
going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.229> basically<00:01:51.590> keep<00:01:52.039> going<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.460> I'll

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
going to basically keep going and I'll

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.789 
going to basically keep going and I'll
go<00:01:52.789> ahead<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.090> speed<00:01:53.329> up<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.600> video<00:01:53.689> just<00:01:54.680> to

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
go ahead and speed up the video just to

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.649 
go ahead and speed up the video just to
go<00:01:54.950> through<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.189> process<00:01:57.430> and<00:01:58.430> then<00:01:59.299> what<00:01:59.509> you

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
go through the process and then what you

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.289 
go through the process and then what you
do<00:01:59.810> at<00:01:59.960> the<00:01:59.990> end<00:02:00.140> is<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.460> either<00:02:01.609> pin<00:02:02.000> down

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
do at the end is you can either pin down

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.899 
do at the end is you can either pin down
the<00:02:02.780> hair<00:02:03.079> or<00:02:03.320> you<00:02:03.500> can<00:02:03.710> just<00:02:03.890> twist<00:02:04.670> off<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
the hair or you can just twist off the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.029 
the hair or you can just twist off the
end<00:02:05.329> like<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.719> did<00:02:05.930> just<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.350> hold<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.740> in<00:02:06.890> place

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
end like I did just to hold it in place

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.200 
end like I did just to hold it in place
now<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:08.780> complete<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.619> second<00:02:10.550> waterfall

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
now to complete the second waterfall

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.910 
now to complete the second waterfall
braid<00:02:11.510> I'm<00:02:11.630> basically<00:02:12.080> doing<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.680> same

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
braid I'm basically doing the same

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.270
