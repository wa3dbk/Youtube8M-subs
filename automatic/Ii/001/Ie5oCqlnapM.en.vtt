function I did try Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and<00:05:23.539> they're<00:05:23.629> not<00:05:23.780> in<00:05:23.870> there<00:05:24.080> yet<00:05:24.199> so<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.500> say

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
and they're not in there yet so if I say

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:31.390

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
device features are not yet supported so

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.230 
device features are not yet supported so
I<00:05:34.039> would<00:05:34.310> assume<00:05:34.400> that<00:05:34.550> means<00:05:34.759> they<00:05:34.969> will<00:05:35.120> be

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
I would assume that means they will be

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.189 
I would assume that means they will be
in<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.360> future<00:05:35.539> and<00:05:35.870> i'm<00:05:35.990> sure<00:05:36.169> would

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 
in the future and i'm sure would

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.570 
in the future and i'm sure would
probably<00:05:36.620> be<00:05:36.680> pretty<00:05:36.800> easy<00:05:36.919> for<00:05:37.250> them<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.430> do

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
probably be pretty easy for them to do

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.279 
probably be pretty easy for them to do
that<00:05:37.669> so<00:05:38.180> anyway<00:05:38.509> that's<00:05:38.630> just<00:05:38.750> a<00:05:38.900> quick<00:05:39.050> tour

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
that so anyway that's just a quick tour

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.950 
that so anyway that's just a quick tour
