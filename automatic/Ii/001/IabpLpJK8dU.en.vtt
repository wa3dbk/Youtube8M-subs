do<00:01:43.470> basically<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.880> hold<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
do basically like this and hold it's a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.499 
do basically like this and hold it's a
little<00:01:45.600> easier<00:01:45.990> than<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.369> elbow<00:01:47.640> plank<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
little easier than the elbow plank so

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.359 
little easier than the elbow plank so
you<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.720> hold<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.070> if

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you just hold it like that but then if

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.490 
you just hold it like that but then if
you<00:01:50.640> find<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.509> too<00:01:51.810> easy<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.380> you

you find this to be too easy and you
want<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> make<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> little<00:01:53.009> bit<00:01:53.159> harder<00:01:53.549> then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
want to make a little bit harder then

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.430 
want to make a little bit harder then
you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.420> try<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.659> lift<00:01:54.930> me

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
keep alternating so it's a little bit

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.090 
keep alternating so it's a little bit
more<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.490> an<00:02:29.580> advanced<00:02:30.060> version<00:02:30.810> okay<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.890> that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
more of an advanced version okay so that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
is the hand plank and in two different

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.130 
is the hand plank and in two different
variations<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.820> even<00:02:36.330> all<00:02:36.540> those<00:02:36.690> do<00:02:36.840> we

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
variations to it even all those do we

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.500 
variations to it even all those do we
also<00:02:37.560> do<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.130> what<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.460> call<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.790> reverse<00:02:39.150> plank

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
also do a what we call a reverse plank

more<00:03:20.970> over<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.360> twist<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.380> drop<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.709> down<00:03:22.739> and

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
more over the twist and drop it down and

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.949 
more over the twist and drop it down and
then<00:03:24.269> twist<00:03:24.510> drop<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.650> down<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.489> also<00:03:26.959> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
then twist drop it down this is also the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.410 
then twist drop it down this is also the
Pilates<00:03:28.530> move<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.060> hold<00:03:30.239> it

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
Pilates move but you can just hold it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.850 
Pilates move but you can just hold it
here<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:31.080> know<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:32.780> make<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:34.260> one<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.830> little

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
here you know to make this one a little

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.800 
here you know to make this one a little
bit<00:03:35.280> harder<00:03:35.610> combine<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.390> other<00:03:36.570> one

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
bit harder combine it with the other one

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.710 
bit harder combine it with the other one
you<00:03:37.320> can<00:03:37.350> kind<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.800> do<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> reverse<00:03:38.459> or<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.269> switch

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
you can kind of do a reverse or a switch

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.690 
you can kind of do a reverse or a switch
between<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.320> two<00:03:40.350> like<00:03:40.830> hand<00:03:41.130> plank<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.640> a

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
between the two like hand plank and a

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.550 
between the two like hand plank and a
reverse<00:03:42.060> hand<00:03:42.360> blank<00:03:42.660> because<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.530> a

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
reverse hand blank because this is a

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.229 
reverse hand blank because this is a
move<00:03:43.830> you're<00:03:44.010> gonna<00:03:44.070> be<00:03:44.250> doing<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.610> lot<00:03:44.940> in

oh and then travel with it like that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.410 
oh and then travel with it like that
because<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.280> will<00:04:10.430> be<00:04:10.580> doing<00:04:10.849> this<00:04:10.970> forward

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
because you will be doing this forward

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.369 
because you will be doing this forward
so<00:04:12.190> give<00:04:13.190> it<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.340> shot<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.849> see<00:04:13.940> if<00:04:14.300> you<00:04:14.450> can<00:04:14.629> if

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
so give it a shot and see if you can if

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.780 
so give it a shot and see if you can if
you<00:04:15.500> can<00:04:15.650> make<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.920> happen<00:04:16.070> if<00:04:16.340> not<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:16.549> hold

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
you can make it happen if not just hold

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.400 
you can make it happen if not just hold
it<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.959> easy<00:04:18.139> way

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
it the easy way

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.940 
it the easy way
so<00:04:18.709> plank<00:04:19.220> as<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.489> said<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:20.060> your<00:04:20.419> elbow<00:04:21.380> on<00:04:21.889> your

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
so plank as I said on your elbow on your

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.730 
so plank as I said on your elbow on your
hand<00:04:22.430> or<00:04:22.669> reverse<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.660> really<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.530> good

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
hand or reverse is really a good

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.590 
hand or reverse is really a good
exercise<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:25.370> know<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.550> side<00:04:25.820> plank<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.270> also

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
exercise you know the side plank is also

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.180 
exercise you know the side plank is also
an<00:04:26.660> awesome<00:04:26.900> one<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.500> sight<00:04:27.770> line<00:04:27.979> could<00:04:28.160> be

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
an awesome one and sight line could be

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.310 
an awesome one and sight line could be
that<00:04:28.460> also<00:04:28.880> on<00:04:29.030> your<00:04:29.150> elbow<00:04:29.479> or<00:04:29.720> on<00:04:29.900> your<00:04:30.080> hand

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
that also on your elbow or on your hand

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.740 
that also on your elbow or on your hand
so<00:04:30.860> on<00:04:31.160> your<00:04:31.400> elbow<00:04:31.669> could<00:04:31.820> be<00:04:31.880> like<00:04:32.150> just

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
so on your elbow could be like just

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.800 
so on your elbow could be like just
simply<00:04:33.470> this<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.979> just<00:04:34.430> try<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.639> hold<00:04:34.910> it<00:04:35.090> and

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
simply this and just try to hold it and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.020 
simply this and just try to hold it and
the<00:04:36.080> easiest<00:04:36.320> version<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.790> drop

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
the easiest version of this is to drop

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.540 
the easiest version of this is to drop
the<00:04:38.240> bottom<00:04:38.630> knee<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.470> more<00:04:39.500> one<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.160> then

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
the bottom knee the more one and then

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.490 
the bottom knee the more one and then
keep<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.880> other<00:04:41.060> leg<00:04:41.300> up<00:04:41.450> or<00:04:41.780> hold<00:04:42.169> the<00:04:42.350> other

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
keep the other leg up or hold the other

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.550 
keep the other leg up or hold the other
leg<00:04:42.710> up<00:04:42.830> like<00:04:43.040> this<00:04:43.300> okay<00:04:44.440> now<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:46.060> harder<00:04:47.560> feet

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
leg up like this okay now a harder feet

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.969 
leg up like this okay now a harder feet
together

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
together

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.240 
together
up<00:04:49.180> even<00:04:50.180> harder<00:04:50.540> lift<00:04:51.350> all<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.620> way<00:04:51.650> up<00:04:51.770> and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
up even harder lift all the way up and

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.580 
up even harder lift all the way up and
see<00:04:52.639> if<00:04:52.700> you<00:04:52.790> can<00:04:52.940> hold<00:04:53.120> or<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.810> can<00:04:54.169> try<00:04:54.350> to<00:04:54.410> go

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
see if you can hold or I can try to go

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.250 
see if you can hold or I can try to go
up<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:54.979> down<00:04:55.100> with<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.760> few<00:04:56.479> times<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.080> then

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
up and down with it a few times and then

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.680 
up and down with it a few times and then
try<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:58.280> hold<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.639> okay

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
try to hold it okay

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.659 
try to hold it okay
another<00:05:00.380> hard<00:05:00.590> version<00:05:01.010> is<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.250> can<00:05:01.430> do<00:05:01.550> like

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
another hard version is you can do like

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.680 
another hard version is you can do like
a<00:05:01.790> crunch<00:05:02.180> with<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:03.970> so<00:05:04.970> just<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.360> different

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
a crunch with it so just a different

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.420 
a crunch with it so just a different
variation<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.139> get<00:05:06.290> your<00:05:06.440> obliques<00:05:06.860> worked

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
variation to get your obliques worked

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.930 
variation to get your obliques worked
out<00:05:07.639> um<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.720> hand<00:05:09.650> version<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:10.130> that<00:05:10.310> will<00:05:10.610> be<00:05:10.729> up

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
out um a hand version of that will be up

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.940 
out um a hand version of that will be up
on<00:05:11.120> your<00:05:11.300> hand<00:05:11.479> like<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.870> it's<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.590> little<00:05:12.740> bit

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
on your hand like this it's a little bit

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.409 
on your hand like this it's a little bit
hard<00:05:13.160> if<00:05:13.220> you<00:05:13.310> have<00:05:13.340> shoulder<00:05:13.729> problems<00:05:13.880> and

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
then try to hold it like that or try to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.260 
then try to hold it like that or try to
lift<00:05:17.500> simple<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:19.010> then<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.550> course<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:20.120> want

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270
