that is lined in what they call a dry
Lex<00:01:23.250> material<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> similar<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
Lex material this is a similar to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.620 
Lex material this is a similar to
somewhat<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> microfiber<00:01:26.520> very<00:01:27.360> very

screens in the shell and this channel so

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.960 
screens in the shell and this channel so

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
doesn't push up against the hole so you

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.869 
doesn't push up against the hole so you
