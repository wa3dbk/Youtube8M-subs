00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
so here we are on a trout stream and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.340 
so here we are on a trout stream and
it's<00:00:05.069> January<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.000> want<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.930> catch<00:00:07.080> some<00:00:07.319> fish

I'm gonna share with you a tip a little

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.379 
I'm gonna share with you a tip a little
trick<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> do<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.759> help<00:00:11.910> me<00:00:12.150> catch

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
trick that I like to do to help me catch

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.870 
trick that I like to do to help me catch
more<00:00:12.719> fish<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.710> winter<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> particularly

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
more fish in the winter and particularly

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
more fish in the winter and particularly
when<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.299> fishing<00:00:15.480> small<00:00:15.960> midges<00:00:16.410> too<00:00:16.949> picky

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
when I'm fishing small midges too picky

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.349 
when I'm fishing small midges too picky
fish<00:00:17.960> normally<00:00:18.960> what<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.590> do<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.010> I

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
fish normally what I like to do is I

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.960 
fish normally what I like to do is I
have<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.510> choose<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:21.990> tip<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.820> right

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
have to choose my tip it to be the right

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.660 
have to choose my tip it to be the right
size<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.779> fly<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.410> typically<00:00:26.099> will<00:00:26.310> divide

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
size for the fly I typically will divide

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.509 
size for the fly I typically will divide
by<00:00:26.910> three<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> take<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> hook<00:00:28.109> size<00:00:28.519> which

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
by three so I take the hook size which

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.209 
by three so I take the hook size which
in<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.789> case<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> size<00:00:30.510> 18<00:00:31.140> midge<00:00:31.560> fly<00:00:31.890> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
in this case is a size 18 midge fly I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.750 
in this case is a size 18 midge fly I
divide<00:00:33.030> by<00:00:33.210> 3<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.870> 6<00:00:34.290> X<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
divide by 3 and I get 6 X but what I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.540 
divide by 3 and I get 6 X but what I
like<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.649> think<00:00:37.860> you'll<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.430> as

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
like to do and I think you'll like it as

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.819 
like to do and I think you'll like it as
well<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:39.090> had<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> take<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> size<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> fly

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
well I had to take the size of the fly

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
well I had to take the size of the fly
divided<00:00:41.219> by<00:00:41.430> 3<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.000> then<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.210> go<00:00:42.510> down<00:00:42.809> one<00:00:43.079> size

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
divided by 3 and then I go down one size

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.010 
divided by 3 and then I go down one size
so<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.070> case<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> size<00:00:44.940> 18<00:00:45.239> fly<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so in this case I have a size 18 fly I

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.619 
so in this case I have a size 18 fly I
normally<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.950> 6<00:00:47.250> X<00:00:47.430> but<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.420> case

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
normally would be 6 X but in this case

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.360 
normally would be 6 X but in this case
because<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.260> winter<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.160> got

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
because it's winter because we got

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.790 
because it's winter because we got
spooky<00:00:50.820> fish<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.360> got<00:00:51.480> small<00:00:51.840> flies<00:00:52.110> we're

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
spooky fish we got small flies we're

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.459 
spooky fish we got small flies we're
gonna<00:00:52.890> go<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.670> size<00:00:54.059> down<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.840> that's

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
gonna go one more size down and that's

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.580 
gonna go one more size down and that's
gonna<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.890> us<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.160> 7<00:00:56.789> X<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:58.440> we're

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
gonna put us out of 7 X and if we're

00:00:58.590 --> 00:04:53.050 
gonna put us out of 7 X and if we're
lucky<00:00:58.710> we'll<00:00:59.160> catch<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.489> couple<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.760> fish

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.090 

so<00:04:54.060> we've<00:04:54.240> been<00:04:54.390> here<00:04:54.600> about<00:04:54.690> an<00:04:54.930> hour<00:04:55.100> we've

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
so we've been here about an hour we've

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.670 
so we've been here about an hour we've
caught<00:04:56.310> several<00:04:56.670> fish<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.840> all<00:04:58.290> because<00:04:58.650> of

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
caught several fish and all because of

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.070 
caught several fish and all because of
the<00:04:59.190> one<00:04:59.400> tip<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.700> we<00:05:00.000> use<00:05:00.210> as<00:05:00.480> our<00:05:00.600> winter

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
the one tip that we use as our winter

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.400 
the one tip that we use as our winter
fishing<00:05:01.260> tip<00:05:01.710> or<00:05:02.250> spooky<00:05:02.940> fish<00:05:03.180> tip<00:05:03.510> or<00:05:03.930> mid

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
fishing tip or spooky fish tip or mid

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.070 
fishing tip or spooky fish tip or mid
fishing<00:05:04.890> tip<00:05:05.160> go<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.180> size<00:05:06.450> of<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.840> fly

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
fishing tip go the size of the fly

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.920 
fishing tip go the size of the fly
divided<00:05:07.680> by<00:05:07.860> three<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.250> go<00:05:08.610> down<00:05:08.880> one<00:05:09.300> size<00:05:09.630> on

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
divided by three and go down one size on

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.240 
divided by three and go down one size on
the<00:05:10.080> tip<00:05:10.260> so<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.490> case<00:05:11.760> size<00:05:12.030> 18<00:05:12.450> fly

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
the tip so in this case size 18 fly

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.430 
the tip so in this case size 18 fly
divided<00:05:14.250> by<00:05:14.430> three<00:05:14.640> you<00:05:14.730> get<00:05:14.820> 6x<00:05:15.270> we<00:05:15.600> use<00:05:15.780> 7x

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
divided by three you get 6x we use 7x

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.650 
divided by three you get 6x we use 7x
we've<00:05:16.980> got<00:05:17.130> a<00:05:17.160> number<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:17.580> fish<00:05:17.790> it's<00:05:18.420> a<00:05:18.480> great

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
we've got a number of fish it's a great

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.380 
we've got a number of fish it's a great
day<00:05:18.950> only<00:05:19.950> out<00:05:20.100> here<00:05:20.280> an<00:05:20.400> hour<00:05:20.520> now<00:05:21.090> we<00:05:21.120> can<00:05:21.330> go

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
day only out here an hour now we can go

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.750 
day only out here an hour now we can go
warm<00:05:21.630> up
