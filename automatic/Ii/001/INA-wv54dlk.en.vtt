wall<00:00:18.380> by<00:00:18.680> drawing<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.279> simple<00:00:19.520> polyline

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.380 

this<00:00:33.710> is<00:00:33.890> what<00:00:34.070> happens<00:00:34.520> on<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.910> other<00:00:34.940> hand

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
this is what happens on the other hand

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.240 
this is what happens on the other hand
if<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:35.870> define<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.440> bottom<00:00:36.830> and<00:00:37.040> top

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
if you define the bottom and top

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:54.920
