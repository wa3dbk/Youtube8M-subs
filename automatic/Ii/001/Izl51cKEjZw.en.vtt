00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
pretty nice articulation I'll try to go

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.930 
pretty nice articulation I'll try to go
over<00:02:46.470> all<00:02:46.590> three<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.040> same<00:02:47.069> because<00:02:47.760> they're

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
over all three the same because they're

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.920 
over all three the same because they're
all<00:02:48.060> basically<00:02:48.389> the<00:02:48.480> same<00:02:48.540> articulation

think<00:02:49.909> both<00:02:50.909> stag's<00:02:51.180> head<00:02:51.389> it<00:02:51.930> can<00:02:52.109> fully

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
think both stag's head it can fully

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.259 
think both stag's head it can fully

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
rotate this beard is a softer plastic so

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.180 
rotate this beard is a softer plastic so
you<00:02:54.329> can<00:02:54.599> rotate<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.079> if<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.379> need<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.920> even

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
you can rotate it if you need to even

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.030 
you can rotate it if you need to even

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
a pivot for in the back now for Fandral

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.860 
a pivot for in the back now for Fandral
his<00:03:25.949> head<00:03:26.190> can<00:03:26.940> also<00:03:27.209> fully<00:03:27.419> rotate<00:03:27.750> this

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
his head can also fully rotate this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.439 
his head can also fully rotate this
caping<00:03:28.349> is<00:03:28.650> removable<00:03:29.639> if<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:30.000> need<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.299> move

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:30.449 
caping is removable if you need to move

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.689 
caping is removable if you need to move
in<00:03:30.659> so<00:03:30.870> that's<00:03:31.049> good<00:03:31.290> arms<00:03:32.069> fully<00:03:32.340> rotate

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
in so that's good arms fully rotate

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.220 
in so that's good arms fully rotate
going<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.180> may<00:03:33.569> not<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.870> able<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.049> rotate

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
going it out may not be able to rotate

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.259 
going it out may not be able to rotate

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
a full waist up arab articulation goes

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.210 
a full waist up arab articulation goes

not hinder at all so you can get all
movements<00:03:44.159> his<00:03:44.459> legs<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:45.000> also<00:03:45.150> go<00:03:45.449> in<00:03:45.840> and

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
movements his legs can also go in and

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.439 
movements his legs can also go in and
out<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.319> rotate<00:03:47.129> so<00:03:47.519> there<00:03:47.940> on<00:03:48.030> those<00:03:48.180> little

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:48.449 
out and rotate so there on those little

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:50.599 
out and rotate so there on those little
ball<00:03:48.599> joints<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.530> move<00:03:49.949> bend<00:03:50.430> at<00:03:50.579> two

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
ball joints that can move bend at two

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.849 
ball joints that can move bend at two
points<00:03:50.729> at<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.209> NIEM<00:03:51.419> his<00:03:52.079> ankle<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.650> only

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
points at the NIEM his ankle is only

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.349 
points at the NIEM his ankle is only
really<00:03:53.099> pivot<00:03:53.489> forward<00:03:53.669> and<00:03:53.879> back<00:03:54.060> though

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
really pivot forward and back though

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.420 
really pivot forward and back though
there<00:03:54.840> they<00:03:55.379> can<00:03:55.530> actually<00:03:55.680> rotate<00:03:55.979> too<00:03:56.220> so

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
there they can actually rotate too so

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.020 
there they can actually rotate too so
good<00:03:56.940> articulation<00:03:57.479> on<00:03:57.780> him<00:03:57.989> a<00:03:58.139> man<00:03:58.530> Hogan<00:03:59.040> his

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
good articulation on him a man Hogan his

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.509 
good articulation on him a man Hogan his
head<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.479> fully<00:04:00.659> rotate<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.590> arm<00:04:01.889> can<00:04:02.400> be<00:04:02.430> a

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
head can fully rotate this arm can be a

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.740 
head can fully rotate this arm can be a
little<00:04:02.639> hindered<00:04:02.909> by<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> Cape<00:04:03.419> but<00:04:03.599> it's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
little hindered by the Cape but it's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.210 
little hindered by the Cape but it's
movable<00:04:04.290> so<00:04:04.530> that's<00:04:04.739> fine

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
movable so that's fine

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.990 
movable so that's fine
so<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:06.060> arm<00:04:06.440> can<00:04:07.440> go<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.129> and<00:04:08.280> out<00:04:08.340> rotate

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
so this arm can go in and out rotate

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.369 
so this arm can go in and out rotate
