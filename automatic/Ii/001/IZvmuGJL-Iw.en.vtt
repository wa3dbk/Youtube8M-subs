00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:12.679
 I'll show you today what you can do 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:15.960
 audi 80 b4 electronic injection digifant 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.990
 since the collapse of the world my age diagnostics 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.140
 showed 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:32.510
 collapse is not air and correct wrong 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:38.660
 the signal is now done now we will 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:45.629
 I was able to repair it 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:48.840
 show here it was disassembled here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.230
 the resistor is a variable that's it 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:59.129
 wear is what we will do as we 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:11.960
 recovered we will take shorter we 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:17.280
 take it intonation court so take 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:21.650
 these holes this one this one 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.650
 hole and here it is 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.720
 growth than once about what it is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.390
 hole like or alex that is 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.590
 here here is just a bunch to move this 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:43.240
 the bar is right here which is a little bit 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:47.000
 back that is slats that are slats here 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.260
 the ram goes away it will move a little there 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.290
 this here a little, where whether there kroons 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.700
 remember the third fraction of a millimeter and there 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.360
 still resistive layer 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.070
 he is still whole in principle 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.880
 costs it starts working like new 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.959
 here so this flow meter is restored 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 the service costs money so you earn 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:22.060
 Yes, and you will know how to recover and not 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.060
 then buy bye
