00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 inside milk a liter of water two 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.439
 sugar cups four small bananas 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.050
 these bananas are small because of that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.660
 I'm going to put four if they were bananas 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.570
 great I put two and if they were medium 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.730
 I put three bananas these we have to 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.380
 choose the bananas that are already 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.899
 negritos when we buy 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 we buy bananas well yellow 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 truth and already when we see that they are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.680
 making blacks we think that they are already 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.079
 spoiling but it's not like that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.940
 banana this has to be bold 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.640
 to be the best banana for 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.850
 ice creams if we open it we see that 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 the fruit is in excellent condition the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.200
 banana so in this color are the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 best to make ice cream 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.270
 we also occupy little bags this is the one 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.210
 I use 8 x 26 are bags 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.140
 ecological the brand that I use is a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.510
 manzanita is a window says gps in the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.540
 blender let's put the bananas and 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.070
 I'm going to put some water 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.070
 enough to liquefy 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 let's liquefy a container we're going to 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.670
 put the banana that we use I will 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.970
 put a little water in the blender 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.440
 to get all the flavor of the banana and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890
 the rest of the water we're going to 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.190
 put in the container we are going to put the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 sugar and we will place the liter of 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.580
 milk this container I have already measured 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.290
 that I have left exactly now I am going to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.229
 stir until it dissolves 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.380
 completely the sugar now let's 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.869
 fill the sachets with a cup 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.910
 of the preparation if you have a lot 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.870
 banana banana can put inside 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
 the sachets we put a cup 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.900
 exactly here is the amount that you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.390
 you want me to recommend a cup that does not 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.450
 the cup is very full and we are going to tie 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.310
 the little guy was telling them in another of my 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.410
 videos that the trick for ice cream 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.740
 they would be bigger is not to make the knot 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.450
 here 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.280
 in this part here we are not going to do the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.190
 knot the roll we're just going to do 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.620
 arribita well in this way that we have left 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.330
 wind space this space is left of 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.490
 where the liquid reaches the knot 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.780
 when we are going to freeze we put them 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.550
 well in this way to give the impression 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.010
 they are larger and buy us 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.690
 more this I will continue to fill my 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.910
 bags and I will tell you how many soldiers I 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.220
 they came out with this amount of 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.260
 ingredients I got 12 ice creams 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.000
 Now I'm going to put them in the freezer and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.130
 wait until tomorrow to be able 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.590
 Enjoy, I hope you liked it 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.340

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.340
