ever made a belt because it was made
with<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.810> like<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> spare<00:00:19.470> piece<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.800> cord

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that I had laying around and it just so

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
that I had laying around and it just so
happened<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.189> fit<00:00:23.310> me<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.970> continued<00:00:24.539> to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
happened to fit me so I continued to

wear it for really long times like this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.720 
wear it for really long times like this
this<00:00:27.599> used<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> be<00:00:28.050> black<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:28.949> it's

worn<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> point<00:00:31.320> where<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.590> just

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
worn out to the point where it just

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.430 
worn out to the point where it just
metal<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.669> that<00:00:32.850> spot<00:00:33.149> which<00:00:33.329> honestly<00:00:33.719> makes

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
metal and that spot which honestly makes

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.630 
metal and that spot which honestly makes
it<00:00:34.559> look<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> whole<00:00:34.950> lot<00:00:35.100> cooler<00:00:35.510> anyway<00:00:37.640> since

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it look a whole lot cooler anyway since

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.510 
it look a whole lot cooler anyway since
the<00:00:38.730> previous<00:00:39.059> belt<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> showed<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.140> guys

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
the previous belt that I showed you guys

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
the previous belt that I showed you guys
had<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.730> many<00:00:41.850> colors<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.020> really

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
had so many colors to it this one really

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.860 
had so many colors to it this one really
shows<00:00:45.260> one<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.289> my<00:00:46.530> favorite<00:00:47.070> modes<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.870> this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
shows one of my favorite modes of this

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.220 
shows one of my favorite modes of this
kind<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.829> belt<00:00:50.070> pattern<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.629> like

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
kind of belt pattern that is I like

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.529 
kind of belt pattern that is I like
seeing<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.250> salt<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:54.120> all<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> my

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
seeing it in a salt of all of my

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.150 
seeing it in a salt of all of my
patterns<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> solid<00:00:55.440> color<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
patterns and a solid color so that I

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.599 
patterns and a solid color so that I
know<00:00:57.590> what<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> looks<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.039> when<00:00:59.250> you're<00:00:59.430> only

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
know what it looks like when you're only

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.380 
know what it looks like when you're only
looking<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> geometry<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.520> topology

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.700 

there's<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> bit<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> spread<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.530> can

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
there's the bit of the spread so you can

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.359 
there's the bit of the spread so you can
see<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.570> loose<00:01:09.570> that<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.650> wound<00:01:11.159> up

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
see how loose that is this wound up

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.130 
see how loose that is this wound up
fitting<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.619> exactly<00:01:13.640> it's<00:01:14.640> 30<00:01:15.210> inches<00:01:15.330> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fitting me exactly it's 30 inches so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.210 
fitting me exactly it's 30 inches so
there's<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.860> sticks

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
there's it's when I have it on it sticks

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
there's it's when I have it on it sticks
through<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.170> exact<00:01:22.710> fit

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
through like that it is an exact fit

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.230 
through like that it is an exact fit
which<00:01:23.670> means<00:01:23.909> that<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:25.670> can't<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:27.090> any

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
which means that I I can't get any

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.670 
which means that I I can't get any
bigger<00:01:27.479> if<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.900> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> keep<00:01:28.259> wearing<00:01:28.500> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
bigger if I want to keep wearing this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.929 
bigger if I want to keep wearing this
belt<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.400> makes<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.329> nice<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.509> size<00:01:30.930> check

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.390 

all<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.540> neck<00:01:37.170> up<00:01:37.409> here<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
all right the neck up here is a bit of a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.999 
all right the neck up here is a bit of a
mess<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.390> was<00:01:39.720> much<00:01:40.290> less<00:01:40.530> careful

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
mess because I was much less careful

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.139 
mess because I was much less careful
about<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.670> thing<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.180> time

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
about that kind of thing at the time

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.370 
about that kind of thing at the time
I've<00:01:45.149> actually<00:01:45.270> been<00:01:45.570> wearing<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:45.990> belt<00:01:46.170> for

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
I've actually been wearing this belt for

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.240 
I've actually been wearing this belt for
like<00:01:46.500> two<00:01:46.649> years<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.740> made<00:01:49.979> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like two years now but it was made so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
like two years now but it was made so
that<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.579> could<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.180> either<00:01:51.600> side<00:01:51.899> facing

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that I could have either side facing

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.359 
that I could have either side facing
which<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.369> important<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> me<00:01:54.000> at<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> time<00:01:55.369> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
which was important to me at the time it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.940 
which was important to me at the time it
actually<00:01:56.399> gave<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.869> probably<00:01:58.770> not

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
actually gave a little bit probably not

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.810 
actually gave a little bit probably not
exactly<00:01:59.630> exactly<00:02:00.630> 30<00:02:00.899> inches<00:02:01.259> anymore<00:02:01.820> but

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
exactly exactly 30 inches anymore but

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.069 
exactly exactly 30 inches anymore but
you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> see<00:02:03.420> there's<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.630> definite

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you can see there's a definite

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.569 
you can see there's a definite
difference<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> way<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.829> that<00:02:05.159> sits

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
difference in the way that that sits

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.510 
difference in the way that that sits
compared<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.950> which<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
compared to up here which is what it

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.130 
compared to up here which is what it
looks<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.759> before<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.239> settles<00:02:09.599> if<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:09.959> put

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
looks like before it settles if you put

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.050 
looks like before it settles if you put
a<00:02:10.170> colossal<00:02:10.709> amount<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.069> weight<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.370> it

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
a colossal amount of weight on it

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
a colossal amount of weight on it
like<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:16.210> at<00:02:17.210> least<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.540> think<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.960> big

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
like that at least I think it's a big

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.420 
like that at least I think it's a big
difference<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:20.320> might<00:02:21.320> be<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.620> only<00:02:21.740> one<00:02:22.040> there

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
difference I might be the only one there

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.670 
difference I might be the only one there
you<00:02:22.580> also<00:02:22.700> notice<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.630> finisher<00:02:24.320> is

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
you also notice that the finisher is

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.400 
you also notice that the finisher is
done<00:02:25.220> very<00:02:25.730> very<00:02:26.120> differently<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.990> I'm<00:02:27.170> going

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
done very very differently and I'm going

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.660 
done very very differently and I'm going
to<00:02:27.500> have<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> video<00:02:27.950> about<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> different

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
to have a video about the different

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.210 
to have a video about the different
kinds<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> finishing<00:02:29.630> knots<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.010> would

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
kinds of finishing knots that I would

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.860 
kinds of finishing knots that I would
use<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.550> Stoppers<00:02:31.970> on<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.240> end<00:02:32.390> but<00:02:32.570> this<00:02:32.720> was

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
use at Stoppers on the end but this was

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.350 
use at Stoppers on the end but this was
just<00:02:33.160> because<00:02:34.160> there<00:02:34.520> were<00:02:34.640> two<00:02:34.790> ends<00:02:35.180> right

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
just because there were two ends right

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.940 
just because there were two ends right
here<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.960> had<00:02:36.170> nothing<00:02:36.500> else<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.740> do<00:02:36.920> with

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
here and I had nothing else to do with

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.790 
here and I had nothing else to do with
it<00:02:37.220> oh<00:02:42.130> I<00:02:43.300> mentioned<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.480> as<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:44.930> record<00:02:45.380> for

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
it oh I mentioned this as the record for

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.000 
it oh I mentioned this as the record for
the<00:02:45.920> fastest<00:02:46.610> time<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> had<00:02:48.170> ever<00:02:48.380> made<00:02:48.770> a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
the fastest time that I had ever made a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.480 
the fastest time that I had ever made a
belt<00:02:49.250> for<00:02:49.610> myself<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:51.290> happened<00:02:51.650> was<00:02:51.830> I<00:02:52.130> took

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
belt for myself what happened was I took

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.660 
belt for myself what happened was I took
them<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.210> took<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.720> line<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.260> hand<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.980> was<00:02:55.130> it

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
them I took the line in hand it was it

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.570 
them I took the line in hand it was it
was<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.850> spare<00:02:56.090> piece<00:02:56.320> so<00:02:57.320> like<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.220> wasn't<00:02:58.460> going

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
was a spare piece so like I wasn't going

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.710 
was a spare piece so like I wasn't going
to<00:02:58.640> measure<00:02:58.760> it<00:02:58.970> or<00:02:59.090> anything<00:02:59.300> like<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.540> it

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
to measure it or anything like that it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.950 
to measure it or anything like that it
was<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.050> that<00:03:00.200> size<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.800> then<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.910> passed<00:03:02.780> it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
was just that size and then I passed it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.650 
was just that size and then I passed it
through<00:03:03.130> here<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> loops<00:03:05.360> all

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
through here and got the loops all

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.440 
through here and got the loops all
evened<00:03:06.080> up<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.500> then<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.310> hit<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.850> timer<00:03:08.210> on<00:03:08.420> my

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
evened up and then I hit the timer on my

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.090 
evened up and then I hit the timer on my
watch<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.370> then<00:03:10.960> set<00:03:11.960> this<00:03:12.230> on<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.770> ground

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
watch and then set this on the ground

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.290 
watch and then set this on the ground
stepped<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:13.970> it

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
stepped on it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.350 
stepped on it
and<00:03:14.390> then<00:03:15.110> was<00:03:15.350> weaving<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:19.360> can't

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
and then was weaving like that I can't

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.450 
and then was weaving like that I can't
really<00:03:20.450> do<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.660> for<00:03:20.840> regular<00:03:21.830> size<00:03:22.040> belts

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
really do that for regular size belts

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.190 
really do that for regular size belts
because<00:03:22.880> of<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.330> compression<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.900> means

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
because of the compression that means

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.590 
because of the compression that means
they're<00:03:24.560> actually<00:03:25.100> longer<00:03:25.520> than<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
they're actually longer than the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.110 
they're actually longer than the
distance<00:03:27.020> that<00:03:27.650> that<00:03:28.640> would<00:03:28.760> give<00:03:28.910> me<00:03:28.940> I

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
distance that that would give me I

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.360 
distance that that would give me I
wouldn't<00:03:29.540> like<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:30.500> would<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.740> too<00:03:30.920> big<00:03:31.100> I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
wouldn't like it it would be too big I

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.220 
wouldn't like it it would be too big I
normally<00:03:32.060> have<00:03:32.210> these<00:03:32.360> done<00:03:32.570> like<00:03:32.780> up<00:03:32.990> in<00:03:33.110> the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
normally have these done like up in the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.840 
normally have these done like up in the
air<00:03:33.580> anyway<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:35.270> actual<00:03:35.900> time<00:03:36.850> construction

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
air anyway the actual time construction

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.870 
air anyway the actual time construction
I<00:03:38.030> want<00:03:38.270> you<00:03:38.330> to<00:03:38.450> guess<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:42.200> belt<00:03:42.530> is<00:03:42.880> about

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
I want you to guess this belt is about

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.360 
I want you to guess this belt is about
35<00:03:44.450> feet<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.080> I've<00:03:46.070> made<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.700> in<00:03:48.370> seven

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
35 feet and I've made it in seven

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.610 
35 feet and I've made it in seven
minutes<00:03:50.950> give<00:03:51.950> or<00:03:51.980> take<00:03:52.130> about<00:03:52.310> 10<00:03:52.520> seconds

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
minutes give or take about 10 seconds

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.280 
minutes give or take about 10 seconds
there<00:03:54.850> that<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:56.030> your<00:03:56.180> new<00:03:56.390> gold<00:03:56.750> standard<00:03:57.470> for

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
there that is your new gold standard for

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.900 
there that is your new gold standard for
construction<00:04:00.290> time<00:04:00.650> on<00:04:00.950> projects<00:04:01.550> like<00:04:01.610> these

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
construction time on projects like these

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.300 
construction time on projects like these
all<00:04:02.870> those<00:04:03.110> paracord<00:04:03.680> belts<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.250> are

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
all those paracord belts that are

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.070 
all those paracord belts that are
they're<00:04:04.760> taking<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.240> four<00:04:05.510> and<00:04:05.540> five<00:04:05.870> hours

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
they're taking like four and five hours

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.010 
they're taking like four and five hours
now<00:04:06.470> now<00:04:07.100> I'm<00:04:07.550> a<00:04:07.730> bit<00:04:08.060> this<00:04:08.270> is<00:04:08.450> exactly<00:04:08.810> my

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
now now I'm a bit this is exactly my

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.020 
now now I'm a bit this is exactly my
size<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.590> made<00:04:09.770> it<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.070> seven<00:04:10.730> minutes<00:04:11.180> the

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
size and I made it in seven minutes the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.550 
size and I made it in seven minutes the
downside<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.360> only<00:04:14.480> contains<00:04:15.050> 35

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
downside is that it only contains 35

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.190 
downside is that it only contains 35
feet<00:04:15.770> but<00:04:16.010> it's<00:04:16.160> also<00:04:16.340> like<00:04:16.730> an<00:04:16.910> actual<00:04:17.870> belt

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
feet but it's also like an actual belt

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.840 
feet but it's also like an actual belt
like<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.530> can<00:04:18.680> wear<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.980> like<00:04:19.340> if<00:04:19.730> it

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
like you can wear that like if it

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.580 
like you can wear that like if it
weren't<00:04:20.030> for<00:04:20.120> what<00:04:20.989> if<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.200> weren't<00:04:21.350> for<00:04:21.410> the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
weren't for what if it weren't for the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.810 
weren't for what if it weren't for the
one<00:04:21.770> down<00:04:22.010> mushroom

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
one down mushroom

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.790 
one down mushroom
chuckle<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.660> could<00:04:23.960> wear<00:04:24.200> this<00:04:24.350> with<00:04:24.410> dress

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
chuckle you could wear this with dress
