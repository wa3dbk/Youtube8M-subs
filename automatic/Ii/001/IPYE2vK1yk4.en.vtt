00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.750 
of the ramp effect I'm sure you're
familiar<00:01:06.170> with<00:01:06.470> them<00:01:06.740> but<00:01:07.280> I<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.520> want<00:01:07.700> to

familiar with them but I just want to
mention<00:01:08.060> them<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:08.390> that<00:01:08.480> we<00:01:08.570> can<00:01:08.720> talk<00:01:08.840> about

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
mention them so that we can talk about

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.750 
mention them so that we can talk about
some<00:01:09.380> slightly<00:01:09.650> more<00:01:09.950> advanced<00:01:10.220> concepts

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
even more control over where those

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.740 
even more control over where those
colors<00:03:51.320> appear<00:03:51.799> well<00:03:52.700> in<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.000> project<00:03:53.269> I've

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
colors appear well in this project I've

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.509 
colors appear well in this project I've
already<00:03:54.200> got<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.560> solid<00:03:54.920> layer<00:03:55.100> with<00:03:55.400> the

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
already got a solid layer with the

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.729 
already got a solid layer with the
gradient<00:03:55.790> ramp<00:03:56.120> however<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.049> this<00:03:57.170> case<00:03:57.470> I'm

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
gradient ramp however in this case I'm

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.500 
gradient ramp however in this case I'm
going<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.220> use<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.549> effect<00:03:58.880> called<00:03:59.180> collar

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
going to use the effect called collar

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.650 
going to use the effect called collar
amla<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.049> alter<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.470> gradient<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:02.090> with<00:04:02.329> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
amla to alter the gradient so with the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.000 
amla to alter the gradient so with the
solid<00:04:03.019> layer<00:04:03.170> selected<00:04:03.769> choose<00:04:04.690> effect<00:04:06.010> color

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
solid layer selected choose effect color

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.319 
solid layer selected choose effect color
correction<00:04:07.810> colorama<00:04:08.810> as<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:10.190> can<00:04:10.370> see<00:04:10.640> we

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
correction colorama as you can see we

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.210 
correction colorama as you can see we
now<00:04:11.569> have<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:12.109> multicolored<00:04:12.739> gradient

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
now have a multicolored gradient

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.240 
now have a multicolored gradient
Colorama<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> fairly<00:04:14.780> complex<00:04:15.200> effect<00:04:15.620> but

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
Colorama is a fairly complex effect but

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.130 
Colorama is a fairly complex effect but
adding<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:16.789> removing<00:04:16.820> colors<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.690> simple

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
adding and removing colors is a simple

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.770 
adding and removing colors is a simple
manner<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.400> effects<00:04:19.729> panel<00:04:20.000> let's

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
manner so in the effects panel let's

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.629 
manner so in the effects panel let's
twirl<00:04:21.109> down<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.410> property<00:04:21.950> called<00:04:22.400> output

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
twirl down the property called output

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.909 
twirl down the property called output
cycle<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.810> we<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.169> see<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.440> color<00:04:24.650> wheel

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
cycle so that we can see the color wheel

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.300 
cycle so that we can see the color wheel
to<00:04:25.160> get<00:04:25.970> rid<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.330> color<00:04:26.570> click<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.680> hold<00:04:27.950> on

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
to get rid of a color click and hold on

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.700 
to get rid of a color click and hold on
any<00:04:28.610> of<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.910> little<00:04:29.150> triangles<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:29.930> sort<00:04:30.620> of

want to point out that you can control

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.019 
want to point out that you can control
the<00:04:56.809> influence<00:04:57.409> of<00:04:57.529> colors<00:04:57.919> by<00:04:58.429> sliding<00:04:58.819> the

00:04:59.019 --> 00:04:59.029 
the influence of colors by sliding the

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:01.629 
the influence of colors by sliding the
triangles<00:04:59.599> along<00:04:59.749> the<00:05:00.139> circle<00:05:00.559> you<00:05:01.219> can<00:05:01.369> even

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
triangles along the circle you can even

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.669 
triangles along the circle you can even
pass<00:05:01.879> through<00:05:02.360> other<00:05:02.569> colors<00:05:03.019> and<00:05:03.229> really<00:05:03.379> mix

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:03.679 
pass through other colors and really mix

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:06.009 
pass through other colors and really mix
things<00:05:03.949> up<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.279> bit<00:05:04.309> and<00:05:04.639> of<00:05:05.269> course<00:05:05.539> for<00:05:05.809> some

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:06.019 
things up a bit and of course for some

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.049 
things up a bit and of course for some
control<00:05:06.409> over<00:05:06.649> the<00:05:06.979> overall<00:05:07.369> gradients

00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:08.059 
control over the overall gradients

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.449 
control over the overall gradients
behavior<00:05:08.539> and<00:05:08.779> influence<00:05:09.319> you<00:05:09.949> can<00:05:09.979> go<00:05:10.219> back

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:10.459 
behavior and influence you can go back

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:12.669 
behavior and influence you can go back
into<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.879> ramp<00:05:11.149> effect<00:05:11.599> and<00:05:11.839> play<00:05:12.379> with<00:05:12.559> the

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:12.679 
into the ramp effect and play with the

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.739 
into the ramp effect and play with the
start<00:05:12.979> of<00:05:13.099> ramp<00:05:13.339> and<00:05:13.550> end<00:05:13.879> of<00:05:14.029> ramp<00:05:14.240> properties

start of ramp and end of ramp properties

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.469 
start of ramp and end of ramp properties
so<00:05:15.439> you<00:05:15.529> see<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.219> have<00:05:16.459> the<00:05:16.639> tools<00:05:16.909> to<00:05:17.059> make<00:05:17.179> a

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
so you see you have the tools to make a

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.540 
so you see you have the tools to make a
multicolored<00:05:18.110> gradient<00:05:18.589> all<00:05:18.740> along<00:05:19.039> but<00:05:19.490> you

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
multicolored gradient all along but you

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.279 
multicolored gradient all along but you
never<00:05:19.759> knew<00:05:20.029> it<00:05:20.179> and<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.689> can<00:05:20.899> use<00:05:21.110> these

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
never knew it and you can use these

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.379 
never knew it and you can use these
techniques<00:05:21.559> for<00:05:22.009> a<00:05:22.069> lot<00:05:22.249> of<00:05:22.279> things<00:05:22.669> such<00:05:22.969> as<00:05:22.999> I

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389
