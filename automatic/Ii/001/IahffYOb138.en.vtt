well<00:01:42.600> his<00:01:42.899> price<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.590> stayed<00:01:43.860> pretty

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
well his price actually stayed pretty

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.609 
well his price actually stayed pretty
steady<00:01:44.399> not<00:01:45.060> much<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> dip<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> think

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
steady not much of a dip but I think

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
steady not much of a dip but I think
it's<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:46.920> people<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> even<00:01:48.630> more

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
are two cards which I was very certain

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.630 
are two cards which I was very certain
about<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.530> even<00:02:24.800> got<00:02:24.890> rid<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.190> foil<00:02:25.460> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
about I even got rid of a foil and

about I even got rid of a foil and

snaring bridge for the same reason that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
wasn't printed again these cards are one

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.880 
wasn't printed again these cards are one
which<00:02:31.550> appear<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:32.300> obvious<00:02:32.810> appear<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.740> be

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
which appear to be obvious appear to be

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.950 
which appear to be obvious appear to be
reprinted<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.700> they<00:02:34.880> weren't<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.660> took<00:02:35.780> a

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
reprinted and they weren't so I took a

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.850 
reprinted and they weren't so I took a
brunt<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.950> because<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.900> law<00:02:38.900> in<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.530> even

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
brunt it because of that law in the even

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.560 
brunt it because of that law in the even
short<00:02:40.220> term<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> next<00:02:40.970> six<00:02:41.180> months<00:02:41.360> I

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
short term in the next six months I

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.270 
short term in the next six months I
think<00:02:41.660> these<00:02:42.020> cards<00:02:42.350> will<00:02:42.530> be<00:02:42.680> reprinted<00:02:43.130> six

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
think these cards will be reprinted six

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.010 
think these cards will be reprinted six
to<00:02:43.400> twelve<00:02:43.670> months<00:02:43.730> they<00:02:44.450> probably<00:02:44.660> will<00:02:44.900> be

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
to twelve months they probably will be

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.900 
to twelve months they probably will be
reprinted<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.010> I'm<00:02:46.070> not<00:02:46.220> overly<00:02:46.580> worried

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
reprinted so I'm not overly worried

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.699 
reprinted so I'm not overly worried
about<00:02:47.090> taking<00:02:47.540> such<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> massive<00:02:48.200> hit<00:02:48.470> and<00:02:48.650> of

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
about taking such a massive hit and of

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:49.720 
about taking such a massive hit and of
course<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.980> got<00:02:49.100> picked<00:02:49.370> them<00:02:49.490> up<00:02:49.550> when<00:02:49.700> they

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
course I got picked them up when they

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.960 
course I got picked them up when they
were<00:02:49.880> cheaper<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:50.450> I'm<00:02:50.570> not<00:02:50.750> overly<00:02:51.709> concerned

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
were cheaper so I'm not overly concerned

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.550 
were cheaper so I'm not overly concerned
but<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.360> basically<00:02:53.780> underlines<00:02:54.170> a<00:02:54.290> point

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
but this basically underlines a point

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.770 
but this basically underlines a point
that<00:02:54.830> no<00:02:55.340> matter<00:02:55.459> how<00:02:55.730> close<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.570> think<00:02:56.600> you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
that no matter how close you think you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.600 
that no matter how close you think you
are<00:02:56.930> speculating<00:02:57.470> about<00:02:57.560> how<00:02:57.770> obvious<00:02:58.130> at

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610

are speculating about how obvious at
card<00:02:58.790> appears<00:02:59.150> it's<00:02:59.620> it's<00:03:00.620> not<00:03:01.490> something

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
card appears it's it's not something

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.120 
card appears it's it's not something
that<00:03:02.090> when<00:03:03.020> you're<00:03:03.140> speculating<00:03:03.380> on<00:03:03.740> a<00:03:03.800> rare

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
that when you're speculating on a rare

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
got to be careful with your speculation

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.260 
got to be careful with your speculation
and<00:03:11.270> for<00:03:11.630> me<00:03:12.280> every<00:03:13.280> time<00:03:13.459> I<00:03:13.520> mess<00:03:14.120> up

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
and for me every time I mess up

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.360 
and for me every time I mess up
speculation<00:03:14.870> as<00:03:15.020> I<00:03:15.050> have<00:03:15.350> for<00:03:15.650> my<00:03:15.980> biggest

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
speculation as I have for my biggest

speculation as I have for my biggest
mess<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.330> personally<00:03:17.840> was<00:03:17.959> vanilla<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.530> click

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
mess up personally was vanilla and click

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.920 
mess up personally was vanilla and click
in<00:03:19.160> terms<00:03:19.640> of<00:03:19.760> just<00:03:19.910> how<00:03:20.090> far<00:03:20.300> would<00:03:20.540> go<00:03:20.750> with

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
in terms of just how far would go with

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.170 
in terms of just how far would go with
modern<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.470> price<00:03:22.220> range<00:03:22.519> in<00:03:22.790> terms<00:03:23.000> of

modern in price range in terms of

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.199 
modern in price range in terms of
interest<00:03:23.739> but<00:03:24.739> yeah<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.340> mean<00:03:25.400> these<00:03:25.850> are

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
interest but yeah I mean these are

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.400 
interest but yeah I mean these are
things<00:03:26.600> we<00:03:26.750> really<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.080> keep<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.380> mind

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
things we really have to keep in mind

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.550 
things we really have to keep in mind
when<00:03:27.800> you're<00:03:27.950> speculating<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:29.470> cards<00:03:30.470> which

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
when you're speculating that cards which

forward hopefully we'll have a bit of a
lesson<00:03:40.700> from<00:03:41.540> these<00:03:41.780> examples<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.650> will<00:03:43.010> be<00:03:43.100> a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
lesson from these examples and will be a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.770 
lesson from these examples and will be a
little<00:03:43.400> bit<00:03:43.549> more<00:03:43.700> careful<00:03:44.090> not<00:03:44.209> through

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
little bit more careful not through

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.050 
little bit more careful not through
ourselves<00:03:45.200> all<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.380> way<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.650> as<00:03:45.860> well<00:03:46.070> as<00:03:46.340> to

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
ourselves all the way in as well as to

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.539 
ourselves all the way in as well as to
just<00:03:47.239> be<00:03:47.440> mindful<00:03:48.440> that<00:03:48.560> some<00:03:49.190> things<00:03:49.430> don't

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549

just plan out go out the way we plan
them<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.470> part<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.590> this<00:03:54.709> leads<00:03:55.100> into<00:03:55.280> well

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
them to and part of this leads into well

400<00:04:13.850> under<00:04:14.060> or<00:04:14.180> 350<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:14.690> think<00:04:14.900> for<00:04:15.140> 30<00:04:15.380> s

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
400 under or 350 I think for 30 s

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.140 
400 under or 350 I think for 30 s
actually<00:04:15.709> within<00:04:16.160> range<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.669> reasonable

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
actually within range of reasonable

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.210 
actually within range of reasonable
range<00:04:17.359> individual<00:04:18.350> packs<00:04:18.590> have<00:04:18.859> been<00:04:18.919> rising

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
range individual packs have been rising

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.969 
range individual packs have been rising
and<00:04:19.549> rising<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:19.850> rising<00:04:19.970> from<00:04:20.359> MSRP<00:04:20.830> so<00:04:21.830> the

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
and rising and rising from MSRP so the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.219 
and rising and rising from MSRP so the
question<00:04:22.280> is<00:04:22.370> should<00:04:22.580> i<00:04:22.880> just<00:04:23.090> buy<00:04:23.479> them<00:04:23.960> now

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
question is should i just buy them now

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.580

for<00:04:28.580> well<00:04:29.580> it's<00:04:30.150> $12<00:04:30.810> here<00:04:31.050> but<00:04:31.230> I've<00:04:31.410> seen

packs for eight nine dollars so the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.659 
packs for eight nine dollars so the
question<00:04:34.260> is<00:04:34.410> should<00:04:34.620> i<00:04:34.889> be<00:04:35.040> picking<00:04:35.520> these<00:04:35.610> up

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
and holding on to them because we know

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.500 
and holding on to them because we know
it's<00:04:37.919> such<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.190> lottery<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.940> just<00:04:39.389> because

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
it's such a lottery and just because

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.290 
it's such a lottery and just because
Darius<00:04:39.960> ECG<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.590> mr.<00:04:41.280> blue<00:04:41.460> lubu<00:04:41.790> have<00:04:42.030> open

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
most people will be disappointed I think

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.050 
most people will be disappointed I think
when<00:04:46.800> they<00:04:46.889> open<00:04:47.160> their<00:04:47.280> packs<00:04:47.520> in<00:04:47.790> terms<00:04:47.970> of

what they pull value wise for the amount
of<00:04:49.680> money<00:04:49.830> they're<00:04:50.040> putting<00:04:50.310> in<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:51.030> would<00:04:51.540> you

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
of money they're putting in so would you

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
looking at it in terms of more of an

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.150 
looking at it in terms of more of an
investment<00:04:57.510> point<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.290> view<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.979> answer

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
investment point of view and the answer

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.620 
investment point of view and the answer
is<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.370> course<00:04:59.400> not<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.060> don't<00:05:00.180> just<00:05:00.450> open

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.080 
packs with sake of opening packs that's
usually<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.960> bad<00:05:04.200> idea<00:05:04.440> for<00:05:04.919> modern<00:05:05.850> masters

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
usually a bad idea for modern masters

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.629 
them to try to open stuff very bad idea
holding<00:05:31.710> on<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.950> them<00:05:32.070> is<00:05:32.190> usually<00:05:32.520> what

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
holding on to them is usually what

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.730 
holding on to them is usually what
people<00:05:32.669> would<00:05:33.000> recommend<00:05:33.479> the<00:05:34.080> concerning

people would recommend the concerning
point<00:05:34.979> I<00:05:35.070> have<00:05:35.280> is<00:05:35.610> that<00:05:36.419> the<00:05:36.810> these<00:05:37.169> are<00:05:37.470> made

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
point I have is that the these are made

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.740 
point I have is that the these are made
out<00:05:37.979> of<00:05:38.010> different<00:05:38.220> materials<00:05:38.460> than<00:05:39.240> the

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
think that there's a good chance that

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:24.680 
think that there's a good chance that
these<00:06:23.039> packs<00:06:23.430> will<00:06:23.700> not<00:06:23.910> have<00:06:24.270> the<00:06:24.450> same

a box and wait on it for five years 33
years<00:06:34.080> even<00:06:34.349> I<00:06:34.909> think<00:06:35.909> that's<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.210> bit<00:06:36.360> risky

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
years even I think that's a bit risky

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.899 
years even I think that's a bit risky
and<00:06:36.750> I<00:06:36.810> think<00:06:36.990> it's<00:06:37.080> a<00:06:37.169> bit<00:06:37.700> that's<00:06:38.700> not

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:38.909 
and I think it's a bit that's not

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:39.620 
and I think it's a bit that's not
exactly<00:06:39.120> the<00:06:39.360> best

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
exactly the best

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.390 
exactly the best
investment<00:06:40.020> opportunity<00:06:40.440> of<00:06:40.500> anything<00:06:40.980> it's

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
investment opportunity of anything it's

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.250 
investment opportunity of anything it's
probably<00:06:41.910> better<00:06:42.180> also<00:06:42.660> in<00:06:42.780> terms<00:06:42.930> of<00:06:43.110> just
