00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.539
 It was giving talks guys here that do not 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.630
 speaking half a kilogram are all well 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.550
 coming to another video of black ops 2 and 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.110
 this is unfortunately not a match 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.119
 complete staff 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.390
 I ended up capturing her from the title rost 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.160
 migrated started the game very well but 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.559
 In the end I ended up doing a lot of licking. 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.750
 type quiz to be very aggressive since the 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.579
 So let's say in the middle of the game. 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.950
 It was very good, everything was going fine. 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.350
 I managed to kill super well but then 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.660
 it ended up kind of turning out and 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.210
 end up dying over and over again 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.030
 But you 'll see me by the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.100
 a machine it that I ended up suffering 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.290
 myself from the well-received offer and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.750
 from that point on things have gone 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.270
 desandando good when you check 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.070
 this is the reason for the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.230
 I really want to talk to you. 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.450
 Ah, I wanted to talk to you today about 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.759
 the scores actress is not my school strike 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.130
 preferred is the combination you can already see 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.590
 there in the corner that the shoppe steppe 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.560
 I am using orbital 97 and an escort 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.509
 Drone guy in my opinion these three 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.810
 technical schools are very good are 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.689
 super efficient and are not so difficult 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.399
 you unlock, I confess that the 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.530
 first let's say the first is more 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.109
 complicated but after you finish 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.990
 locking the steffi the others finish 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.729
 making in sequence and you can even 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.399
 loop it with a certain 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.380
 ease as long as you do not die 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.209
 keep killing, it's more or less 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.619
 that combination that I always went through 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:46.100
 For you of the module for 3579 I want 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.709
 predator the helicopter attack and the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.179
 six o vate basically the same thing only 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.579
 that in the place of the building is here 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.819
 people use orbital 97 that ends up helping 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.249
 very much, I mean, and it helps the 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.270
 my team also looks only there three ways 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.950
 What are you doing here? 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.229
 This helps me a lot. I got it. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.869
 get my first drone escort and mine 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.919
 7 and ends up explaining all the 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.020
 scores 3 

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:10.940
 The legal thing here is basically the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.280
 staff is a mall is always 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.310
 interesting you put in a point of the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.260
 map that is a point that has good 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.300
 the divisions for various parts of the map 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.000
 is the shopper different from the attack of a 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.370
 blackhawk helicopter sound 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.989
 he is not fixed you see I finished a point 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.150
 but it always varies somewhat 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.980
 it has small mobility 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.440
 to one side and then this 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.180
 ends up being more useful than the attack of 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.880
 black ops 1 helicopter 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.610
 the orbital of 7 as you already know 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.980
 identifying all opponents name 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.400
 map shows their time in real time 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.959
 huh 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.000
 the dots there where they are going 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.170
 to turn on the mininova in time 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.480
 real and all of them if your team has 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.280
 your sneaky friends will kill 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.319
 opponents you will add points and 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.830
 these points will accumulate for your 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.920
 Next trick score and a drone escort is 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.959
 very good because you throw and linen in the 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.810
 map in reality you trigger it you 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.450
 call him, he'll end up flying over you 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.940
 always around he'll teh year and 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.799
 same schematic and silverlight and with 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.530
 This he will even protect you 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.200
 Going to do your escort and no one 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.420
 no opponent can kill you 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.299
 so I thought this combination was really cool 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.519
 It's not very difficult to unlock 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.459
 one of the cool things is that from the 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.250
 the moment you release the stop shop is 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.930
 you can also automatically call 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.269
 the chronic escort and they get 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.640
 survive the same airspace at the 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.190
 airspace at the same time it ends 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.410
 making it much easier, you can also 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.010
 do as follows 1 st flame stop 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.930
 shop 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.940
 he stands there attracting the attention of the galley 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.069
 killing opponents and then 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.680
 when I was at the mall leaving the mini 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.350
 map from the map of your perimeter 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.750
 action you call the drone cuts for me 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.670
 plus a helicopter with a take the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.590
 space to it with that leaves the galley 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.380
 more worried and with that too 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.940
 Can you get an escort trick in the air? 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.010
 For a longer time, right? 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.170
 since it has that interval from one to the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.329
 another if you call the two promises 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.030
 they will sometimes be more efficient 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.380
 already have two history high 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.500
 doing your 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:24.200
 is your little enjoyment exchange 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.910
 Followed on 97 yet to help you know 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.680
 Where is the crowd going? 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.780
 I found a very interesting combination. 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.370
 very good I was able to do the same 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.140
 combination of ibm 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.240
 but I confess to you that modalities 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.910
 with the purpose of the type that comfort is 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.190
 much more interesting staff 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.000
 Good crowd and play is basically 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.030
 ending 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.460
 just the last message for you 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.430
 partially sighted two have a lot of people yet 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.790
 Tell me to burn the game I am 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.680
 funny, huh? 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.060
 but no, I'm not ungrateful 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.950
 Game I really like the game as it already 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.610
 I told you and when I play, it leaves me 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.440
 play 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.060
 I can get good matches 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.770
 Kilo is not a top player of 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.600
 line but I'm far from being a club 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
 that you can see through this 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.150
 gameplay of some game place that I 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.650
 canal swallow 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.690
 Of course I do not bring English in the streets. 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.730
 usually without bringing good game place 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.610
 but when the game lets me play 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.170
 I always try to bring my best to 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.550
 that you can check 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.100
 so this is it people, thank you 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.480
 company and we see each other in the 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.480
 video bye to you went
