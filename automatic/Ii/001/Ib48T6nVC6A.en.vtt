actually take flowers and throw them in
there<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.250> nuke<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:52.140> out<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.290> time

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there and nuke them little out of time

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.899 
there and nuke them little out of time
15<00:01:53.070> seconds<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> time

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
15 seconds at a time

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
15 seconds at a time
but<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.570> got<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.840> careful<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> end<00:01:55.470> up

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
but you got to be careful you can end up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.920 
but you got to be careful you can end up
burning<00:01:55.799> yourself<00:01:55.939> yeah<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.210> what<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.780> would

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
burning yourself yeah so what we would

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
burning yourself yeah so what we would
end<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.259> doing<00:01:58.619> instead<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.880> we<00:02:00.000> would

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
end up doing instead is that we would

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.319 
end up doing instead is that we would
actually<00:02:00.540> take<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.560> silica<00:02:02.369> gel<00:02:03.000> which

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
actually take and use silica gel which

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
hang them upside down takes much longer

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.440 
hang them upside down takes much longer
you<00:03:58.829> want<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.010> put<00:03:59.130> them<00:03:59.220> in<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> garage<00:03:59.640> in<00:04:00.299> a

dark area could be in a closet and then

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.660 
dark area could be in a closet and then
again<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> juices<00:04:04.680> go<00:04:04.860> down<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.400> then<00:04:05.549> it

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
again the juices go down and then it

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.340 
again the juices go down and then it
just<00:04:05.880> helps<00:04:06.299> preserve<00:04:06.540> them<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.170> can<00:04:07.320> just

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
just helps preserve them you can just

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.810 
just helps preserve them you can just
keep<00:04:07.620> checking<00:04:07.860> or<00:04:08.220> how<00:04:08.340> long<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.670> gonna

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
keep checking or how long is it gonna

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.220 
keep checking or how long is it gonna
take<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.239> get<00:04:09.329> this<00:04:09.390> way<00:04:09.720> here's<00:04:09.930> gonna<00:04:10.049> take

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
take to get this way here's gonna take

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
like a it's like a liquid polymer so it

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.650 
like a it's like a liquid polymer so it
almost<00:04:53.740> seals<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.370> yeah<00:04:54.640> okay<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:55.330> you<00:04:55.420> want<00:04:55.570> to

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
almost seals it yeah okay so you want to

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.270 
almost seals it yeah okay so you want to
get<00:04:55.780> it<00:04:55.900> on<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.110> inside<00:04:56.590> if<00:04:56.830> you<00:04:56.860> want<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.160> take

get it on the inside if you want to take
and<00:04:57.460> rip<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.210> inside<00:04:58.570> it<00:04:58.960> really<00:04:59.170> doesn't

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
and rip it inside it really doesn't

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.050 
and rip it inside it really doesn't
matter<00:04:59.740> any<00:05:00.160> turn<00:05:00.370> ends<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:00.730> looking<00:05:00.880> like

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
matter any turn ends up looking like
