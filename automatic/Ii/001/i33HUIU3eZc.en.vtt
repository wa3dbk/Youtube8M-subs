00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
man when I first learned to surf one of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
man when I first learned to surf one of
the<00:01:36.920> first<00:01:37.190> things<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.490> learned<00:01:37.700> is<00:01:37.850> don't

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the first things I learned is don't

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.090 
the first things I learned is don't
paddle<00:01:38.480> like<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:38.690> paddle<00:01:39.620> with<00:01:39.770> your<00:01:39.890> hands

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
paddle like this paddle with your hands

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.190 
paddle like this paddle with your hands
close<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.790> tighter<00:01:41.060> your<00:01:41.330> hands<00:01:41.630> are<00:01:41.780> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
close is the tighter your hands are the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.570 
close is the tighter your hands are the
less<00:01:42.470> amount<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.830> water<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.220> gonna<00:01:43.340> come

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
less amount of water is gonna come

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.220 
less amount of water is gonna come
between<00:01:43.730> your<00:01:44.000> fingers<00:01:44.360> more<00:01:44.900> traction

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
between your fingers more traction

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.890 
between your fingers more traction
faster<00:01:46.010> speed<00:01:46.280> more<00:01:46.790> ways<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:47.660> when<00:01:47.780> you're

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
faster speed more ways so when you're

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.960 
faster speed more ways so when you're
paddling<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.860> need<00:01:49.040> to<00:01:49.160> be<00:01:49.280> kicking<00:01:49.640> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970

been<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.020> water<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.470> 12<00:02:27.740> years<00:02:28.160> and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
been in the water for 12 years and

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.010 
been in the water for 12 years and
there's<00:02:28.580> still<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.090> sets<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.540> come<00:02:29.720> through

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
there's still the sets that come through

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
and I think even cleaning it up so lots

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.530 
and I think even cleaning it up so lots
of<00:02:32.900> practice<00:02:33.470> paddle<00:02:34.100> hard<00:02:34.130> commit<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.480> be

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540
