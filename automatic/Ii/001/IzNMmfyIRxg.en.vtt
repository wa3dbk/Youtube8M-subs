00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
when I got that done find myself using

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.460 
when I got that done find myself using
the<00:01:05.610> pipe<00:01:05.820> clamp<00:01:06.210> extensively<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.110> straighten

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the pipe clamp extensively to straighten

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.340 
the pipe clamp extensively to straighten
out<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> corners<00:01:08.659> see

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
out the corners see

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.100 
out the corners see
to<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.070> pipe<00:01:12.340> plant<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.420> release<00:01:13.630> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.060 

it's<00:01:17.110> all<00:01:17.940> unstraight<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:21.430> I<00:01:21.460> gotta<00:01:21.790> do<00:01:21.910> here

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.429 

stating<00:01:25.850> a<00:01:25.910> pipe<00:01:26.210> clamp

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:36.359 

they<00:01:29.950> can<00:01:30.070> pull<00:01:30.250> it<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.509> till<00:01:31.509> it's<00:01:31.659> flush

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:51.700 

droppin<00:01:37.369> a<00:01:37.549> screw<00:01:50.110> might<00:01:51.110> be<00:01:51.229> easier<00:01:51.500> to<00:01:51.560> do

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
droppin a screw might be easier to do

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.399 
droppin a screw might be easier to do
without<00:01:51.920> holding<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.280> camera<00:01:52.520> but<00:01:53.289> there<00:01:54.289> you

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
without holding the camera but there you

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:55.050 
without holding the camera but there you
go

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
go

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.730 
go

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
that screws in place the clamp there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.060 
that screws in place the clamp there
pretty<00:02:00.890> much<00:02:00.979> got<00:02:01.250> one<00:02:01.399> done<00:02:04.810> mm-hmm<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.070> still

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
to do is I'm going to cover this was a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.580 
to do is I'm going to cover this was a
sheet<00:03:29.050> of<00:03:29.140> tin<00:03:29.410> or<00:03:29.790> plastic<00:03:30.790> or<00:03:30.940> something

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
here managed to put exactly five frames

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.699 
here managed to put exactly five frames
in<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:50.370> I'll<00:03:51.370> put<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.610> frames<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:53.440> the

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
in it I'll put the frames in and the

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.800 
in it I'll put the frames in and the
bees

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:06.540 

we'll<00:03:58.810> say<00:03:58.959> that<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:02.890> all<00:04:03.040> four<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.340> these

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
I also have a couple of these three

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.230 
I also have a couple of these three
frame<00:04:10.060> nukes<00:04:10.360> which<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.750> built<00:04:10.930> earlier<00:04:12.240> the

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
frame nukes which I built earlier the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.710 
frame nukes which I built earlier the
same<00:04:13.450> thing<00:04:13.720> except<00:04:14.530> it's<00:04:14.680> just<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:15.480> little<00:04:16.480> bit

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
same thing except it's just a little bit

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.570 
same thing except it's just a little bit
smaller

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
smaller

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.010 
smaller
see

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.350 

they<00:04:23.620> use<00:04:23.770> these<00:04:23.979> for<00:04:24.250> transporting<00:04:24.910> frames

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
they use these for transporting frames

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.450 
they use these for transporting frames
of<00:04:25.539> bees<00:04:26.349> around<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.970> easy<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.300> carry<00:04:32.160> yep<00:04:33.160> I

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
of bees around it's easy to carry yep I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.070 
of bees around it's easy to carry yep I
think<00:04:34.000> that's<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.330> for<00:04:34.479> now

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.610 

I'll<00:04:38.620> just<00:04:38.830> cover<00:04:39.400> these<00:04:39.699> lids<00:04:40.509> with<00:04:40.780> some

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
I'll just cover these lids with some

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.950 
I'll just cover these lids with some
kind<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:41.919> covering<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:43.539> they'll<00:04:43.720> be<00:04:43.840> ready

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
kind of covering and they'll be ready

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.050 
kind of covering and they'll be ready
for<00:04:44.199> the<00:04:44.319> bees<00:04:47.159> you'll<00:04:48.159> see<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.520> knee<00:04:48.639> putting

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
for the bees you'll see the knee putting

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.680 
for the bees you'll see the knee putting
them<00:04:49.180> in<00:04:49.680> shortly
