00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.870 
palace I figured I'd start here this is
pretty<00:00:21.779> much<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.500> reason<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.220> got<00:00:23.430> back<00:00:23.640> into

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
pretty much the reason I got back into

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.870 
pretty much the reason I got back into
collecting<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.630> couple<00:00:24.900> years<00:00:25.050> ago<00:00:25.699> I'd<00:00:26.699> always

Jabba's<00:00:31.199> palace<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.770> got<00:00:35.550> me

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
Jabba's palace and this is what got me

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.780 
Jabba's palace and this is what got me
back<00:00:35.880> into<00:00:36.329> collecting<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.640> slowly<00:00:38.640> but

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
back into collecting and slowly but

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.950 
back into collecting and slowly but
surely<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:40.640> finally<00:00:41.640> got<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> where<00:00:42.899> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
surely and I finally got it to where I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.920 
surely and I finally got it to where I
wanted<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.620> took<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> couple<00:00:44.640> years<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
wanted it I took a couple years but a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
wanted it I took a couple years but a
lot<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.710> had<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> fact<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
lot of that had to do with the fact that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.299 
lot of that had to do with the fact that
some<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> figures<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.800> gomorian

I could be mistaken correct me if I'm
wrong<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.720> he's<00:02:41.350> really<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.739> only<00:02:41.769> figure

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
wrong and he's really the only figure

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850 
wrong and he's really the only figure
that<00:02:42.550> I<00:02:42.580> don't<00:02:43.060> actually<00:02:43.390> care<00:02:43.630> for<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.200> he's

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
that I don't actually care for but he's

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.620 
that I don't actually care for but he's
the<00:02:45.160> only<00:02:45.280> Chewbacca<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.209> that

the only Chewbacca that I know that

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.120 
the only Chewbacca that I know that
comes<00:02:46.840> with<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:49.709> chain<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:52.530> that's<00:02:53.530> why<00:02:53.769> he's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
comes with the chain so that's why he's
