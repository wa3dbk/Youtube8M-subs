some people console gamers who want to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
some people console gamers who want to
get<00:01:22.590> into<00:01:22.770> PC<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.909> prices<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.720> stuff

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
get into PC because the prices and stuff

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.960 
get into PC because the prices and stuff
like<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> free<00:01:25.680> internet<00:01:26.130> but<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> don't

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
like that and free internet but I don't

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.130

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
think they're going to do very well

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.520 
think they're going to do very well
because<00:01:28.710> pc<00:01:29.159> gamers<00:01:29.579> already<00:01:30.360> have<00:01:30.570> pcs<00:01:31.049> they

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
because pc gamers already have pcs they

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.190 
because pc gamers already have pcs they

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.280 
don't want to spend you know 52 thousand
dollars<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.890> box<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.810> play<00:01:37.020> in

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
already but something like this I think

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.139 
already but something like this I think
will<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.170> very<00:01:43.200> well<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> lot<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.700> PC
