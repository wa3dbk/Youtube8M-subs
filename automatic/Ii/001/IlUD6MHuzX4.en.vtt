00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.289 
that ad block that that google has there
they<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:53.100> how<00:01:53.430> much<00:01:53.610> money<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.939> thing

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
they know how much money that thing

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.300 
they know how much money that thing
should<00:01:54.509> generate<00:01:54.899> right<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:56.159> got

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
should generate right and so if they got

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.240 
should generate right and so if they got
seven<00:01:56.909> individual<00:01:57.570> ads<00:01:57.840> their<00:01:58.200> text<00:01:58.770> ads<00:01:58.950> and

seven individual ads their text ads and
they<00:01:59.700> aren't<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.390> generating<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.110> sir<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
they aren't really generating or sir and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.830 
they aren't really generating or sir and
they<00:02:02.250> know<00:02:02.490> how<00:02:02.700> much<00:02:02.729> okay<00:02:03.149> those<00:02:03.329> seven<00:02:03.689> ads

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
they know how much okay those seven ads

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
they know how much okay those seven ads
on<00:02:04.140> average<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.710> 1%<00:02:05.159> click-through<00:02:05.880> rate<00:02:06.000> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
on average get 1% click-through rate so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
on average get 1% click-through rate so
that<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:07.290> know<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.590> they're<00:02:07.979> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> get

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that they know that they're going to get

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.859 
that they know that they're going to get
like<00:02:08.550> say<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> seven<00:02:09.090> percent<00:02:09.390> click-through

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
like say a seven percent click-through

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.630 
like say a seven percent click-through
rate<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.200> average<00:02:10.530> cost<00:02:10.800> they're<00:02:11.220> making

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
rate in the average cost they're making

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.520 
rate in the average cost they're making
per<00:02:11.910> click

per click

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.559 
per click
say<00:02:12.650> thirty<00:02:13.010> cents<00:02:13.310> right<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.360> they've<00:02:14.540> got

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
say thirty cents right so they've got

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.380 
say thirty cents right so they've got
their<00:02:14.930> metrics<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.430> run<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:16.880> ad<00:02:17.060> and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
it gets like a half percent clicks or

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.699 
it gets like a half percent clicks or
rate<00:02:19.730> think<00:02:20.630> about<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:20.990> why<00:02:21.230> would<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:21.560> run

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
rate think about it why would they run

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.890 
rate think about it why would they run
you're<00:02:21.920> at<00:02:22.069> when<00:02:22.550> they<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.880> boot<00:02:23.450> your<00:02:23.720> ad<00:02:23.870> out

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
you're at when they can boot your ad out

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.680 
you're at when they can boot your ad out

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
12 times the amount of clicks array it

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.510 
12 times the amount of clicks array it
doesn't<00:02:29.600> make<00:02:29.720> sense<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.980> first<00:02:31.370> thing

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
doesn't make sense so the first thing

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.220 
doesn't make sense so the first thing
you've<00:02:31.760> got<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:32.000> do<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.569> have<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:33.080> make

nobody's going to click on it you can

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.199 
nobody's going to click on it you can
run<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.860> ad<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.280> hundreds<00:02:58.670> of<00:02:58.760> sites<00:02:59.000> all

run that ad on hundreds of sites all
through<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.600> internet<00:02:59.959> and<00:03:00.080> eventually

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
through the internet and eventually

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.930 
through the internet and eventually
they're<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.100> going<00:03:01.190> to<00:03:01.280> all<00:03:01.400> get<00:03:01.580> taken<00:03:01.760> down

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
they're just going to all get taken down

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.430 
they're just going to all get taken down
all<00:03:02.239> get<00:03:02.480> taken<00:03:02.630> down<00:03:02.780> because<00:03:03.140> Google<00:03:03.410> is

so what do we do first thing you gotta

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.569 
so what do we do first thing you gotta
do<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.390> you've<00:03:15.260> got<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.680> without<00:03:16.459> question

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
make sure you've got at least a couple

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.500 
make sure you've got at least a couple
split<00:03:18.769> tests<00:03:19.070> running<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.850> you<00:03:19.910> want<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.239> split

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
split tests running so you want to split

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.690 
split tests running so you want to split
tests<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.110> rotate<00:03:21.500> three<00:03:22.010> ads<00:03:22.220> when<00:03:22.549> you're

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
tests and rotate three ads when you're

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.340 
tests and rotate three ads when you're
starting<00:03:22.970> out<00:03:23.150> ideally<00:03:23.690> that's<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:24.049> good<00:03:24.230> thing

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
starting out ideally that's a good thing

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.009 
starting out ideally that's a good thing
and<00:03:24.560> then<00:03:25.130> on<00:03:25.340> each<00:03:25.760> ad<00:03:26.030> you're<00:03:26.720> going<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.900> want

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
number one then add 3 has the same

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.360 
number one then add 3 has the same
everything<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.079> add<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:42.590> but<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.070> only<00:03:43.250> thing

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
everything is add one but the only thing

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.280 
everything is add one but the only thing
