any strategies to give you because i was

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.280

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.389 
never great at this game I you know I'm
okay<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.780> fantastic<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
is it's just really fun to play I think
it's<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.340> I'm<00:01:56.549> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.729> revisiting<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360

slow<00:06:17.710> and<00:06:17.740> I<00:06:17.890> don't<00:06:18.040> think<00:06:18.220> sleight<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.460> hand<00:06:18.790> I

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
slow and I don't think sleight of hand I

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.600 
slow and I don't think sleight of hand I
honestly<00:06:20.170> I'm<00:06:20.320> kind<00:06:20.350> of<00:06:20.890> a<00:06:20.980> new<00:06:21.100> but<00:06:21.280> this<00:06:21.400> game

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
honestly I'm kind of a new but this game

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.250 
honestly I'm kind of a new but this game
which<00:06:22.090> is<00:06:22.210> sad<00:06:22.450> because<00:06:22.480> it's<00:06:22.900> been<00:06:22.990> out<00:06:23.080> for<00:06:23.110> a

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
which is sad because it's been out for a

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.780 
which is sad because it's been out for a
long<00:06:23.320> time<00:06:23.560> but<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.860> didn't<00:06:24.130> play<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.310> seriously

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
long time but I didn't play it seriously

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.360 
long time but I didn't play it seriously
so<00:06:25.090> I'm<00:06:25.510> kind<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.720> like<00:06:25.840> discovering<00:06:26.350> it<00:06:26.500> but<00:06:27.160> i

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
so I'm kind of like discovering it but i

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.770 
so I'm kind of like discovering it but i
don't<00:06:27.460> think<00:06:27.670> the<00:06:27.850> sleight<00:06:28.120> of<00:06:28.150> hand<00:06:28.450> in<00:06:28.600> world

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780
