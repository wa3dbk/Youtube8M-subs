30<00:00:38.360> seconds<00:00:38.870> for<00:00:39.320> this<00:00:39.440> thing<00:00:39.680> to<00:00:39.770> take<00:00:39.950> on<00:00:40.100> a

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
30 seconds for this thing to take on a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.430 
30 seconds for this thing to take on a
life<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.670> its<00:00:40.850> own<00:00:40.970> was<00:00:41.210> this<00:00:41.329> something<00:00:42.290> that

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
life of its own was this something that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.900 
life of its own was this something that
you<00:00:42.680> envisioned<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.550> crowd<00:00:43.760> jizz

you envisioned the crowd jizz

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.520 
you envisioned the crowd jizz
gravitating<00:00:44.570> towards<00:00:44.900> when<00:00:45.050> you<00:00:45.170> walked<00:00:45.410> out

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
gravitating towards when you walked out

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.960
