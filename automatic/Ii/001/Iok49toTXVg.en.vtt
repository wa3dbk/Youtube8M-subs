00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hello dear and dear friends of 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.069
 digital torrent today we have with 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.139
 us a smart watch or watch 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.570
 smart or good as you want 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.360
 call it the smart wash and today it was named 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
 page packs s 8 and has the latest 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.660
 Android version is nothing more and nothing 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.359
 less than the mtk 65-72 tester of 2 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.140
 cores with a speed of 1.2 and 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.140
 exercises and 512 mb of ram the processor 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.660
 mtk 65 32 is not the big deal for a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.190
 mobile but for a smart watch it offers a 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.940
 excellent performance 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.500
 The s 8 offers 4 gb free memory 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.239
 internal but these can be expanded to 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.239
 32 with a card 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.770
 reverse wrong the metal cover 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.960
 of the s8 that offers them a good 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.390
 protection and a solid appearance to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 this smart watch here are the buttons 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.520
 Android classics the menu button 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.830
 and go back 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.800
 and on the side are the 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.740
 volume buttons 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.120
 and also the mini usb socket to load the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.430
 smart watch battery or for 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.290
 transfer data from or to the smart 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.200
 watch 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.240
 here at the bottom as they can 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.450
 see are the holes that allow the 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.030
 sound propagates from the speaker and in the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 opposite side is the camera of 5 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.750
 megapixels 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.000
 the memory card is inserted 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:43.200
 on the side here just below this 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 rubber membrane let's take a look at it 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.290
 I think without some kind of instrument 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.900
 it will not be easy to remove it is covered 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.310
 which I suppose is something positive already 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.030
 that attracts us gp memory will be 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.030
 well protected 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.270
 A bit difficult 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.579
 well finally here you can see the shot 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.579
 where the memory card is inserted 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.769
 let's now look at the interface 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.769
 main of this smart watch 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.180
 here as you can see has the look 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 classic android and navigation is 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.820
 very easy that they do have to make sure 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.930
 let the fingertip touch the screen 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.370
 correctly if not the screen does not 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.470
 will detect that it is being touched 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.200
 the screen of this smart watch measures 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.129
 about 54 inches and it has a density of 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.099
 240 240 pixels the image quality 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.019
 is good but keep in mind that this 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.190
 screen is not hd so keep your 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.190
 expectations in reality 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.400
 if we try now the keyboard of the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.650
 computer is relatively easy 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.460
 type but it's a different story 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.780
 when you have to send a message 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.780
 or look in the phone book 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.280
 if we press the home button 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.010
 we can access all the applications 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.920
 open and close 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.200
 as in a regular mobile that surely 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.659
 something the android fans are going to 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.860
 love now we see a look at the 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.510
 Gallery 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.400
 and let's see how it looks in the photos 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 I want to clarify that the photos look very 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.170
 well live but in the recording is 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.480
 possible that you look a little disappointed 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.900
 this is simply an effect of the 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.900
 recording 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.270
 the different story when they look at 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.960
 alive 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.960
 Live 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.989
 a green with simple settings 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:26.430
 classics the android wifi classics 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.770
 bluetooth can connect the vpn that by 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.319
 very useful course here in china 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.780
 in airplane mode and nothing else new everything 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.819
 something that people who have used 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.560
 Android will feel very 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.560
 familiar with this interface 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.240
 I want to say that this phone also 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.580
 can connect with 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.580
 an application of maps like google maps 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.690
 the s8 camera has 5 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.940
 megapixels and is located in a 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.670
 fairly strategic position for greater 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.240
 comfort but so everything is not super 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.370
 comfortable 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.620
 but it takes a certain time 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.300
 adapt to use it and then feel 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.300
 a bit like james bond 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.539
 use the keyboard in the 8 s can be 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:35.039
 a bit of a challenge since good the 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.080
 keyboard is quite small and the 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.919
 people who have two a little 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.919
 thick is going to be a bit difficult 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.919
 key 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.340
 It is not impossible but it is somewhat difficult 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.919
 let's see how is the quality of the video 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.919
 and the audio in s 8 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.520
 good friends I think that's all for 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.690
 Now if you liked the video and want 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.940
