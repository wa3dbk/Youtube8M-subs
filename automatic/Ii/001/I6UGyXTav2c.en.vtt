00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
veggies what what are they good for we

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.770 
veggies what what are they good for we
tell<00:00:32.770> our<00:00:32.920> patients<00:00:33.160> try<00:00:33.700> and<00:00:33.760> have<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:34.030> rainbow

organic<00:00:36.730> I<00:00:37.270> know<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.539> gets<00:00:37.660> expensive<00:00:37.960> but<00:00:38.379> as

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
organic I know it gets expensive but as

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.110 
organic I know it gets expensive but as
much<00:00:38.680> organic<00:00:38.890> as<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.370> can<00:00:39.520> afford<00:00:39.789> one

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
much organic as you can afford one

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.630 
much organic as you can afford one
because<00:00:41.110> you're<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.800> agricultural

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
because you're the agricultural

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.029 
because you're the agricultural
pesticides<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.719> the<00:00:43.899> chemicals<00:00:44.289> and<00:00:44.920> the

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
pesticides and the chemicals and the

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.250 
pesticides and the chemicals and the
manufacturing<00:00:45.760> chemicals<00:00:46.239> all<00:00:46.629> do<00:00:46.930> affect

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
manufacturing chemicals all do affect

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.200 
manufacturing chemicals all do affect
hormone<00:00:47.649> balance<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.280> think<00:00:48.699> none<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:48.879> us<00:00:49.059> can

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
hormone balance I think none of us can

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.970 
hormone balance I think none of us can
afford<00:00:49.329> to<00:00:49.539> it<00:00:49.690> completely<00:00:50.170> organic<00:00:50.440> but<00:00:50.800> just

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
afford to it completely organic but just

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.069 
afford to it completely organic but just
the<00:00:51.070> best<00:00:51.219> we<00:00:51.460> can<00:00:51.609> do<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:52.120> then<00:00:52.510> lots<00:00:52.809> of

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
sperm count that kind of thing so this

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.150 
sperm count that kind of thing so this
is<00:01:10.840> basically<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.290> keep<00:01:11.320> your<00:01:11.530> hormones<00:01:11.920> and

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
chuck it in main function energy it's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.210 
chuck it in main function energy it's
probably<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.380> most<00:01:14.410> important<00:01:14.980> thing<00:01:15.100> you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
probably the most important thing you

can<00:01:15.280> do<00:01:15.580> okay<00:01:15.940> what<00:01:16.090> do<00:01:16.150> you<00:01:16.180> want<00:01:16.360> to

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
can do okay what do you want to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.000 
can do okay what do you want to
illustrate<00:01:16.510> here<00:01:16.900> is<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.170> some<00:01:17.590> examples<00:01:17.950> of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
illustrate here is this some examples of

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.860 
illustrate here is this some examples of
fat<00:01:18.280> like<00:01:18.490> with<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.730> oil<00:01:18.880> I'd<00:01:19.330> like<00:01:19.570> people<00:01:19.720> to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
fat like with the oil I'd like people to

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.600 
fat like with the oil I'd like people to
know<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.230> they<00:01:20.320> should<00:01:20.530> have<00:01:20.740> some<00:01:21.070> fat<00:01:21.340> I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
know that they should have some fat I

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.220 
know that they should have some fat I
think<00:01:21.910> people<00:01:22.090> go<00:01:22.330> on<00:01:22.480> very<00:01:22.630> very<00:01:22.840> low<00:01:22.990> fat

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
think people go on very very low fat

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.870 
think people go on very very low fat
diet<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:23.890> think<00:01:24.070> they'd<00:01:24.190> be<00:01:24.310> surprised<00:01:24.700> to

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
diet and I think they'd be surprised to

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.250 
diet and I think they'd be surprised to
find<00:01:25.060> out<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.300> if<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.660> don't<00:01:25.870> get<00:01:26.020> enough

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
find out that if you don't get enough

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.960 
find out that if you don't get enough
fat<00:01:26.470> you<00:01:26.620> can't<00:01:26.860> make<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.250> hormones<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.790> need

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
fat you can't make the hormones you need

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.940 
fat you can't make the hormones you need
so<00:01:28.480> we<00:01:28.600> encourage<00:01:28.870> people<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.290> have<00:01:29.500> healthy

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
so we encourage people to have healthy

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.820 
so we encourage people to have healthy
fats<00:01:30.250> okay<00:01:30.820> whole<00:01:31.120> grains<00:01:31.420> whole<00:01:32.050> grains<00:01:32.110> we

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
fats okay whole grains whole grains we

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.380 
fats okay whole grains whole grains we
were<00:01:32.980> fine<00:01:33.250> grains<00:01:33.580> in<00:01:33.790> this<00:01:33.910> country<00:01:34.300> really

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
were fine grains in this country really

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.060 
were fine grains in this country really
for<00:01:34.630> convenience<00:01:35.080> sake<00:01:35.290> because<00:01:35.560> they<00:01:35.830> cook

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
for convenience sake because they cook

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.740 
for convenience sake because they cook
quicker<00:01:36.310> but<00:01:36.850> it<00:01:37.030> takes<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.420> lot<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
quicker but it takes a lot of the

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.540 
quicker but it takes a lot of the
important<00:01:38.170> vitamins<00:01:38.530> out<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:38.890> them<00:01:39.010> so<00:01:39.190> we

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
important vitamins out of them so we

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.740 
important vitamins out of them so we
like<00:01:39.730> people<00:01:39.940> who<00:01:40.120> have<00:01:40.210> whole<00:01:40.450> grains

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
like people who have whole grains

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.470 
like people who have whole grains
because<00:01:41.020> have

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
because have

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.080 
because have
t<00:01:41.630> oxidants<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:42.200> iron<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:43.130> b<00:01:43.280> vitamins<00:01:43.310> and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
t oxidants and iron and b vitamins and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.250 
t oxidants and iron and b vitamins and
those<00:01:44.180> are<00:01:44.300> all<00:01:44.420> important<00:01:44.930> for<00:01:45.050> getting

that<00:02:08.750> mean<00:02:08.930> and<00:02:09.080> then<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.680> really
