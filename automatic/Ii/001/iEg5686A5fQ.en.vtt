00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
Year award just a couple months ago we

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
Year award just a couple months ago we
entered<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> market<00:01:15.000> with<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.049> believe

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
entered the market with what we believe

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.330 
entered the market with what we believe
was<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.650> first<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.130> mo<00:01:17.189> antenna<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:19.340> from

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
was the first my mo antenna and from

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.690 
was the first my mo antenna and from
there<00:01:20.640> we<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.210> saw<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.979> market<00:01:22.979> demand<00:01:23.340> for

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
there we also saw the market demand for

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.240 
there we also saw the market demand for
a<00:01:23.729> good<00:01:24.030> size<00:01:24.299> o<00:01:24.330> antenna<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.650> started<00:01:26.070> with

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a good size o antenna so we started with

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.330 
a good size o antenna so we started with
our<00:01:26.280> large<00:01:26.939> premium<00:01:27.330> sigh<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.770> identified

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
our large premium sigh so we identified

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.069 
our large premium sigh so we identified
the<00:01:29.579> need<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:31.189> different<00:01:33.079> venue

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
the need for different venue

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
the need for different venue
requirements<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.880> came<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.119> with

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
requirements and so we came up with

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
requirements and so we came up with
through<00:01:37.170> ceiling<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.770> above<00:01:38.009> ceiling<00:01:38.460> for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
through ceiling and above ceiling for

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
through ceiling and above ceiling for
our<00:01:38.850> site<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.240> antennas<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.500> then<00:01:40.710> later<00:01:41.009> on

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
our site so antennas we then later on

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.300 
our site so antennas we then later on
developed<00:01:41.820> our<00:01:42.150> small<00:01:42.570> sigh<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.159> for<00:01:44.159> more

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
developed our small sigh so for more

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.840 
developed our small sigh so for more
budget<00:01:44.850> minded<00:01:45.079> projects<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:47.040> took<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.490> into

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
budget minded projects we took that into

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.350 
budget minded projects we took that into
public<00:01:48.420> safety<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.369> public

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
public safety and so now we have public

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.469 
public safety and so now we have public
safety<00:01:51.780> which<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> 3d<00:01:52.439> megahertz<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.670> 6000

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
safety which is 3d megahertz to 6000

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.889 
safety which is 3d megahertz to 6000
megahertz<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.470> building<00:01:56.159> antennas<00:01:56.689> we<00:01:57.689> then

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
megahertz in building antennas we then

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.080 
megahertz in building antennas we then
realized<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.189> needed<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.460> complement

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
realized that we needed to complement

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.389 
realized that we needed to complement
that<00:02:00.170> though<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> omni's<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.159> our

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that though the omni's with our

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.630 
that though the omni's with our
directional<00:02:03.030> panels<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.799> complements

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
directional panels so that complements

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.660 
directional panels so that complements
