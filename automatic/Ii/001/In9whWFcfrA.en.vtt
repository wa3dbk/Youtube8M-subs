each<00:01:04.769> delivery<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> will<00:01:06.060> all<00:01:06.150> be

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
each delivery and then it will all be

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420 
each delivery and then it will all be
programmed<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.260> you'll<00:01:07.380> be<00:01:07.470> able<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.799> press

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
trusts go ones we've all used it a hell

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.609 
trusts go ones we've all used it a hell
of<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.670> lot<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> big<00:01:16.439> asset

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
of a lot and it's it's been a big asset

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.050 
of a lot and it's it's been a big asset
to<00:01:16.799> our<00:01:16.979> practice<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:17.970> you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to our practice really this because you

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.850 
to our practice really this because you
can<00:01:18.180> go<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.960> amount<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.259> spin<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
can go in and the amount of spin is that

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.960 
can go in and the amount of spin is that
is<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.100> key<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:20.880> because

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
is the key to it or not because

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
is the key to it or not because
sometimes<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:22.229> know<00:01:22.350> we're<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.650> normal

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
sometimes you know we're just normal

sometimes you know we're just normal
finger<00:01:23.670> spinners<00:01:23.939> Bowl<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.299> don't<00:01:24.479> get

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
finger spinners Bowl and you don't get

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
finger spinners Bowl and you don't get
the<00:01:24.659> ball<00:01:24.780> turning<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.560> against<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the ball turning like you do against the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.370 
the ball turning like you do against the
world's<00:01:26.610> best<00:01:26.640> bowlers<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.330> anyway<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.259> can

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
world's best bowlers so anyway we can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
world's best bowlers so anyway we can
simulate<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> help<00:01:29.520> us<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
simulate it was going to help us the

to<00:01:33.810> play<00:01:34.079> mystery<00:01:34.560> spin<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> thought<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
to play mystery spin so I thought I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
to play mystery spin so I thought I
would<00:01:36.030> briefly<00:01:36.509> come<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> retirement<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
would briefly come out of retirement and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.469 
would briefly come out of retirement and
see<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.159> wizard<00:01:38.430> machine<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> really

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
see what this wizard machine is really

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.359 
see what this wizard machine is really
like<00:01:39.630> things<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> name<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.829> research

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
ought to get balls that spin both ways

you<00:02:11.690> got<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.870> try<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.050> read<00:02:12.200> them<00:02:12.350> as<00:02:12.440> they're

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530

you got to try and read them as they're
coming<00:02:12.620> down<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:14.300> your<00:02:14.480> are<00:02:14.630> trying<00:02:14.810> to

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
coming down so your are trying to

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
it is than it will be outside so that

it is than it will be outside so that

when you go outside you feel pretty

when you go outside you feel pretty

to deal with anything you get there are

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.620 
to deal with anything you get there are
a<00:02:28.040> few<00:02:28.250> little<00:02:28.400> tricks<00:02:28.610> up<00:02:28.970> our<00:02:29.120> sleeve<00:02:29.360> for

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
a few little tricks up our sleeve for

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.840 
a few little tricks up our sleeve for
the<00:02:29.750> coming<00:02:30.290> months<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.860> for<00:02:31.580> getting<00:02:31.760> your

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
the coming months and for getting your

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.670 
the coming months and for getting your
next<00:02:32.030> season<00:02:32.420> which<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.630> think<00:02:32.840> will<00:02:33.410> be<00:02:33.470> quite

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
next season which I think will be quite

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.290 
next season which I think will be quite
interesting<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.220> anyone<00:02:34.489> who<00:02:34.550> faces<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
interesting for anyone who faces it and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.900 
interesting for anyone who faces it and
hopefully<00:02:36.050> we'll<00:02:36.140> make<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:37.250> better

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
hopefully we'll make it a better

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.360 
hopefully we'll make it a better
coaching<00:02:38.390> tool<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.840> also<00:02:39.110> quite<00:02:39.500> fun<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.950> play

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
coaching tool and also quite fun to play

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.680 

that<00:02:49.910> was<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.180> do<00:02:50.330> sir<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.630> think

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390 

say<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> hardest<00:02:55.710> thing<00:02:55.980> actually<00:02:56.310> is

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
say the hardest thing actually is

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.400 
say the hardest thing actually is
getting<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.910> timing<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.720> movements<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
getting the timing of the movements you

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.430 
getting the timing of the movements you
get<00:02:59.100> three<00:02:59.400> flashing<00:03:00.000> lights<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.350> have

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
get three flashing lights and you have

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.250 
get three flashing lights and you have
to<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.800> your<00:03:01.830> feet<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.550> get<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.630 

unlike<00:03:07.260> regular<00:03:07.470> bowling<00:03:07.950> machines<00:03:08.430> which

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
unlike regular bowling machines which

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.740 
unlike regular bowling machines which
use<00:03:08.850> rubber<00:03:09.180> balls

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
use rubber balls

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.530 
use rubber balls
Merlin<00:03:10.200> uses<00:03:10.590> action<00:03:11.070> cricket<00:03:11.460> balls<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:12.300> puts

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
Merlin uses action cricket balls it puts

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.480 
Merlin uses action cricket balls it puts
so<00:03:12.870> many<00:03:13.020> revolutions<00:03:13.830> on<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> ball<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.370> the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
so many revolutions on the ball that the

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.610 
so many revolutions on the ball that the
seam<00:03:14.700> comes<00:03:15.510> into<00:03:15.720> play<00:03:15.870> sometimes<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.470> get

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
seam comes into play sometimes you get

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.740 
seam comes into play sometimes you get
an<00:03:17.070> irregularity<00:03:17.670> with<00:03:17.970> cricket<00:03:18.360> balls<00:03:18.540> which

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
an irregularity with cricket balls which

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.320 
an irregularity with cricket balls which
is<00:03:19.020> quite<00:03:19.320> good<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.890> variation<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.030> people

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
is quite good a variation so that people

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.930 
is quite good a variation so that people
don't<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:22.260> stuck<00:03:22.590> in<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.890> same<00:03:23.100> shot<00:03:23.430> the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
don't get stuck in the same shot the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.400 
don't get stuck in the same shot the
drift<00:03:24.210> is<00:03:24.330> harder<00:03:24.660> with<00:03:24.750> a<00:03:24.810> cricket<00:03:25.140> ball<00:03:25.230> I'll

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
drift is harder with a cricket ball I'll

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.750 
drift is harder with a cricket ball I'll
be<00:03:25.830> honest<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.130> that's<00:03:26.250> something<00:03:26.610> we've

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
be honest and that's something we've

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.400 
be honest and that's something we've
been<00:03:26.880> working<00:03:27.210> on<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.390> think<00:03:27.720> we'll<00:03:27.840> we'll<00:03:28.200> get

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
been working on I think we'll we'll get

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.930 
been working on I think we'll we'll get
there<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.860> we<00:03:28.980> were<00:03:29.130> getting<00:03:29.460> there<00:03:29.610> towards

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
there and we were getting there towards

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.770 
there and we were getting there towards
the<00:03:30.030> end<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.300> summer<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.950> easier<00:03:32.370> with<00:03:32.550> a

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
the end of the summer it's easier with a

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.180 
the end of the summer it's easier with a
rubber<00:03:33.780> ball<00:03:33.960> because<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.230> can<00:03:34.440> grip<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.980> more

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
rubber ball because you can grip it more

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.040 
rubber ball because you can grip it more
and<00:03:35.460> you<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:35.970> send<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.240> out<00:03:36.360> sideways<00:03:36.840> what

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
and you can send it out sideways what

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.420 
and you can send it out sideways what
what<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:37.470> were<00:03:37.560> still<00:03:37.770> getting<00:03:37.920> was<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> little

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
what we were still getting was a little

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.070 
what we were still getting was a little
bit<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.640> drift<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.240> we<00:03:39.540> are<00:03:39.660> getting<00:03:39.840> more

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
bit of drift and we are getting more

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.040 
bit of drift and we are getting more
drift<00:03:40.380> now<00:03:40.910> but<00:03:41.910> even<00:03:42.210> Merlin<00:03:42.600> couldn't

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
drift now but even Merlin couldn't

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.200 
drift now but even Merlin couldn't
prevent<00:03:43.350> warns<00:03:43.770> magic<00:03:44.310> because<00:03:44.490> he<00:03:44.580> took<00:03:44.760> 40

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
prevent warns magic because he took 40

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.360 
prevent warns magic because he took 40
wickets<00:03:45.540> last<00:03:45.810> summer<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:46.890> released<00:03:47.130> 10

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
wickets last summer and we released 10

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
taking 40 wickets last year yeah I think

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.430 
taking 40 wickets last year yeah I think
that<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.270> difference<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:18.810> me<00:04:18.870> was<00:04:18.960> that<00:04:19.260> last

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
that the difference for me was that last

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.110 
that the difference for me was that last
year<00:04:19.770> through<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.400> other<00:04:20.580> series<00:04:20.970> I've
