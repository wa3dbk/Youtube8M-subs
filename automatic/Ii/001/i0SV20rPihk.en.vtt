00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.130 
Nathan let's kick it off with this one
why<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.520> people<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.030> drugs<00:00:48.090> even<00:00:49.050> though

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
why do people take drugs even though

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.740 
why do people take drugs even though
they<00:00:49.260> might<00:00:49.410> know<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> risks<00:00:50.070> involved<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
they might know the risks involved I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.959 
they might know the risks involved I
think<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> people<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.680> curious<00:00:53.129> about<00:00:53.489> drugs

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
think the people are curious about drugs

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.400 
think the people are curious about drugs
and<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.510> might<00:00:54.660> do<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> them<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and what they might do to them and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.990 
and what they might do to them and
they're<00:00:55.980> quite<00:00:56.190> available<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.360> two<00:00:57.660> people<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
they're quite available to two people I

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.150 
they're quite available to two people I
think<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.180> they<00:01:00.899> might<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.410> drugs<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> way

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
think they they might see drugs as a way

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.640 
think they they might see drugs as a way
of<00:01:02.210> breaking<00:01:03.210> down<00:01:03.570> social<00:01:04.260> barriers<00:01:04.500> that

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
of breaking down social barriers that

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.700 
of breaking down social barriers that
part<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.400> at<00:01:08.549> night<00:01:09.710> definitely

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
part of going out at night definitely

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.969 
part of going out at night definitely
the<00:01:10.920> availability<00:01:11.810> part<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.170> does<00:01:13.740> play

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
the availability part I think does play

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
the availability part I think does play
a<00:01:14.010> big<00:01:14.100> role<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.520> why<00:01:14.820> people<00:01:15.240> choose<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> take

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
a big role in why people choose to take

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.719 
a big role in why people choose to take
drugs<00:01:16.439> even<00:01:16.710> though<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.520> there

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
drugs even though they know that there

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.940 
drugs even though they know that there
is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.880> risk<00:01:18.150> because<00:01:18.680> drugs<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:19.830> everywhere

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
is a risk because drugs are everywhere

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.410 
is a risk because drugs are everywhere
you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:21.330> almost<00:01:21.570> find<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.259> any<00:01:22.470> setting

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
you can almost find them in any setting

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.760 
you can almost find them in any setting
someone<00:01:24.420> asked<00:01:24.750> what<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.530> if<00:01:25.619> your

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
someone asked what can you do if your

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
someone asked what can you do if your
mates<00:01:25.920> take<00:01:26.159> drugs<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
mates take drugs and you don't want it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080 
mates take drugs and you don't want it
well<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:29.790> your

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
well I think that just because your

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
well I think that just because your
friend<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.479> taking<00:01:30.900> drug<00:01:31.259> does<00:01:31.470> definitely

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
friend is taking drug does definitely

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.429 
friend is taking drug does definitely

it is potent the withdrawals are more

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.720 
it is potent the withdrawals are more
severe<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.680> personality<00:02:34.099> change<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
severe and the personality change is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.130 
severe and the personality change is
pretty<00:02:34.940> dramatic<00:02:35.390> they<00:02:35.540> become<00:02:35.870> more

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
pretty dramatic they become more

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.199 
pretty dramatic they become more
paranoid<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.860> aggressive<00:02:37.280> than<00:02:37.549> most<00:02:37.940> other

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
paranoid and aggressive than most other

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.150 
paranoid and aggressive than most other
drug<00:02:38.450> users<00:02:38.870> from<00:02:39.019> what<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.200> know<00:02:39.319> ice<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.860> a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
drug users from what I know ice is a

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.970 
drug users from what I know ice is a
relatively<00:02:40.610> new<00:02:40.730> drug<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.230> think<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.830> that

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
relatively new drug so I think that that

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.920 
relatively new drug so I think that that
that<00:02:43.280> is<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.700> course<00:02:43.910> for<00:02:44.209> some<00:02:44.420> concern

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
that is of course for some concern

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.360 
that is of course for some concern
because<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.410> don't<00:02:45.620> really<00:02:45.739> know<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.040> whole<00:02:46.190> lot

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
because we don't really know a whole lot

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.520 
because we don't really know a whole lot
what<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:46.819> can<00:02:46.970> do<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.180> you<00:02:47.390> what<00:02:47.900> about<00:02:48.019> my
