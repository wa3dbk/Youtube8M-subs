00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.639
 and let's make your value not 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.119
 For this we need the prices or 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.039
 sea ​​bream this weighs approximately 900 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:28.980
 grams 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:31.470
 garlic lemon potatoes onion oil salt and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.270
 to make a profit 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.270
 breadcrumbs garlic and parsley 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.899
 first we have peeled and washed well 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.829
 the potatoes and we have cut them in 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.980
 slices about half a centimeter a 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.780
 centimeter and then we have 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.180
 also cut the onion into wedges 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.400
 prices 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.640
 now so many things together we're going to 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.090
 fry in a pan 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.980
 with warm oil and when they are 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.260
 little bit golden just because you do not need 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.409
 they are made completely we will go 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.070
 removing them we will add the salt and the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.070
 we will reserve 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.610
 You see how they are a little media 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.020
 golden then we're going to leave 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.020
 taking out the baking dish 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.660
 because they finish doing in the in the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.330
 oven when we put the bream I like 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.520
 always fry them a little before here 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.370
 because if not, maybe it would stay in 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 half made in the oven because of course 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.320
 your oven needs too much time 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.500
 well now we will salar the kiss 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 inside and outside 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.990
 we turn it around 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.120
 study 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.600
 now we are going to put him here 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.940
 Lemon slices 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.630
 We have already put half of the slices of 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.880
 lemon 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.910
 also inside and now we are going to 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.150
 throw over a provençal that is 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.470
 grated bread with garlic and parsley this creates 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.470
 a crust is very rich 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.100
 and it gives a very good taste to the part of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.100
 above 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.000
 and finally the oil where we fried 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.170
 the potatoes and the onion 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.170
 pour over 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.489
 and by the cataracts 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.720
 to 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.340
 and finally we add water 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.340
 so that the kiss does not dry 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.860
 plus 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:41.190
 as it weighs 900 grams we will have it 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.190
 approximately 30 minutes from 30 to 35 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.370
 so now we 're going to put it in the oven 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.750
 at 200 degrees at the second height 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.840
 starting at the bottom 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.790
 Well, after half an hour 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.320
 approximately something minute more 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.830
 here we have already our kiss there was 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:03.800
 finished you can see how it has turned golden and the 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.800
 Provence has also caught its color 5 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.890
 and good is a dish that is usually made 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.390
 very often for the price of fish 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.320
 but once in a while we can 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.320
 give us a whim 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.209
 Well, here we have presented the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.530
 tail of the sea bream accompanied by its 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.530
 potatoes and onions
