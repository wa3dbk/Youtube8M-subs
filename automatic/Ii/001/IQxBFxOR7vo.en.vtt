feet<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.530> coverage<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.119> competition

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
feet of coverage this is the competition

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.450 
feet of coverage this is the competition
it<00:01:30.869> uses<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> plastic<00:01:31.470> Quick<00:01:31.890> Connect<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.280> you

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it uses a plastic Quick Connect that you

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
it uses a plastic Quick Connect that you
just<00:01:32.640> shove<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.030> hose<00:01:33.240> into<00:01:33.450> which<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.170> fine

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
just shove the hose into which is fine

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.249 
just shove the hose into which is fine
except<00:01:34.920> these<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.310> break<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.850> bit<00:01:36.259> you

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
except these do break a little bit you

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.440 
except these do break a little bit you
can<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.920> made<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.579> air<00:01:39.060> mover

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
can see this was made out of a air mover

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.920 
can see this was made out of a air mover
body<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.020> they<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.500> blocked<00:01:40.950> off

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
body that they just blocked off

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.039 
body that they just blocked off
different<00:01:44.240> different<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.720> clips

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
different different kind of clips

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
different different kind of clips
together<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.710> glued<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.520> panel<00:01:47.729> in

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
together they glued this little panel in

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
together they glued this little panel in
the<00:01:48.000> front<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.450> screwed<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.130> this<00:01:50.130> does<00:01:50.430> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the front and screwed it this does up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.600 
the front and screwed it this does up
240<00:01:51.360> degrees<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.649> comes<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> hundred<00:01:53.369> feet

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
240 degrees it comes with a hundred feet

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.510 
240 degrees it comes with a hundred feet
instead<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.149> 200<00:01:54.630> feet<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> hose

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
instead of 200 feet of hose

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.830 
instead of 200 feet of hose
they<00:01:57.450> both<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:58.250> similar<00:01:59.250> things<00:01:59.340> but<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
they both do similar things but I

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.690 
they both do similar things but I
we<00:02:01.079> think<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.500> does<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:02.310> these<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
we think this does this these are the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.100 
we think this does this these are the
people<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:02.969> invented<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:03.990> of
