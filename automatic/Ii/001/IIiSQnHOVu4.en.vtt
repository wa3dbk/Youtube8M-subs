do we need it to be healthy well a
couple<00:00:47.399> things<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.789> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> keep<00:00:48.149> our<00:00:48.360> cells

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
couple things you want to keep our cells

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.260 
couple things you want to keep our cells
healthy<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.590> free<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.340> illness<00:00:50.640> and/or

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
healthy and free of illness and/or

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.049 
healthy and free of illness and/or
cancer<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.770> oxygen<00:00:53.370> enriched

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
cancer so if you have oxygen enriched

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.479 
cancer so if you have oxygen enriched
cells<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.500> prevent<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.250> lot<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
cells then that can prevent a lot of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.180 
cells then that can prevent a lot of
illness<00:00:56.879> okay<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.440> us<00:00:58.620> right<00:00:58.890> yes

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
illness okay if you have us right yes

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.979 
illness okay if you have us right yes
well<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.670> let's<00:00:59.879> talk<00:01:00.059> about<00:01:00.120> some<00:01:00.690> things

that we can eat that have that oxygen in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.759 
that we can eat that have that oxygen in
them<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.660> well<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> raw

things that you eat in a raw food diet

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
things that you eat in a raw food diet
are<00:01:10.650> made<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.010> water<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.729> hydrogen

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
are made of water when you get hydrogen

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
are made of water when you get hydrogen
and<00:01:12.299> oxygen<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.110> helps<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> transfer<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and oxygen which helps the transfer of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
and oxygen which helps the transfer of
oxygen<00:01:14.520> through<00:01:14.939> our<00:01:15.030> blood<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.390> that's<00:01:15.479> what

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
oxygen through our blood and that's what

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
oxygen through our blood and that's what
we're<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:17.100> option<00:01:17.490> we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
we're really going for more option we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
we're really going for more option we
can<00:01:17.729> get<00:01:17.850> through<00:01:18.060> our<00:01:18.090> blood<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.810> an

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960

and<00:01:32.520> vegetables<00:01:32.939> legumes<00:01:33.119> okay<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.650> kind

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and vegetables legumes okay so so kind

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.410 
and vegetables legumes okay so so kind
of<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.100> things<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.670> pick<00:01:36.060> off<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
of the things that you pick off the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.640 
of the things that you pick off the
trees<00:01:36.689> or<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> things<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> put<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.530> your

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
trees or the things that you put in your

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.020 
trees or the things that you put in your
mouth<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.770> therefore<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.610> what<00:01:38.790> makes<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
mouth and therefore that's what makes it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.219 
mouth and therefore that's what makes it
run<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.210> don't<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> cook<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.110> order

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
run you don't have to cook it in order

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
run you don't have to cook it in order
to<00:01:40.409> eat<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.710> yeah<00:01:40.920> okay<00:01:41.340> going<00:01:41.579> back<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to eat it yeah okay going back to the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389 
to eat it yeah okay going back to the
farmer<00:01:42.360> okay<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.170> okay<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.590> our<00:01:44.040> next

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
farmer okay I like that okay so our next

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.359 
farmer okay I like that okay so our next
type<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.579> food<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.970> say<00:01:45.500> green<00:01:46.500> veggies<00:01:46.950> let's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
type of food you say green veggies let's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
type of food you say green veggies let's
go<00:01:47.520> back<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.820> green<00:01:48.000> veggies<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.689> they

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
go back to green veggies here and they

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649 
go back to green veggies here and they
contain<00:01:49.460> chlorophyll<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.820> chlorophyll<00:01:51.509> is

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
contain chlorophyll and chlorophyll is

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.240 
contain chlorophyll and chlorophyll is
has<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> very<00:01:52.110> similar<00:01:52.380> structure<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.009> our

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
has a very similar structure to our

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.460 
has a very similar structure to our
blood<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.880> eat<00:01:54.439> green<00:01:55.439> vegetables

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
blood and when you eat green vegetables

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520 
blood and when you eat green vegetables
it<00:01:56.280> transfers<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.570> into<00:01:57.869> our<00:01:57.960> blood<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it transfers that into our blood and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.859 
it transfers that into our blood and
helps<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.460> oxygen<00:01:59.850> transfer<00:02:00.060> into<00:02:00.540> our<00:02:00.659> blood

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
helps the oxygen transfer into our blood

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.050 
helps the oxygen transfer into our blood
and<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.350> richer<00:02:02.250> okay

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
and and richer okay

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.819 
and and richer okay
mine<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.450> that<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.869> you<00:02:05.320> can't<00:02:05.530> go<00:02:05.619> wrong<00:02:05.770> with

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
mine is that you you can't go wrong with

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.530 
mine is that you you can't go wrong with
green<00:02:06.189> energy<00:02:06.340> can't<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:06.880> mean<00:02:07.030> there's<00:02:07.420> so

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
green energy can't I mean there's so

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.270 
green energy can't I mean there's so
much<00:02:07.659> nutrients<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:08.860> good<00:02:09.039> for<00:02:09.190> you

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
much nutrients in it and so good for you

that and I just brought some examples of
that<00:02:35.590> juices<00:02:36.220> extracting<00:02:37.090> from<00:02:37.390> vegetables

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
that juices extracting from vegetables

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.699 
that juices extracting from vegetables
and<00:02:38.440> fruits<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.489> can<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.120> help

and fruits so that you can it will help
transfer<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.830> oxygen<00:02:41.860> faster<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.670> helped

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
transfer the oxygen faster it helped

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.059 
transfer the oxygen faster it helped
make<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.120> more<00:02:43.330> efficient<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.049> your<00:02:44.530> blood<00:02:44.709> so

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
keeping it pure so what that means is

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.930 
keeping it pure so what that means is
like<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.930> get<00:02:47.049> like<00:02:47.230> juice<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:48.160> um<00:02:48.430> I

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
juices that say that they're juice but

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
juices that say that they're juice but
really<00:02:52.870> only<00:02:53.049> 10%<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.860> actually<00:02:54.310> extracted

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
really only 10% is actually extracted

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.880 
really only 10% is actually extracted
and<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.239> rest<00:02:55.390> is<00:02:55.569> all<00:02:55.690> sugars<00:02:56.440> or<00:02:56.650> water

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
and the rest is all sugars or water

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.589 
and the rest is all sugars or water
exactly<00:02:57.519> chosen<00:02:58.150> all<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.390> stuff<00:02:58.569> so

so<00:03:04.690> then<00:03:04.840> we<00:03:04.959> get<00:03:05.080> into<00:03:05.380> kind<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.340> more

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
so then we get into kind of the more

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.849 
so then we get into kind of the more
complexing<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.480> iron<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.230> we're<00:03:08.470> Erin

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
complexing of the iron so we're Erin

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.140 
complexing of the iron so we're Erin

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
let's get back to it

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.390 
let's get back to it
e12<00:03:42.700> Franklin<00:03:43.690> cheese<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.170> eggs<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.620> for

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
e12 Franklin cheese and eggs and for

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.099 
e12 Franklin cheese and eggs and for
those<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:46.000> choose<00:03:46.299> not<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.870> eat<00:03:46.900> eggs

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
those that that choose not to eat eggs

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.059 
those that that choose not to eat eggs
or<00:03:47.260> or<00:03:47.440> dairy

or or dairy
then<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.579> can<00:03:48.730> use<00:03:48.850> soy<00:03:49.060> okay<00:03:49.569> well<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.139> that

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
then you can use soy okay well so that

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.410 
then you can use soy okay well so that
so<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.500> will<00:03:50.739> help<00:03:50.859> again<00:03:51.329> transfer<00:03:52.329> the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
so that will help again transfer the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.090 
so that will help again transfer the
oxygen<00:03:52.450> making<00:03:53.139> more<00:03:53.319> enriching<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.889> stuff

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
oxygen making more enriching and stuff

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.620 
oxygen making more enriching and stuff
okay<00:03:54.370> transfer<00:03:54.819> to<00:03:54.910> your<00:03:55.000> muscles<00:03:55.359> as<00:03:55.480> well

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
okay transfer to your muscles as well

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.660 
okay transfer to your muscles as well
okay<00:03:56.019> and<00:03:56.170> then<00:03:56.380> we<00:03:56.500> have<00:03:56.650> copper<00:03:57.130> actually

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
okay and then we have copper actually

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.460 
okay and then we have copper actually
which<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:58.000> found<00:03:58.269> is<00:03:58.540> interesting<00:03:59.019> copper

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
which I found is interesting copper

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.949 
which I found is interesting copper
copper<00:03:59.739> like<00:04:00.250> copper<00:04:00.639> and<00:04:00.790> there<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.450> almonds

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
copper like copper and there is almonds

in<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.310> research<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.850> know<00:04:06.970> but<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.750> does<00:04:07.900> it

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
in the research I know but it does it

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.240 
in the research I know but it does it
helps<00:04:08.290> transfer<00:04:08.620> all<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.739> oxygen<00:04:08.980> to<00:04:09.130> the

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
helps transfer all the oxygen to the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.309 
helps transfer all the oxygen to the
muscles<00:04:09.609> so<00:04:09.670> as<00:04:10.030> an<00:04:10.329> athlete<00:04:10.690> your<00:04:10.870> training

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
is and P right exactly but they're those

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.370 
is and P right exactly but they're those
that<00:04:17.720> really<00:04:17.810> now<00:04:18.260> hey<00:04:18.530> now<00:04:18.680> how<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:19.040> coca-cola

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
that really now hey now how is coca-cola

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.170 
that really now hey now how is coca-cola
oxygen<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.770> know<00:04:21.890> good<00:04:22.250> good<00:04:22.580> for<00:04:22.730> us<00:04:22.850> it's

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
oxygen you know good good for us it's

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.420 
oxygen you know good good for us it's
not<00:04:23.360> okay<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:23.690> these<00:04:23.990> are<00:04:24.050> oxygen<00:04:24.710> depleting

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
not okay so these are oxygen depleting

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.150 
not okay so these are oxygen depleting
correct<00:04:26.060> so<00:04:26.360> they're<00:04:26.570> no<00:04:26.720> no's<00:04:27.050> very<00:04:27.860> under
