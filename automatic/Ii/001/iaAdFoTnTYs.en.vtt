00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
bigger except for the butter bush tomato

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.889 
bigger except for the butter bush tomato
oh<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.500> bush<00:01:40.979> tomato<00:01:41.479> it<00:01:42.479> might<00:01:42.720> be

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
oh not so good bush tomato it might be

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.539 
oh not so good bush tomato it might be
the<00:01:43.020> only<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.100> guy<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the only one that that's this guy in the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.370 
the only one that that's this guy in the
center<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.930> might<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.290> only

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
center here I think it might be the only

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990 
center here I think it might be the only
one<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.770> bought<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> specifically<00:01:47.729> for

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
one that we bought that specifically for

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
one that we bought that specifically for
containers<00:01:48.509> jail<00:01:49.189> maybe<00:01:50.189> that's<00:01:50.430> why<00:01:50.610> it's

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
containers jail maybe that's why it's

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
containers jail maybe that's why it's
staying<00:01:51.119> diminutive<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.259> maybe<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
staying diminutive I don't know maybe it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.580 
staying diminutive I don't know maybe it
doesn't<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.610> lot<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.880> sense<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
doesn't make a lot of sense and then the

know hopefully ask people to I try and
identify<00:02:20.620> things<00:02:21.360> these<00:02:22.360> are<00:02:22.510> maybe<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.959> the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
identify things these are maybe like the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.570 
identify things these are maybe like the
first<00:02:23.319> leaves<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.010> maybe<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.310> don't<00:02:24.400> look

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
first leaves so maybe they don't look

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.949 
first leaves so maybe they don't look
like<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.940> rest<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.209> the<00:02:25.330> leaves<00:02:25.540> look<00:02:25.629> like

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
like the rest of the leaves look like

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.720 
like the rest of the leaves look like
but<00:02:26.260> at<00:02:26.830> least<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.099> can<00:02:27.250> point<00:02:27.430> out<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.610> couple

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
but at least I can point out a couple

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.210 
but at least I can point out a couple
different<00:02:28.299> varieties<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:28.930> thing<00:02:29.410> here<00:02:30.190> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
different varieties of thing here that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.339 
different varieties of thing here that
are<00:02:30.489> different<00:02:30.760> we<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:31.870> these<00:02:32.049> guys

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
are different we have these guys

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
and what do we have a whole bunch of

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.809 
and what do we have a whole bunch of

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
these guys you know this is probably

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.030 
these guys you know this is probably
like<00:02:49.030> way<00:02:49.269> too<00:02:49.329> soon<00:02:49.690> for<00:02:49.930> anybody<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.319> to

like way too soon for anybody to to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.900 
like way too soon for anybody to to
recognize<00:02:51.549> any<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.870> these<00:02:52.989> things<00:02:53.319> I<00:02:54.160> can

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
recognize any of these things I can

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.940 
recognize any of these things I can
recognize<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.269> Mona<00:02:55.599> you<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.290> recognize<00:02:56.709> one

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
recognize a Mona you can recognize one

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.369 
recognize a Mona you can recognize one
of<00:02:56.980> them<00:02:57.480> which<00:02:58.480> point<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.079> one<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.319> you

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
of them which point to the one that you

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.420 
of them which point to the one that you
recognize<00:02:59.980> these<00:03:00.940> these<00:03:01.540> little<00:03:01.870> tall<00:03:02.430> guys

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
recognize these these little tall guys

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.240 
recognize these these little tall guys
these<00:03:03.819> little<00:03:04.090> tall<00:03:04.329> guys<00:03:04.540> yeah<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.620> think<00:03:06.010> I

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
these little tall guys yeah so I think I

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.589 
these little tall guys yeah so I think I
have<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.400> theory<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.790> what<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.390> might<00:03:07.569> be

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
have a theory of what that one might be

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.890 
have a theory of what that one might be
as<00:03:07.900> well<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.290> little<00:03:08.410> stringy<00:03:08.890> guy<00:03:09.720> but<00:03:10.720> let

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
as well this little stringy guy but let

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.030 
as well this little stringy guy but let
us<00:03:10.930> know<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.380> comments<00:03:11.799> if<00:03:11.889> you<00:03:12.010> have
