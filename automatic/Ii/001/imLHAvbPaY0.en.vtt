00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.160
 like everyone I like 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.170
 obviously today among others the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.269
 presentation of the assembly table 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.339
 so that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 it is a massage table so rare 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:24.390
 what's this in your studio 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.650
 ringer so this one you had me so 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.449
 this is the new series of jimmy choo 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.559
 the components have been changed from 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.739
 better quality then we will start 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:39.840
 so where we have a small transfer 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 lessons there is for the volume of 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.989
 helmet 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 we know how to do it so it rolls there 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.000
 it's all volume knob so there 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 the knob but microphone volume a handsome 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.560
 blow there we can blame 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:00.360
 microbes or in xl'r or road 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.570
 jack so their second one so there 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.309
 the microphone gain we will not be big 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.420
 thing that we have another later here 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.509
 but here we are between is paid to 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.240
 finally stereo inputs 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.369
 so we have four 4 years left there so 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.939
 I do not really know what it's used for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.200
 no info that was real rumba or 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.709
 always enough to eat the kids 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 back but I pass on years left 

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.060
 shit if to connect children 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.389
 so there the left speaker and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.889
 right 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.889
 this is to avenge 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:40.270
 meet at 15 simply is there and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.689
 600 to connect an effect 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.640
 training in Qatar 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.570
 so we have a skin late to change 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.220
 microphone point 2 of the line 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:56.299
 the deÃ»le m34 name of that one of the year 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:01.060
 5 6 2 it's the beauty of the c8 and the 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:04.189
 9th then we have some pot'arts 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 bass and treble only for 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:12.110
 the microphones so here we have the pann 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.810
 so the pal button is for the 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.950
 his is either right or left 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 observation is pretty cool we can 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.050
 make nice effects and the fx is 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.410
 for when this guy 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.960
 different boxes at home next 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.020
 that's fine on the island came in 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.050
 normal so the sound is exactly a 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.780
 sure thing chiappa the settings knob 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.780
 schools prefer the stars SRI simon 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.660
 So that's about all 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.000
 So I bought this word sale 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.370
 I think I bought 80 euros it must 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.140
 to be it goes up behind a USB cord 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.830
 so there it looks like connecting it to a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.140
 computer 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.510
 so I never tested because I have 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.120
 not useful but it must be that one 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.200
 can do some good things france 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.860
 so if we do not have terms 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:18.880
 of power so wait I just 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:19.480
 saucer is just because I have a 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.220
 own life 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.220
 so here it is a catch like that 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:36.220
 not very practical while lacking 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:39.010
 then this dog son a transformer with 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.959
 spike so after barca plugged into 10 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:50.410
 homeland so she is practically done 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:52.780
 all metal practically but she's 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.830
 not so heavy as it makes 2 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.590
 3 kg we do not find it very heavy so 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.390
 here are very good tables e orchestra 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.310
 studio if you do not mix or you 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.140
 are I just computer frankly 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.520
 I advise you there is enough 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.470
 of entry because there I can still 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.430
 put two more computers my platinum 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.959
 laser on it even more 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.889
 another entry does not use the 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.610
 frankly the lions after you have the 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.790
 wildlife the series finally not the series the 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.169
 model put two usb so there you have 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.070
 wanted to have only two microphone inputs 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.410
 young had 4 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.910
 I had no microphone it's true 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.860
 only after later tonight may have been 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.250
 a disadvantage but for the moment 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.470
 so that's it if you plan to 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.270
 buy microphones after take it 1002 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.919
 because there are four microphone inputs 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.360
 not against the price would be a little 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.490
 more expensive tomorrow that's what is 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.850
 pity 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.800
 so here is so very good table I the 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:05:00.530
 recommend but also so 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:05:02.930
 then one will even find all my marabout 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:10.880
 that there is a led power so that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:14.940
 light up 9 in gold here so we have it 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:18.910
 is viewing 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.010
 here and next for another 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.390
 video and who is on my little bitch 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.490
 I missed the mans land that's all that 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.760
 it's good it's always fun 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.760
