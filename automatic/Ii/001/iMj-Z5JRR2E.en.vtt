if I sound different or congested or

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180 
if I sound different or congested or
anything<00:02:18.390> I've<00:02:18.540> been<00:02:18.720> sick<00:02:19.080> all<00:02:19.319> week<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:20.040> I'm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
anything I've been sick all week and I'm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.110 
anything I've been sick all week and I'm
just<00:02:20.580> getting<00:02:20.970> over<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.270> cold<00:02:21.390> here<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.730> yeah

just getting over a cold here but yeah
so<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.319> main<00:02:25.530> thing<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.920> noticed<00:02:26.250> right<00:02:26.310> off

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
so so the main thing I noticed right off

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.490 
so so the main thing I noticed right off
the<00:02:26.760> bat<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.209> when<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.480> get<00:02:27.630> into<00:02:27.810> an<00:02:28.080> online

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the bat is when you get into an online

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
the bat is when you get into an online
game<00:02:28.800> or<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.130> lobby<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.660> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
game or a lobby you know in the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.980 
game or a lobby you know in the
matchmaking<00:02:30.990> part<00:02:31.740> of<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:33.270> still<00:02:33.720> does<00:02:33.960> not

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
matchmaking part of it it still does not

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.890 
matchmaking part of it it still does not
show<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.070> record<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.940> your<00:02:36.090> opponent<00:02:36.600> which<00:02:36.720> I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
show the record of your opponent which I

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.720 
show the record of your opponent which I
think<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:37.260> be<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.440> nice<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.370> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
think would be really nice to see you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.000 
think would be really nice to see you
know<00:02:38.850> similar<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.480> how<00:02:39.600> NCAA<00:02:40.230> football<00:02:40.800> has

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
know similar to how NCAA football has

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.840 
know similar to how NCAA football has
done<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.460> and<00:02:42.500> previous<00:02:43.500> matted<00:02:43.950> titles<00:02:44.370> not

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
done it and previous matted titles not

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.290 
done it and previous matted titles not
including<00:02:45.420> last<00:02:45.600> year's<00:02:45.840> game<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:47.150> like<00:02:48.150> I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
including last year's game but like I

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.240 
including last year's game but like I
said<00:02:48.360> previous<00:02:48.960> titles<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.560> usually<00:02:49.770> showed

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
said previous titles have usually showed

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.340 
said previous titles have usually showed
it<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:51.060> some<00:02:51.240> reason<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.750> don't<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:52.200> if

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it and for some reason I don't know if

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.560 
it and for some reason I don't know if
it's<00:02:52.500> just<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.860> early<00:02:53.220> release<00:02:53.400> hoping<00:02:54.270> so

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
it's just the early release hoping so

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.050 
it's just the early release hoping so
but<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.440> also<00:02:55.590> doesn't<00:02:56.070> show<00:02:56.250> your<00:02:56.460> opponent's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
but it also doesn't show your opponent's

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.120 
but it also doesn't show your opponent's
I<00:02:57.240> did<00:02:57.660> not<00:02:57.840> finish<00:02:58.080> percentage<00:02:58.770> which<00:02:58.980> is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
I did not finish percentage which is

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.850 
I did not finish percentage which is
really<00:02:59.340> horrible<00:02:59.640> because<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:01.380> know<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:01.710> you

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
really horrible because you know if you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.130 
really horrible because you know if you
eat<00:03:02.190> jump<00:03:02.460> into<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.820> lobby<00:03:03.150> against<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.930> person

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
eat jump into a lobby against a person

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.830 
eat jump into a lobby against a person
who's<00:03:04.530> got<00:03:04.740> a<00:03:04.770> 75-percent<00:03:05.700> DN<00:03:06.270> a--<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.660> don't

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
who's got a 75-percent DN a-- you don't

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.540 
who's got a 75-percent DN a-- you don't
want<00:03:07.020> to<00:03:07.110> play<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.320> game<00:03:07.560> because<00:03:08.100> it's<00:03:08.310> you

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
want to play that game because it's you

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.550 
want to play that game because it's you
know<00:03:08.580> he's<00:03:08.880> most<00:03:09.120> likely<00:03:09.240> gonna<00:03:09.660> quit<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.350> I

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
know he's most likely gonna quit so I

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.830 
know he's most likely gonna quit so I
really<00:03:11.460> really<00:03:11.730> hope<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.090> that's<00:03:12.240> just<00:03:12.540> part

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
really really hope that that's just part

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.350 
really really hope that that's just part
of<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.220> season<00:03:14.220> ticket<00:03:14.670> part<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.090> it<00:03:15.210> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
of the season ticket part of it the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.240 
of the season ticket part of it the
early<00:03:15.690> release<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.710> will<00:03:16.920> be<00:03:17.100> on

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
early release and that that will be on

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.110 
early release and that that will be on
the<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.940> full<00:03:18.150> game<00:03:18.420> once<00:03:18.750> that<00:03:18.960> drops

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
the the full game once that drops

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.690 
the the full game once that drops
another<00:03:21.120> thing<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.600> noticed<00:03:21.990> was<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.700> onside

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
another thing I noticed was the onside

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.500 
another thing I noticed was the onside
kicks<00:03:24.120> when<00:03:24.630> your<00:03:24.810> opponent<00:03:25.260> selects<00:03:25.650> one<00:03:26.510> it

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
kicks when your opponent selects one it

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.210 
kicks when your opponent selects one it
doesn't<00:03:27.930> tell<00:03:28.080> you<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.470> they're<00:03:28.650> an<00:03:28.770> onside

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
doesn't tell you that they're an onside

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.940 
doesn't tell you that they're an onside
kick<00:03:29.250> formation<00:03:30.180> which<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.450> last<00:03:31.170> man<00:03:31.590> did

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
kick formation which the last man did

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.500 
kick formation which the last man did
not<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.610> right<00:03:32.820> away<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.180> i<00:03:33.390> believe

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
not do that right away but i believe

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.630 
not do that right away but i believe
they<00:03:33.930> patched<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.560> or<00:03:34.680> made<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.220> did

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
they patched it or made it so that did

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.480 
they patched it or made it so that did
work<00:03:35.880> out<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:37.350> that's<00:03:37.560> another<00:03:37.920> thing<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.460> I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
work out so that's another thing that I

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.100 
work out so that's another thing that I
noticed<00:03:38.940> they<00:03:39.060> don't<00:03:39.240> show<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.600> when<00:03:39.960> your

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
noticed they don't show you when your

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.170 
noticed they don't show you when your
opponent's<00:03:40.590> outside<00:03:41.040> kicking<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:42.000> some

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
opponent's outside kicking and for some

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.820 
opponent's outside kicking and for some
reason<00:03:42.210> I<00:03:42.630> always<00:03:42.660> seem<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.290> forget<00:03:43.620> how<00:03:43.800> to

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
reason I always seem to forget how to

there and here you see we give up a
touchdown<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.530> believe<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.560> tied<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.040> score

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
touchdown I believe that tied the score

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.800 
touchdown I believe that tied the score
14<00:04:03.000> apiece<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.920> i<00:04:05.040> somehow<00:04:05.819> missed<00:04:06.330> even

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
14 apiece and i somehow missed even

Madden's<00:05:10.939> and<00:05:11.990> you<00:05:12.990> know<00:05:13.139> not<00:05:13.319> that<00:05:13.379> I

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
Madden's and you know not that I

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.619 
Madden's and you know not that I
disliked<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.249> game<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.819> I'm<00:05:15.210> sure<00:05:15.419> it'll

00:05:15.619 --> 00:05:15.629 
disliked the game and I'm sure it'll

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.089 
disliked the game and I'm sure it'll
have<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.960> just<00:05:16.139> grow<00:05:16.319> on<00:05:16.469> me<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.710> little<00:05:16.889> more

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
have to just grow on me a little more

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:19.519 
have to just grow on me a little more
but<00:05:17.279> everything<00:05:17.699> seems<00:05:17.999> a<00:05:18.180> lot<00:05:18.360> slower<00:05:18.659> the

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
but everything seems a lot slower the

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.409 
but everything seems a lot slower the
players<00:05:19.830> seem<00:05:20.189> to<00:05:20.219> move<00:05:20.490> more<00:05:20.550> stiff<00:05:21.180> when

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
players seem to move more stiff when

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.029 
players seem to move more stiff when
you're<00:05:21.569> trying<00:05:21.779> to<00:05:21.900> run<00:05:22.139> with<00:05:22.349> a<00:05:22.379> quarterback

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
you're trying to run with a quarterback

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.619 
you're trying to run with a quarterback
it<00:05:23.759> just<00:05:24.090> doesn't<00:05:24.330> feel<00:05:24.629> natural<00:05:25.999> so<00:05:26.999> I<00:05:27.330> really

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:27.629 
it just doesn't feel natural so I really

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.749 
it just doesn't feel natural so I really
don't<00:05:27.749> like<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.259> motions<00:05:28.770> or<00:05:28.949> the<00:05:29.099> game<00:05:29.340> speed

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.119 
don't like the motions or the game speed
yet<00:05:30.360> but<00:05:30.689> maybe<00:05:30.900> I<00:05:31.050> just<00:05:31.289> need<00:05:31.499> to<00:05:31.620> adjust<00:05:31.770> to

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
yet but maybe I just need to adjust to

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:33.649 
yet but maybe I just need to adjust to
them<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.580> I'm<00:05:32.729> not<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:32.939> type<00:05:33.240> of<00:05:33.300> player

that<00:05:49.169> I<00:05:49.199> had<00:05:49.379> a<00:05:49.409> huge<00:05:49.800> problem<00:05:50.460> with<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:51.379> by

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
that I had a huge problem with and by

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.019 
that I had a huge problem with and by
the<00:05:52.439> way<00:05:52.680> you<00:05:53.279> know<00:05:53.400> I<00:05:53.430> haven't<00:05:53.639> been<00:05:53.819> paying

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
the way you know I haven't been paying

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:55.969 
the way you know I haven't been paying
attention<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.749> video<00:05:55.050> but<00:05:55.289> I<00:05:55.319> think<00:05:55.710> that

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
attention to the video but I think that

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.200 
attention to the video but I think that
was<00:05:56.249> my<00:05:56.580> ah<00:05:57.499> boy<00:05:58.499> I<00:05:58.830> mom<00:05:59.370> forgetting<00:06:00.029> what<00:06:00.180> i

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210

did<00:06:00.419> here<00:06:00.449> but<00:06:00.749> i<00:06:00.779> think<00:06:01.050> that<00:06:01.199> was<00:06:01.319> my<00:06:01.499> second

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:04.570 
did here but i think that was my second
userpic<00:06:02.490> so<00:06:02.729> I<00:06:02.759> got<00:06:02.969> both<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.210> my<00:06:03.449> user<00:06:03.629> picks

userpic so I got both of my user picks

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.700 
userpic so I got both of my user picks

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
this game and I was happy I was

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.209 
this game and I was happy I was
recording<00:06:09.419> that<00:06:09.749> but<00:06:10.439> I'm<00:06:10.590> yeah<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:10.949> drop

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
recording that but I'm yeah the drop

passes<00:06:11.699> from<00:06:11.819> the<00:06:11.909> demo<00:06:12.389> haven't<00:06:12.900> really<00:06:13.139> been

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
passes from the demo haven't really been

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.309 
passes from the demo haven't really been
a<00:06:13.319> big<00:06:13.379> problem<00:06:13.800> yet<00:06:14.509> it<00:06:15.509> really<00:06:15.930> could<00:06:16.289> be

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
a big problem yet it really could be

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.219 
a big problem yet it really could be
because<00:06:16.830> I<00:06:17.580> play<00:06:18.180> against<00:06:18.599> the<00:06:18.749> computer<00:06:18.779> on

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
because I play against the computer on

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.320 
because I play against the computer on
all<00:06:19.499> med<00:06:19.770> and<00:06:19.979> then<00:06:20.129> these<00:06:20.249> online<00:06:20.550> games<00:06:21.089> are

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
all med and then these online games are

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.269 
all med and then these online games are
on<00:06:21.360> all<00:06:21.689> pro<00:06:22.110> so<00:06:22.439> they're<00:06:22.620> less<00:06:22.800> likely<00:06:22.830> to

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 
on all pro so they're less likely to

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.119 
on all pro so they're less likely to
drop

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
drop

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.429 
drop
is<00:06:24.239> but<00:06:25.239> we'll<00:06:25.389> see<00:06:25.629> because<00:06:25.809> I<00:06:25.959> do<00:06:26.050> plan<00:06:26.409> on

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
is but we'll see because I do plan on

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.339 
is but we'll see because I do plan on
doing<00:06:26.889> a<00:06:26.979> connected<00:06:27.489> careers<00:06:27.989> series<00:06:28.989> for<00:06:29.229> you

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
doing a connected careers series for you

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.439 
doing a connected careers series for you
guys<00:06:29.529> which<00:06:30.129> will<00:06:30.339> end<00:06:30.489> up<00:06:30.639> being<00:06:30.909> basically<00:06:31.330> a

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:31.449 
guys which will end up being basically a

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.809 
guys which will end up being basically a
franchise<00:06:32.050> with<00:06:33.009> the<00:06:33.159> Philadelphia<00:06:33.759> Eagles

things<00:07:02.110> like<00:07:02.289> that<00:07:02.349> I<00:07:02.559> think<00:07:02.709> it<00:07:03.129> and<00:07:04.059> I<00:07:04.719> kind

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
things like that I think it and I kind

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.299 
things like that I think it and I kind
of<00:07:05.229> noticed<00:07:05.379> it<00:07:05.679> like<00:07:05.800> on<00:07:05.979> the<00:07:06.069> first

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:06.309 
of noticed it like on the first

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.159 
of noticed it like on the first
touchdown<00:07:06.580> pass<00:07:07.059> that<00:07:07.330> I<00:07:07.360> had<00:07:07.569> in<00:07:07.719> this<00:07:07.809> video

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:08.169 
touchdown pass that I had in this video

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:09.689 
touchdown pass that I had in this video
if<00:07:08.349> you<00:07:08.469> want<00:07:08.649> to<00:07:08.709> rewind<00:07:08.979> and<00:07:09.189> check<00:07:09.429> it<00:07:09.550> out

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:09.699 
if you want to rewind and check it out

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.549 
if you want to rewind and check it out
but<00:07:09.939> I<00:07:09.969> feel<00:07:10.240> like<00:07:10.269> that<00:07:10.719> it<00:07:11.259> gives<00:07:11.469> you

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:11.559 
but I feel like that it gives you

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:14.820 
but I feel like that it gives you
control<00:07:11.740> the<00:07:12.279> hit<00:07:13.179> receivers<00:07:13.779> who<00:07:13.959> may<00:07:14.589> not

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
control the hit receivers who may not

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.619 
control the hit receivers who may not
necessarily<00:07:15.039> be<00:07:15.639> open<00:07:16.059> but<00:07:16.179> if<00:07:16.300> you<00:07:16.419> give<00:07:16.599> them

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:16.629 
necessarily be open but if you give them

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:19.439 
necessarily be open but if you give them
like<00:07:16.990> a<00:07:17.019> pass<00:07:17.319> lead<00:07:17.679> forward<00:07:18.279> where<00:07:19.240> there's

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:19.449 
like a pass lead forward where there's

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:21.989 
like a pass lead forward where there's
open<00:07:19.839> space<00:07:20.069> you<00:07:21.069> know<00:07:21.189> kind<00:07:21.490> of<00:07:21.550> like<00:07:21.610> over

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:21.999 
open space you know kind of like over

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:24.600 
open space you know kind of like over
shoulder<00:07:22.449> throws<00:07:22.899> I<00:07:23.379> just<00:07:24.069> gives<00:07:24.279> you<00:07:24.399> more

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
shoulder throws I just gives you more

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.459 
shoulder throws I just gives you more
flexibility<00:07:25.329> in<00:07:25.479> the<00:07:25.569> passing<00:07:26.019> game<00:07:26.050> but<00:07:26.379> it

00:07:26.459 --> 00:07:26.469 
flexibility in the passing game but it

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:28.409 
flexibility in the passing game but it
also<00:07:26.649> makes<00:07:27.009> it<00:07:27.279> in<00:07:27.429> my<00:07:27.699> opinion<00:07:28.059> it<00:07:28.269> looks

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
also makes it in my opinion it looks

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:29.399 
also makes it in my opinion it looks
like<00:07:28.569> it's<00:07:28.749> going<00:07:28.869> to<00:07:28.959> be<00:07:29.050> a<00:07:29.079> little<00:07:29.289> more

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.409 
like it's going to be a little more

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:32.549 
like it's going to be a little more
difficult<00:07:30.399> to<00:07:30.909> get<00:07:31.089> user<00:07:31.329> interceptions<00:07:32.259> like

00:07:32.549 --> 00:07:32.559 
difficult to get user interceptions like

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:35.069
