00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
however this is kind of a neat thing

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.290 
however this is kind of a neat thing
it's<00:00:32.920> a<00:00:33.130> program<00:00:33.820> we're<00:00:33.940> using<00:00:34.090> right<00:00:34.270> now

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
it's a program we're using right now

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.500 
it's a program we're using right now
called<00:00:34.629> crazy<00:00:34.960> talk<00:00:35.290> 5<00:00:35.620> and<00:00:36.270> well<00:00:37.270> you

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
probably can't believe it this is

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.040 
probably can't believe it this is
actually<00:00:39.370> just<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.670> still<00:00:40.000> photo<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.870> we've

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
actually just a still photo that we've

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.889 
actually just a still photo that we've
brought<00:00:41.320> into<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:41.829> program<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.750> also

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
brought into this program and we also

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.979 
brought into this program and we also
recorded<00:00:44.469> my<00:00:44.559> voice<00:00:44.590> separately<00:00:45.250> and<00:00:45.899> put<00:00:46.899> it

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
recorded my voice separately and put it

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.709 
recorded my voice separately and put it
in<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.320> it<00:00:47.469> automatically<00:00:48.600> created<00:00:49.600> this

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
in and it automatically created this

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.650 
in and it automatically created this
moving<00:00:50.320> image<00:00:50.649> of<00:00:50.860> my<00:00:51.010> face<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.760> head<00:00:52.180> that

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
moving image of my face and head that

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.049 
moving image of my face and head that
wasn't<00:00:53.050> creepy<00:00:53.440> at<00:00:53.590> all<00:00:53.620> well<00:00:54.550> maybe<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.910> little

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
wasn't creepy at all well maybe a little

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.849 
wasn't creepy at all well maybe a little
bit<00:00:55.210> creepy<00:00:55.570> cuz<00:00:55.750> maybe<00:00:55.989> I'm<00:00:56.230> a<00:00:56.260> little<00:00:56.379> creepy

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
bit creepy cuz maybe I'm a little creepy

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.819 
bit creepy cuz maybe I'm a little creepy
but<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.640> it's<00:00:58.270> freaking<00:00:58.750> amazing<00:00:58.809> like<00:00:59.469> it

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
but it's it's freaking amazing like it

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.279 
but it's it's freaking amazing like it
it<00:01:00.100> actually<00:01:00.460> has<00:01:00.760> lip<00:01:01.030> syncing<00:01:01.480> capabilities

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
it actually has lip syncing capabilities

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.560 
it actually has lip syncing capabilities
so<00:01:02.829> it's<00:01:02.980> actually<00:01:03.150> syncing<00:01:04.150> up<00:01:04.239> what<00:01:04.480> I'm

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
so it's actually syncing up what I'm

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.030 
so it's actually syncing up what I'm
saying<00:01:04.870> with<00:01:05.050> my<00:01:05.170> lips<00:01:05.379> and<00:01:05.500> making<00:01:05.740> my<00:01:05.800> lips

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
saying with my lips and making my lips

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.590 
saying with my lips and making my lips
move<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.580> again<00:01:06.910> this<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.150> just<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.390> still

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
move and again this is just a still

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.120 
move and again this is just a still
photo<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.930> can<00:01:08.020> see<00:01:08.110> my<00:01:08.230> my<00:01:08.710> eyes<00:01:08.890> are

turn<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.390> off<00:02:26.570> here<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.350> mean<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.310> guess

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
turn this off here so I mean I guess

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.250 
turn this off here so I mean I guess
there's<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:29.000> few<00:02:29.270> different<00:02:29.330> applications<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
there's a few different applications you

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.230 
there's a few different applications you
know<00:02:30.350> some<00:02:30.530> people<00:02:30.560> are<00:02:30.800> using<00:02:31.220> this<00:02:31.460> for<00:02:31.760> for

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
know some people are using this for for

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.560 
know some people are using this for for
training<00:02:33.730> tutorials<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.880> stuff<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:35.180> website

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
training tutorials and stuff on website

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.940 
training tutorials and stuff on website
so<00:02:35.690> basically<00:02:36.080> again<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.530> just<00:02:36.560> take<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
so basically again you just take the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.530 
so basically again you just take the
still<00:02:37.490> image<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.880> just<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.120> someone<00:02:38.330> come

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
still image and just have someone come

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.210 
still image and just have someone come
in<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.660> do<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> voiceover<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.620> it'll

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
in and do a voiceover and it'll

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.470 
in and do a voiceover and it'll
automatically<00:02:40.640> marry<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.060> all<00:02:41.300> together

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
automatically marry that all together

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.450 
automatically marry that all together
and<00:02:41.870> create<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.260> kind<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.530> moving<00:02:42.860> face<00:02:43.160> and

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
and create this kind of moving face and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.950 
and create this kind of moving face and
you<00:02:43.580> can<00:02:43.700> create<00:02:43.880> little<00:02:44.060> short<00:02:44.450> stories<00:02:44.870> in

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
you can create little short stories in

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.900 
you can create little short stories in
little<00:02:45.140> mini<00:02:45.290> movies<00:02:45.620> too<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.520> mean<00:02:46.700> one

thing<00:02:46.940> you're<00:02:47.180> going<00:02:47.270> to<00:02:47.360> ask<00:02:47.570> yourself<00:02:47.780> is<00:02:48.140> is

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
thing you're going to ask yourself is is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.980 
thing you're going to ask yourself is is
this<00:02:48.590> an<00:02:48.800> alternative<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:50.420> know<00:02:50.540> shooting

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
this an alternative to you know shooting

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.420 
this an alternative to you know shooting
a<00:02:51.110> regular<00:02:51.500> corporate<00:02:51.770> video<00:02:52.130> or<00:02:52.340> something

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
angle that you kind of take with this is

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.460 
angle that you kind of take with this is
it's<00:02:55.520> very<00:02:55.610> unique<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.540> mean<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:56.900> can<00:02:57.050> get<00:02:57.230> some
