00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:09.790
 today we will show one of the ways 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:12.320
 from torsion bolts with damage slot 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.420
 we will conduct an experiment on planers 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.220
 makita a few bolts we managed 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.810
 unscrew 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.300
 on two bolts the slot was torn down here we are 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.670
 trying to unscrew it with 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.670
 allen key key rotates 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.920
 bolts can not be unmounted because 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.139
 what we didn't have at hand 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.989
 extractors we decided 

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:50.739
 weld these hex bolts 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:55.989
 keys and so unscrew them and 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:59.329
 called the planer welding process we lowered 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:03.159
 here are the keys welded to the bolts and we 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.159
 safely unscrew the bolts 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.259
 Inverter welding 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.520
 electrode triad current welding 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.270
 90 amps of welding space was set 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.270
 closed non - flammable material 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.520
 negative wire welder you 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.899
 connected directly to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.259
 hex key 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:30.719
 so we created an outline 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.600
 welding current flow from the bolt 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.000
 through the key bypassing the winding 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.140
 the electric motor is thus we protected 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.319
 motor winding from welding 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.319
 current 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.100
 after replacing knives 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.979
 conduct final inspection 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.630
 make sure that the new bolts will not be 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.119
 to touch 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.580
 about the workpiece we are here 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:05.570
 we twist the shaft and see that the bolts 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.570
 quietly undergoing repair is over
