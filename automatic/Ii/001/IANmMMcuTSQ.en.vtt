anyways<00:01:13.310> back<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.939> regularly<00:01:14.450> scheduled

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
anyways back to the regularly scheduled

anyways back to the regularly scheduled
program<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:16.970> one<00:01:17.150> that<00:01:17.299> has<00:01:17.540> a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
program this is the one that has a

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:43.719 
program this is the one that has a
problem<00:01:19.750> with<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:42.590> still<00:01:42.799> hanging<00:01:43.460> in

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
problem with the it's still hanging in

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:51.790 
problem with the it's still hanging in
there<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.970> what<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:50.630> thought<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.869> would<00:01:51.020> do<00:01:51.319> is

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
there and what I thought I would do is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.580 
there and what I thought I would do is
an<00:01:52.039> earlier<00:01:52.429> do<00:01:53.360> my<00:01:53.479> first<00:01:53.780> attempt<00:01:54.259> at<00:01:54.319> a

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
an earlier do my first attempt at a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.139 
an earlier do my first attempt at a
citrus<00:01:55.100> earlier<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.899> it's<00:01:57.080> hard<00:01:57.229> to<00:01:57.289> decide

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
citrus earlier and it's hard to decide

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.550 
citrus earlier and it's hard to decide
what<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.240> want<00:01:59.450> me<00:01:59.569> to<00:01:59.659> move<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.960> branch<00:02:00.259> but

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
what you want me to move a branch but

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.020 
what you want me to move a branch but
you<00:02:00.649> hate<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.950> even<00:02:01.190> do<00:02:01.340> anything<00:02:01.580> coming

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
you hate to even do anything coming

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.690 
you hate to even do anything coming
around<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.720> tree<00:02:03.069> but<00:02:04.069> this<00:02:04.250> looks<00:02:04.520> like<00:02:04.610> a

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
around the tree but this looks like a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.529 
around the tree but this looks like a
nice<00:02:04.940> straight<00:02:05.360> piece<00:02:05.630> here<00:02:06.080> and<00:02:07.269> you<00:02:08.269> know<00:02:08.390> if

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
nice straight piece here and you know if

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.170 
nice straight piece here and you know if
I<00:02:08.690> ended<00:02:08.959> up<00:02:09.110> losing<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.979> at<00:02:10.310> least<00:02:10.489> I'd<00:02:11.060> get

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
I ended up losing this at least I'd get

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.770 
I ended up losing this at least I'd get
another<00:02:11.420> plant<00:02:12.350> out<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.480> although<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.600> don't

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
another plant out of it although I don't

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.750 
another plant out of it although I don't
know<00:02:14.930> what<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.319> rootstock<00:02:16.069> brings<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
know what the rootstock brings to the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.130 
know what the rootstock brings to the
table<00:02:16.880> I'm<00:02:17.150> sure<00:02:17.360> that<00:02:17.630> different<00:02:17.810> root

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
table I'm sure that different root

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.350 
table I'm sure that different root
stocks<00:02:18.530> are<00:02:19.160> chosen<00:02:19.489> depending<00:02:19.820> on<00:02:20.180> whether

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
stocks are chosen depending on whether

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.420 
stocks are chosen depending on whether
they're<00:02:20.660> going<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.739> grown<00:02:22.070> in<00:02:22.220> California

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
they're going to be grown in California

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.580 
they're going to be grown in California
Arizona<00:02:24.250> Florida<00:02:25.810> one<00:02:26.810> of<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.019> big<00:02:27.230> states

Arizona Florida one of the big states

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.660 
Arizona Florida one of the big states
out<00:02:27.799> for<00:02:28.040> growing<00:02:28.250> citrus<00:02:29.200> but<00:02:30.549> so<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.579> don't

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
out for growing citrus but so I don't

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.069 
out for growing citrus but so I don't
know<00:02:31.940> exactly<00:02:32.870> when<00:02:33.709> you<00:02:33.799> use<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.250> natural

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
know exactly when you use the natural

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.750 
know exactly when you use the natural
roots<00:02:36.079> of<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.950> citrus<00:02:37.400> tree<00:02:39.130> what<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.280> plus<00:02:40.519> and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
roots of a citrus tree what the plus and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.530 
roots of a citrus tree what the plus and
minuses<00:02:41.209> are<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.590> saw<00:02:43.130> I<00:02:43.370> saw<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.609> video<00:02:43.820> on

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
minuses are but I saw I saw a video on

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.170 
minuses are but I saw I saw a video on
YouTube<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.769> just<00:02:46.070> like<00:02:46.280> air<00:02:46.790> layering

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
YouTube and it's just like air layering

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.289 
YouTube and it's just like air layering
the<00:02:47.420> fig<00:02:47.660> tree<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:48.310> just<00:02:49.310> removed<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.880> outside

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
the fig tree I just removed the outside

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.789 
the fig tree I just removed the outside
arc<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.970> put<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> plastic<00:02:53.660> bag<00:02:53.720> tape<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.350> plastic

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
arc and put a plastic bag tape a plastic

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.390 
arc and put a plastic bag tape a plastic
bag<00:02:54.980> around<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.579> fill<00:02:55.880> it<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.120> some<00:02:56.359> soil<00:02:56.390> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
bag around it fill it with some soil and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.920 
bag around it fill it with some soil and
we'll<00:02:58.400> see<00:02:58.640> if<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.299> can<00:02:59.540> can<00:03:00.530> layer<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:02.030> set

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
we'll see if I can can layer this set

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.290 
we'll see if I can can layer this set
Zoomer

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
Zoomer

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.020 
Zoomer
but<00:03:05.930> hopefully<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:07.160> tree<00:03:07.400> itself<00:03:07.730> will

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
but hopefully the the tree itself will

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
but hopefully the the tree itself will
eventually<00:03:08.840> make<00:03:09.710> it<00:03:10.210> if<00:03:11.210> it<00:03:11.330> can<00:03:11.450> heal<00:03:11.660> itself

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
eventually make it if it can heal itself

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.730 
eventually make it if it can heal itself
still<00:03:12.890> don't<00:03:13.070> know<00:03:13.870> what<00:03:14.870> possibly<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.470> going

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
still don't know what possibly is going

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.420 
still don't know what possibly is going
on<00:03:15.860> there<00:03:16.070> whether<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.490> was<00:03:16.900> frost<00:03:17.900> damage

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
on there whether that was frost damage

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.840 
on there whether that was frost damage
cold<00:03:19.430> damage<00:03:20.410> but<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.620> seems<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.310> be<00:03:22.430> trying<00:03:22.700> to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
cold damage but it seems to be trying to

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.270 
cold damage but it seems to be trying to
heal<00:03:23.030> at<00:03:23.720> least<00:03:24.640> so<00:03:25.640> let's<00:03:25.820> do<00:03:25.910> an<00:03:26.030> earlier

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
heal at least so let's do an earlier

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
heal at least so let's do an earlier
make<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.430> chickadees<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> background<00:03:31.300> so

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
make the chickadees in the background so

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.740 
make the chickadees in the background so
I<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.540> baggie<00:03:32.870> then<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.320> can<00:03:34.100> open<00:03:34.750> the

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
I have a baggie then I can open the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:54.780 
I have a baggie then I can open the
other<00:03:35.870> end<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:36.980> can<00:03:37.160> slip<00:03:37.400> this<00:03:37.580> over

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.270 

now<00:03:55.790> watch<00:03:56.000> out<00:03:56.150> for<00:03:56.330> these<00:03:56.450> thorns<00:03:57.069> and<00:03:58.069> I'll

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
now watch out for these thorns and I'll

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:28.020

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.520 

now<00:04:29.030> in<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.240> video<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.540> watch<00:04:29.930> they<00:04:30.200> used<00:04:30.380> a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
now in the video I watch they used a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.910 
now in the video I watch they used a
rooting<00:04:30.860> hormone<00:04:31.040> so<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.610> do<00:04:31.850> have<00:04:32.180> some<00:04:32.480> I

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
rooting hormone so I do have some I

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:43.980 
rooting hormone so I do have some I
think<00:04:33.920> I'll<00:04:34.930> follow<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.200> same<00:04:36.440> procedure<00:04:36.890> I

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:05:02.830

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.629 

well<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.620> was<00:05:03.740> difficult<00:05:04.250> that<00:05:04.370> would<00:05:04.520> have

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
well that was difficult that would have

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.970 
well that was difficult that would have
made<00:05:04.820> the<00:05:05.090> cut<00:05:05.720> further<00:05:06.110> on<00:05:06.410> up<00:05:06.590> to<00:05:06.770> give<00:05:06.950> me

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980
