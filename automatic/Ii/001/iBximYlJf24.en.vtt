00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:15.539

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.410
 7 for 10 total pad in my notebook 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.779
 stopped working and I researched 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.859
 on the internet and I have seen that some 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.929
 asus brand also occurred good is what 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 I did basically to try to find out 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620
 what was 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.900
 I was kind of unintentionally right do not understand 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.280
 a lot of computer but in the midst of 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.160
 on the screen here by the click start button 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.740
 in case the mouse does not work 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.870
 You'll have to keep using the 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.420
 little ones down 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.390

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:07.880

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.880
 device manager only 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.200
 devices are always with this 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:21.450
 because the mouse will not work from a 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:32.280
