00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.450
 you have to lose 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:24.990
 and I go crazy for my team and in 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:29.340
 my heart and history full of passion 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.960
 that make me feel alive when the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.510
 vice president the president be when 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.860
 they called me from the airport there yes me the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.680
 I believed 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.310
 I was asked permission for them the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.930
 victory to the president as is 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.380
 they did not see it as any problem 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.610
 that coincided with the arrival of the manager 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.610
 Blue Cross Sports 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.960
 we invite you as we have done many 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.960
 times to give a regular practice 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.880
 I was offered in the position of director 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.110
 technical not accept it at that time 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.689
 because there were six hours left for a 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.360
 crucial match for national and for 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.580
 the whole institution out of respect for 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.680
 national and risking them 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.620
 they changed the idea 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.290
 on his return to sao paulo he gave them a no 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.780
 resounding 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.140
 and I asked them to let me play the 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.040
 party exploded back and forth and 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.040
 make a decision 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 I made a counterproposal Sao Paulo 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.079
 simple and three points point points 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.780
 one of them how many people could 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.560
 Take Colombians to work with me 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.360
 like all of you our compatriots 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.640
 I think it was a great exercise and it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.979
 did a great job profe give us six 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.950
 titles and help us make the name 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.439
 of the institution at an international level 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.850
 I will not forget the runner-up of the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.619
 South American Cup that I value 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.260
 also as a championship for everything that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.489
 a title was lived at that time and 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.870
 good everything we did at the level 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.250
 what has been done at the international level 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.600
 international that has not been done every 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.700
 bigger time is that what we want 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.700
 do from our guideline 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.709
 the truth I was one of those who criticize 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.540
 a lot and today it hurts me to leave a 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.769
 bit sad 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.280
 although it is a good tea it is almost that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:45.959
 let's say it an opportunity for him to go 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.969
 and deliver abroad what some 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.840
 in average we are part of the heart 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:53.909
 because it is a nest of us always 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.450
 so many titles that gave us so much joy 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:59.099
 of bad moments and then wherever I go 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.290
 I bless it is also very 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.629
 gratifying to know 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.359
 know that wanting also wants to do 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.040
 this in other countries to meet the years of 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.390
 life fulfills many of the dreams of the 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.909
 nhtsa 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.230
 I thought and I thought it was very 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.230
 difficult but not so much 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.580
 national 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.970
