okay Justin here how you're doing in
this<00:00:35.170> lesson<00:00:35.470> today<00:00:35.830> we're<00:00:36.040> going<00:00:36.220> to<00:00:36.310> be

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
this lesson today we're going to be

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.820 
this lesson today we're going to be
looking<00:00:36.640> at<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:36.850> riff<00:00:37.120> for<00:00:37.720> money<00:00:38.170> by<00:00:38.470> Pink

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
looking at the riff for money by Pink

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.010 
looking at the riff for money by Pink
Floyd<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.700> I<00:00:39.820> guess<00:00:40.030> for<00:00:40.300> most<00:00:40.480> people<00:00:40.900> the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
Floyd and I guess for most people the

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.960 
Floyd and I guess for most people the
interesting<00:00:41.470> thing<00:00:41.680> about<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:42.070> riff<00:00:42.340> is<00:00:42.520> the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
interesting thing about this riff is the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.440 
interesting thing about this riff is the
time<00:00:43.270> signature<00:00:43.900> because<00:00:44.260> it's<00:00:44.440> in<00:00:44.700> 7/4<00:00:45.700> now

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
time signature because it's in 7/4 now

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.729 
time signature because it's in 7/4 now
this<00:00:46.630> is<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.900> thing<00:00:47.080> that<00:00:47.110> probably<00:00:47.410> most

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
this is the thing that probably most

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.470 
this is the thing that probably most
people<00:00:48.040> are<00:00:48.280> going<00:00:48.400> to<00:00:48.489> have<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.970> the<00:00:49.000> biggest

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
people are going to have to the biggest

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.180 
people are going to have to the biggest
struggle<00:00:49.840> getting<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.230> grips<00:00:50.470> with<00:00:50.650> and<00:00:50.770> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
struggle getting the grips with and the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.830 
struggle getting the grips with and the
easiest<00:00:51.580> way<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.820> do<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.390> easiest<00:00:52.660> way<00:00:52.809> to

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
easiest way to do it the easiest way to

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.930 
easiest way to do it the easiest way to
start<00:00:53.020> doing<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.590> is<00:00:53.770> to<00:00:54.130> count<00:00:54.489> along<00:00:54.880> with

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
start doing it is to count along with

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.210 
start doing it is to count along with
the<00:00:55.270> track<00:00:55.630> and<00:00:55.900> count<00:00:56.470> along<00:00:56.650> with<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.980> riff

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
a little bit about the count and how to

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.870 
a little bit about the count and how to
count<00:01:05.440> along<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.070> try<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.670> get<00:01:06.790> you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
to count that out and practice counting

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.980 
to count that out and practice counting
the<00:02:23.680> 1<00:02:23.830> 2<00:02:23.980> 3<00:02:24.160> 4<00:02:24.430> 5<00:02:24.580> 6<00:02:24.880> 7<00:02:25.060> along<00:02:25.480> with<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.810> riff

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
part is pretty straightforward

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.270

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
the bar lines so it's not really obvious

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
where one is all the time but if you can

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.340 
where one is all the time but if you can
keep<00:06:29.000> an<00:06:29.180> ear<00:06:29.360> out<00:06:29.479> on<00:06:29.630> the<00:06:29.750> pace<00:06:29.930> you'll<00:06:30.169> get

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
keep an ear out on the pace you'll get

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.750 
keep an ear out on the pace you'll get
there<00:06:30.560> and<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:30.830> will<00:06:31.010> find<00:06:31.310> that<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:31.550> matches

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
there and you will find that it matches

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.610 
there and you will find that it matches
up<00:06:32.060> and<00:06:32.270> you<00:06:32.630> can<00:06:32.780> play<00:06:32.990> through<00:06:33.320> with<00:06:33.500> those
