00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.620
 very good everyone was given someone and 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.689
 we are playing action and reaction this 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.850
 it is the third or fourth time that the 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.470
 We try because I do not know why there is a way 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.750
 free in this game I think it's 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.880
 by one of the players with whom 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.199
 I'm playing but there's free mode and I 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.950
 that we have loaded it in a way 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.800
 very very hardcore before I'm going to put a 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.860
 punch assured this is not necessary 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.300
 ASEJA weapons to kill and is in 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.600
 just holding the gun and doing nothing 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.570
 play this 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.010
 As you can see I'm dressed as a cowboy 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.600
 johnny the tourist and that's because I've 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.310
 been working on the jong chapter 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.560
 and the tourist already tries to upload only 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.990
 this weekend if I can because still 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.370
 it is not finished 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.900
 and good as I played it there and I 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.190
 is the charge and I was watching 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.190
 I'm going to kill you 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.520
 I'm going to get rid of this one and this one and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.650
 that god how many haiti 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.830
 I'm going to go up , god, I'm running 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.980
 my age I saw it coming there is a player 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.730
 in my team good of the three of us that 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.380
 is out there without doing in a day 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.550
 I think I know it just joined 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.440
 because as we have said we have 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.670
 repeated three or four times by 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.270
 three contents 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.950
 I hope not to fight anymore but not fight anymore 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.830
 go to triple-a and with punctuality 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 free mode or if I did not have the mode 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.909
 of government would not make sense but 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.950
 let's go pirate that's a 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 good mission is my favorite because of that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.200
 I'm surprised I did not upload it before 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.090
 because I know that you have to hack there 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.679
 what to kill you have to open a safe 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
 you have to escape it seems pretty 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.079
 complete and such and to work as a team 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.319
 and for and good if it's a good clear team 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319
 but 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.820
 and this mission is also going pretty well 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.440
 to practice before the dlc comes out 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.940
 There is good about this mission and anyone 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.640
 where you have to hack or open 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.380
 safes because it will be what more 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.760
 do when the fg is done and be 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.340
 good that I know not why 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.110
 that we know that you will have to hack 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.540
 really when the tlc is done will be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.700
 several panels when we rob the bank 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.340
 well, it's better not to talk about that 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.170
 now because yes no 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.150
 and we mix things too 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.030
 and well let's open the strong box 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.160
 it is better to always pull towards the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.569
 left that I know because it's more 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.190
 fast from left to right and 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.610
 left right left right 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.930
 I do not know if you understand me or because 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.660
 you have to turn to the left 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.100
 until it vibrates and sonic right up 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.440
 that sounds clear left is fine 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.020
 clear and good that I know is always 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.930
 to the left first to go more 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.400
 fast or good is a little advice 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.250
 I'm there 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.720
 and good to see good I'm with Johnny the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.459
 tourist or is it strange to me to have failed 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.170
 so many times this mission playing with 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.920
 Johnny is the first time I play 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.000
 jong dress missions the tourist 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.519
 well dressed really about I have 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.799
 have to change the hair but I have the 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.970
 I do not know if case has been opened or not 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.600
 has opened has it seems to me that there 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.400
 forever 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.690
 it seems to me that it has been opened and not 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.800
 I realized 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.890
 is already 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.170
 my two companions are dead 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.730
 a good team seems like a good team 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.319
 I always play with good people 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.290
 let's see we're going to escape there I'm going to 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.640
 call my buffer that in this mission I 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.910
 reappears at the end of that dock 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.430
 God, it seems to me that this is going to go wrong 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.550
 seriously I concentrate and go to 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.020
 try to do it but god the people 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.880
 that I have there god I will try to jump 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.450
 in the game because without mom they are going to 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.160
 kill 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.940
 hopefully killed this one that I have 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.600
 ahead 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.880
 fuck like I'm playing it for real 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:59.680
 Jesuit the car 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.680
 no no because if they change the glasses 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.790
 or god half an hour to drink me a 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:08.550
 cocacola day leaving the glasses and the 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.380
 disk man pet to the car at the moment 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.030
 and well now we caught the helicopter and 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.950
 we escape over there I always get the 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.769
 helicopter because the output that there is of 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.480
 here is a very small bridge and I that 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.370
 I'm usually killed there whenever you 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.370
 yes it catches me in helicopter 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.699
 and good as far as the races 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.370
 are serving lately I seem to 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.800
 me very pretty that of the loops and the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.190
 ramps the central jumps and also that 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.169
 they are races created by players and they are 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.720
 more original creative and such and good 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.910
 if I see that you like it if such 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.470
 you like it and I will keep going up 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.810
 racing that style to me 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.400
 personally I would like to continue 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.440
 going up from those because they seem very 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.200
 beautiful and good you can also 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.600
 want can not be 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.790
 but it can be 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.460
 well I 'll be back where 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.500
 I went before I feel sorry for the dance I know 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.420
 You saw there but good as I told you 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.310
 before if there had been other 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.250
 fails today he is one of my days that 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.840
 do like any other and well I'll 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.640
 deliver this we already finished the mission as 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.010
 it's going away, it's pretty cool to me 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.200
 upload personalized careers and such if 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.640
 I see this continue to rise and for good 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.400
 I know why there will also be departures 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.080
 death 'captures and other type of games 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.270
 Personalized that I'll be looking at 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.730
 I recently started looking at everything 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.800
 this so we'll already try to see 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.300
 what do you like most and such and such 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.340
