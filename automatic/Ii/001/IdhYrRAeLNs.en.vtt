00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 very good to all welcome to the new 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.560
 I'm with lake but why not 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.040
 we have batteries and you are seeing like this 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.620
 like a fish station 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 and we're going to draw a lot for a 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.500
 very good product here I am I do not know 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.680
 you are seeing me that I will explain 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 and gaditanos of it then thanks to the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.660
 formula that we have been given helmets that 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.279
 I'm seeing that they are valued at 190 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.420
 euros I think they are the 180 the truth 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.189
 quite expensive and I think they are the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.199
 best helmets that is raffled up to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.609
 moment and as I always say if you want 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.779
 a little money or you need them 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.450
 you just have to go to the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.790
 description of the video where you will have the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.290
 twitter of the guys where you can 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.850
 continue to retweet the tweet that is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.230
 and so easy to enter the draw 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.000
 have a week was and we say the 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.270
 winner and you can wear these helmets 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.739
 they are 180 euros they have 7.1 and a lot of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.510
 characteristics that you have below in the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.860
 description in the description you can see 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 everything that leads to helmets 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 as the website of these guys and of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.899
 everything so we're not going to open the off 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.000
 and April and we'll show you a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 little inside and I think it has 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.570
 they also make a lot of lights and the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.100
 you can put you to make the lights that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.840
 want and others we will not connect 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.220
 because they are going to be for you but like this 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.530
 that maybe they are going to put sofia and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.299
 is going to give a little 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:14.270
 and a million other things so to see 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.560
 I really like the truth these helmets 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.630
 they have to be a passer is giving me 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.810
 life the truth 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.060
 I will put a moment to determine what is 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 piece of quilt you have that has to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.860
 be very comfortable and you are seeing that they are 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.220
 7.1. It paints to be very comfortable that 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.220
 flips 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:40.910
 the micro 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:44.270
 the truth is that he will not tell us they are 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:55.090
 very light they do not tighten anything they insulate 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:55.090
 pretty good very comfortable 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.979
 they are those helmets and I already 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.270
 I can assure and as I say, I believe 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.320
 which is one of the best draws that 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.209
 I'm going to do and you have down at the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.590
 description is simply a tweet in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.720
 the one that you have to do what you put on 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.130
 to the guys from fall cracks and do 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.480
 retweet like that so simple in a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.950
 week we will say the winner me that is 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.360
 them that the ones of a pass are me 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.700
 giving an incredible life because I have 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 a pair of helmets of 60 euros fair enough 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.739
 but I like them and I'm 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.330
 accustomed 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.330
 the box that we will send you if you touch 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.750
 to be able to connect but this is 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:45.450
 here you are watching it is connected here 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.450
 and hence the pp usb 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.510
 if you have other extra things and also 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:00.450
 you have anemia are helmets 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.450
 for the mobile one for the mobile too 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.510
 you have to then only on the mobile is 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.459
 truth that we have or is it gives us something 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.709
 because it's going to be for you and the 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.170
 really leave it in the comments I do not know 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.550
 if it bothers you that we already have to 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.220
 obviously teach it the product of 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.600
 the best thing what ya open the plastics 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.520
 He gives us a little bit for that, but hey 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.230
 we could prove it is also true and 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.940
 but we will give you what is good 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.200
 what there is, we are not going to open it, 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.850
 nothing is all there I am seeing 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.110
 We have not opened anything but 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.430
 this to teach them because if not 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:33.310
 It is obviously a little weird to make a 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.900
 draw without teaching a little bit good so what 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.250
 said is what said guys if you want more 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.420
 raffles would be fine that I will support the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.520
 videos because the truth that they were 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.080
 quite supportive and it's pretty good for 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.580
 the people who sent us these things to 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.840
 that we can avoid them and as I say no 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.670
 you have all the description is simply 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.380
 you enter by twitter I also forget 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.540
 you can do it on facebook 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.150
 a like on facebook to my page or by 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:04:04.980
 twitter following the guys to force 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:04.980
