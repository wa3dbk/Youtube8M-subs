 much blood 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.600
 from a zeitenwende great season of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.310
 test pascal or what do you say 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.920
 end together where you end up the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
 musher mega important goal then in 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.860
 the second league brief here in here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:43.800
 bielefeld are happy like often ge 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.239
 heavy body was allowed to make the dream 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.940
 that makes me happy to think I 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.290
 I have the fans back a lot 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.239
 given this year 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.460
 I think I was always supported 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.720
 has come back to should I am 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.280
 studying at the first day 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.079
 public training and then how much 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.550
 dyna positive message the whole thing 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.890
 come though I played so little 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.090
 and today everyone could do it again 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 I think I could give it all 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.340
 give up club again and he goes to the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.060
 second league I want to continue in the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 third league but no matter the nice then 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.640
 for the gate and a lot of impression before the end 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.100
 could be as festive beast today throughout 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.659
 could happen a bit already 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.520
 experience with ascending is mine 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.140
 third now and I know what it is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.570
 arrives and I will of course 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.870
 to bring in my experience with what comes 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.180
 then 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:42.440
 we drink first and foremost 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.750
 Alcohol is very important the rest is coming 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.570
 all by itself I mean it is about 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.840
 the next days will be 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.940
 I had to realize more 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.620
 we ask the season it is gone 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 not easy if you have to ascend 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.080
 always tried to groups home 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.280
 low say anyway with the squad must 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.340
 the climber that did it 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.719
 that's a really big one 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.090
 very big thing that you have done 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:14.280
 We can easily value anyone 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.910
 or just anyone can not anymore 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.650
 Bielefeld 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.930
 It's not easy here 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.069
 kept saying and today 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.580
 impressively confirmed again 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.560
 get an unfortunate season 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.640
 ends in an incredibly emotional 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.120
 in difficult hands 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.830
 but thank God for this happy one 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.799
 the end of the darmstadt trauma defeats yours 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.769
 head between the individual the 22nd 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.910
 shock-resistant so we have the 1 2 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.650
 I felt reminded of that 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.900
 last day of darmstadt if it was 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.819
 I was sure of a copy 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.000
 was because the body language of our 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:54.090
 Team another was immediately 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.349
 Focused on the center circle 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.790
 have stood up for the penta 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.120
 At the same time we still do that 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.610
 on 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.160
 So that was really that that lay in 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.090
 the air and then well then has too 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.500
 works again and what works 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.480
 one-way football the last ten 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.670
 minutes 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.550
 Thank god or even the 2 2 and there 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.870
 Think of facebook 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.280
 yes but positively so I'm on a parcours 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.230
 here has its outstanding time 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.910
 had a hard time 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.010
 Of course times had strong competition 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.190
 has behaved pop and perfectly here 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.110
 the whole time 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.810
 Baku was one of the rising heroes 2013 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.370
 and now that he is doing that today 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.450
 2 2 of course make incredible 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.910
 story a great story 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.680
 I could once was there it goes in 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.670
 city ​​hall what do annina expect today 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.490
 board goes to the town hall, I think what we 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.110
 therefore it should be clear 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.770
 and then we will be together 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:52.250
 retire and an internal 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.990
 make an ascent with the evening but 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.790
 arminia hamm jain comes the organizers 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.890
 back how relieved they are by 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.270
 the duo of keys pistol performance am 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.830
 I have a little bit exhausted 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.500
 was and that was not good for the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.020
 health of football really say 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.280
 a great season's cup semi-final and 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.550
 now the rise of a game day 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.440
 played again so well but one 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.770
 whole season has on me that 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.830
 Right 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.169
 You have to respect us 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.290
 all worked hard and today at the 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:25.070
 Wages get really meaningful now, too 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.790
 quite honestly though 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.120
 huge and happy for the team 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.120
