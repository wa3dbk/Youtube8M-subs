00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 moment when badly worded truth was expressed 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.330
 the history of this research actually begins at the end of the 19th century 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.549
 and 900 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.909
 on anatomical studies 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:16.070
 so we are seen in practice in difference of volume between the brain of the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.970
 woman's brain 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.869
 evening fundamentally decreed the superiority of the male over the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.710
 woman saying the brain objectively 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.579
 larger than the female one therefore the man is 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.919
 smarter 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.630
 then moving on 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.969
 it was said that the brain being smaller then the woman is truly a 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.950
 be of a limited type 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.310
 elis the left hemisphere that of the rationally shaped male habit of humanity 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.990
 of intelligence the consciousness of reason 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.930
 expose the right hemisphere was the female one was developed in children in the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.990
 there were criminals in colored races 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.530
 completely inferior 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.780
 and this was said by the scientific community anyway so it is the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.690
 Truth of the time I don't think anyone here today shares that kind of anymore 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 life 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.660
 to dispel this thing it means male brain bigger than that 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.740
 female on the basis of the so-called cc totti study on average 12% more 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.170
 great 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.530
 I repeat, this film is considered a sign some time ago 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.330
 of his male life compared to the female one 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.240
 among science it also depends very much on what point of view we take into 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.100
 consideration the data that are exposed 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.299
 so much so that if we come into continuous relationship between the mass 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.659
 body of man 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.610
 of the male 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.000
 and that of women makes the relationship between the surface of square meters 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.140
 between say male and female structure height 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.990
 this relationship invested 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.590
 so the woman actually considers her mass to be a bigger brain 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.380
 compared to that of man 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 this does not really mean to be or not to be greater than that 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.460
 male 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.220
 however, as you can see, depending on the cut with which you look at things, the truths 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.960
 change 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.150
 really 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.030
 ours with most information we have the del 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.640
 animals naturally love animals 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.590
 especially from the mice because they are the most easily influenced yes 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.289
 can do everything you can to start injecting the hormones you can 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.169
 castrating you can see so many things and therefore name of animal sexuality 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:16.899
 we know enough 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:21.329
 commissioned my old master email besser of london voro the man is not a 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.469
 great people 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:26.900
 we have a cerebral ciamo structure that is much more complex and therefore 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.949
 it should be taken into consideration but it was a little different 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.759
 most studies that sell products in recent years also tend 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.819
 instead a on the one hand puts the animal model which on the other hand then says for 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.199
 the man probably the thing happens more or less in the same way 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.180
 below leave a quote in English a little bit special because not 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.290
 I wish I were. attributed because it is particularly strongly done 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.810
 since it would help because director institute a blogger idem brige we start sea 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.619
 I'm quite competent 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.389
 but then you say that it is almost everything we know about variation 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.099
 of human sexuality 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.400
 including how it stands on the balls between sexuality and identity disorders 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.439
 of genus cel transsexualism 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.229
 of elena mariani clinical 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:16.169
 that is talking about hegemonic glasses from anecdotes or even fiction ie 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.809
 pure fantasy 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:20.809
 and this I do not say I repeat 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.789
 let's start a little bit what our biological certainties are 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.939
 Sexual termination as you have already heard this morning therefore depends 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.850
 from the presence or absence of the genus knows that I will be 'trouble on the chromosome y 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.020
 this generating variations among which the prince the male hormones that the 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.579
 testosterone 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.029
 so during embryonic development life after two choices I'm spur that 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.969
 will determine the son of male pu 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.629
 without prejudice to the fact that the whole structure functions as a thematic cascadan 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.399
 of receptors 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:53.099
 we were interested in this area to see what types of testosterone effects a 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.099
 brain level central nervous system 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.259
 here are a series of studies that have been done but the 80s up to 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:02.909
 around 2000 years 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.290
 where do you see that testosterone exposure seems anal 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.139
 masculinity and sexual behavior that drives the preference for the female 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.659
 so it means that testosterone exposure in a particular phase 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.119
 of embryonic development aired on an imprinting as you saw before at 

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.119
 physical but also from mint 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.530
 these imprints is to remember all the studies are done first on mice and 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.520
 then where possible they are carried on the hand otherwise one goes by deduction 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.319
 therefore the imprinting of the testosterone at the level of the mouse continues also in the 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.520
 app in the first week 10 days after birth 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.360
 if the same thing is a man it is still a controversial fact 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.919
 how to live in the article made by professor tab 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.660
 Minimal prenatal testosterone exposure changes could 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.439
 counting sexual preferences in humans 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:56.530
 this was seen because there were some studies done. on 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.070
 particularly the tumors the use of drugs in practice of Como 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.939
 inviting london in pregnancy and if the disc 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:07.339
 the hypothetical possibility that exposed people of a female gender a 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.189
 these different levels of support they might have 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:13.150
 variations for what their sexual tastes are 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.580
 but it is purely indicative 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.349
 in the 90s guinea once dismantled others and lot jean monnet 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.639
 cif a biological hypothesis of sexual orientation 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.349
 then try to understand if homosexuality for example was linked 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.529
 in some way hygienic however add the factors that were not variable 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.489
 for this reason they made anatomical studies once again 

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:41.489
 basically wine going to see if for example in the brain between the 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:44.699
 male and female brains therefore that of homosexuals 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.509
 the place of the specific structures that had different dimensions 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.509
 dimensions we are talking about exactly as the beginning of the century 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.029
 to try to understand if they could give this the reason 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.789
 and of a different kind of sexual behavior 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.589
 Professor I go 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.830
 who made d we are still his academic fortune on this kind of 

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.379
 studies that I have the pleasure to personally collaborate with 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:08.349
 amsterdam 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:11.669
 I find this summary asthmatic in sexual men 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:16.159
 it is known that it had the same size as the female one as opposed to 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:19.599
 the male one which was twice the size of that also as the number of 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:21.309
 neurons 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:24.679
 it should be noted that then in reality the number of dance and suali studied in 

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:28.159
 this type of study never went beyond the 5 7 brains 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.089
 so you realize by yourself that 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.749
 study 5 7 brains and - generalized conclusion for the whole quanta 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:37.059
 mankind 

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:40.629
 normally of a heart this medicine is from against only that it becomes 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.969
 really extremely difficult 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:49.099
 even more and an impact boron that beautiful article of lele the fact in the mi 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:50.659
 seems 91 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.240
 which showed another difference is your hypothalamic level structure 

00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:56.550
 the hypothalamus is found in practice 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.500
 above the hypothesis that under the brain does not represent the point of 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.599
 contact between 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.240
 the mental part the hormonal part so it was obvious affair between seeks 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.409
 differences in what then regulates the selection of all body hormones 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:10.199
 human 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.830
 petroleum this structure called the nh3 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.669
 cars 1 5 useless useless that only this have been studied 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:21.569
 one finds difference at the level of both neuron and magnitude numbers 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.479
 similar to the one found in the press 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.639
 the number was larger at the level of heterosexual males and was smaller 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.610
 in women and in males it is sexual 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.090
 how is the size of this nucleus therefore the reason why 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.839
 someone chooses 

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:42.569
 the attractiveness of some sex partners of the same sex 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:45.869
 opposite to 

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:49.319
 these biological bases are subsequently re-evaluated 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.909
 dvd you present a review diba in where 

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:56.409
 I quote that the word does not exist 

00:07:57.169 --> 00:08:01.210
 that proves biological factors is the origin sexual orientation 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:03.499
 moles that are united social psycho 

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:05.449
 quite logical to think gun 

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.080
 therefore as everything in nature that everything is from the interaction between the 

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.499
 around, one part and the environment on the other 

00:08:11.499 --> 00:08:13.360
 we can phenotypic level 

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.110
 it would not be logical to think that it is never such a complex aspect 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.270
 a human sexuality
