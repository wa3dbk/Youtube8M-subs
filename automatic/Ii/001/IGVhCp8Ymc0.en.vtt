00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.830 

but<00:00:16.690> I'm<00:00:16.810> pretty<00:00:16.930> good<00:00:17.200> now<00:00:18.960> yeah<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:22.570> took

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
but I'm pretty good now yeah just took

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.980 
but I'm pretty good now yeah just took
all<00:00:22.990> we're<00:00:23.170> at<00:00:23.350> right<00:00:23.590> now<00:00:24.270> took<00:00:25.270> all<00:00:25.450> my<00:00:25.600> stats

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
all we're at right now took all my stats

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.030 
all we're at right now took all my stats
as<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:26.980> can<00:00:27.130> see<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:29.140> know<00:00:29.260> what's<00:00:29.680> running

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:43.080 

time<00:00:33.040> I'm<00:00:33.160> also<00:00:33.370> in<00:00:33.610> here<00:00:40.830> don't<00:00:41.830> see<00:00:42.129> on<00:00:42.160> first

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
time I'm also in here don't see on first

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.450 
time I'm also in here don't see on first
check<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.420> temperature<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:45.190> we're<00:00:45.309> right

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
check the temperature see we're right

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.930 
check the temperature see we're right
here<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:48.010> if<00:00:48.040> I<00:00:48.130> can<00:00:48.280> zoom<00:00:48.430> in<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.640> little<00:00:48.790> bit

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
here see if I can zoom in a little bit

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:55.100 
here see if I can zoom in a little bit
on<00:00:49.120> that<00:00:51.360> high<00:00:52.360> right<00:00:52.630> now<00:00:52.660> what<00:00:53.559> 31<00:00:54.040> degrees

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
on that high right now what 31 degrees

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.510 
on that high right now what 31 degrees
low<00:00:56.110> is<00:00:56.320> 29<00:00:58.649> hopefully<00:00:59.649> you<00:00:59.710> can<00:00:59.800> see<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.040> let

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
low is 29 hopefully you can see that let

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.990 
low is 29 hopefully you can see that let
me<00:01:00.610> minimize<00:01:00.760> that<00:01:02.460> runs<00:01:03.460> down<00:01:03.670> there<00:01:03.879> in<00:01:03.940> the

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
me minimize that runs down there in the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.170 
me minimize that runs down there in the
background<00:01:04.239> um<00:01:05.640> let's<00:01:06.640> see<00:01:06.729> what<00:01:06.850> speed<00:01:07.090> I'm

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
background um let's see what speed I'm

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.070 
background um let's see what speed I'm
at<00:01:07.330> right<00:01:07.360> now

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.280 

do<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> quick<00:01:13.860> test<00:01:13.950> here
