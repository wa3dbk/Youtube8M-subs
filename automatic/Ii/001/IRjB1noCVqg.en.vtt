Hello Youtube friends¡¡

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.100
In this opportunity we are going to learn how to do the "Hard Reset" to a Alcatel Pop S3.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.500
As you can see it.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.340
I am going to uncover it so that you observe the model in detail.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.680
Look at model.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.340
I do not know if it can be appreciated

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.760
It's a 5050A.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.060
We are going to turn it on to better observe the model.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.980
Look it. Alcatel One Touch Pop S3.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080
And as you will see.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.660
The phone has a password.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.340
The pattern password to be able to enter.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.920
Then, we are going to perform the hard reset to be able to enter the phone.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.020
We are going to do the following:

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.000
Turn off the phone

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.800
Remove the battery for 5 seconds.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.560

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.340
And press power button for a few seconds.

Immediately turn the phone on, release the power button only.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.320
Hold the volume up button pressed

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.820

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.800
Select the preferred language.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.900

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.980
I prefer to choose the English language.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.640
The recovery menu appears.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.620

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.240
And finally restart the phone in the first option that says "Reboot System Now"

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.460
