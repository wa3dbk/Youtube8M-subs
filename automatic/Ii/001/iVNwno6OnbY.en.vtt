 mole can always drop chicken fundus 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.120
 becomes a game that goes very badly 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.229
 slowly 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.390
 such a kill usually lasts 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.850
 confirmed pot all the time 10 minutes 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.140

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.729
 just always reasonable along 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.869

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.399

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:19.689
 exactly p to check it does mean 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250

 meter only you have it now 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.520

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.380

 caught again by someone else so me 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 must keep in mind that if 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.709
 it's a somebody's walking what's there 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.910
 probably one next to it 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.250
 hard paying attention to politics, I will immediately 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.900

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.190

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.290
