if not you can check my channel on how
to<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> set<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.020> one<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.530> how<00:00:55.980> to

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to get it set up I have one on how to

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.590 
to get it set up I have one on how to
get<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> set<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.789> Galaxy<00:00:57.120> Nexus<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
get it set up for the Galaxy Nexus it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
get it set up for the Galaxy Nexus it
works<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.989> same<00:00:58.020> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.859> transformer<00:00:59.399> prime

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
works the same on the transformer prime

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.580 
works the same on the transformer prime
but<00:01:00.420> we'll<00:01:00.539> go<00:01:00.629> ahead<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.020> move<00:01:01.109> forward<00:01:01.500> with

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
but we'll go ahead and move forward with

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
but we'll go ahead and move forward with
this<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.370> be<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> screen<00:01:02.940> that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this so this would be the screen that

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
this so this would be the screen that
you're<00:01:03.390> stuck<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> your

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
you're stuck in this is your

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.250 
you're stuck in this is your
clockworkmod<00:01:05.670> recovery<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.270> I've<00:01:06.360> got<00:01:06.510> my<00:01:06.689> USB

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
clockworkmod recovery so I've got my USB

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.310 
clockworkmod recovery so I've got my USB
cable<00:01:08.130> plugged<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.960> we're<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.170> go

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
cable plugged in and we're gonna go

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.840 
cable plugged in and we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.250> brick<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
ahead and get out of this brick so the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.010 
ahead and get out of this brick so the
way<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:11.970> we're<00:01:12.240> gonna<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.930> we're

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
way that we're gonna do that is we're

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.149 
way that we're gonna do that is we're
gonna<00:01:13.140> open<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> command<00:01:14.010> line<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> just

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
gonna open up a command line and just

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
gonna open up a command line and just
type<00:01:17.400> CMD<00:01:18.170> that'll<00:01:19.170> bring<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.409> our<00:01:19.530> command

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
type CMD that'll bring up our command

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.609 
type CMD that'll bring up our command
line<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.610> adb<00:01:21.090> devices<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.470> make

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
line now you can do adb devices to make

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
line now you can do adb devices to make
sure<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.040> sees<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.460> device<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sure that it sees your device and it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
sure that it sees your device and it
shows<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.689> we're<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.990> recovery<00:01:25.500> we're<00:01:25.740> in

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
shows that we're in recovery we're in

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.070 
shows that we're in recovery we're in
our<00:01:26.250> brick<00:01:26.640> we're<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.909> recovery<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.900> I'm<00:01:27.960> gonna

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080

the<00:01:45.890> first<00:01:46.890> thing<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.280> says<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.750> open

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the first thing it says here is you open

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.819 
the first thing it says here is you open
your<00:01:52.200> CMD<00:01:52.799> line<00:01:52.829> you'll<00:01:53.310> type<00:01:53.520> adb<00:01:54.090> shell<00:01:54.119> so

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
your CMD line you'll type adb shell so

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.859 
your CMD line you'll type adb shell so
adb<00:01:55.829> shell<00:01:58.820> okay<00:01:59.820> so<00:01:59.909> when<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> number<00:02:00.570> sign

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
adb shell okay so when the number sign

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.550 
adb shell okay so when the number sign
appears<00:02:01.350> there<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> will<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.000> type

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
appears there you will just type

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.130 
appears there you will just type
actually<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.979> copy<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.640> paste<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
actually you can copy and paste the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
actually you can copy and paste the
command<00:02:07.530> lines<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:08.250> are<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.610> written

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
command lines that are on that written

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.600 
command lines that are on that written
tutorial<00:02:09.390> just<00:02:10.020> copy<00:02:11.090> paste<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.360> hit<00:02:12.540> enter

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
tutorial just copy paste and hit enter

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.449 
tutorial just copy paste and hit enter
and<00:02:14.610> then<00:02:15.090> you'll<00:02:15.209> go<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.599> next<00:02:15.989> line<00:02:16.459> copy

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
and then you'll go to the next line copy

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:27.530 
and then you'll go to the next line copy
and<00:02:17.700> paste<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:23.510> hit<00:02:24.510> enter<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:27.360> says

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
and paste that and hit enter it says

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720 
and paste that and hit enter it says
exit<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> shell<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.530> reboot<00:02:28.920> your<00:02:29.099> prime<00:02:29.400> via

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
exit the shell and reboot your prime via

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.300 
exit the shell and reboot your prime via
clockworkmod<00:02:30.330> recovery<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.739> now<00:02:31.890> we'll<00:02:32.280> just

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
clockworkmod recovery so now we'll just

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.690 
clockworkmod recovery so now we'll just
click<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.360> X<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.280> we'll<00:02:35.280> go<00:02:35.370> back<00:02:35.550> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
click on the X here and we'll go back to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.170 
click on the X here and we'll go back to
the<00:02:35.790> prime<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:37.410> we'll<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.739> reboot<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the prime and we'll just reboot the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.280 
the prime and we'll just reboot the
system<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.630> guess<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.019> go<00:02:40.110> ahead<00:02:40.200> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
system I guess we can go ahead and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.360 
system I guess we can go ahead and
unplug<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.880> reboot<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.000> system<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
unplug it reboot the system and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.530 
unplug it reboot the system and
hopefully<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.000> recovered<00:02:47.239> now<00:02:48.239> if<00:02:48.390> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
hopefully we have recovered now if you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.020 
hopefully we have recovered now if you
have<00:02:48.780> gone<00:02:49.049> into<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.769> brick<00:02:50.370> it's<00:02:50.790> not

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
have gone into that brick it's not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.120 
have gone into that brick it's not
necessarily<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.959> problem<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> rom

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
necessarily the problem with the rom

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.650 
necessarily the problem with the rom
that<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> were<00:02:53.519> on<00:02:53.700> or<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> modification

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
that you were on or the modification

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.600 
that you were on or the modification
that<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:54.900> were<00:02:54.989> on<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.470> caused<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.400> break

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
that you were on that caused it to break

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.800 
that you were on that caused it to break
is<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:56.790> something<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.239> these<00:02:57.510> devices

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
is just something that these devices

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.009 
is just something that these devices
tend<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:59.239> so<00:03:00.239> hopefully<00:03:00.540> it<00:03:00.660> should<00:03:00.810> just

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
tend to do so hopefully it should just

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.309 
tend to do so hopefully it should just
boot<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.590> now<00:03:02.989> anyhow<00:03:03.989> we'll<00:03:04.170> watch

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
boot right up now anyhow we'll watch

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.759 
boot right up now anyhow we'll watch
this<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> few<00:03:05.069> minutes<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:06.380> if<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.530> follow

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
this for a few minutes and if you follow

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.589 
this for a few minutes and if you follow
that<00:03:07.950> step-by-step<00:03:08.640> process<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.450> will

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
that step-by-step process that will

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.979 
that step-by-step process that will
unbreak<00:03:10.110> your<00:03:10.290> transformer<00:03:10.860> prime<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.930> is

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
unbreak your transformer prime this is

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.860 
unbreak your transformer prime this is
taking<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.530> while<00:03:13.709> here<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.540> guess<00:03:15.540> we'll<00:03:15.720> just

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
taking a while here so guess we'll just

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.210 
taking a while here so guess we'll just
wait<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.019> few<00:03:16.110> more<00:03:16.319> minutes<00:03:16.470> if<00:03:16.799> we<00:03:16.890> don't<00:03:17.040> get

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
wait a few more minutes if we don't get

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.770 
wait a few more minutes if we don't get
anything<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.670> guess<00:03:17.850> maybe<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.299> possibly

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
anything I guess maybe it's possibly

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.720 
anything I guess maybe it's possibly
wiping<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.560> system<00:03:19.950> I'm<00:03:20.100> not<00:03:20.130> sure<00:03:20.400> what<00:03:20.579> it's

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
wiping the system I'm not sure what it's

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
wiping the system I'm not sure what it's
doing<00:03:21.030> right<00:03:21.180> now<00:03:21.239> just<00:03:21.709> kind<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.829> watch<00:03:22.980> it

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
doing right now just kind of watch it

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.090 
doing right now just kind of watch it
okay<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.840> says<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.170> if<00:03:25.290> you're<00:03:25.440> stuck<00:03:25.799> on<00:03:25.950> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
okay it says that if you're stuck on the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.590 
okay it says that if you're stuck on the
splash<00:03:26.430> screen<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.120> boot<00:03:27.329> into<00:03:27.450> recovery

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
splash screen you can boot into recovery

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.509 
splash screen you can boot into recovery
and<00:03:28.019> reinstall<00:03:28.560> your<00:03:28.590> rom<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.190> way<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.370> do

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
and reinstall your rom so the way to do

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.180 
and reinstall your rom so the way to do
that<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.120> hold<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.569> volume<00:03:31.380> down<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.890> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
that is to hold the volume down and the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.590 
that is to hold the volume down and the
power<00:03:32.370> so<00:03:32.730> we'll<00:03:32.880> do<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.329> looks<00:03:33.359> like

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
power so we'll do that it looks like

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.069 
power so we'll do that it looks like
we're<00:03:33.780> stuck<00:03:33.959> at<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.200> splash<00:03:34.440> screen<00:03:36.079> you

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
we're stuck at the splash screen you

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.960 
we're stuck at the splash screen you
should<00:03:37.140> come<00:03:37.440> back<00:03:37.590> up<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:37.859> give<00:03:37.980> us<00:03:38.010> our<00:03:38.310> line

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
should come back up and give us our line

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.539 
should come back up and give us our line
of<00:03:39.150> code<00:03:39.359> in<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> top<00:03:39.959> right<00:03:40.170> corner<00:03:40.380> okay<00:03:41.370> now

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
of code in the top right corner okay now

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.129 
of code in the top right corner okay now
we<00:03:41.609> can<00:03:41.819> hit<00:03:42.060> up<00:03:42.269> that's<00:03:42.750> going<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.989> put<00:03:43.109> us

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
we can hit up that's going to put us

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.420 
we can hit up that's going to put us
into<00:03:43.350> recovery<00:03:43.889> from<00:03:44.040> there<00:03:44.220> we'll<00:03:44.400> just

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
into recovery from there we'll just

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.020 
into recovery from there we'll just
install<00:03:44.819> a<00:03:45.269> rom<00:03:46.160> so<00:03:47.160> hopefully<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.609> had<00:03:47.790> one

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
install a rom so hopefully you had one

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.800 
install a rom so hopefully you had one
on<00:03:48.269> your<00:03:48.480> SD<00:03:48.630> card<00:03:49.019> if<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.380> didn't<00:03:50.750> then<00:03:51.750> you

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
on your SD card if you didn't then you

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.129 
on your SD card if you didn't then you
can<00:03:52.139> of<00:03:52.380> course<00:03:52.410> go<00:03:52.799> into<00:03:52.980> mountain<00:03:53.340> storage

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
can of course go into mountain storage
