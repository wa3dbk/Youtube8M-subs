00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.030
 since the release of street fighter 4 passed 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.460
 scary to imagine as much as five years 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.649
 the project doesn't even think about taking positions 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.659
 annual events big 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.059
 competitions and of course the same traditional 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.640
 major capcom style updates 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.210
 forcing buy one game again and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.339
 again 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 the last one is called 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.320
 ultra street fighter 4 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 we were subjected to a thorough analysis received 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.090
 with multiple mental trauma 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.300
 from veterans of online battles and ready 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 share your impressions for 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.470
 start warning that the ultra version 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.810
 it is installed only on top of super 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.149
 street fighter 4 arcade edition 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.490
 representing essentially paid 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.440
 supplement don't wish to stay with already 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.479
 not current editions get ready 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.369
 pay for the project again 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.860
 If you decide to join 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.080
 general fun just now that you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.450
 will require not only double payment 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.939
 but also angelic patience steamed with 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 the rest of the nerves are game mechanics 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.100
 street fighter 4 and ultra street fighter 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.409
 4 in particular is very demanding on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.360
 different kind of timing this to me 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.640
 tekken where you can walk your fingers on j 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.649
 I submit to win all here anyway 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.170
 much more interesting two-dimensional 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.540
 timely keystroke affects 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.850
 much from the correct performance even 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.610
 simplest combinations before dodging 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.430
 attacks the opponent's mistakes during the battle is not 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.720
 can be forgiven at all once wrong 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.790
 podgadat moment to strike or 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 setting the block as an oversight 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.840
 will result in a lost round or even 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.640
 the whole battle 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.709
 since we started talking about newbies then 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.099
 it would be superfluous to mention training 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.709
 mode 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.840
 this is the first place to go 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.450
 if you do not have years of age 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.430
 experience of this kind of project is true 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.129
 comprehend all the delights of local combat 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.109
 the system will have no 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.959
 tips besides the list of beats ultra 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:46.030
 street fighter 4 can not provide 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.069
 also pay attention to troil mode 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.079
 where under the guise of tests you will be asked 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.829
 perform simple and complex combinations 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.530
 beats 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.019
 and also start doing ultra and other 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.389
 evil tricks taking away the essential 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.290
 part of the life strip carefully 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.599
 remember 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.579
 the knowledge gained in this way is very 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.579
 useful as battles with real 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.260
 opponents of experienced ultra fighters 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.269
 publications will delight several 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.239
 significant changes in mechanics 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.939
 wearing even more variety in so 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.159
 not the easiest game for her alone 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.739
 of the most notable innovations was 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.560
 the appearance of the ultra combo item got on 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.540
 special techniques screen 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.000
 option allows you to use the battle 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.889
 both special techniques were previously offered 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.769
 choose only one but their effectiveness 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.900
 will be reduced or for example you can 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.310
 force a character to lie down for a few 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.379
 hundredths of a second longer 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.959
 such a trifle helps not to fall under 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.269
 timing-crushing blow 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.540
 which allows you to take the initiative in your 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.389
 hands also once again was 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.519
 reworked balance one character slightly 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.250
 weakened some tricks to others 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.290
 on the contrary, slightly added damage at all 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.930
 dig out and search for various little things 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.629
 ultra street fighter 4 can be very long 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.060
 and don't forget that there are forty in the game 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.040
 four immediately available heroes and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.560
 five of them appeared only fresh 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.780
 whether it is necessary to speak additionally 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.909
 that with so many fighters to choose from 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.449
 my pet and I his his receptions 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:19.509
 not one hundred hours will leave and for what 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.579
 do it of course for the sake of the wonderful 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.280
 network battles to break away from which 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.020
 definitely impossible worth a couple of times 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.060
 fight live rival like 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.159
 go back to the bots absolutely not 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.370
 it would be desirable but if only to work 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.500
 several tricks 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.290
 ultra street fighter 4 offers 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.150
 nuclear mix from the dynamics of tactics and 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.880
 speeds and makes it so much 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.490
 well that the defeat does not upset 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.800
 on the contrary, it gives an additional incentive 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.270
 for training then for sure 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.240
 scatters everyone online 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.190
 victories in turn becomes 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.830
 a real reason for joy especially 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.770
 when you pull them out on your last breath 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.530
 the advantages can be attributed and excellent 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.120
 network code during testing 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.310
 any problems with big ping 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.710
 or compound breaks when conducting 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.169
 no match was added add here 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.530
 minimum load time between fights and 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.760
 get near perfect mode 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.050
 posing a serious threat to 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.780
 free time 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.750
 ultra street fighter 4 may like 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.370
 both veterans of the series and novices 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.340
 provided they are ready to devote 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.740
 while training the next 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.630
 a big update proved once again that 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.720
 fourth of the famous TV series 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.450
 lively all the living and retire until 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.740
 not going to get ready for hurricane 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:41.740
 fights loud victories and unexpected 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.740
 defeat 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.460
 but
