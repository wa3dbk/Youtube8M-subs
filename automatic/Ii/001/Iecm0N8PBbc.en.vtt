 it is convenient to hold the big device in your hand 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.870
 at the ends of the device just a few 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 buttons and they are all located where 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 expect them to find the power key 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.960
 The locking device is located at the top 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.579
 parts of the left end under the index 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.280
 finger right under the thumb 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.930
 turns out to be a short volume control 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 when you intercept your smartphone 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.469
 such a position to take a picture under 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.700
 camera shutter markov too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.049
 a little bit just the top two of the device 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.909
 placed audio jack 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.020
 and on the right above the volume rocker and connector

 display diagonal is 4.55 inches 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 add more to that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.340
 broad framework and we will get in fact 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.710
 large dimensions that are more suitable 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.070
 male hand rather than female resolution 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.040
 screen 1280 720 points that gives 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.229
 density 320 3-5 matrix here 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.670
 used standard so-called. but 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.490
 polished software technology 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.439
 Mobile bravia engine which is noticeable 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.689
 improving picture quality during 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.430
 view photos and videos but problems with 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.560
 screen is not observed during operation 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.259
 with brightness and contrast applications 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.810
 enough to clearly see everything even 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.909
 in bright light and viewing angles are close 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.270
 maximum based hardware stuffing 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.190

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.870
 asthma bregan which includes a processor 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 Cores glues and frequency and a half 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.330
 gigahertz gigabytes of ram and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.920
 graphics chip adreno 225 in the test 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.369
 quadrant standart such a configuration 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.680
 gaining about 4,700 points that even 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.750
 eat more than u sevan x which 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.390
 held the lead for the last 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.310
 half a year with the main memory of the device 16 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.490
 gigabyte and there is a card slot 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.680
 micro sd memory up to 32 gigabytes 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.450
 that is, on this smartphone photos and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.010
 films you can just keep the sea 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.320

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.410
 update to 41 jellybin 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.570
 exact dates for the release of new firmware to us 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.760
 not yet called and even more so no one 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.900
 talks about when the update will appear 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.000
 up to version 42 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.520
 but at 40 everything works pretty 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.160
 smoothly including proprietary interface with 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.170
 Thai raisin and smartphone widgets 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.180

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.560
 megapixels and back light 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.350
 matrix which allows you to do 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.880
 high-quality images even in conditions 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.680
 low light in addition to photos 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.600
 the main camera of course can 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.910
 record video in full hd format on 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.160
 speeds of 30 frames per second in contrast 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.590
 from the classic version x go which 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.260
 Sold in Europe UT x Detachable cover 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.950

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.680
 back panel 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.320

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.810
 milliampere hour and also slots for micro 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.180
 sd and micro sim on one battery charge 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.370
 a smartphone can hold about 10 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.870
 hours in pretty hard mode 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.730
 use but if not particularly 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.370
 zealous can count and hours 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.200
 On 20 in standby mode for example the device 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.510
 can spend up to one and a half weeks in 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.040
 depending on network types if you were waiting 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.900
 that the james bond smartphone will 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.660
 built of rocket launchers and any laser and 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.000
 of course wrong times change a 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.540
 with them and agent 007 with his 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.060
 devices 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.400
 now the main weapon is this information and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.350
 xperia tx copes with its 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.060

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.020
 spy shots and powerful stuffing to 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.390
 one time 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.580
 keep running a lot of programs you can 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.530
