00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello to me all is given tinker and in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.760
 In this video I will tell and show three ideas. 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.429
 how can i make flower headbands 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.660
 so if you're interested let's 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:21.840
 watch the video for this is incredible 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.689
 beautiful and very very gentle rim 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640
 we will need the flowers i bought in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.099
 the shop unfortunately I did not make them 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.439
 itself but in principle you can make them 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.309
 suit yourself amine hope I correctly 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 said 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.969
 principle it's pretty easy but to 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.760
 Sorry I did not know how night I hope 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.309
 learn and show you so here are ours 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.290
 flowers we need to tie to the rim 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.300
 principle it's pretty easy to wash off and 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.300
 so the flowers just keep well 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.650
 to create this here we need 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.239
 branches branches best dunk bathroom 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.070
 before you make your 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.500
 bezel in order for us to be later 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 it is easier to shape them among themselves 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 we fasten the twigs with a thread not 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.640
 remove all the same under the color method to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.740
 they were pink white or some 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.260
 Unclear color is better that it was not 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.690
 visible artificial flowers you can 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 secure with thread but honestly 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.320
 telling me it seems she will hold on 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.790
 not really so I will still 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.790
 fasten with a glue gun 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.890
 we need five laps but look 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.920
 carefully we need to get four of 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.580
 they were the same size but 5 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.030
 will be a little less now our circle 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.920
 fold in half and again and sew 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.550
 in our midst in this way 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.020
 sew on 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.020
 and the remaining three laps 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.159
 in the middle we will have a bead so 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.040
 sew it 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.680
 and again we will need naturally 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.459
 bezel to the bezel our flowers you can 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.290
 sew or glue me for glue 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.350
 so I will glue everything glue 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.350
 a pistol 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.180
