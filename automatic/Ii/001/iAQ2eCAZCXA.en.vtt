00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
because it can still be used because

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.600 
because it can still be used because
it's<00:03:48.780> already<00:03:48.989> activated<00:03:49.250> but<00:03:50.250> once<00:03:50.430> it's

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
activated like that there's no way you

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.970 
activated like that there's no way you
can<00:03:52.739> deactivate<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.780> that's<00:03:55.410> where<00:03:55.680> my

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
can deactivate it so that's where my

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.060 
can deactivate it so that's where my
idea<00:03:56.370> came<00:03:56.670> in<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.989> now<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.650> he

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
idea came in and so now that he

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.280 
idea came in and so now that he
activated<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.269> already<00:04:00.450> have<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.900> numbers
