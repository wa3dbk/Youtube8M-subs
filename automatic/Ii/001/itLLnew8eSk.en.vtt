00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
deterioration all the way around but by

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.070 
deterioration all the way around but by
that<00:00:44.950> noise<00:00:45.520> that<00:00:45.820> it's<00:00:45.940> making<00:00:46.420> it<00:00:46.600> is<00:00:46.750> blown

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
blown out the whole surrounding might be

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.049 
blown out the whole surrounding might be
intact<00:00:53.710> there<00:00:54.700> might<00:00:54.910> be<00:00:55.510> no<00:00:55.930> signs<00:00:56.650> of<00:00:57.059> damage

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
intact there might be no signs of damage

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:10.440 
intact there might be no signs of damage
but<00:00:58.780> if<00:00:59.379> you<00:00:59.589> hear<00:00:59.830> that<00:01:00.010> crackling<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:10.210> lets

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
but if you hear that crackling now lets

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.080 
but if you hear that crackling now lets
you<00:01:10.570> know<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.380> is<00:01:11.440> blown<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.820> go<00:01:13.000> ahead

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
you know that it is blown so go ahead

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.230 
you know that it is blown so go ahead
and<00:01:13.210> replace<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:14.620> the<00:01:15.370> woofer<00:01:15.820> not<00:01:16.000> just

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and replace it with the woofer not just

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.930 
and replace it with the woofer not just
a<00:01:16.330> regular<00:01:16.720> speaker<00:01:16.990> because<00:01:17.490> since<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.700> has<00:01:18.909> a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
a regular speaker because since it has a

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.700 
a regular speaker because since it has a
JBL<00:01:19.600> system<00:01:20.080> right<00:01:20.890> there<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.060> your<00:01:22.240> radio

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
JBL system right there and on your radio

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.880 
JBL system right there and on your radio
on<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:24.690> bottom<00:01:25.690> right<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:26.020> says<00:01:26.170> JBL<00:01:26.590> has<00:01:26.740> an

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
on the bottom right it says JBL has an

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.520 
on the bottom right it says JBL has an
amplifier<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.630> what's<00:01:28.810> going<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:28.990> happen<00:01:29.080> is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
amplifier so what's going to happen is

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.160 
amplifier so what's going to happen is
you're<00:01:30.040> gonna<00:01:30.130> block<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.360> speaker<00:01:31.900> if<00:01:32.020> you

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
you're gonna block the speaker if you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.860 
you're gonna block the speaker if you
put<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> UH<00:01:32.790> entry-level<00:01:33.790> speaker<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.450> here<00:01:34.570> so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
put a UH entry-level speaker in here so

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.140 
put a UH entry-level speaker in here so
it<00:01:35.020> has<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.320> have<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.500> big<00:01:36.220> magnet<00:01:36.700> has<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:37.000> be<00:01:37.120> a

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
it has to have a big magnet has to be a

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.770 
it has to have a big magnet has to be a
woofer<00:01:37.690> not<00:01:37.990> just<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.320> regular<00:01:38.650> coax<00:01:39.070> speaker

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
woofer not just a regular coax speaker

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.990 
woofer not just a regular coax speaker
alright<00:01:40.780> thanks<00:01:41.050> YouTube<00:01:41.490> 2005<00:01:42.630> Toyota<00:01:43.630> Prius
