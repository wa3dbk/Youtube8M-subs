00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I fell in love
'bout a game a little square

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but when I've got played
left me disappointed 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I do not know how to start
from an apple tree 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with my own hands
practically i pulled it down

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I feel a little lost
wood I found

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I think I've figured out by now
to be a great magician

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I put them at random
I've crafted a pickaxe
I took that coal
I dug in the dark

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
torches are few
slowly the sun goes down

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
starts to become noche
i start to feel hungry

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
noise spiders and zombies
I must hurry

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
a shelter should I do
and kill a nice pork

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
creeper spiders and zombies
want to kill me

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I have the tools in my pocket
I must get away

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
block over a block
pickaxe over a pickaxe

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
now looks like a bunker
but it does not matter because

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this is my home
and that's fine as it is 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
there is still no glass
but it makes up for

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
now it is perfect
the light can pass

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I am going to sleep
Meanwhile, the night comes over me

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
iron, cobble, diamonds,
charcoal, gold and furnaces,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
finally my home
is ready and completed

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
i just have to mine
all day long!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
finally found those
diamonds iron and gold

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now I have to go
the armor is my objective

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
mob's cannot resist
my brutal blade

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
iron, cobble, diamonds  
charcoal,  gold and furnaces 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
hey mr greepah
You will be beheaded

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
ork smash and you know it
start the dancing!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
cobblestone blade,
meanwhile two rooms explodes

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
there is nothing to do this creeper is immortal
there is some elemental blade?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
obsidian in a hand with a table in the other
here is the spell to neutralize

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the forces of the night with no fish to fry
send to hell this demolition creeper

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now my house is a pile of rubble
I'll have to spend the night to rebuild all the walls

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
damn beast you should be ashamed
I finally defeated you and now I can work

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
damn beast you should be buried
And I can finally say BOMBOCRAFT

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
BOMBOCRAFT
