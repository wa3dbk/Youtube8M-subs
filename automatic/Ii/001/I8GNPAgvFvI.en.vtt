have any any other answers for that I
mean<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.609> places<00:01:03.359> technically<00:01:04.110> don't

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
mean a lot of places technically don't

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.140

call<00:01:04.500> us<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> sport<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.430> he<00:01:05.580> said<00:01:05.610> here

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
call us a sport but like he said here

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
call us a sport but like he said here
they<00:01:06.330> definitely<00:01:06.930> treat<00:01:07.320> us<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.530> her<00:01:07.860> ones

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
they definitely treat us like her ones

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.090 
they definitely treat us like her ones
hey<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.420> think<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.080> sport<00:01:10.409> like<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.770> said<00:01:11.010> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
hey I think it's a sport like I said you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.830 
hey I think it's a sport like I said you
guys<00:01:11.220> work<00:01:11.549> harder<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.030> anybody<00:01:12.210> else<00:01:12.570> team

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
guys work harder than anybody else team

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
guys work harder than anybody else team
so<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.380> believe<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> sport<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:15.060> all<00:01:15.210> seen

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so I believe it's a sport so we all seen

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.060 
so I believe it's a sport so we all seen

under five foot to be a cheerleader it's

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.070

happens<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.530> our<00:02:16.680> team<00:02:16.980> seems<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
happens that our team seems to be on the

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.120 
happens that our team seems to be on the
shorter<00:02:18.090> end<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.540> think<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.500> tallest<00:02:19.860> go<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.100> a

that<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:03.150> one<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.019> biggest<00:03:04.320> things<00:03:04.530> for

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that like one of the biggest things for

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.380 
that like one of the biggest things for
an<00:03:05.130> athlete<00:03:05.459> competing<00:03:05.790> store<00:03:06.090> it<00:03:06.299> would

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
an athlete competing store it would

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.289 
an athlete competing store it would
probably<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.260> lose<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.040> crowd<00:03:08.820> support

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
probably be to lose the crowd support

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.180 
probably be to lose the crowd support
throughout<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.690> game<00:03:09.870> so<00:03:10.079> as<00:03:10.650> long<00:03:10.890> as<00:03:10.950> you

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
throughout the game so as long as you

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.530 
throughout the game so as long as you
have<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.549> crowd<00:03:11.760> cheering<00:03:12.060> for<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
have the crowd cheering for you in the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.180 
have the crowd cheering for you in the
crowd<00:03:12.750> loud<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:13.049> think<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.530> really<00:03:13.829> helps

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
crowd loud I think that really helps

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.620 
crowd loud I think that really helps
motivate<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.940> players<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.269> do<00:03:15.359> good<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
motivate the players to do good on the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.599 
motivate the players to do good on the

think<00:03:49.260> being<00:03:49.950> asked

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
think being asked

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.640 
think being asked
of<00:03:50.730> previous<00:03:51.480> sport<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.020> everyone<00:03:52.500> on<00:03:52.590> our

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
of previous sport and everyone on our

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.170 
of previous sport and everyone on our
team<00:03:52.709> has<00:03:53.010> been<00:03:53.040> like<00:03:53.430> athletes<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.030> other

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.210 
team has been like athletes of other
sports<00:03:54.450> as<00:03:54.660> well<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.319> think<00:03:55.680> it's<00:03:55.980> really

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
sports as well I think it's really

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.280 
sports as well I think it's really
similar<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:57.270> basketball<00:03:57.870> footballer

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
similar to like basketball footballer

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.820 
similar to like basketball footballer
this<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.550> are<00:03:59.910> pretty

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
this and that like we are pretty

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:02.750 
this and that like we are pretty
ritualistic<00:04:01.830> on<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:01.980> lot<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.190> things<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.580> do

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
ritualistic on a lot of things we do

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.190 
ritualistic on a lot of things we do
with<00:04:02.940> our<00:04:03.030> warmup<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.690> different<00:04:03.989> things<00:04:04.080> so

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
with our warmup in different things so

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.740 
with our warmup in different things so
you<00:04:04.260> get<00:04:04.380> us<00:04:04.470> prepared<00:04:04.860> so<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:06.540> pretty

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you get us prepared so it's pretty

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.720 
you get us prepared so it's pretty
similar<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.140> think<00:04:07.230> across<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.739> board<00:04:07.860> in

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
similar I think across the board in

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.309 
similar I think across the board in
terms<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.330> cheerleading<00:04:09.720> related<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.230> other

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
terms of cheerleading related to other

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.720 
terms of cheerleading related to other
sports<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.800> how<00:04:10.950> we<00:04:11.010> get<00:04:11.310> get<00:04:11.610> ourselves
