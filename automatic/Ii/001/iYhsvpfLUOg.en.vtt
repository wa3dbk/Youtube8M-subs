00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
I'll go ahead and go through my scrap

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.969 
I'll go ahead and go through my scrap
stash<00:01:51.999> but<00:01:52.749> if<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.079> just<00:01:53.320> send<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.710> little

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
stash but if I just send a little

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.560 
stash but if I just send a little
project<00:01:54.399> I<00:01:54.520> don't<00:01:54.729> bother<00:01:54.909> i<00:01:55.090> just<00:01:55.329> put<00:01:55.479> this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
project I don't bother i just put this

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.090 
project I don't bother i just put this
stuff<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:55.960> side<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.499> I<00:01:56.590> wait<00:01:56.770> until<00:01:57.039> it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
stuff to the side and I wait until it

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.340 
stuff to the side and I wait until it
piles<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:57.850> little<00:01:58.090> bit<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.479> then<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.079> start

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
piles up a little bit and then I start

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.789 
piles up a little bit and then I start
cutting<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.799> down<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.659> it's<00:02:01.899> too<00:02:02.170> small<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
cutting it down if it's too small it

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.370 
cutting it down if it's too small it
goes<00:02:03.009> in<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.759> garbage<00:02:03.969> because<00:02:04.479> I<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:05.049> don't

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
goes in the garbage because I just don't

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.100 
goes in the garbage because I just don't
want<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.920> keep<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.340> zillion<00:02:07.179> little<00:02:07.719> pieces<00:02:07.899> of

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
want to keep a zillion little pieces of

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.320 
want to keep a zillion little pieces of
paper<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.619> will<00:02:08.890> never<00:02:08.979> use<00:02:09.160> this<00:02:10.030> is

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
paper that I will never use this is

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.720 
paper that I will never use this is
about<00:02:10.690> as<00:02:10.840> small<00:02:11.050> as<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.350> want<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.710> go<00:02:11.860> okay<00:02:12.490> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
about as small as I want to go okay and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.080 
about as small as I want to go okay and
I<00:02:12.760> like<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:13.680> sometimes<00:02:14.680> they<00:02:14.860> fiddle<00:02:15.130> if

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I like this but sometimes they fiddle if

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.710 
I like this but sometimes they fiddle if
a<00:02:16.240> punch

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
a punch

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.110 
a punch
fit<00:02:17.020> on<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.560> I'll<00:02:17.650> keep<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.100> but<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.970> has

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
fit on it then I'll keep it but it has

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.840 
fit on it then I'll keep it but it has
to<00:02:19.150> be<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.480> pretty<00:02:19.840> decent<00:02:20.230> size<00:02:20.670> normally<00:02:21.670> or

find them in my stack of big paper so

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.560 
find them in my stack of big paper so
i'll<00:02:57.280> probably<00:02:57.670> just<00:02:57.910> put<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.510> the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.820 
pieces that I keep these are all good
big<00:03:18.310> sizes<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:19.090> can<00:03:19.270> be<00:03:19.390> reused<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.230> reason

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
big sizes that can be reused the reason

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.430 
big sizes that can be reused the reason
I<00:03:20.890> do<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.580> makes<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.180> simple<00:03:22.570> to<00:03:22.750> cut

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
I do that it makes it simple to cut

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.900 
I do that it makes it simple to cut
things<00:03:23.590> out<00:03:23.830> if<00:03:24.130> you're<00:03:24.610> going<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.790> do

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
things out if you're going to do

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.070 
things out if you're going to do
something<00:03:24.940> big<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:25.480> don't<00:03:25.750> have<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.900> worry

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
something big you don't have to worry

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.020 
something big you don't have to worry
about<00:03:26.230> oh<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.769> piece<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:26.950> too<00:03:27.190> small<00:03:27.400> like

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
about oh that piece is too small like

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.850 
about oh that piece is too small like
that's<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.330> pretty<00:03:28.510> small<00:03:28.780> piece<00:03:29.050> but<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.560> kept

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
that's a pretty small piece but I kept

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's a pretty small piece but I kept
it<00:03:30.010> because<00:03:30.100> it's<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.519> skin<00:03:30.790> tone<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.239> often

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
it because it's a skin tone and often

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.720 
it because it's a skin tone and often
it's<00:03:31.840> hard<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.140> find<00:03:32.290> skin<00:03:32.620> tone<00:03:32.800> paper<00:03:33.100> so

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
it's hard to find skin tone paper so

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.240 
it's hard to find skin tone paper so
that's<00:03:34.269> why<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.600> tiny<00:03:35.019> one<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.380> in<00:03:35.530> there<00:03:35.739> but

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
that's why that tiny one is in there but

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.890 
that's why that tiny one is in there but
normally<00:03:36.820> if<00:03:37.000> you'll<00:03:37.150> look<00:03:37.330> through<00:03:37.660> you'll

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
normally if you'll look through you'll

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.550 
normally if you'll look through you'll
see<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.140> big<00:03:38.650> big<00:03:39.430> pieces<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.269> then<00:03:41.200> look

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
see just big big pieces and then look

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.920 
see just big big pieces and then look
here's<00:03:41.860> something<00:03:42.190> that<00:03:42.310> I<00:03:42.400> actually<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:43.090> made
