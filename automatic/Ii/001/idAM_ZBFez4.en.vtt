00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
sluggish like third-person shooters

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.060 
sluggish like third-person shooters

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
typically are a little bit slower than

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.200 
typically are a little bit slower than
first<00:01:24.340> person<00:01:24.640> yeah<00:01:24.789> so<00:01:24.999> they<00:01:25.090> definitely

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
first person yeah so they definitely

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.609 
first person yeah so they definitely
wanted<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.630> pay<00:01:25.749> attention<00:01:25.869> to<00:01:26.229> keeping<00:01:26.499> his

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
fast-paced as possible and so people are

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
fast-paced as possible and so people are
kind<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.659> saying<00:01:28.840> it's<00:01:29.020> like<00:01:29.109> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
kind of saying it's like a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.169 
kind of saying it's like a
counter-strike<00:01:30.189> meets<00:01:30.460> Gears<00:01:30.700> of<00:01:30.759> War<00:01:30.880> kind

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
counter-strike meets Gears of War kind

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.940 
counter-strike meets Gears of War kind
of<00:01:31.240> thing<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:31.600> your<00:01:31.840> strafing<00:01:32.289> you<00:01:32.560> can<00:01:32.710> kind

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
of thing as your strafing you can kind

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.130 
of thing as your strafing you can kind
of<00:01:33.039> like<00:01:33.490> roll<00:01:34.359> out<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:34.659> way<00:01:34.749> I<00:01:34.780> think<00:01:35.049> it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
of like roll out of the way I think it

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.569 
of like roll out of the way I think it
was<00:01:35.259> like<00:01:35.439> right<00:01:35.679> click<00:01:36.100> or<00:01:36.130> something

was like right click or something
another<00:01:37.030> element<00:01:37.450> with<00:01:37.689> third<00:01:37.960> person

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
another element with third person

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.669 
another element with third person
dynamic<00:01:39.909> is<00:01:40.060> taking<00:01:40.840> cover<00:01:41.049> when<00:01:41.439> you<00:01:41.560> don't

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
dynamic is taking cover when you don't

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:42.929 
dynamic is taking cover when you don't
want<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.859> get<00:01:41.920> shot<00:01:41.979> because<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.789> know<00:01:42.880> you

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
want to get shot because you know you

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.669 
want to get shot because you know you
can<00:01:43.149> kind<00:01:43.329> of<00:01:43.390> like<00:01:43.509> blind<00:01:43.810> fire<00:01:44.049> over<00:01:44.409> things

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
can kind of like blind fire over things

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:45.899 
can kind of like blind fire over things
and<00:01:44.859> that's<00:01:45.039> just<00:01:45.130> another<00:01:45.369> element<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.819> add

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
and that's just another element to add

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.719 
and that's just another element to add
to<00:01:46.119> it<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:47.259> other<00:01:47.530> thing<00:01:47.829> was<00:01:48.130> their<00:01:48.460> active

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
to it the other thing was their active

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.160 
to it the other thing was their active
reload<00:01:49.060> which<00:01:49.329> is<00:01:49.569> something<00:01:49.780> we're<00:01:50.139> familiar

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
reload which is something we're familiar

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.010 
reload which is something we're familiar

with from Gears of War which is not
obviously<00:01:53.020> not<00:01:53.200> weird<00:01:53.679> for<00:01:53.799> epic<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.399> do<00:01:54.549> but

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
obviously not weird for epic to do but

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.340 
obviously not weird for epic to do but
they<00:01:55.359> have<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.569> active<00:01:55.810> reload<00:01:56.079> in<00:01:56.200> there

completely multiplayer but then they

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.850 
completely multiplayer but then they
make<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:27.920> up<00:02:28.010> for<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.340> fact<00:02:28.520> that<00:02:28.640> there<00:02:28.910> are

head-to-head things but the coop is cool

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.450 
head-to-head things but the coop is cool

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
it's you know five to eight players

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.630 
it's you know five to eight players
depending<00:02:44.000> on<00:02:44.090> what<00:02:44.210> mode<00:02:44.360> you<00:02:44.480> have<00:02:44.690> again

depending on what mode you have again

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.620 
depending on what mode you have again
it's<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.760> typical<00:02:46.910> there's<00:02:47.240> an<00:02:47.330> assault

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
it's the typical there's an assault

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.870 
it's the typical there's an assault
which<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.960> like<00:02:48.110> objective<00:02:48.700> different<00:02:49.700> little

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
which is like objective different little

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.850 
which is like objective different little
missions<00:02:50.210> to<00:02:50.390> get<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.690> end<00:02:50.840> point<00:02:50.930> there's

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
missions to get to the end point there's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.430 
missions to get to the end point there's
survival<00:02:52.220> mode<00:02:52.610> which<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:52.880> zombies<00:02:53.480> which

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
survival mode which is zombies which

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.650 
survival mode which is zombies which
everybody<00:02:54.680> loves<00:02:55.130> yep<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:56.360> then<00:02:56.510> there's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
everybody loves yep and then there's

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.540 
everybody loves yep and then there's
also<00:02:56.810> invasion<00:02:57.500> mode<00:02:57.650> which<00:02:57.950> which<00:02:58.340> is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
also invasion mode which which is

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.940 
also invasion mode which which is
regular<00:02:59.330> zombies<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.930> guess<00:03:00.080> it's<00:03:00.470> just<00:03:00.530> waves

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
regular zombies I guess it's just waves

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.680 
regular zombies I guess it's just waves
of<00:03:01.310> enemies<00:03:01.700> coming<00:03:01.940> at<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.450> entire<00:03:02.570> time

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
of enemies coming at you the entire time

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.630 
of enemies coming at you the entire time
so<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> little<00:03:03.710> bit<00:03:03.800> different<00:03:04.130> than<00:03:04.370> some

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
so it's a little bit different than some

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.790 
so it's a little bit different than some
other<00:03:04.820> co-op<00:03:05.060> modes<00:03:05.330> because<00:03:05.480> in<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800
