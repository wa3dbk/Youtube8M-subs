00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello people were thick concrete today one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.460
 new video talks again and again today 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.460
 a new mail time 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.889
 there are super many responses , we are super 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 many things submitted also stay 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.789
 in to 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 and how is that point com and me 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.720
 now treat the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 responses and feedback so that is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
 very nice 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.340
 I am the first to walk and I am going 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.070
 just for a moment 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.170
 click on you and I start my 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 below i see one 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.280
 one of kees labels and it has one 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.230
 submitted intro 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.360
 hello that i wish it again 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.520
 try to get feedback here 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.530
 I made our intro with a friend 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 like to know what is the process and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.969
 what good i have more download mp4 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.860
 let's see what it looks like 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.180
 play song without sound with you 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.690
 never know with copyright 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.690
 ok there we go 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.000
 ok i assume it should be on the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.039
 music go it looks very clean 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 just enjoy getting started 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.479
 black and white also very neat that I find 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.729
 the great effect that that audio showed it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.500
 always cool and move 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.030
 probably also goes to the music now 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.159
 don't listen i do n't know or copyright 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.290
 so looks generally very tight 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.720
 from it looks very good and tasty 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 nice and flat and nice and simple too 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 I love this kind of animation gave the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 text I would do something else because 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.430
 one way it doesn't really fit now 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.500
 perhaps with the rest of van elements 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.600
 is also because the poll is and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.159
 does not necessarily say it to the font 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.110
 so try to see how it is 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.450
 if it's just flat I personally 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.740
 would make flat 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.479
 I am curious how it look like 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 sees but in general so very 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.320
 well kees sables 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.329
 to go wall of responses below last 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.580
 mail time watching the questions 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.890
 fisker 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.540
 maybe adobe muse and adobe once 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.120
 muse is in between 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.560
 specially made for designers a 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.970
 nice thing is that the actually few 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 code is used 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.080
 such as nice success him or sure 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.550
 girl is perhaps good book it 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.410
 first learn yourself but maybe 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.509
 does anyone else from 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.520
 how is it going to be experience with it 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.810
 I just have to ask when the cinema 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.970
 for that series 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.800
 I did a tutorial a while ago 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.690
 about given but that was just simple 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.100
 tutorial about an intro but I would 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.270
 can best continue with it if 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.620
 people really like it 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.350
 also leave a comment if you 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.370
 screen or think you are asking me 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.980
 how can you get in 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.890
 brackets add a slider and which 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.959
 which one do you use in brackets 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.360
 if only purely it encodes program 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.850
 coincidentally installed here too 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.500
 so your own no design can't 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.230
 add the slider but what you can do 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.300
 doing is looking for a slider and then that 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.090
 implementation is often with the jquery 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.590
 And then you can do it indeed 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.209
 e-mail file you put the genius 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.459
 brackets from was near coding program 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.840
 to implement the side so sometimes 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.880
 but then we go to the mail for a while 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.220
 and we have two loo de logos here 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.870
 faas here are my entries these are 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.269
 two runners for streetwear company 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.769
 clothing brand so want feedback 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.720
 ok first of all they are very bad 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.340
 differences it is also some corn because 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.750
 imagine you send it to customer 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.730
 then they can opt for a bit 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.830
 style and that is always nice that they 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.370
 not all have the same choice 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.989
 appear 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.970
 so you have the top lady here 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.230
 Gorge in and you have here under the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.970
 polar bear 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.380
 This is a bit you think about it 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.020
 that's great I don't know if you like that 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.540
 want to achieve it is one 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.860
 cycles per company and give 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.740
 cool that you have two funds come 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.870
 combined that can best be signed 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.370
 I am you did you make it yourself I am 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.140
 curious about the new one very well 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.130
 from it again something completely different 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.440
 i am 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.760
 this cell is really nice but it 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.440
 just purely because this is more 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.390
 appealing I think they both are something 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.430
 yet what you can possibly do is 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.320
 for example with that polar bear 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.540
 add a little more depth 3 by something else 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.510
 of course there is none here 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.610
 text with as dangerous in it 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.740
 start if people do n't get your brain right 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.660
 know that there is no text under it and 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.740
 that is under here so that is makes 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.150
 this one more powerful 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.190
 that maybe you could use this 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.760
 doing me a bit with a texture 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.230
 to work 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.300
 So it becomes all that we all 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.670
 what more plant one now seems to be whole 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.440
 very separate from this while they him 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.020
 naturally together in general 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.190
 really looks very cool from the really good you 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.200
 well done 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.180
 lode and i see here i come from just 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.799
 Frank and who always says if I have one 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.760
 have made a video and I will upload it 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.500
 premiere pro 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.570
 then I always get black edges over it 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.710
 how do I fix it if I can do this after 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.780
 take away 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.700
 I think this is up to you and the Carnation 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.260
 settings depends on your sequence 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.180
 settings you have to take a look and you 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.010
 premiere pro and therefore you in your seaqueen 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.470
 Adjust settings as he does 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.150
 same formats as the video and then 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.340
 also once more in the running settings 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.920
 that it is again the same size as the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.500
 video what you can do is if you have one 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.450
 video in premiere pro drag call 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.420
 also whether it should keep the same settings 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.890
 or adjust to the video then you must 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.420
 click that you adjust it to the 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.460
 video I think that's the problem 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.830
 I see another comment from Luc de here 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.600
 Kanter lets you do about how you treat someone 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:06.850
 nice and here say now because accelerator 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.860
 hold on to 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.720
 so nice but I assume you are with 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.370
 aftereffects I mean did it a 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.630
 done sometime after 5 so they do 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.160
 nice to explain 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.660
 it is also known with the mesh 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.570
 exactly in that you learn those techniques 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.669
 what those are very important to it 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.500
 I run into someone perfect 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.290
 just a moment to the mail and I have it here 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.270
 e-mail from kees evels and he says hello 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.070
 goes that I made this intro with 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.120
 adobe basic tracks and photo shop i want 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.040
 like to know yours was that 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.540
 you think of this intro and what's there 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.310
 you can always do the music better 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.680
 I do n't change this music 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.060
 good sound and music okay music is playing 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.710
 anyway not because i'm afraid it 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.710
 copyright is but let's see 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.510
 ok I think I really like it 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.510
 those young girls anyway nice I know 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.220
 done picoway and that write effects 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.540
 will on and it generally looks 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.639
 just be very good at what you might be 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.639
 can do is the animations slightly faster 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.979
 have it made because now the intro is taking 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.780
 total i think 9 seconds and now you have 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.550
 seen it already so you would do the animation 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.110
 for example cells can do but 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.060
 minor adjustments in itself perhaps 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.580
 you can also have a must over it 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.070
 do so he doesn't mix you up 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.710
 now we go see the campsite stevie 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.940
 and since 2015 I am mixed up 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.310
 personally think it might still be 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.139
 something nicer is if you put it as your mask 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.820
 about a doing is a mas with a beyond 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.440
 at the top and at the bottom 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.520
 that they come up out of nowhere 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.810
 as it were 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.790
 but for the rest it looks very good 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.500
 case you also have very cool work steering wheel 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.389
 that after submitting and I will do that 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.070
 could or if you have a question ask him 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:44.710
 then here in the comments where are you now 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.660
 still curious about some more feedback click 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.280
 then as the upper right because I have 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.080
 I also wrote a blog post where I was 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.669
 handle some more emails 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.470
 no to subscribe here and then I see 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.470
 bye next time
