that we like to harbor bout with our
solid<00:00:55.350> state<00:00:55.469> drives<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.579> have

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
solid state drives is we have

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.439 
solid state drives is we have
best-in-class<00:00:58.340> sustained<00:00:59.340> performance<00:00:59.520> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
best-in-class sustained performance so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.150 
best-in-class sustained performance so
now<00:01:00.719> what<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.899> means<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.710> soon<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.070> you

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
now what that means is as soon as you

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
now what that means is as soon as you
take<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> drive<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.570> into

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
take a drive out and you put it into

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.260 
take a drive out and you put it into
your<00:01:03.750> machine<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.920> performance<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.729> going

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
your machine your performance is going

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.740 
your machine your performance is going
to<00:01:06.420> degrade<00:01:07.460> with<00:01:08.460> art<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.970> our<00:01:09.150> occ<00:01:09.570> drive

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
to degrade with art with our occ drive

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
