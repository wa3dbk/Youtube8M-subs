know I can used to be relatively cheap
and<00:05:03.400> then<00:05:03.550> they<00:05:03.760> went<00:05:03.850> through<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.240> revamp<00:05:04.900> a

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
and then they went through a revamp a

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.170 
and then they went through a revamp a
rehaul<00:05:05.470> and<00:05:05.860> now<00:05:06.010> everything's<00:05:06.520> rather

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
rehaul and now everything's rather

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.780 
rehaul and now everything's rather
expensive<00:05:07.630> in<00:05:08.080> my<00:05:08.229> opinion<00:05:08.620> um<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.520> don't

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
expensive in my opinion um I don't

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.070 
expensive in my opinion um I don't
really<00:05:09.940> know<00:05:10.090> what<00:05:10.270> happened<00:05:10.510> that<00:05:10.600> I<00:05:10.840> know

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
really know what happened that I know

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.350 
really know what happened that I know
they<00:05:11.289> went<00:05:11.470> through<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.650> revamp<00:05:12.039> but<00:05:13.030> this<00:05:13.210> is

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
they went through a revamp but this is

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.330 
they went through a revamp but this is
actually<00:05:13.660> 10<00:05:13.900> pounds<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:14.590> that's<00:05:14.740> pretty<00:05:15.070> much

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
actually 10 pounds so that's pretty much

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.240 
actually 10 pounds so that's pretty much
the<00:05:15.550> cost<00:05:15.760> of<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:15.970> box<00:05:16.650> without<00:05:17.650> posting<00:05:18.130> and

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
the cost of the box without posting and

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.710 
the cost of the box without posting and
packing<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:18.639> that's<00:05:18.820> kind<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.210> paper<00:05:19.419> the<00:05:19.539> box

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
packing so that's kind of paper the box

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.990 
packing so that's kind of paper the box
anyway<00:05:20.229> so<00:05:20.500> I<00:05:20.530> really<00:05:20.979> thinks<00:05:21.280> that<00:05:21.400> calm<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.789> do

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
anyway so I really thinks that calm I do

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.940 
anyway so I really thinks that calm I do
a<00:05:22.030> lot<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.570> they<00:05:22.960> do<00:05:23.110> put<00:05:23.350> like<00:05:23.530> they<00:05:23.740> tend

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
a lot of that they do put like they tend

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.290 
a lot of that they do put like they tend
to<00:05:23.979> put<00:05:24.100> in<00:05:24.220> one<00:05:24.430> product<00:05:24.700> which<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.270> really

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
to put in one product which is really

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.570 
to put in one product which is really
kind<00:05:25.870> of<00:05:25.960> expensive<00:05:26.440> and<00:05:26.560> pays<00:05:26.830> for<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.160> box<00:05:27.370> in

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
kind of expensive and pays for a box in

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.940 
kind of expensive and pays for a box in
itself<00:05:27.940> which<00:05:28.150> i<00:05:28.270> think<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.630> nice<00:05:28.840> idea<00:05:29.289> so

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
itself which i think is a nice idea so

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.820
