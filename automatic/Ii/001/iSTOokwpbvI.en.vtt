the giant and wizard plus some archers
almost<00:00:39.809> similar<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.470> comp<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.370> he<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
almost similar to my comp but he is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910 
almost similar to my comp but he is
missing<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.149> healer<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.230> he<00:00:43.620> did<00:00:43.800> bring

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
missing that healer but he did bring

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.430 
missing that healer but he did bring
along<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.310> heal<00:00:44.700> spell<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.150> well<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:46.110> good

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
along a heal spell as well and a good

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.580 
along a heal spell as well and a good
fair<00:00:47.220> amount<00:00:47.490> of<00:00:47.670> wizards<00:00:48.540> but<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> would<00:00:49.410> say

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
fair amount of wizards but I would say

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
fair amount of wizards but I would say
that<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.010> want<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.400> turn<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> into<00:00:50.880> like

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
that if you want to turn this into like

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.080 
that if you want to turn this into like
a<00:00:51.420> legitimate<00:00:52.260> farming<00:00:52.950> type<00:00:53.100> army<00:00:53.580> then<00:00:54.060> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
a legitimate farming type army then I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
a legitimate farming type army then I
would<00:00:54.540> try<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.960> remove<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.250> bit<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
would try to remove a little bit of the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
would try to remove a little bit of the
Wizards<00:00:57.060> mainly<00:00:57.450> because<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.990> are<00:00:58.140> costly

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
Wizards mainly because they are costly

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.610 
Wizards mainly because they are costly
for<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.360> training<00:01:00.900> time<00:01:01.200> that<00:01:01.470> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
for one and the training time that it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.800 
for one and the training time that it
takes<00:01:01.950> is<00:01:02.280> around<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.420> said<00:01:03.630> eight

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810 
takes is around like I said eight

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.649 
takes is around like I said eight
minutes<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.799> that's<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.430> per<00:01:05.790> wizard<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
minutes so that's a per wizard so you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
minutes so that's a per wizard so you
don't<00:01:06.930> really<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:08.060> have<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.270> hinder

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
don't really want to have that hinder

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
don't really want to have that hinder
your<00:01:10.320> ability<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.310> raid<00:01:11.520> back<00:01:11.759> to<00:01:11.970> back<00:01:12.149> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
your ability to raid back to back to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
your ability to raid back to back to
back<00:01:12.329> because<00:01:12.869> farming<00:01:13.649> is<00:01:13.799> also<00:01:14.220> about<00:01:14.280> turn

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
back because farming is also about turn

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.910 
back because farming is also about turn
around<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.540> minimizing<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> amount<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
around and minimizing the amount of

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
around and minimizing the amount of
downtime<00:01:17.460> between<00:01:17.670> rates<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.659> why

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
downtime between rates that's why

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.710 
downtime between rates that's why
bartsch<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.830> successful<00:01:20.510> even<00:01:21.510> though<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
bartsch is so successful even though it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
bartsch is so successful even though it
does<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.170> its<00:01:22.350> limitations<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:23.159> terms<00:01:23.190> of

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
does have its limitations in terms of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.910 
does have its limitations in terms of
power<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.870> have<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.290> sort<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
power but here we do have the sort of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.039 
power but here we do have the sort of
giant<00:01:26.190> wizard<00:01:26.670> Archer<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.510> sort<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> breaking

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
giant wizard Archer is sort of breaking

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.410 
giant wizard Archer is sort of breaking
into<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.620> middle<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> base<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> also

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
into the middle of that base and also

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.649 
into the middle of that base and also
taking<00:01:30.780> advantage<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.920> elixir<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
taking advantage of the elixir and the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.960 
taking advantage of the elixir and the
gold<00:01:34.020> collectors<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.190> pretty<00:01:35.580> full<00:01:35.760> at

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
gold collectors that are pretty full at

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.330 
gold collectors that are pretty full at
this<00:01:36.120> time<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.200> actually<00:01:37.500> didn't<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.159> all

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
this time now he actually didn't get all

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
this time now he actually didn't get all
of<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> loot<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> collectors<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
of the loot in the collectors but

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.289 
of the loot in the collectors but
overall<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.830> really<00:01:41.250> good<00:01:41.610> rate<00:01:41.850> he

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
overall it was a really good rate he

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420 
overall it was a really good rate he
does<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.690> a<00:01:42.750> few<00:01:43.080> seconds<00:01:43.590> left<00:01:43.830> or<00:01:44.010> so<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
does have a few seconds left or so and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.240 
does have a few seconds left or so and
that<00:01:44.909> Archer<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.330> just<00:01:45.799> shooting<00:01:46.799> away<00:01:47.010> at

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that Archer is just shooting away at

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.940 
that Archer is just shooting away at
that<00:01:47.460> wall<00:01:47.760> and<00:01:48.000> he<00:01:48.720> probably<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.830> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that wall and he probably is going to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.030 
that wall and he probably is going to
get<00:01:50.070> maybe<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.850> little<00:01:51.210> bit<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.440> that<00:01:52.680> gold

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
get maybe a little bit more in that gold

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
get maybe a little bit more in that gold
collector<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.580> I'm<00:01:53.700> gonna<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:53.940> ahead<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
collector but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.750 
collector but I'm gonna go ahead and
speed<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.439> raid<00:01:55.740> alright<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.580> did

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
side of the base at first I was

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.080 
side of the base at first I was
wondering<00:02:24.160> well<00:02:24.310> maybe<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.670> should<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.879> like

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
wondering well maybe I should just like

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.970 
wondering well maybe I should just like
pick<00:02:25.300> a<00:02:25.330> side<00:02:25.599> rather<00:02:26.170> than<00:02:26.349> just<00:02:26.650> going

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
pick a side rather than just going

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.430 
pick a side rather than just going
straight<00:02:27.250> from<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.640> bottom<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:28.690> i<00:02:28.720> decided<00:02:29.319> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
straight from the bottom so i decided to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.309 
straight from the bottom so i decided to
sort<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:29.980> deal<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.420> barbarian<00:02:32.110> king

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
sort of deal with the barbarian king

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.380 
sort of deal with the barbarian king
take<00:02:32.860> him<00:02:32.980> down<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.190> really<00:02:33.519> early<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:33.849> then<00:02:34.120> i

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
take him down to really early and then i

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.940 
take him down to really early and then i
only<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.050> really<00:02:35.319> worry<00:02:35.560> about<00:02:35.620> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
only have to really worry about the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.160 
only have to really worry about the
archer<00:02:36.280> queen<00:02:36.519> which<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.630> little<00:02:37.959> bit<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.140> a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
archer queen which is a little bit of a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.199 
archer queen which is a little bit of a
nuisance<00:02:38.349> but<00:02:38.650> i<00:02:38.800> wanted<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.310> maybe<00:02:39.610> deal<00:02:39.940> with

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
nuisance but i wanted to maybe deal with

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.570 
nuisance but i wanted to maybe deal with
her<00:02:40.360> last<00:02:40.900> when<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.530> pekka's<00:02:42.040> are<00:02:42.250> placed

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
town hall and then we do get that one

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.640 
town hall and then we do get that one
star<00:03:23.769> 34%<00:03:24.760> there<00:03:25.420> goes<00:03:25.690> those<00:03:25.989> multi

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650

targeting infernos and we took down one
of<00:03:29.319> them<00:03:29.560> now<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.069> do<00:03:30.220> have<00:03:30.400> some<00:03:30.850> archers<00:03:31.269> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
of them now I do have some archers and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.530 
of them now I do have some archers and
some<00:03:32.079> Wizards<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.040> can<00:03:33.370> use<00:03:33.700> while<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
some Wizards that I can use while the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.050 
some Wizards that I can use while the
archer<00:03:35.079> towers<00:03:35.470> are<00:03:35.680> focusing<00:03:36.370> on<00:03:36.519> my<00:03:36.670> archer

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
archer towers are focusing on my archer

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.240 
archer towers are focusing on my archer
Queen<00:03:37.389> and<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.319> did<00:03:38.440> take<00:03:38.680> down<00:03:38.920> some<00:03:39.220> of

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
Queen and so we did take down some of

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.819 
Queen and so we did take down some of
the<00:03:39.750> collectors<00:03:40.750> on<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.989> top<00:03:41.200> left<00:03:41.410> side<00:03:41.650> and

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
the collectors on the top left side and

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.920 
the collectors on the top left side and
here<00:03:42.459> we<00:03:42.700> have<00:03:42.819> another<00:03:42.910> perfect<00:03:43.480> setup<00:03:43.690> with

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
here we have another perfect setup with

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.680 
here we have another perfect setup with
the<00:03:44.019> golems<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.010> defenses<00:03:45.850> are<00:03:46.000> focusing<00:03:46.540> on

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
the golems the defenses are focusing on

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.319
