00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.590
 good to data attached to a new video 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.080
 pretty interesting news 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.050
 one could be described as ghostly 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.150
 others may not but knowing it 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.010
 people who prove that everything is enough 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 possible good believes that the developer 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.109
 of crisis and the world since you had 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 you already know that the game has 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.069
 had like more brutal recognition 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 I told them your graphics did not conquer your 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:27.630
 color that was second pc was 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 truly impressive the jump 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.739
 for saying some ways that they gave like 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.579
 it really can be from hamas maybe in 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:37.500
 ridiculous consoles to see that that 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.649
 It was a very brutal thing, not because it was not 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.160
 truth with crysis 2 it seems that the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.289
 thing changed totally consoles came out 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 also and really for the graphics that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.230
 had was also very impressive of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.489
 fact that people keep assuring that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.489
 with the president of crytek si dades 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.550
 works said that almost no game has been 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.019
 the best graphically or technically the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.210
 success because I could not make a few 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.409
 how many I do not really know but yes it is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.719
 true that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 they have been a game very very really very 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.259
 good any graphic the graphic lung 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.170
 It's pretty good for you with crisis 3 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.170
 the thing changes and they say they will use 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.840
 imagine those that 99 of the power of 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.719
 xbox 360 and playstation 3 will only leave one 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.810
 1% potential and will recognize a way 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:26.969
 it seems that they say even that it will be the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.439
 game that best looks on xbox 360 and 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.700
 playstation 3 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.189
 we will see to see that it is not a ghost 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.929
 they relaxed the real but really like 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.539
 I say credit that everything is possible 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.329
 you really have a crisis TV 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.629
 crisis 3 in the description by sigre 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.549
 happen to read it and really as I say 

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:47.069
 surely since I started being much more 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.599
 brutal that in consoles is clear but 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.280
 well we will see to see if it is true if it is 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.079
 true that it really is a game that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.319
 exploits 99 percent of capacity 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.209
 of the consoles as I say we will see 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.560
 see because it's something quite curious about 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.270
 see and hopefully it's not a ghost 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.859
 anyway, there is little left for 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.469
 them to find out you know in the end 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.509
 February 2013 also has many 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.129
 games in early 2013 with which 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.060
 it's going to be quite spectacular what 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.530
 what are we going to see 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.170
 and well we always talk about this one 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.450
 that is at the height that gets 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.430
 even surpass the stanzas in 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.540
 graphics subjects because really it 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.310
 I think it's him 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.050
 perhaps the last exponent that remains are 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.480
 and in terms of exclusivity it's for 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.239
 demonstrate the power that they have today more 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.330
 coming from the naughty dog ​​band 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.910
 what can you do to make a way 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.709
 so we'll see if you believe 6-3 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.450
 the game that will be best in console is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.730
 will lose 99 percent of the thing 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.200
 power of the consoles and if it's true 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.450
 that the first to the maximum as well as not 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.260
 we were waiting for the game and nothing 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.260
 See you at the next one
