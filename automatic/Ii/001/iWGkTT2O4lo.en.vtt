my<00:00:00.719> kit<00:00:01.290> flash<00:00:01.680> suggestion<00:00:02.490> for<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.790> variation

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
my kit flash suggestion for a variation

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.150 
my kit flash suggestion for a variation
on<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.659> Megatron<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.589> tidal<00:00:04.890> wave

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
on the Megatron and tidal wave

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.990 
on the Megatron and tidal wave
abomination<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.189> is<00:00:08.639> their<00:00:08.910> combined<00:00:09.389> mode

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
abomination that is their combined mode

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.950 
abomination that is their combined mode
so<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.389> ways<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.230> suggested<00:00:14.809> kind<00:00:15.809> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
so here is ways it's suggested kind of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.609 
so here is ways it's suggested kind of
the<00:00:16.230> legs

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the legs

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.900 
the legs
tidal<00:00:17.070> wave<00:00:17.100> legs<00:00:17.520> become<00:00:18.000> wings<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.570> back

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
tidal wave legs become wings in the back

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.260 
tidal wave legs become wings in the back
ish

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
ish

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.890 
ish
um<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> things<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:23.580> people<00:00:24.330> complain

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
um but the things that people complain

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.349 
um but the things that people complain
about<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.439> mode<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.830> number<00:00:26.070> one

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
about with this mode is number one

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.670 
about with this mode is number one
everything<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.510> our<00:00:27.689> movements<00:00:28.170> drastically

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
everything is our movements drastically

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
everything is our movements drastically
by<00:00:28.890> giving<00:00:29.160> him<00:00:29.279> these<00:00:29.429> big<00:00:29.670> wings<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
by giving him these big wings in the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.540 
by giving him these big wings in the
back<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:31.230> seems<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.399> could

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
back it seems it's not like you could

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.280 
back it seems it's not like you could
move<00:00:32.669> via<00:00:32.910> Terry<00:00:33.149> much<00:00:33.329> anyway<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.750> it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
move via Terry much anyway but it

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.680 
move via Terry much anyway but it
impedes<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:34.920> well<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.579> his<00:00:36.000> legs<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.450> still

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
impedes it as well as his legs are still

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.030 
impedes it as well as his legs are still
kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.020> small<00:00:37.260> now<00:00:37.440> they've<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> good

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
kind of small now they've got a good

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310 
kind of small now they've got a good
base<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.850> they<00:00:39.090> can<00:00:39.329> even<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:39.840> fan<00:00:40.079> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
base that they can even still fan and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.319 
base that they can even still fan and
support<00:00:40.649> twenty<00:00:41.399> found<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> plastic<00:00:41.940> that's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
support twenty found the plastic that's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.970 
support twenty found the plastic that's
pretty<00:00:42.930> impressive<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.410> its<00:00:43.530> own<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:45.410> if<00:00:46.410> they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
pretty impressive on its own but if they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
pretty impressive on its own but if they
don't<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.370> much<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.730> his<00:00:47.850> legs<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.239> just<00:00:48.719> kind

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
don't do much for his legs you just kind

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.380 
don't do much for his legs you just kind
of<00:00:48.930> add<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.350> backpack<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> hands<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:50.700> so

of add the backpack and hands on top so
what<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> did<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.890> instead<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.690> going

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
what I did is instead of this is going

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
what I did is instead of this is going
to<00:00:54.870> clip<00:00:55.079> on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.850> just<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> be

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
to clip on the same way just going to be

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.459 
to clip on the same way just going to be
upside<00:00:57.809> down<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:00.410> open<00:01:01.410> up

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
upside down here like this and open up

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.870 
upside down here like this and open up
tied<00:01:01.710> away<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.100> legs<00:01:04.100> feet<00:01:06.380> his<00:01:07.880> little

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
tied away with legs feet his little

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.660 
tied away with legs feet his little
cargo<00:01:09.180> seat<00:01:09.930> community<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.590> seats<00:01:10.979> pull<00:01:11.430> those

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
cargo seat community on seats pull those

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.750 
cargo seat community on seats pull those
out<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.430> we're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
out like this and so we're going to

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
out like this and so we're going to
click<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.420> back<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.200> before<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:16.860> do<00:01:17.040> I'm

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
click that back in before we do I'm

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
click that back in before we do I'm
going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> push<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.110> not

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
going to push these down like this not

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.870 
going to push these down like this not
only<00:01:19.860> does<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.729> way

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
only does it get them out of the way

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.570 
only does it get them out of the way
from<00:01:21.210> his<00:01:21.390> legs<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.310> supports

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
from his legs but it actually supports

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
from his legs but it actually supports
the<00:01:24.240> frontage<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.990> wasn't<00:01:25.259> idle<00:01:25.470> wave<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.740> his

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the frontage I wasn't idle wave on his

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.789 
the frontage I wasn't idle wave on his
own<00:01:26.070> won't<00:01:26.909> support<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> weight<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:28.650> way

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
own won't support the weight the way

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.429 
own won't support the weight the way
that<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.299> centered<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> back<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that it's centered in the back like that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
that it's centered in the back like that
it<00:01:31.650> almost<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.310> quite<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.729> add<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it almost does but not quite these add a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.429 
it almost does but not quite these add a
huge<00:01:33.240> stability<00:01:33.689> look<00:01:33.810> at<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:33.960> lines<00:01:34.290> up

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
huge stability look at that lines up

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.030 
huge stability look at that lines up
almost<00:01:34.710> perfect<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.030> made<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.040> so

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
almost perfect it was made to do so so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.999 
almost perfect it was made to do so so
now<00:01:40.820> you're<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:41.850> only<00:01:42.210> free<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.320> Megatron

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
now you're not only free up Megatron

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.480 
now you're not only free up Megatron
arms<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.909> give<00:01:45.810> him<00:01:45.960> some<00:01:46.369> shoulder<00:01:47.369> space

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.140 

that<00:01:52.210> is<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:54.640> there<00:01:54.820> we<00:01:54.940> go<00:01:55.120> I<00:01:56.970> like<00:01:57.970> make

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
that is right there we go I like make

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.660 
that is right there we go I like make
these<00:01:58.330> kind<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.720> picture<00:01:59.110> things<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.800> when

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
these kind of picture things that when

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.570 
these kind of picture things that when
was<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:01.000> gun<00:02:01.240> type<00:02:01.570> thing<00:02:01.810> man<00:02:01.960> good<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.800> so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
was the gun type thing man good and so

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:12.000 
was the gun type thing man good and so
now<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:09.490> can<00:02:09.550> see<00:02:09.850> his<00:02:10.090> feet<00:02:10.360> position<00:02:11.110> so

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
now you can see his feet position so

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.420 
now you can see his feet position so
instead<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.700> his<00:02:13.030> feet<00:02:13.300> being<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:15.160> put<00:02:15.310> him

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
instead of his feet being he put him

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.650 
instead of his feet being he put him
like<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.640> then<00:02:15.850> he's<00:02:15.940> doing<00:02:16.150> David<00:02:16.360> Blaine

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
like that then he's doing David Blaine

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.220 
like that then he's doing David Blaine
levitation<00:02:17.350> tricks<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:19.209> because<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.930> way

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
levitation tricks but because of the way

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.920 
levitation tricks but because of the way
that<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.530> feet<00:02:20.740> have<00:02:20.980> those<00:02:21.160> angles<00:02:21.930> mega

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
that the feet have those angles mega

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.500 
that the feet have those angles mega
Johnny<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:24.880> kind<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.150> make<00:02:25.300> him<00:02:25.390> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
Johnny then you can kind of make him so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.690 
Johnny then you can kind of make him so
he<00:02:25.690> still<00:02:25.930> got<00:02:26.050> some<00:02:26.560> tattoos<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:27.640> you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
he still got some tattoos but now you

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.060 
he still got some tattoos but now you
can<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:27.970> he's<00:02:28.239> got<00:02:28.420> more<00:02:28.630> leg<00:02:29.140> bulk<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:29.830> only

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
can see he's got more leg bulk not only

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.050 
can see he's got more leg bulk not only
backwards<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.270> which<00:02:32.170> wise<00:02:32.820> they're<00:02:33.820> still

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
backwards but which wise they're still

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.510 
backwards but which wise they're still
separated<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.800> gives<00:02:35.950> us<00:02:36.040> an<00:02:36.190> extra<00:02:36.400> like

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
separated so it gives us an extra like

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.830 
separated so it gives us an extra like
bulk<00:02:36.730> um<00:02:37.500> some<00:02:38.500> extra<00:02:38.880> weight<00:02:39.880> stance<00:02:40.300> wise<00:02:40.630> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
bulk um some extra weight stance wise I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.220 
bulk um some extra weight stance wise I
guess<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.170> could<00:02:41.350> say<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:42.540> arm<00:02:43.540> pose<00:02:43.750> ability

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
guess you could say and arm pose ability

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.030 
guess you could say and arm pose ability
now<00:02:45.300> that's<00:02:46.300> pretty<00:02:46.450> much<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.780> it's<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.860> tip

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
now that's pretty much it it's a tip

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.440 
now that's pretty much it it's a tip
that<00:02:48.070> some<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.610> will<00:02:48.760> not<00:02:49.090> even<00:02:49.209> bother

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
that some of you will not even bother

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.020 
that some of you will not even bother
doing<00:02:49.870> because<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.830> means<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.760> take

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
doing because that means I have to take

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.670 
doing because that means I have to take
out<00:02:52.180> those<00:02:52.360> toys<00:02:52.600> again<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.500> really
