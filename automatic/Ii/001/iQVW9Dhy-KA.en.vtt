00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.760 
dumbbells to the side or to make it even
more<00:04:34.500> challenging<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.340> then<00:04:36.090> put<00:04:36.300> that

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
more challenging and then put that

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.470 
more challenging and then put that
letter<00:04:37.770> leg<00:04:38.070> onto<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.580> pad<00:04:38.820> all<00:04:39.090> right<00:04:39.300> here

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
letter leg onto that pad all right here

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.020 
letter leg onto that pad all right here
we<00:04:39.510> go<00:04:39.660> here<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.140> go<00:04:40.200> just<00:04:40.380> hold<00:04:40.590> my<00:04:40.710> hand<00:04:40.890> okay

so we're adding so you're gonna drop
down<00:04:46.310> so<00:04:47.310> now<00:04:47.490> we<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.700> hip<00:04:48.690> strength<00:04:49.670> his

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670 
down so now we have hip strength his

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.730 
down so now we have hip strength his
glutes<00:04:51.000> are<00:04:51.150> working<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.660> coors<00:04:52.230> working

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
glutes are working is coors working

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.520 
glutes are working is coors working
there's<00:04:53.280> instability<00:04:54.150> very<00:04:54.690> good<00:04:55.050> they<00:04:55.230> lots

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
there's instability very good they lots

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.200 
there's instability very good they lots
working<00:04:55.950> right<00:04:56.100> about<00:04:56.280> now<00:04:56.490> I<00:04:56.520> very<00:04:57.030> good

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
sweat good nice all right and then the

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.260 
sweat good nice all right and then the
other<00:05:01.920> things<00:05:02.160> we<00:05:02.310> do<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.610> do<00:05:02.700> a<00:05:02.730> lot<00:05:02.820> of<00:05:02.940> core

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
other things we do you do a lot of core

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.230 
other things we do you do a lot of core
work<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.930> we<00:05:04.050> do<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.170> lot<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.350> bridging<00:05:04.890> on<00:05:05.640> the

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
work so we do a lot of bridging on the

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.730 
work so we do a lot of bridging on the
side<00:05:06.480> but<00:05:06.840> we<00:05:07.050> do<00:05:07.170> a<00:05:07.200> lot<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.410> work<00:05:07.590> with<00:05:07.710> a

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
side but we do a lot of work with a

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.860 
side but we do a lot of work with a
stability<00:05:08.100> ball<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.970> this<00:05:09.060> again<00:05:09.390> creates

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
stability ball and this again creates

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.780 
stability ball and this again creates
instability<00:05:10.320> if<00:05:11.130> you<00:05:11.250> want<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.460> create<00:05:11.670> an

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
instability if you want to create an

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.670 
instability if you want to create an
unstable<00:05:12.150> environment<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.900> getting<00:05:13.410> into<00:05:13.650> a

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
unstable environment so getting into a

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.590 
unstable environment so getting into a
little<00:05:13.800> 45-degree<00:05:14.550> push-up<00:05:14.940> position<00:05:15.060> here

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
little 45-degree push-up position here

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.750 
little 45-degree push-up position here
what<00:05:16.260> we'll<00:05:16.410> do<00:05:16.560> is<00:05:16.740> you're<00:05:17.460> going<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.610> prove

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
what we'll do is you're going to prove

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.980 
what we'll do is you're going to prove
your<00:05:17.910> hands<00:05:18.090> out<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.300> little<00:05:18.600> bit<00:05:18.720> from<00:05:18.840> the

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
your hands out a little bit from the

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.750 
your hands out a little bit from the
bottom<00:05:19.350> more<00:05:19.980> you<00:05:20.100> move<00:05:20.220> your<00:05:20.370> hands<00:05:20.550> out<00:05:20.700> the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
bottom more you move your hands out the

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.200 
bottom more you move your hands out the
more<00:05:21.000> challenging<00:05:21.210> it<00:05:21.570> is

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
more challenging it is

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.540 
more challenging it is
it's<00:05:22.990> been<00:05:23.169> 40<00:05:23.680> gravity<00:05:23.979> we<00:05:24.069> push<00:05:24.280> up<00:05:24.430> position

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
it's been 40 gravity we push up position

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.189 
it's been 40 gravity we push up position
okay<00:05:25.360> all<00:05:25.509> right<00:05:25.630> you're<00:05:25.750> just<00:05:25.900> going<00:05:26.020> to<00:05:26.080> hold

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
okay all right you're just going to hold

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.689 
okay all right you're just going to hold
that<00:05:26.289> position<00:05:26.470> i'll<00:05:26.830> roll<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.310> ball<00:05:27.490> out<00:05:27.669> a

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
that position i'll roll the ball out a

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.240 
that position i'll roll the ball out a
little<00:05:28.000> bit<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:29.410> i<00:05:29.440> could<00:05:29.710> everyone<00:05:29.949> here

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
little bit so i could everyone here

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.339 
little bit so i could everyone here
before<00:05:30.550> and<00:05:31.449> then<00:05:31.599> it<00:05:31.690> also<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:32.050> make<00:05:32.259> it<00:05:32.319> a

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349
