00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.699 
do get my fingers in a little milk and
Pat<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.009> top<00:02:04.219> of<00:02:04.459> each<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.999> the<00:02:05.509> scones<00:02:05.810> this

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
Pat the top of each of the scones this

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:08.580 
Pat the top of each of the scones this
is<00:02:06.859> going<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.189> add<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.639> little<00:02:07.880> bit<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.090> shine

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
is going to add a little bit of shine

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.500 
is going to add a little bit of shine
but<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:09.799> I<00:02:10.039> can<00:02:10.280> sprinkle<00:02:10.580> poppy<00:02:11.000> seeds<00:02:11.360> on

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
but then I can sprinkle poppy seeds on

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.680 
but then I can sprinkle poppy seeds on
top<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.019> they'll<00:02:12.140> stick

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
top and they'll stick

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.570 
top and they'll stick
