difference<00:04:16.450> between<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.930> soft<00:04:17.230> and<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
difference between the soft and the

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.770 
difference between the soft and the
sauce<00:04:18.130> see<00:04:18.400> how<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.910> over<00:04:19.299> here<00:04:19.480> looks<00:04:19.660> a

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
sauce see how this over here looks a

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.140 
sauce see how this over here looks a
little<00:04:19.900> bigger<00:04:20.169> than<00:04:20.380> this<00:04:20.530> one<00:04:20.769> so<00:04:21.150> that's

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
little bigger than this one so that's

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.810 
little bigger than this one so that's
why<00:04:22.390> I<00:04:22.450> always<00:04:22.990> put<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.560> little<00:04:23.740> deeper<00:04:24.520> shade

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
why I always put a little deeper shade

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.060 
why I always put a little deeper shade
out<00:04:25.180> here<00:04:25.630> in<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.840> outer<00:04:25.990> V<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.740> gives

blend<00:05:04.630> everything<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:05.470> usually<00:05:06.310> always<00:05:06.550> do

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
blend everything I usually always do

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.030 
blend everything I usually always do
this<00:05:07.390> with<00:05:07.600> my<00:05:07.750> crease<00:05:08.020> color<00:05:08.290> it<00:05:08.590> just<00:05:08.620> makes

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
this with my crease color it just makes

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.240 
this with my crease color it just makes
everything<00:05:09.490> look<00:05:09.700> more<00:05:09.940> blended<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:11.080> know<00:05:11.919> it

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
everything look more blended I know it

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.430 
everything look more blended I know it
kind<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.580> seems<00:05:12.880> like<00:05:13.060> maybe<00:05:13.540> an<00:05:13.750> unnecessary

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
kind of seems like maybe an unnecessary

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.900 
kind of seems like maybe an unnecessary
step<00:05:14.860> but<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.250> can<00:05:15.400> make<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.700> biggest

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
step but it can make the biggest

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.610 
step but it can make the biggest
difference<00:05:16.150> just<00:05:16.780> to<00:05:16.840> add<00:05:17.050> a<00:05:17.350> little

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
difference just to add a little

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.080 
difference just to add a little
something<00:05:18.100> different<00:05:18.220> to<00:05:18.550> this<00:05:18.669> look<00:05:18.910> I'm
