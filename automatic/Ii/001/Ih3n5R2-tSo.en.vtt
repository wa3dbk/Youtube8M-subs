00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.710
Hi, I'm Dr. Josh Axe and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.910
Today we're going to be making turkey burgers
and we're going to be putting that on a bed

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.720
of lettuce along with some saut�ed vegetables.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.010
And the best thing about this recipe is it's
quick, it's easy, it doesn't take a whole

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.110
lot of ingredients, and so this is something
that's even for the most inexperienced person

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.110
in the kitchen.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.360
It's again, very easy and doesn't take a lot
of time to cook.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.540
So what we're going to do is we're going to
start off with the turkey, okay?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.330
So we've got some ground turkey here that
we picked up from the store and we're going

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.740
to mix this with a few other spices just to
kind of add some flavor to it.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.190
So we're going to go ahead and start off and
just take this turkey and we're going to put

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.870
it in a bowl.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.430
The next thing we're going to do is we're
going to add in some spices.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.710
So we're going to start off adding in a little
bit of cumin.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.070
Just kind of sprinkle that on there.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.740
Next thing we're going to add is curry, yellow
curry powder.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:41.811
From there, we're going to add on just a little
bit of sea salt, then some black pepper, and

00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:44.899
finally we're going to add in a little bit
of Bragg's Liquid Amino Acid.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.720
This is from fermented soy sauce.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.740
Just squeeze a little bit of that in there.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.729
And then we're ready to get it mixing.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.439
Now, while I mix it up, we're actually going
to get this pan heated up.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.270
All right, the next thing we're going to do
is add in grapeseed oil.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.420
And the reason why we use grapeseed oil rather
than canola oil or vegetable oil is it doesn't

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.910
oxidize under heating, so it has a higher
heat threshold.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.160
Also, that's also why we don't use olive oil.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.780
Olive oil has a certain heat threshold.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.470
If you go above medium heat, it's going to
oxidize and go from being a good fat to a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.470
bad fat.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.120
And so we use things like grapeseed oil, coconut
oil, organic butter for cooking.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.420
But grapeseed oil has a lighter flavor and
that's why we're using it in this dish.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.670
So you just take a little bit of grapeseed
oil, you don't have to go too crazy, just

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.940
a little bit in there.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.340
And then the next thing we're going to do
is we're going to start mixing up these turkey

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.480
burgers.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.620
Mix up all the spices, the seasonings in there.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.290
And once we get that, we're going to take
them and we're just going to make them into

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.330
patties, like so.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:07.430
We're going to make about four patties here.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.890
All right, so the turkey burgers have been
cooking about five minutes on this one side,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.890
now we're going to flip them over and let
them cook about three more minutes.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.680
So, simple enough, just take your spatula
here, get these things flipped over.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.760
All right.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.110
And do about three more minutes and they'll
be ready to serve.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.140
All right, now that the burgers are done cooking,
we're going to start saut�ing the vegetables.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.400
And while the vegetables saut�, we're going
to take these burgers and we're going to place

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.030
them in the oven at about 350 heat, just to
keep them warm as we saut� the vegetables.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.890
And so, simple enough, just take the burgers,
and go ahead and put them in a glass plate

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.560
here.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.340
And get them in the oven there.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.900
Again, bake for about 350.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.360
And then we're going to use this same oil,
same pan to saut� the vegetables in.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.540
Now I am going to add in a little bit more
grape seed oil here, in the pan.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.250
Now what we have, starting off, is we've got
some red bell peppers we sliced up.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.610
So we're going to just kind of dump those
in the pan here.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.620
We have some zucchini that we sliced up, going
to add those as well.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.890
Onion, we've got chopped up, red onion there.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.900
And also, some chopped small little green
onions here, we're going to add in those as

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.900
well.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.070
And so we're going to take all this.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.640
And we're going to throw in some spices as
well.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.440
We're going to use a little bit more of this
Bragg's Liquid Amino, which is fermented soy

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.210
sauce, just to kind of add a little flavor
here.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.310
We'll kind of throw that on, like so.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.220
We're going to take a little bit of this Celtic
sea salt, sprinkle that on.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.510
And then we're going to do more black pepper.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.780
And there's all kinds of different things
you can add on here, and that's the one thing

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.330
we may do right now is just add a little bit
of curry as well.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.530
But anything you'd like to do to kind of spice
things up is great.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.970
So you add a little bit of curry here, to
the sauce.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.690
Running out of curry there.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.700
All right, and then once you get that you're
going to just spend a little bit of time to

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.700
get this all mixed up here.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:35.640
I'm going to take a minute now and just talk
about the benefits of this recipe.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.010
Starting off with the turkey.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.520
We know turkey has got a lot of good protein
in it, also amino acids.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.720
Then moving onto the vegetables.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.190
We've got this zucchini here, which has high
levels of folate, potassium, and vitamin A.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.200
Looking at the red peppers, we know that's
really high in vitamin C and also lycopene,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.790
which has been shown to help fight cancer.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.620
The onions, we know they're full of allicin,
which is a natural anti-viral, natural anti-bacteria.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.080
And sulfur, which actually helps clean out
your arteries, helps your body detox.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.410
Just a few other things here, looking at the
sea salt, we know that that actually has a

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.600
lot of trace minerals in it, as well as the
curry we used here.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.080
Curry has turmeric in it, which is a natural
anti-inflammatory, so it's going to help reduce

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.060
inflammation in your body, allowing your body
to heal faster.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.530
All right, our turkey burgers are ready to
serve.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.900
So what you're going to do here, you start
off with a bed of spring mix lettuce.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.020
You're going to take a couple of these turkey
burgers and kind of place them on here like

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.020
this.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:48.160
Then you're just going to take the mixed vegetables
and kind of lay them on here like so.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.910
This turkey burger dish is great for when
you're having guests over.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:53.910
It's very colorful.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.290
Again, easy and quick to make.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.970
So try it out and we'll see you next week.
