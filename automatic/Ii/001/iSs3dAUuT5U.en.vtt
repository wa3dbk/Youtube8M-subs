00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
think I figure this out earlier if you

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.280 
think I figure this out earlier if you
go<00:03:32.689> up<00:03:33.689> here<00:03:34.620> they<00:03:34.979> can't<00:03:35.370> get<00:03:35.669> you<00:03:35.819> see<00:03:36.449> they

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
go up here they can't get you see they

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.030 
go up here they can't get you see they
can't<00:03:37.799> attack<00:03:37.919> you<00:03:38.280> after<00:03:38.639> yourself<00:03:40.040> just

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
can't attack you after yourself just

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.009 
can't attack you after yourself just
kill<00:03:41.549> them<00:03:41.669> with<00:03:41.879> the<00:03:42.120> bow<00:03:42.269> first<00:03:42.629> and<00:03:42.930> then

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
kill them with the bow first and then

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.629 
kill them with the bow first and then
you<00:03:43.109> won't<00:03:43.259> be<00:03:43.379> able<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:43.769> get<00:03:43.949> attacked<00:03:44.310> and
