00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hello, how are you doing with a series? 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.559
 of videos to show them the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.620
 pigments that I have to collection me 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.390
 very much like some samples are not 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 Are bought 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.460
 and well, so I 'm teaching them 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.070
 everyone so they can see my 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.529
 opinions see images and especially if 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.929
 I have not used or I will use it in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.619
 makeup videos that comes though it 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:35.250
 have used pigments for me 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:38.430
 are let's say something very special in 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.640
 about eye shadows because they have 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.769
 a lot more power of color that yes 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.930
 they are a bit more difficult to difficult 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:49.679
 work and there are pigments even that not 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.359
 they are as solid as others that we say 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.710
 it's a little bit more volatile so 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.100
 good to be released by all those who 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.320
 I like more what I consider to be a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.850
 little bit easier to work and if they are 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.309
 difficult because I'm also going to 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.640
 to say the same, they are already seeing the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.950
 opinions and if it 's worth 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.710
 to invest in it good the first one 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 I want to talk to you is the one that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.080
 he was using time to party in 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.409
 this case is the one of gift and I take it now 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.860
 same as it is number 35 and the 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.750
 English pigments are let's say that the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.759
 recommended product because there are people 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.530
 who asks me what he eats me 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.420
 recommended from the Hindu brand are 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.720
 many things that prove it and those that 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.460
 I keep trying and in this case with the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.990
 closed eyes I recommend you those 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.289
 example pigments that when 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.380
 you use well they look good 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.810
 it is not exaggerated in addition even I am this 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.570
 kind of peppers I do not use them with brushes 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.399
 but with wet mast cells are very 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.229
 very easy and they do not need any 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.110
 kind of special brooch even also 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.660
 with your finger you can put them on top of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.420
 shade or solitos to give a touch in 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.350
 the part of light 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.049
 it's a beautiful mallow with a silver in it 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.050
 tone has with a few ones 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.569
 slight touches to use are also 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.260
 I recommend one that I have here is 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.510
 the one of the basic let's say others that 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.160
 all you should try is the pigment 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.180
 copper and it is a precious copper copper 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 reddish let's say that depending on the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.720
 base that you put even only remain 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.819
 recess but depending on the basis that 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.739
 you put many more brown or 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:39.910
 much more copper more reddish and orange 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.250
 even that it has a versatility to 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.140
 change color and also handle very 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.730
 very easy this for example is very very 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.459
 pretty and this one I like to use the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 taken advantage of gives me or even with lying down 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.390
 face up 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.930
 of a base of a jumbo from a paintball 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.260
 to be beautiful even I like to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.569
 give a touch nothing else in the center of it 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.670
 and I do not remember right now if I have a 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.129
 tutorial with this pigment 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.629
 but good surely I will be 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:14.560
 doing because I like it very much and 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:16.360
 has some reflexes as well as litmus is 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.610
 precious here I recommend them 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.120
 very much to the cupbearer the pigment 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.159
 skin champagne good this one came to me 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.590
 a gloss and box a few boxes where 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.659
 come samples and for that is also 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.659
 very complete and let's say it's like a 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:35.300
 dust to be bright loose but that 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.520
 it even has some pink highlights 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.930
 melons 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.090
 it's super cute I'm using it 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.550
 also in one of the last tutorials 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.910
 in the feast it and to make up a 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:50.930
 so lighter with the range of 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.180
 neutral and good in this case is a 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.710
 small sample that came to me there and I 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.450
 I highly recommend it has about 275 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.690
 grams and the truth is that they are not very 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.580
 expensive the sides I think 12 euros and 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.070
 the truth that I recommend them 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.320
 very much is always beautiful 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.110
 they used both loose and wet 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.580
 It has a good quality because it is not 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.160
 these first of that regular 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.769
 and they want to start with the pigments and not 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.780
 they want weapons with colorful this is 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.060
 quite interesting then I handed him 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.740
 one here also from my brand fetish 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.110
 pigments that I like very much on 10 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.100
 the burnley neighborhood 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.030
 a chocolate and not a barry in a signature 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.830
 English that of some pigments 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.800

 for this season that is 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.070
 using the burgundy and the 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:56.350
 Bordeaux wines are reddish with their 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.720
 good black tone is that it is ideal to be 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.030
