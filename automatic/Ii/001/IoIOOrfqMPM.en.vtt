00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:17.039
 Almost every Sony Xperia phone actually 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:23.750

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:29.519

 Rohde is a simple one 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:43.770
 he does not need a computer pc for that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:50.550

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:58.219
 I need an android 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.219

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:07.539
 install description 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:31.780

 piece I recommend you always gandalf 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.470
 to take 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.420
 why is easy in itself so are 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.859
 Aragon does not work 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.709
 always not easy for that reason 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:04.829
 only has to wait for a short while 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.829
 just get reddened now 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:15.420
 Restart make time just a tripod 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:24.090
 Coming soon, now I feel right now 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:27.359
 with the mobile we do it too 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:39.690
 all right, everything is provisional 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:42.120
 I'm filming on the sheet of paper he is 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.340
 even more videos come from hacks 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:50.849
 So for example at springfield 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.510
 the simpsons springfield now for 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:59.180
 example playing for example 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:07.349
 Endless donuts and money 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:11.269
 or how infinitely infinite 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.269
 a lot but a certain number of 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:24.169
 things donots gets now is so ours 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.169
 first time here 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:40.250
 in st 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:07.730
 and you can not look it either 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:12.420
 can delete and choose me 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.220
 if you get my phone via work the 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.350
 riots but in any case these routes 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:21.350
 Just click on it again 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.350

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:44.580

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:47.120
 take if it has to know is on 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.130
 likely as here I show you we 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.070
 We could do certain things in series 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.919
 could uninstall things 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:01.850
 For example, we cara the island in 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:06.180
 winter is just still contacts browser 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:12.740

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:28.190
