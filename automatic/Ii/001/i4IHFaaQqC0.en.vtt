get<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.500> issue<00:02:33.830> fixed<00:02:34.520> was<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:37.670> my

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
get this issue fixed was that on my

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.750 
get this issue fixed was that on my
cluster<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.540> would<00:02:39.080> see<00:02:39.320> you<00:02:40.070> know<00:02:40.160> Jacob<00:02:40.460> brake

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
cluster I would see you know Jacob brake

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.430 
cluster I would see you know Jacob brake
lights<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.210> I<00:02:41.750> thought<00:02:41.930> okay<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.260> know<00:02:42.410> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
lights and I thought okay you know a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.890 
lights and I thought okay you know a
lipo<00:02:42.740> went<00:02:42.950> out<00:02:43.060> when<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.090> started<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.720> notice

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
lipo went out when I started to notice

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.050 
lipo went out when I started to notice
later<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.470> that's<00:02:45.590> because<00:02:45.890> I<00:02:46.220> my<00:02:46.520> wife<00:02:46.730> was

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
later and that's because I my wife was

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.720 
later and that's because I my wife was
backing<00:02:47.450> up<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.690> car<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.110> day<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.530> I<00:02:49.310> noticed

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
backing up the car one day and I noticed

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.750 
backing up the car one day and I noticed
that<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:51.110> brake<00:02:51.380> lights<00:02:51.620> would<00:02:52.010> will<00:02:52.430> remain

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that my brake lights would will remain

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.550 
that my brake lights would will remain
on<00:02:53.000> all<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:53.450> time<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.720> for<00:02:54.050> example<00:02:54.410> your

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
on all the time so for example your

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.440 
on all the time so for example your
third<00:02:54.740> brake<00:02:54.890> light<00:02:55.010> may<00:02:55.400> be<00:02:55.730> on<00:02:55.880> constantly

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
third brake light may be on constantly

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.500 
third brake light may be on constantly
even<00:02:57.140> if<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.410> brake<00:02:58.010> pad<00:02:58.220> wasn't<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:58.880> mean

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
even if the brake pad wasn't on I mean

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.420 
even if the brake pad wasn't on I mean
the<00:02:59.630> brake<00:02:59.810> pedal<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.830> all<00:03:01.010> these<00:03:01.190> slides

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
the brake pedal the all these slides

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.480 
the brake pedal the all these slides
would<00:03:01.610> turn<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:01.940> as<00:03:02.360> well<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:02.900> my<00:03:03.890> passenger

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
would turn on as well and my passenger

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.020 
would turn on as well and my passenger
light<00:03:04.670> would<00:03:04.970> be<00:03:05.150> turned<00:03:05.750> on<00:03:05.930> so<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:07.010> was<00:03:07.220> not

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
light would be turned on so that was not

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.640 
light would be turned on so that was not
a<00:03:08.060> good<00:03:08.270> idea<00:03:08.420> or<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:08.900> good<00:03:09.200> sign<00:03:09.380> for<00:03:09.410> me

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
a good idea or a good sign for me

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.950 
a good idea or a good sign for me
because<00:03:09.980> that's<00:03:10.280> hazardous<00:03:10.850> okay<00:03:11.780> and

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
because that's hazardous okay and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.020 
because that's hazardous okay and
secondly<00:03:12.710> I<00:03:12.800> didn't<00:03:13.130> want<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.640> get<00:03:13.790> pulled

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
secondly I didn't want to get pulled

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.949 
secondly I didn't want to get pulled
over<00:03:14.860> because<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.220> my<00:03:17.000> brake<00:03:17.750> lights

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
over because of my brake lights

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199 
over because of my brake lights
constantly<00:03:18.770> been<00:03:18.920> on<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.790> that's<00:03:19.970> why<00:03:20.180> I

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
constantly been on so that's why I

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.820 
constantly been on so that's why I
decided<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:20.959> go<00:03:21.020> ahead<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.709> know

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
decided to just go ahead and you know

decided to just go ahead and you know
switch<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.640> ignition<00:03:22.730> switch<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:24.050> that's

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
switch the ignition switch and that's

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.449 
switch the ignition switch and that's
why<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.470> decided<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.920> do<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.220> today

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
condition switch and secondly I'm going

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.400 
condition switch and secondly I'm going
to<00:03:44.420> go<00:03:44.600> ahead<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.130> install<00:03:46.870> another<00:03:47.870> one<00:03:48.200> and

to go ahead and install another one and
that's<00:03:48.470> going<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.709> be<00:03:48.830> in<00:03:48.890> the<00:03:48.980> next<00:03:49.130> video<00:03:49.489> so

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
that's going to be in the next video so

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.600 
that's going to be in the next video so
where<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:51.050> your<00:03:51.320> ignition<00:03:51.560> switch<00:03:51.980> so

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
where is your ignition switch so

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.310 
where is your ignition switch so
question<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.239> most<00:03:53.480> people<00:03:53.780> would<00:03:53.959> have<00:03:53.989> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
question that most people would have I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.680 
question that most people would have I
had<00:03:54.530> for<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.739> long<00:03:54.830> time<00:03:55.100> your<00:03:55.970> ignition<00:03:56.450> switch

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
had for a long time your ignition switch

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.460 
had for a long time your ignition switch
is<00:03:56.900> right<00:03:59.650> there<00:04:01.390> okay<00:04:02.390> now<00:04:02.570> how<00:04:03.140> do<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.320> have

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
is right there okay now how do you have

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.140 
is right there okay now how do you have
how<00:04:03.860> do<00:04:03.920> you<00:04:04.010> get<00:04:04.130> access<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:04.700> ignition

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
how do you get access to this ignition

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.620 
how do you get access to this ignition
switch<00:04:05.980> well<00:04:06.980> it's<00:04:07.070> pretty<00:04:07.160> simple<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:07.880> you

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
switch well it's pretty simple if you

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.180 
switch well it's pretty simple if you
notice<00:04:08.959> that<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.230> look<00:04:09.410> at<00:04:09.530> your<00:04:09.650> steering
