00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 Good day friends continue 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.379
 our topic of protection 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 today talk about helmets protecting your 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.150
 the most important organ of the body is your brain 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.620
 and all that is connected with this many 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 prefer to ride here such 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.090
 headgear people call them 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.920
 flirt and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 it's stylish and fashionable but the downside is that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 they protect from nothing except from 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.510
 soft bits discard the idea where it all 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 start if you ride simple 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.350
 cross country bike or recreational 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.809
 Well, you already have some 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.300
 extreme inclinations will suit you 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.910
 here is such a helmet 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 Plus he is following it easy 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.030
 developed ventilation is relatively good 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.100
 looks like it can be customized over the head 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.309
 How convenient because there are clasps 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.320
 there are straps on the back naturally 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.730
 adjustable 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.280
 but it is designed only for one serious 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 blow after which it cracks and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 also for excessive extreme not 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.430
 suitable because of advanced protection for 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 unfortunately he has no neck 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.580
 more interesting country on the helmet and they 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.490
 already cost much more but they 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.030
 much easier and + ventilation from them 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.770
 much more developed there are all sorts 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.610
 branded fastener systems such as 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.710
 here at this leisurely Lois it is very convenient 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.990
 but minus is exactly the same one 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:39.299
 serious blow and no helmet if you 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880
 young guy ride bmx or 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.340
 mountain bike jump do tricks 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.850
 ride the park you need a pot with 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.140
 this should start your skating 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.880
 also should not arrogate to those who 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.420
 rides long ago and still roll on 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 helmet 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.740
 in the helmet, even on the street itself bowler 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.320
 but you can chop the whole season after 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.860
 strong falls he most often remains 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.130
 is whole 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.229
 well, of course your head too 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.869
 carefully choose it by size it 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.360
 should sit very tight on the head 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.410
 if you change your hair 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.050
 or for some reason your voice becomes 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.230
 less complete always go 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.420
 seals 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.060
 to change the size of the helmet for yourself 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.560
 budget models have foam inside 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.050
 plastic sheath they are bonded with 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:35.520
 using the buttons only adjustment 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.780
 this strap come in such options and with 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.060
 integrated visor that looks 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.980
 quite strange for the most part on 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:49.810
 lover one of the pot minuses 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.959
 is bad ventilation and your head 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.530
 were afternoon to shamelessly sweat so not 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:03:00.370
 skimp and choose a helmet with a large 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.910
 the number of holes although there probably need 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.489
 do n't be stingy just being attentively there 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.370
 here is such a brutal helmet from scott 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.700
 it is heavier than ordinary bowlers had 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.450
 good blowing at the crown very 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.430
 interesting and stylish and offset 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.030
 vent holes to the right side 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.030
 heads and 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.930
 excellent regulating kit 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.000
 small seals proper 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.900
 the only thing that can be said about 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.750
 pot is the most expensive models 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.140
 have soldered inside and outside 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.260
 the shell this visibly facilitates the helmet he 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.269
 weighs 30 percent to 40 percent less 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.830
 than an ordinary pot and at the same time has 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:54.730
 all the same positive properties 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:57.190
 like strength and well-developed ventilation if 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.880
 you are somewhere between country cheeks 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.070
 and jumpers but still sure that you 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.989
 need a little bit serious protection a little 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.570
 more than one stroke but you 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.459
 want to look still there is truth here 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.459
 such a member zakosom under kafka 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:21.720
 that is, then immediately from the minuses a little 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.220
 side ventilation appearance but it 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.210
 rather, plus than minus, you will at least 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.430
 somehow stand out from the crowd and he doesn't have 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.940
 outer plastic shell that is 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:36.210
 Only the foam he can not stand so much 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.130
 blows how many bowler for those who 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.170

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.730
 downhila 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:47.070
 there are newfangled models like these 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.700
 with advanced protection and neck rolling 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.860
 even more than a bowler back him 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.610
 there is a good adjustable visor 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.440
 ventilation 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.390
 It has a sleeping shell and a standard 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.360
 regulating strap naturally 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:09.270
 set of seals for any head about 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.250

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.000

 downhill 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.220
 in the city they do not need to ride in the same way 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.340
 shoot when not worth it either 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.680
