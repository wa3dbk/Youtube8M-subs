i've been criticized for it there was a

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.620 
i've been criticized for it there was a

was<00:03:07.080> an<00:03:08.280> example<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.580> where<00:03:09.880> we've<00:03:10.150> got<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.570> put

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
was an example of where we've got to put

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.360 
was an example of where we've got to put
our<00:03:10.840> foot<00:03:11.020> down<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.470> show<00:03:11.980> that<00:03:12.010> we're

our foot down and show that we're

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.040 
our foot down and show that we're
serious<00:03:12.850> about<00:03:13.320> enforcement<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.860> it<00:03:14.980> caused

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050

the usual fuss at the international

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.490 
the usual fuss at the international
level<00:03:20.590> but<00:03:20.830> it<00:03:21.010> was<00:03:21.100> the<00:03:21.220> right<00:03:21.340> thing<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.670> do

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
level but it was the right thing to do

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
be one of our biggest markets and for us

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.290 
be one of our biggest markets and for us
to<00:03:40.900> close<00:03:41.320> ourselves<00:03:41.590> off<00:03:42.100> from<00:03:42.490> that<00:03:42.880> market

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
to close ourselves off from that market

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.320 
to close ourselves off from that market
would<00:03:43.420> be<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.630> mistake<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.910> point<00:03:46.150> you're

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
would be a mistake the point you're

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.730 
would be a mistake the point you're
making<00:03:46.360> or<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> limb<00:03:46.960> which<00:03:47.080> is<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.350> right<00:03:47.500> one

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
making or a limb which is the right one

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
making or a limb which is the right one
is<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.400> got<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.820> reciprocal<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.700> we

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
is it's got to be reciprocal so if we

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.250 
is it's got to be reciprocal so if we
have<00:03:52.180> established<00:03:54.660> agreements<00:03:55.660> in<00:03:55.840> which

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
have established agreements in which

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.230 
have established agreements in which
both<00:03:56.830> sides<00:03:57.190> are<00:03:57.430> supposed<00:03:57.700> to<00:03:57.790> open<00:03:57.880> up<00:03:58.090> their

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
both sides are supposed to open up their

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
both sides are supposed to open up their
markets<00:03:58.660> we<00:03:59.530> do<00:03:59.740> so<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.310> then<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.810> other<00:04:01.840> side

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
markets we do so and then the other side

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.830 
markets we do so and then the other side
is<00:04:02.590> imposing<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.490> whole<00:04:03.640> set<00:04:03.910> of<00:04:04.150> non-tariff

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
is imposing a whole set of non-tariff

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.070 
is imposing a whole set of non-tariff
barriers<00:04:05.380> in<00:04:05.590> place<00:04:06.240> that's<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.420> problem<00:04:07.600> and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
barriers in place that's a problem and

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.580 
barriers in place that's a problem and
it<00:04:08.680> has<00:04:08.830> to<00:04:09.010> be<00:04:09.130> squarely<00:04:09.460> confronted<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.900> so

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
it has to be squarely confronted so so

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.200 
it has to be squarely confronted so so
the<00:04:11.680> approach<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:11.980> we're<00:04:12.340> taking<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:13.030> try

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
the approach that we're taking is to try

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.900 
the approach that we're taking is to try
to<00:04:13.240> get<00:04:13.420> much<00:04:14.140> tougher<00:04:14.380> about<00:04:14.830> enforcement<00:04:15.790> of

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
to get much tougher about enforcement of

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.750 
to get much tougher about enforcement of
existing<00:04:16.120> rules<00:04:17.010> putting<00:04:18.010> constant<00:04:18.520> pressure

existing rules putting constant pressure

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.650 
existing rules putting constant pressure
on<00:04:19.090> China<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.650> other<00:04:21.040> countries<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:22.150> open<00:04:22.540> up

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
on China and other countries to open up

their markets in recipie
always<00:04:25.320> one<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.710> challenges<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.310> we've

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
always one of the challenges that we've

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.360 
always one of the challenges that we've
got<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.910> address<00:04:29.160> internationally<00:04:30.160> is

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
got to address internationally is

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.270 
got to address internationally is
currency<00:04:30.970> rates<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.630> how<00:04:32.530> they<00:04:32.710> match<00:04:32.980> up<00:04:33.010> to

goods are artificially deflated in price
that<00:04:43.360> puts<00:04:43.630> us<00:04:43.720> at<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.960> huge<00:04:44.290> competitive

that puts us at a huge competitive

that puts us at a huge competitive
disadvantage<00:04:45.330> but<00:04:46.330> what<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.510> don't<00:04:46.630> want<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.200> do

disadvantage but what I don't want to do

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.390 
disadvantage but what I don't want to do
is<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:48.970> us<00:04:49.000> as<00:04:49.390> a<00:04:49.450> country<00:04:50.020> where<00:04:50.710> as<00:04:50.890> a<00:04:50.920> party

create jobs here in the United States if
we<00:05:15.040> just<00:05:15.070> increased<00:05:15.760> our<00:05:17.880> exports<00:05:18.880> to<00:05:19.000> Asia<00:05:19.290> by

we just increased our exports to Asia by

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
a percentage point by a fraction it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.740 
a percentage point by a fraction it
would<00:05:26.920> mean<00:05:27.100> hundreds<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.120> thousands<00:05:28.600> maybe

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
would mean hundreds of thousands maybe

these folks potentially could market not

these folks potentially could market not
just<00:06:20.110> here<00:06:20.500> in<00:06:20.530> the<00:06:20.620> United<00:06:20.680> States<00:06:20.980> but<00:06:21.490> this

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
just here in the United States but this

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.820 
just here in the United States but this
is<00:06:22.210> a<00:06:22.740> technology<00:06:23.740> that<00:06:24.040> could<00:06:24.610> end<00:06:24.820> up<00:06:25.830> being

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
is a technology that could end up being

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.850 
is a technology that could end up being
sent<00:06:27.190> all<00:06:27.340> around<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.700> world<00:06:28.290> but<00:06:29.290> they<00:06:29.470> don't

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
sent all around the world but they don't

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.410 
sent all around the world but they don't
have<00:06:29.920> the<00:06:30.130> money<00:06:30.310> to<00:06:30.430> set<00:06:30.850> up<00:06:30.970> their<00:06:31.360> own

have the money to set up their own

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.260 
have the money to set up their own
foreign<00:06:31.960> office<00:06:32.320> in<00:06:32.620> Beijing<00:06:33.610> to<00:06:33.790> navigate

through<00:06:34.540> the<00:06:34.630> bureaucracy

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
through the bureaucracy

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.800 
through the bureaucracy
they've<00:06:36.170> got<00:06:36.380> to<00:06:36.500> have<00:06:36.650> some<00:06:37.250> help<00:06:37.600> being<00:06:38.600> over

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
they've got to have some help being over

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.850 
they've got to have some help being over
there<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.050> so<00:06:39.170> that's<00:06:39.410> one<00:06:39.650> of<00:06:39.740> the<00:06:39.800> things

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
there and so that's one of the things

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.160 
there and so that's one of the things
that<00:06:40.130> we<00:06:40.220> really<00:06:40.430> want<00:06:40.580> to<00:06:40.610> focus<00:06:40.700> on<00:06:41.090> in<00:06:41.990> this
