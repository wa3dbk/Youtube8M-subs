00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
there's been not much on loadouts and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's been not much on loadouts and
customization<00:01:22.770> options<00:01:23.220> all<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.670> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
customization options all we know is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.120 
customization options all we know is
that<00:01:23.880> there<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.420> some<00:01:25.170> customization<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that there will be some customization of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
that there will be some customization of
your<00:01:26.189> characters<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.320> your

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
your characters and you know your

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980 
your characters and you know your
loadout<00:01:29.009> for<00:01:29.250> example<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.780> probably

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
loadout for example but I think probably

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.749 
loadout for example but I think probably
before<00:01:31.590> games<00:01:31.829> come<00:01:32.130> we'll<00:01:32.280> probably<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.700> a

would get the best time on the tattooing
mission<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.530> was<00:01:55.710> shown<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.070> e3<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.899> we<00:01:57.899> have

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
mission that was shown at e3 and we have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
mission that was shown at e3 and we have
been<00:01:58.500> playing<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:59.040> mission<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.790> over

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
been playing that mission over and over

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.149 
been playing that mission over and over
and<00:02:00.119> over<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:01.110> fun<00:02:01.350> changing<00:02:01.979> your

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
and over it is really fun changing your

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.100 
and over it is really fun changing your
type<00:02:02.369> stick<00:02:02.670> slightly<00:02:03.180> every<00:02:03.509> time<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.930> try

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
type stick slightly every time and try

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
type stick slightly every time and try
new<00:02:04.320> ways<00:02:04.530> especially<00:02:04.829> when<00:02:05.520> you<00:02:05.640> start<00:02:05.969> up<00:02:06.149> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
new ways especially when you start up to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180 
new ways especially when you start up to
compare<00:02:06.780> round<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.770> friends<00:02:08.069> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
compare round time with your friends and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.279 
compare round time with your friends and
colleagues<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:09.239> overall<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.690> think<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
colleagues so overall I think this is

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290 
colleagues so overall I think this is
going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> be<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.920> fun<00:02:11.099> nice<00:02:11.400> amount<00:02:11.700> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
going to be really fun nice amount to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.960 
going to be really fun nice amount to
not<00:02:12.540> necessarily<00:02:12.900> play<00:02:13.110> all<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.980> time<00:02:14.010> but<00:02:14.700> if

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
not necessarily play all the time but if

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.370 
not necessarily play all the time but if
you<00:02:15.090> want<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.390> play<00:02:15.480> with<00:02:15.630> friends<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.200> you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
you want to play with friends if you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.890

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.140 
it plays out if there's leaderboards
that<00:02:22.800> will<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.100> really<00:02:23.640> awesome

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150

and<00:02:50.730> basically<00:02:51.300> people<00:02:51.780> were<00:02:51.990> expecting<00:02:52.470> it

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and basically people were expecting it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
to be around that age but it isn't

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.290 
to be around that age but it isn't
because<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:55.140> reality<00:02:55.500> doesn't<00:02:56.160> seem<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.550> fit

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
because in reality doesn't seem to fit

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.200 
because in reality doesn't seem to fit
that<00:02:57.360> age<00:02:58.260> rating<00:02:58.770> so<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.610> nice<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.850> see<00:03:00.180> that

that age rating so it's nice to see that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.940 
that age rating so it's nice to see that
a<00:03:00.390> lot<00:03:00.600> more<00:03:00.870> people<00:03:01.110> are<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.710> be<00:03:01.830> able
