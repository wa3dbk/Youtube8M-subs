00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it a little bit uncomfortable to code

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.389 
it a little bit uncomfortable to code
and<00:00:56.360> operate<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> single<00:00:57.960> hand<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
and operate with a single hand but you

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.330 
and operate with a single hand but you
know<00:00:59.579> we<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:00.930> live<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.129> one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
know we think we can live with this one

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.719 
know we think we can live with this one
the<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.930> display<00:01:04.350> measures<00:01:04.920> 5.5

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the way it is the display measures 5.5

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
the way it is the display measures 5.5
inches<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.180> diagonal<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> resolution<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
inches in diagonal on the resolution is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
inches in diagonal on the resolution is
1080p<00:01:08.130> 1080<00:01:08.939> x<00:01:09.200> 1920<00:01:10.200> pixels<00:01:10.640> pixel<00:01:11.640> densities

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.100 
1080p 1080 x 1920 pixels pixel densities
excellent<00:01:12.600> colors<00:01:12.990> also<00:01:13.290> look<00:01:13.680> quite<00:01:14.250> nice

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
excellent colors also look quite nice

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.980 
excellent colors also look quite nice
however<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.439> cannot<00:01:16.680> really<00:01:16.890> seem<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
however we cannot really seem to get it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.960 
however we cannot really seem to get it
brighter<00:01:18.990> than<00:01:19.380> this

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
brighter than this

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.560 
brighter than this
so<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.860> highest<00:01:22.280> club<00:01:22.490> right<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.120> brightness

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
so the highest club right the brightness

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.590 
so the highest club right the brightness
of<00:01:23.720> this<00:01:23.900> tone<00:01:24.200> could<00:01:25.190> be<00:01:25.460> could<00:01:25.910> be<00:01:25.970> an<00:01:26.300> issue

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.600 

inside<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.720> joni<00:01:29.990> lb7<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:31.070> will<00:01:31.190> find<00:01:31.490> a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
inside the joni lb7 you will find a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.150 
inside the joni lb7 you will find a
quad-core<00:01:31.940> Qualcomm<00:01:32.750> Snapdragon<00:01:32.930> chip<00:01:33.680> the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon chip the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.610 
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon chip the
eight<00:01:34.280> nine<00:01:34.550> seven<00:01:34.580> four<00:01:34.910> AC<00:01:35.360> running<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:36.020> 2.5

eight nine seven four AC running a 2.5

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.980 
eight nine seven four AC running a 2.5
gigahertz<00:01:37.030> actually<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:38.360> very<00:01:38.660> same

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
gigahertz actually this is the very same

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.080 
gigahertz actually this is the very same
chipset<00:01:39.410> that<00:01:39.860> comes<00:01:40.190> inside<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.580> Samsung

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
chipset that comes inside the Samsung

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.720 
chipset that comes inside the Samsung
Galaxy<00:01:41.120> s5<00:01:41.870> so<00:01:42.500> definitely<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.250> phone

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
Galaxy s5 so definitely this phone

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.640 
Galaxy s5 so definitely this phone
should<00:01:44.030> be<00:01:44.210> able<00:01:44.300> to<00:01:44.510> handle<00:01:44.840> anything<00:01:45.200> that

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
should be able to handle anything that

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.680 
should be able to handle anything that
you<00:01:45.920> throw<00:01:46.250> at<00:01:46.370> it<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.820> also<00:01:46.970> get<00:01:47.150> 3<00:01:47.420> gigabytes

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
you throw at it you also get 3 gigabytes

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.530 
you throw at it you also get 3 gigabytes
of<00:01:47.930> ram<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:48.620> 32<00:01:48.980> gigabytes<00:01:49.430> of<00:01:49.640> on-board

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
of ram and the 32 gigabytes of on-board

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.260 
of ram and the 32 gigabytes of on-board
storage<00:01:51.460> flipping<00:01:52.460> the<00:01:52.580> phone<00:01:52.790> around<00:01:53.030> we

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
storage flipping the phone around we

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.980 
storage flipping the phone around we
find<00:01:53.600> an<00:01:53.810> eight-<00:01:54.580> me<00:01:55.580> the<00:01:55.790> main<00:01:56.270> camera<00:01:56.600> has<00:01:56.960> a

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
find an eight- me the main camera has a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.320 
find an eight- me the main camera has a
resolution<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.560> 16<00:01:57.950> megapixels<00:01:58.640> without<00:01:59.300> a

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
resolution of 16 megapixels without a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.960 
resolution of 16 megapixels without a
focus<00:01:59.720> and<00:01:59.900> a<00:01:59.960> single<00:02:00.470> LED<00:02:00.830> flash<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.400> also

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
focus and a single LED flash and also

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870 
focus and a single LED flash and also
the<00:02:02.090> actual<00:02:02.360> pixel<00:02:03.260> size<00:02:03.619> is<00:02:04.010> a<00:02:04.040> voice<00:02:04.520> large

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
the actual pixel size is a voice large

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.450 
the actual pixel size is a voice large
so<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.690> camera<00:02:06.170> definitely<00:02:06.710> should<00:02:07.009> be<00:02:07.220> a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
so the camera definitely should be a

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.030 
so the camera definitely should be a
good<00:02:07.729> performer<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.590> front-facing

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
good performer and the front-facing

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.310 
good performer and the front-facing
