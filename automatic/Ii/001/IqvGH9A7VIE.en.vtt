photographers that are running around

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.640 
photographers that are running around
taking<00:04:56.389> snapshots<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:57.020> posting<00:04:57.440> them<00:04:57.560> on

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
taking snapshots and posting them on

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.800 
taking snapshots and posting them on
Instagram<00:04:58.190> and<00:04:58.460> taking<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.240> thousand<00:04:59.660> pictures

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
Instagram and taking a thousand pictures

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.110 
Instagram and taking a thousand pictures
and<00:05:00.139> day<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:00.560> having<00:05:01.039> five<00:05:01.280> nice<00:05:01.580> ones<00:05:01.880> I

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
and day and having five nice ones I

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.689 
and day and having five nice ones I
think<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.479> helps<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.990> have<00:05:03.169> a<00:05:03.260> very<00:05:03.699> narrow

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
think it helps to have a very narrow

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.189 
think it helps to have a very narrow
body<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.630> work<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.260> people<00:05:06.590> if<00:05:07.370> they<00:05:07.580> want<00:05:07.820> a
