00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.910 

we'll<00:02:42.480> see

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.570 

a<00:02:46.980> little<00:02:47.910> bit<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.650> Browning<00:02:50.390> name<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.720> it

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
a little bit at the Browning name on it

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.740 
a little bit at the Browning name on it
than<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:53.880> pretty<00:02:53.940> standard<00:02:54.300> knife

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
think overall it's about seven and a

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.570 
think overall it's about seven and a
half<00:03:02.320> eight<00:03:02.770> inches<00:03:03.160> something<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:04.000> that

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
half eight inches something like that

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.380 
half eight inches something like that
it's<00:03:06.580> very<00:03:07.020> very<00:03:08.020> secure<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:10.000> got<00:03:10.150> minor

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
it's very very secure it's got minor

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.180 
it's very very secure it's got minor
lock

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.240 

jumping<00:03:15.090> from<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.480> back<00:03:15.690> there

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.430 

grips<00:03:19.910> very<00:03:20.240> very<00:03:20.900> well<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:23.140> guess<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.260> could

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
grips very very well and guess you could

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.960 
grips very very well and guess you could
use<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:24.680> okay<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.940> skinner<00:03:26.510> maybe<00:03:26.990> I<00:03:27.820> think<00:03:28.820> that

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
use it okay a skinner maybe I think that

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.250 
use it okay a skinner maybe I think that
was<00:03:29.120> where<00:03:29.300> they<00:03:29.390> were<00:03:29.510> kind<00:03:29.690> of<00:03:29.750> going<00:03:29.900> with

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
was where they were kind of going with

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.560 
was where they were kind of going with
it<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:31.070> where<00:03:31.250> you're<00:03:32.120> going<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.300> make<00:03:32.390> it
