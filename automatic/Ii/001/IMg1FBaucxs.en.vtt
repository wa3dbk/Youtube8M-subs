peony<00:00:51.329> tulip<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> me<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.260> got<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> nice<00:00:52.649> double

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100

really have any pink to it same thing

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
really have any pink to it same thing
with<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.329> behind<00:01:00.980> it's<00:01:01.980> nice<00:01:02.520> it's

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
with the one here behind it's nice it's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.380 
with the one here behind it's nice it's
a<00:01:03.480> hidden<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.320> prefer<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> single<00:01:05.640> tulip<00:01:05.939> myself

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a hidden I prefer a single tulip myself

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
a hidden I prefer a single tulip myself
these<00:01:07.260> double<00:01:07.619> ones<00:01:07.770> don't<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.250> do

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
these double ones don't really do

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.800 
these double ones don't really do
anything<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.760> me

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
anything for me

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420 
anything for me
but<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.409> here<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.100> looks<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
but this one here this one looks a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
but this one here this one looks a
little<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.760> more<00:01:11.930> like<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> representation

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
little bit more like the representation

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.840 
little bit more like the representation
of<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> photo<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.310> got<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> pink

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
of the of the photo it's got the pink

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
of the of the photo it's got the pink
and<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.150> it's<00:01:18.270> got<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.689> white<00:01:19.200> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
and then it's got the the white that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.620 
and then it's got the the white that
spills<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> top<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
spills out the top so this one is is a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.149 
spills out the top so this one is is a
much<00:01:21.960> nicer<00:01:24.290> representation<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.830> one's<00:01:26.040> not

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
much nicer representation this one's not

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.800 
much nicer representation this one's not
so<00:01:26.400> bad<00:01:26.430> again<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> pink<00:01:27.180> isn't<00:01:27.509> nearly<00:01:27.720> as

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
so bad again the pink isn't nearly as

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
so bad again the pink isn't nearly as
vibrant<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> shows<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:30.210> thing

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
vibrant as what it shows and same thing

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.179 
vibrant as what it shows and same thing
this<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.810> here<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.680> look<00:01:31.829> nicer<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
this one here is gonna look nicer I

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.950 
this one here is gonna look nicer I
think<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.360> got<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.720> deeper

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
think because it's got a much deeper

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.460 
think because it's got a much deeper
pink<00:01:35.000> outer<00:01:36.000> edge<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.930> white<00:01:37.259> will

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
pink outer edge and then the white will

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
pink outer edge and then the white will
come<00:01:37.500> out<00:01:37.770> through<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> top<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.270> was<00:01:39.479> an

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
come out through the top so this was an

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.770 
come out through the top so this was an
interesting<00:01:39.799> experience<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.390> don't<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.659> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
interesting experience I don't know that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440 
interesting experience I don't know that
I<00:01:42.810> would<00:01:42.990> buy<00:01:43.110> these<00:01:43.170> again<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.270> some<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.329> them

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I would buy these again but some of them

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.780 
I would buy these again but some of them
look<00:01:45.570> nice<00:01:45.750> some<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.290> them<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.710> nice<00:01:47.100> but

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
