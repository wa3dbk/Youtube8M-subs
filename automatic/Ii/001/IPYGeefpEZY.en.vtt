JJ rigged so he has legs and feet that
are<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.329> joy<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> work<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:35.809> just<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.170> did

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
are a joy to work with just as we did

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
for jj's torso arms and hands we need to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
for jj's torso arms and hands we need to
take<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:40.620> at<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:41.520> reference<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
take a look at some reference for the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.760 
take a look at some reference for the
legs<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.840> figure<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.170> what<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
legs to figure out what it is that a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
legs to figure out what it is that a
character<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.520> needs<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> what

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
character actually needs to do and what

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.799 
character actually needs to do and what
our<00:00:45.809> legs<00:00:46.170> need<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.559> able<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.809> you

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
our legs need to be able to do if you

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.569 
our legs need to be able to do if you
look<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> movies<00:00:49.440> directory<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
look in the movies directory of the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.010 
look in the movies directory of the
included<00:00:51.030> files<00:00:51.449> you'll<00:00:51.719> notice<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
included files you'll notice that

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.350 
included files you'll notice that
there's<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.620> series<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.489> movies<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.059> creating

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there's a series of movies for creating

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.000 
there's a series of movies for creating
our<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> legs<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:55.860> can<00:00:55.980> use

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
our for the legs for that we can use

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.830 
our for the legs for that we can use
reference<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.149> if<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.270> take<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.449> look<00:00:57.629> at<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
reference so if we take a look at the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
reference so if we take a look at the
first<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.980> bryce<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.520> he's<00:00:59.699> running

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
first one this is bryce and he's running

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
first one this is bryce and he's running
up<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> wall<00:01:00.600> leaping<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.109> running<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
up a wall leaping or running up to a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.200 
up a wall leaping or running up to a
while<00:01:01.739> leaping<00:01:02.129> onto<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> running<00:01:02.969> off

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
while leaping onto it and running off

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
while leaping onto it and running off
and<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.960> let's<00:01:04.140> take<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> look<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.619> what<00:01:04.650> his

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and so let's take a look at what his

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.250 
and so let's take a look at what his
legs<00:01:05.070> are<00:01:05.220> doing<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.610> his<00:01:06.600> legs<00:01:06.840> are<00:01:06.960> running

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
legs are doing as his legs are running

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
legs are doing as his legs are running
up<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.040> standard<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> foot

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
up it's just a standard you know foot

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.130 
up it's just a standard you know foot
plant<00:01:09.600> swing<00:01:10.200> forward<00:01:10.560> stuff<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
plant swing forward stuff like that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.109 
plant swing forward stuff like that
nothing<00:01:13.140> too<00:01:13.290> complicated<00:01:13.790> then<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.030> he

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
nothing too complicated then when he

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660 
nothing too complicated then when he
swings<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.689> his<00:01:16.049> leg<00:01:16.350> comes<00:01:16.890> around<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> top

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
swings up his leg comes around the top

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.580 
swings up his leg comes around the top
and<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.570> he<00:01:18.689> pushes<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.439> his

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and you can see he pushes off with his

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.170 
and you can see he pushes off with his
toe<00:01:19.770> his<00:01:20.009> leg<00:01:20.250> extends<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:22.430> then<00:01:23.430> lands<00:01:24.060> on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
toe his leg extends and then lands on

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.770 
toe his leg extends and then lands on
the<00:01:24.450> side<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> his<00:01:24.869> foot<00:01:26.210> he<00:01:27.210> rolls<00:01:27.540> around

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
the side of his foot he rolls around

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.550 
the side of his foot he rolls around
like<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.890> leg<00:01:29.070> comes<00:01:29.280> around<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.320> now

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like this the leg comes around and now

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.179 
like this the leg comes around and now
he's<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.100> toe<00:01:32.400> pivoting<00:01:33.119> around<00:01:33.180> and

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
he's up on the toe pivoting around and

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.030 
he's up on the toe pivoting around and
pushing<00:01:35.189> off<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.320> need<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.619> sure<00:01:37.680> that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
pushing off so we need to make sure that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.789 
pushing off so we need to make sure that
our<00:01:38.070> legs<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.820> push<00:01:39.600> off<00:01:39.840> by<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> ball<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
our legs can push off by the ball of the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.819 
our legs can push off by the ball of the
foot<00:01:40.829> swing<00:01:41.369> around<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.170> move<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.290> FK<00:01:43.619> mode

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
foot swing around and move in FK mode

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.120

second example Carlos is doing push-ups
and<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.030> his<00:01:51.270> knees<00:01:51.479> are

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
and you can see that his knees are

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.810 
and you can see that his knees are
locked<00:01:51.810> down<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:53.009> having<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.399> ability<00:01:53.579> to
