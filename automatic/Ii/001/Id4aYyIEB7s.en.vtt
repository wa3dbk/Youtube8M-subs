00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
around on the particular environments

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.780 
around on the particular environments
which<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:18.940> cool<00:03:20.280> I'll<00:03:21.280> be<00:03:21.370> here<00:03:21.490> we<00:03:21.580> got<00:03:21.700> the

menu let's go back out and show you
something<00:03:23.200> more<00:03:23.470> complicated<00:03:25.260> Alice's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
something more complicated Alice's

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.340 
something more complicated Alice's
bedroom<00:03:26.410> so<00:03:27.280> these<00:03:27.430> are<00:03:27.640> just<00:03:27.730> kind<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.060> hard

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
bedroom so these are just kind of hard

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.840 
bedroom so these are just kind of hard
more<00:03:29.350> level<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.620> come<00:03:29.830> later<00:03:30.070> start<00:03:30.550> target

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
more level to come later start target

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.170 
more level to come later start target
practice<00:03:31.650> okay<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.100> this<00:03:33.640> one<00:03:33.850> they<00:03:33.970> give<00:03:34.090> you

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
a sling shot pretty cool a little marble

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.810 
a sling shot pretty cool a little marble
a<00:03:37.830> little<00:03:38.830> bumper<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.460> in<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.640> pinball

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
a little bumper like in a pinball

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.390 
a little bumper like in a pinball
machine<00:03:40.000> and<00:03:40.360> some<00:03:40.720> pipes<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.200> remember<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.190> did

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
machine and some pipes I remember I did

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.770 
machine and some pipes I remember I did
this<00:03:42.520> one<00:03:42.700> kind<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:42.970> randomly<00:03:43.330> this<00:03:43.540> one<00:03:43.660> was

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
this one kind of randomly this one was

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.960 
this one kind of randomly this one was
hard<00:03:44.080> so<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.650> can<00:03:44.740> rotate<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:45.400> by<00:03:45.580> doing<00:03:45.640> that

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
hard so I can rotate this by doing that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.340 
hard so I can rotate this by doing that
simply<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.570> controls<00:03:46.870> are<00:03:46.960> very<00:03:46.990> intuitive

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
simply the controls are very intuitive

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.320 
simply the controls are very intuitive
kind<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.370> like<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.700> can<00:03:48.850> stretch<00:03:49.150> the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
kind of like if you can stretch the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.280 
kind of like if you can stretch the
slingshot<00:03:49.990> back<00:03:50.580> stick<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.760> ball<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.480> your

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
slingshot back stick the ball in it your

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.080 
slingshot back stick the ball in it your
fingers<00:03:53.650> do<00:03:53.890> sometimes<00:03:54.340> get<00:03:54.490> in<00:03:54.610> the<00:03:54.640> way<00:03:54.700> but

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
fingers do sometimes get in the way but

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.390 
fingers do sometimes get in the way but
as<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.300> can<00:03:55.420> see<00:03:55.630> if<00:03:55.810> you<00:03:55.930> try<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.410> gauge<00:03:57.220> it

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
as you can see if you try to gauge it

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.740 
as you can see if you try to gauge it
that'll<00:03:57.610> shoot<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.090> automatically<00:03:58.510> which<00:03:58.630> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
that'll shoot it automatically which is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.480 
that'll shoot it automatically which is
really<00:03:58.960> cool<00:03:59.110> physics<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.310> game

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
really cool physics like that this game

has great physics great characteristics
of<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.530> other<00:04:02.680> graphics<00:04:03.250> everything<00:04:03.760> that's

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
of the other graphics everything that's

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.280 
of the other graphics everything that's
great<00:04:04.210> about<00:04:04.300> this<00:04:04.540> game<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.870> can<00:04:04.900> even<00:04:05.260> zoom

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
great about this game you can even zoom

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.690 
great about this game you can even zoom
in<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.710> little<00:04:05.800> bit<00:04:05.950> with<00:04:06.160> your<00:04:06.280> fingers<00:04:06.550> like

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
in a little bit with your fingers like

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.080 
in a little bit with your fingers like
that

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.380 
that
cool<00:04:07.780> um<00:04:08.230> let's<00:04:09.190> actually<00:04:09.550> move<00:04:09.910> that<00:04:10.120> up<00:04:10.360> a

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
cool um let's actually move that up a

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:19.310 
cool um let's actually move that up a
little<00:04:10.540> bit<00:04:10.690> more

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.590 

see<00:04:20.320> how<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.530> works<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.240> doesn't<00:04:22.509> matter

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
see how that works so it doesn't matter

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.620 
see how that works so it doesn't matter
how<00:04:22.690> many<00:04:23.020> hoops<00:04:23.430> hit<00:04:24.430> development<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.539> the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
how many hoops hit development so the

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.610 
how many hoops hit development so the
objective<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.020> this<00:04:26.139> one<00:04:26.289> if<00:04:26.410> I<00:04:26.470> actually

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
objective of this one if I actually

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.560 
objective of this one if I actually
pressed<00:04:26.919> play<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.729> let's<00:04:27.850> get<00:04:27.970> this<00:04:28.120> doll<00:04:28.360> as

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
pressed play so let's get this doll as

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.090 
pressed play so let's get this doll as
you<00:04:28.690> can<00:04:28.780> see<00:04:28.870> with<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.050> blue<00:04:29.229> arrow<00:04:29.470> into<00:04:29.979> that

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
you can see with a blue arrow into that

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.839 
you can see with a blue arrow into that
basket<00:04:30.250> so<00:04:30.610> let<00:04:30.729> me<00:04:30.789> try<00:04:30.940> that<00:04:31.000> again

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
basket so let me try that again

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.950 
basket so let me try that again
what<00:04:33.849> happens<00:04:34.180> okay<00:04:34.449> that's<00:04:34.599> a<00:04:34.630> little<00:04:34.780> too

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
what happens okay that's a little too

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.740 
what happens okay that's a little too
strong<00:04:37.349> the<00:04:38.349> ball<00:04:38.530> there<00:04:38.740> oh<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:40.210> missed<00:04:40.570> the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
strong the ball there oh I missed the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.520 
strong the ball there oh I missed the
yeah<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:41.110> misplaced<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.949> ball<00:04:43.139> all<00:04:44.139> this<00:04:44.320> way

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
yeah I misplaced the ball all this way

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.370 
yeah I misplaced the ball all this way
too<00:04:44.590> hard<00:04:45.090> ah<00:04:48.570> as<00:04:49.570> you<00:04:49.630> can<00:04:49.780> see<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:50.050> sometimes

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
too hard ah as you can see it sometimes

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.249 
too hard ah as you can see it sometimes
gets<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.650> little<00:04:50.830> finicky<00:04:51.099> cuz<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.669> UH<00:04:52.259> the

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
gets a little finicky cuz the UH the

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.879 
gets a little finicky cuz the UH the
items<00:04:53.560> on<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.770> screen<00:04:53.949> are<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:55.560> small<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.620> can

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
items on the screen are so small you can

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.339 
items on the screen are so small you can
actually<00:04:57.009> just<00:04:57.250> zoom<00:04:57.490> in<00:04:57.810> do<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:58.930> this<00:04:59.110> way

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
actually just zoom in do it this way

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:11.060 
actually just zoom in do it this way
which<00:04:59.620> tends<00:04:59.919> to<00:05:00.039> work<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.840> bit<00:05:01.840> better

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.760 

good<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:12.780> didn't<00:05:13.780> hit<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.960> doll<00:05:14.139> though<00:05:14.320> so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
good I didn't hit the doll though so

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.460 
good I didn't hit the doll though so
we're<00:05:15.160> gonna<00:05:15.280> try<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.639> again<00:05:15.699> I<00:05:16.289> think<00:05:17.289> that

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
we're gonna try that again I think that

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.879 
we're gonna try that again I think that
there<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.810> again<00:05:20.110> there's<00:05:20.349> a<00:05:20.409> lots<00:05:20.710> of

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
there and again there's a lots of

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.520 
there and again there's a lots of
different<00:05:21.039> types<00:05:21.430> of<00:05:21.759> ways<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.479> actually<00:05:22.810> beat

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
different types of ways to actually beat

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.149 
different types of ways to actually beat
the<00:05:23.740> level<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.810> honestly<00:05:26.349> you<00:05:26.560> can<00:05:26.680> have<00:05:26.830> hours

we go right in the face right in the
face<00:05:57.099> and<00:05:58.469> so<00:05:59.469> that's<00:05:59.710> pretty<00:05:59.979> much<00:06:00.099> the<00:06:00.400> gist
