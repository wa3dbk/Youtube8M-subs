00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.780 
tier I've decided to leave that open for
the<00:02:28.020> moment<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:29.130> not<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> hunter

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the moment it's not really a hunter

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.520 
the moment it's not really a hunter
perception<00:02:30.240> each<00:02:30.360> bit<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:33.600> know<00:02:33.660> adds<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.440> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
perception each bit you know adds to it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.640 
perception each bit you know adds to it
a<00:02:34.560> bit<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> top<00:02:36.960> tier<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:37.440> as<00:02:37.560> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
a bit and this is a top tier so as you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.110 
a bit and this is a top tier so as you
can<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.100> full<00:02:38.310> blocks<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> way<00:02:39.090> out

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
can see it's full blocks all the way out

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.230 
can see it's full blocks all the way out
and<00:02:39.650> when<00:02:40.650> you're<00:02:40.770> at<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.890> very<00:02:41.100> top<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:42.030> my

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
and when you're at the very top as my

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.450 
and when you're at the very top as my
bed<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:43.290> got<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> pretty<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.800> view<00:02:44.040> so

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
bed you got a pretty good view so

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.860 
bed you got a pretty good view so
whatever<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.090> sit<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.480> gotta<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.750> good

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
whatever you sit you gotta have a good

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.530 
whatever you sit you gotta have a good
view<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.310> was<00:02:47.310> going<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.520> put<00:02:47.640> big<00:02:47.850> screen<00:02:48.120> TVs

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
view I was going to put big screen TVs

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.650 
view I was going to put big screen TVs
in<00:02:48.720> yes<00:02:49.650> i<00:02:49.830> still<00:02:50.040> clinic<00:02:50.370> good<00:02:50.640> but<00:02:50.940> no<00:02:51.630> I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
in yes i still clinic good but no I

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.770 
in yes i still clinic good but no I
really<00:02:51.960> to<00:02:52.050> put<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:53.090> there<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.720> close<00:02:55.200> ladder<00:02:56.780> so

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
really to put it there I close ladder so

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.930 
really to put it there I close ladder so
obviously<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.410> roof<00:02:58.820> there's<00:02:59.820> no

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
obviously this is a roof there's no

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.360 
obviously this is a roof there's no
glass<00:03:00.530> because<00:03:01.530> I'm<00:03:01.620> doing<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.860> by<00:03:01.950> myself<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
glass because I'm doing it by myself and

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.400 
glass because I'm doing it by myself and
it<00:03:02.460> will<00:03:02.550> take<00:03:02.700> too<00:03:02.880> long<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.960> it's<00:03:04.080> not<00:03:04.230> worth

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
it will take too long so it's not worth

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.950 
it will take too long so it's not worth
it<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.460> I<00:03:05.520> kept<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.880> below<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.300> clouds<00:03:06.570> as<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
it and I kept it below the clouds as you

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.100 
it and I kept it below the clouds as you
can<00:03:07.080> see<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:08.100> should<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.460> set<00:03:08.640> as<00:03:08.760> clouds

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
can see you should be on set as clouds

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.720 
can see you should be on set as clouds
very<00:03:10.110> close<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.590> but<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.040> didn't<00:03:11.520> want<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
very close to it but I didn't want the

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.680 
very close to it but I didn't want the
weather<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.330> clouds<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.720> cover<00:03:12.990> it<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:14.690> it's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
weather the clouds to cover it so it's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.710 
weather the clouds to cover it so it's
pretty<00:03:15.990> much<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:19.200> top<00:03:19.740> will<00:03:20.670> go<00:03:20.820> back<00:03:21.000> down<00:03:21.330> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
pretty much the top will go back down to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.500
