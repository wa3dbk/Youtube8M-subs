00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 there are again film errors now 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.040
 amounted once a month hello 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.019
 factory it's time again 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 a new episode film errors exist 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.990
 Now, once a month, then 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.960
 we have really really good 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 and only great mistakes and ten looked 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.840
 I have you guys this time too 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.699
 brought back we start this 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 eat sometimes with kick because there is such a 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.900
 comic apps in between at one go 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.000
 is shown and what is funny 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 that the comic is on the left side 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.810
 without any real justification 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.340
 changed so you see on the right 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 side is the picture remains and also the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.000
 completely different things are left and left 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.590
 that's a bit crazy 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 It was probably just like that from the set 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.370
 design several options then 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.500
 somehow still something turned down because of it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 There is only a sense to have a side to the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.289
 then change ours next to that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.770
 other folder but somehow this is here 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.879
 happens 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.739
 and somehow I think that's pretty 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.629
 cool i do not know anyone the movie and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.829
 Every day the marmot greets does not love 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.539
 I think it's really cool 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.860
 the thing is but I know but for it 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.170
 Almost nobody in this film mistakes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.129
 recognizes in his scene that he 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.289
 the beautiful that with too 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.059
 tv cameras and tv team like this 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.159
 you can see in the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.540
 reflection from the camera clearly 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.220
 turn the light setting of the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.560
 other films just do that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.930
 actually turn this movie 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 and who looks closely then you see 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.259
 that, too, I honestly think so 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.880
 really cool because there you can see 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.439
 Again , it does not need that 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.420
 is not the day as bright as it is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.310
 knows but it also becomes itself 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.170
 if everything is turned outside 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.460
 adjusted so afterwards in the film 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.259
 looks perfect too i have again 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.670
 what brought by pixar and there yes 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.409
 actually always perfect your movies 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 I almost always look forward to that 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.990
 you can see you're okay too 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.479
 People sometimes have mistakes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.490
 like here you can see rex 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.650
 standing in front of the tv and in the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.119
 bleed is not a reflection in the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.500
 Of course this is not allowed 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.840
 But I still think it's amazing to happen 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.600
 charming and happy as I said about 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.430
 the humanity in this movie is 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.259
 but just happens does not happen often 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.970
 at pixar but that's just one 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.649
 mistake is really cool too 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.090
 will not just recommend somewhere 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.290
 little bit there is really nothing 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.479
 left to chance 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.729
 that's fine too out of it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.530
 falls on the one even before one 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.049
 Mark has laid on the ground like that 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.819
 also here a little beautiful picture 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.420
 I know that I screamed then 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.790
 in the movie 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.230
 a shock comes in moderately then it falls 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.599
 one then not on that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.120
 mark like the figure or 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.550
 our disfigured corpse is right there 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.510
 to and before are now complete 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.430
 the crime scene 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.230
 knows about the movie that's just 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.239
 the girl in there and it is just 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.160
 really on the ground look exactly 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.900
 It really has to be marked there 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.850
 sit and the mark was level 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.380
 not removed neither digital afterwards 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.340
 still on the spot and so what may actually 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.239
 not happen 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.980
 I finally have something out again 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.739
 back to the future because there is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.970
 a clear proof that here 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.610
 has been to operate stupid little 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.010
 namely you do not have the handwriting 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.780
 exactly matched you see two 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.250
 pictures the handwriting is supposedly 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.019
 from the same person 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.970
 if you look at then you see 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.680
 just never are two completely 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.000
 different fonts and inside 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 from a year changed a 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.750
 he does not write now so blatant is yes 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.080
 but you did not pay attention 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.950
 and thought probably so no one noticed 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.720
 not counted with us 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.580
 we will witness the blade runner 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.350
 I face paint one more time 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.390
 can change after the man has died 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.340
 you see the lady first here 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.910
 not so crudely make-up normal 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.310
 lips 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.959
 she is dead and suddenly a claus 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.090
 recording and she really has 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.859
 make-up lips so very lipstick 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.060
 on the lips and that results even 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.459
 no sense one could say now 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.170
 would be reversed so the work 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.489
 lips were just just audel running 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.340
 no blood right through now 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.780
 everything stays ok but lipstick im 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.640
 death is the motto mist I die 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.440
 I look good 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.269
 that actually does not happen 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.130
 here at blade runner just not 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.470
 beware Mr. Scott's release cotton 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.700
 made movies but not bad me 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.140
 find it quite charming that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.640
 in such films exactly those 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.950
 film mistakes still happen to them 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.690
 Batman really gets it wrong 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.489
 saved job I can understand 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.319
 that's about twice and three times 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.940
 somehow it wants to be used but it should 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.040
 not so noticeable so here at batman 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.780
 are two completely different places 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.040
 the whole takes place and the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.900
 story is told it is but 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.090
 clearly that's exactly the same 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.350
 Setting is just fast 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.290
 set other studies so come 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.880
 take away super and 22 sat down 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.109
 I almost hoped that there 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.239
 maybe the dresser from les 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.500
 miserable reappears happening 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.989
 unfortunately not here but actually 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.489
 same room pretended it was two 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.320
 completely different places and that is 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.889
 then noticeable but funny 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.999
 at the same time 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.349
 classic pack is an absolute one 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:27.389
 movie classics but I'm still that 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.449
 this film mistakes so the predicate 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.590
 classic cup earned here at basic 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.419
 we always see park like this 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.550
 Dare over fats and the background 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.889
 once you see light equipment though 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.169
 at the same time also a potted plant 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.419
 and who is now jurassic park 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.610
 look at the white it does not indicate 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.590
 to see that in this second of every second 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.969
 There is a potted plant somewhere in the forest 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.590
 I would not like to say his 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.349
 reportage look for the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.610
 Potted plant in the set of 30 park because I 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.590
 stemme really has the question as well 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.560
 that's the way it is for me then 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.509
 actually commode part 2 was the now 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.919
 yes no sense shows that in the picture 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:04.110
 I think it is very nice 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.789
 and now makes stressful park another 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.419
 little horny themselves as new again 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.680
 as co 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.659
 I also have something nice again 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.180
 which shows that stanley kubrick indeed 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.710
 but ingenious is only one person 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.169
 the whole episode runs here under the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.419
 title humanity ingenious 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.560
 directors because this lie stone 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.599
 you can see very clearly if they are the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.729
 Air intake does not come that way 

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:26.550
 watch out quite correctly has seen 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.279
 namely the helicopter of the same 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.199
 This scene has been shot clearly 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:32.490
 on the street and if you look at it now 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.589
 anyway, the light is considered anyway 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.389
 and what is the perspective of the camera 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.819
 then you really know that is exactly 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.469
 this helicopter is and has 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.149
 just not this grandmaster 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:44.279
 beware , it is always 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.810
 just noticed it 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.069
 shit we do it anyway 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.629
 no idea 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.879
 In any case, this shadow has on 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:52.050
 nothing at all for the ground 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.289
 especially with his movie classics as 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.909
 ghostbusters is noticeable that sometimes 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:58.560
 It was very easy to see 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.620
 namely, here establish a schott 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.149
 from the central park and you can see it ok 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.080
 but with visual effects always without 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.520
 because just two different things 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.979
 so there are two 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.180
 different times and just 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.889
 two different days 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.839
 But you also see that exactly the same 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:15.180
 people at the exact place in the central park 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.979
 sit and that means nothing else than 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.629
 that you just taken the same material 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.580
 has that one stop working the other 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.169
 not both or used and that 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.430
 is going very charming today 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.139
 I do not think so because 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.430
 you do not even think about it anymore 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.009
 how would we do that? 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.839
 rather 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.300
 Just build it yourself in Central Park 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:33.639
 I think that's pretty cool on the computer 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.199

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:36.699

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.469

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:41.919
 I like the playlist of the others 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:42.339
 There are always some mistakes in the movie 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.259
