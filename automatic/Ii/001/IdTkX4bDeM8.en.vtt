00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:10.670
 hello dear viewers something 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.559
 say red barrels in done it again 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.500
 all the benefit of a downloadable addition to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.930
 survayval horror outlast 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.100
 you are a park programmer working 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.109
 on brand corporation 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
 and the person who sent the email 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.789
 journalist on the RAM in the original glutton 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 the game after sending the letter 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.630
 little changed circumstances and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:44.940
 now your job is not to write programs 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:47.100
 and getting out of there alive is immediately worth 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.500
 note in the game there are all even 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.559
 creepy atmosphere organs and body parts 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.140
 scattered along the corridors and rooms blood 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.239
 smeared on the walls and of course nowhere 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.280
 got the camera which is on 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.219
 today is probably the most 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.140
 effective way to scare you 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.150
 being in complete darkness you turn 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 night mode with its creepy green 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.320
 tinge that gives tension 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.979
 especially when you have pepper and two 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.979
 glowing eyes 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.680
 sound design on top 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.290
 tense soundtrack is great to find 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.080
 moment for the transfer of the atmosphere I'm not 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.400
 talking about loud steps behind you 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.500
 slamming doors and terrible screams 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.450
 prisoners in the distance all this 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.960
 really works and forces you 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.960
 stand still 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.899
 wandering around the hospital sometimes you'll 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.929
 find documents and take notes 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.100
 when you filmed something interesting 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.429
 documents complements the general background 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.770
 There have been many events in general 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.659
 bullshit about evil megacorporations 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.729
 and indeed the story does not have much 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.219
 meanings but still there are quite a few 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.369
 good intersections with the original game 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.599
 Yes, and the ending makes you wonder where 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.470
 will happen next events 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.879
 parts 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.879
 if she will of course 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.270
 the game added a couple of new antagonists 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.160
 when i first met he first me 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.380
 small very impressed since I was very 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.150
 bananas not be so terrible for 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.340
 at least compared to the crazy 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.650
 number two this type made me by 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.450
 fidgeting in the chair after meeting him in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 thoughts really appear in the head 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.000
 the spirit of God, what is wrong with this guy 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.720
 Yes 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.820
 dil se successfully returns you to the formula 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.830
 the original game before the game is 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.750
 disadvantages such as design complexity 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.000
 levels and the lack of new gameplay 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.670
 elements on the character delsey itself 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.410
 sound design makes you feel 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.220
 presence effect in this hellish 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.490
 hospital 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.930
 among all these psychos on it all
