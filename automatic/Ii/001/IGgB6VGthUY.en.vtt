let's talk specifics then let's hit the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.850 
let's talk specifics then let's hit the
iPads<00:00:32.850> first<00:00:33.360> we're<00:00:33.750> probably<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.710> see

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
iPads first we're probably going to see

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.790 
iPads first we're probably going to see
not<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.250> different<00:00:35.730> size<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.840> ipad<00:00:36.930> but

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
not a different size of the ipad but

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.209 
not a different size of the ipad but
some<00:00:38.660> finer<00:00:39.660> finely<00:00:40.350> tuned<00:00:40.559> features<00:00:40.980> yeah

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
some finer finely tuned features yeah

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
some finer finely tuned features yeah
yeah<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> big<00:00:41.969> expectation<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> will

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
yeah the big expectation is that will

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
yeah the big expectation is that will
see<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> bigger<00:00:43.590> iPad<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.700> looks<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.969> lot<00:00:45.059> more

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
see a bigger iPad that looks a lot more

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.610 
see a bigger iPad that looks a lot more
like<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> ipad<00:00:45.750> mini<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.170> rounded<00:00:46.590> corners

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
like the ipad mini with rounded corners

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.369 
like the ipad mini with rounded corners
and<00:00:47.280> thinner<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.870> portrait

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and thinner kind of that at portrait

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
and thinner kind of that at portrait
style<00:00:49.620> where<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> edges<00:00:50.700> aren't<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.120> thin

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
style where the edges aren't as thin

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.240 
style where the edges aren't as thin
right<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.770> expecting<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
right also what we're expecting is a

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
right also what we're expecting is a
retina<00:00:53.670> iPad<00:00:54.149> Mini<00:00:54.480> yeah<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> thing

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
retina iPad Mini yeah this is the thing

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.049 
retina iPad Mini yeah this is the thing
we<00:00:55.800> didn't<00:00:56.039> get<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> first<00:00:56.579> generation

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we didn't get with the first generation

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.689 
we didn't get with the first generation
I've<00:00:57.180> had<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.590> had<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.100> first<00:00:59.340> kind

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I've had you know we had that first kind

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.900 
I've had you know we had that first kind
of<00:00:59.789> 1024<00:01:00.480> x<00:01:00.660> 7<00:01:01.020> 80<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.250> displayed<00:01:02.730> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
of 1024 x 7 80 kind of displayed it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
of 1024 x 7 80 kind of displayed it
looked<00:01:03.420> okay<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.500> wasn't<00:01:04.860> quite<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
looked okay but it wasn't quite up to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.530 
looked okay but it wasn't quite up to
par<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.880> other<00:01:05.909> devices<00:01:06.210> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
par with some of the other devices so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.060 
par with some of the other devices so
we're<00:01:06.659> expecting<00:01:06.780> something<00:01:07.200> very<00:01:07.290> sharp<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
we're expecting something very sharp and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
we're expecting something very sharp and
if<00:01:08.369> you're<00:01:08.610> excited<00:01:09.330> about<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.869> ipad<00:01:10.380> mini

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
if you're excited about that ipad mini

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
if you're excited about that ipad mini
with<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> retina<00:01:11.310> display<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:12.119> should

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
with the retina display you should

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.270 
with the retina display you should
probably<00:01:12.960> act<00:01:13.140> quickly<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:14.010> announced

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
probably act quickly if they announced

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
probably act quickly if they announced
it<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.150> another<00:01:15.450> report<00:01:15.869> that's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it because there's another report that's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
it because there's another report that's
surfaced<00:01:16.740> from<00:01:17.040> their<00:01:17.280> having<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> couple<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
surfaced from their having a couple of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
surfaced from their having a couple of
reports<00:01:18.210> floating<00:01:18.509> around<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> suggest<00:01:19.439> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
reports floating around that suggest it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
reports floating around that suggest it
it's<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> limited<00:01:20.640> supply<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.689> same

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it's gonna be a limited supply the same

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
it's gonna be a limited supply the same
kind<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.140> thing<00:01:22.320> happened<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:22.799> some<00:01:23.369> older

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
kind of thing happened with some older

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 
kind of thing happened with some older
products<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.049> come<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.350> retina

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
products that have come out with retina

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.170 
products that have come out with retina
displays<00:01:26.070> where<00:01:26.280> they<00:01:26.670> were<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.970> hard<00:01:27.150> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
displays where they were kind of hard to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.719 
displays where they were kind of hard to
get<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.450> first<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.560> don't<00:01:29.340> think<00:01:29.430> we<00:01:29.610> have

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
get at first right I don't think we have

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.039 
get at first right I don't think we have
a<00:01:29.759> good<00:01:29.880> indication<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> fact<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
a good indication that but the fact that

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
a good indication that but the fact that
they're<00:01:31.950> launching<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.369> probably<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> long

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they're launching that probably a long

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.850 
they're launching that probably a long
side<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.390> updated<00:01:33.840> version<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.229> older<00:01:34.530> version

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
side an updated version or older version

not the mini um I kind of think that if
they<00:01:50.939> are<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.240> put<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.079> ipad<00:01:52.380> it'll

they are gonna put it on the ipad it'll

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
they are gonna put it on the ipad it'll
come<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> mini<00:01:53.130> too<00:01:53.340> cuz<00:01:53.640> that's<00:01:53.790> really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
come the mini too cuz that's really

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.280 
come the mini too cuz that's really
device<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.420> people<00:01:54.659> carry<00:01:54.869> around<00:01:54.990> with

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
device that people carry around with

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.569 
device that people carry around with
them<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> kind<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> thing

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
them right and that's the kind of thing

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.679 
them right and that's the kind of thing
where<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> pass<00:01:57.270> word<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.659> that
