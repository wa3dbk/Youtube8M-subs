dispenses<00:00:12.349> I'm<00:00:13.349> just<00:00:13.559> demonstrating<00:00:14.190> here

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
dispenses I'm just demonstrating here

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.189 
dispenses I'm just demonstrating here
this<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.450> old<00:00:16.070> 5<00:00:17.070> clock<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.670> am<00:00:18.029> playing<00:00:18.840> now

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
this is the old 5 clock I am playing now

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:27.230 
this is the old 5 clock I am playing now
better<00:00:19.560> 1.3<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:24.619> this<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:26.160> how<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.460> use<00:00:26.670> dead

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
better 1.3 and this is how you use dead

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.430 
better 1.3 and this is how you use dead
ok<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.250> how<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.460> stuff<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.269> things

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.369 

that<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.829> average<00:00:35.100> 5<00:00:35.910> clock<00:00:38.960> working<00:00:39.960> like

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that is the average 5 clock working like

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.560 
that is the average 5 clock working like
a<00:00:40.500> 5-4<00:00:41.100> does<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:43.250> now<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.640> think<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.270> might<00:00:45.539> have

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
a 5-4 does I now I think I might have

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.990 
a 5-4 does I now I think I might have
created<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:47.989> alternative<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.410> new<00:00:50.070> age<00:00:50.280> version

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.619 

maybe<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.270> 1.3<00:00:56.989> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.550> almost<00:00:59.550> this

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.640 

actually<00:01:03.629> running<00:01:03.780> other<00:01:03.960> residents<00:01:04.530> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
actually running other residents are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.090 
actually running other residents are
going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:07.220> I'm<00:01:08.220> away<00:01:08.520> nice<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.060> cheap

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.280 

so<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.869> in<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
so this is what I think in the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.100 
so this is what I think in the
replacement<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.250> fight<00:01:17.580> club<00:01:17.840> not<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
replacement of a fight club not really a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.730 
replacement of a fight club not really a
placement<00:01:19.619> though<00:01:20.150> it's<00:01:21.500> another<00:01:22.500> way<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
placement though it's another way of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859 
placement though it's another way of
doing<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.250> probably<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> more<00:01:24.000> used<00:01:24.330> way<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
doing it probably the more used way in

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:37.410 
doing it probably the more used way in
the<00:01:25.020> future<00:01:25.729> but<00:01:26.729> um

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.710 

it<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.799> just<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.250> normal<00:01:39.930> bike<00:01:40.930> lock<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:43.479> it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
it is just a normal bike lock really it

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.149 
it is just a normal bike lock really it
does<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.080> same<00:01:44.140> thing<00:01:46.350> about<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.680> same<00:01:47.890> speed

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
does the same thing about the same speed

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.190 
does the same thing about the same speed
although<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.330> different<00:01:49.840> though<00:01:49.960> because

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
although it is different though because

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.560 
although it is different though because
I<00:01:50.350> want<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.830> call<00:01:51.009> it<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.280> five<00:01:51.640> o'clock<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:52.360> much

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
I want to call it a five o'clock so much

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.499 
I want to call it a five o'clock so much
as<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.229> isn't<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.610> adjustable<00:01:54.610> compact<00:01:55.240> o

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
as it isn't it adjustable compact o

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.249 
as it isn't it adjustable compact o
clock<00:01:56.970> because<00:01:57.970> you<00:01:58.149> can<00:01:58.299> do<00:01:58.450> this<00:01:58.600> now<00:01:58.869> with

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
clock because you can do this now with

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.029 
clock because you can do this now with
the<00:01:59.409> new<00:02:00.000> redstone<00:02:02.310> blocks<00:02:03.390> what<00:02:04.390> are<00:02:04.450> they

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
the new redstone blocks what are they

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.059 
the new redstone blocks what are they
she<00:02:06.039> bought<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.490> your<00:02:06.670> way<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.440> use<00:02:09.039> a

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
she bought in your way you can use a

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.670 
she bought in your way you can use a
redstone<00:02:09.519> repeater<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.290> make<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
redstone repeater and I can make the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.920 
redstone repeater and I can make the
beat<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.130> slower<00:02:15.519> now<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.510> can't<00:02:19.780> actually

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
beat a slower now so I can't actually

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.870 
beat a slower now so I can't actually
change<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.620> speed<00:02:20.920> without<00:02:21.100> having<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.730> build

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
change the speed without having to build

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.259 
change the speed without having to build
anything<00:02:22.239> which<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.780> quite<00:02:23.230> nifty<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:25.060> that's

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
anything which is quite nifty but that's

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.780 
anything which is quite nifty but that's
not<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.840> big<00:02:26.019> thing<00:02:26.560> well<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.700> pretty

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
not the big thing well that is pretty

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.759 
not the big thing well that is pretty
big<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.450> that's<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.140> what<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.350> wanted<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.650> show

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
big but that's not what I wanted to show

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.660 
big but that's not what I wanted to show
you<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:31.260> don't<00:02:32.260> wanted<00:02:32.769> to<00:02:32.890> show<00:02:33.069> you<00:02:33.100> guys<00:02:33.400> is

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
you I don't wanted to show you guys is

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.910 
you I don't wanted to show you guys is
an<00:02:34.510> invention<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.670> if<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.150> thing<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:37.540> stop

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
an invention and if this thing on stop

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:49.860 
an invention and if this thing on stop
cutting<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.980> thing<00:02:47.700> yes<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.600> mainly

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
cutting a thing yes this is mainly

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:00.090 
cutting a thing yes this is mainly
directed<00:02:50.380> an<00:02:50.829> ether<00:02:51.310> ethers<00:02:52.030> lives<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:59.100> yes

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
directed an ether ethers lives and yes

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.690 
directed an ether ethers lives and yes
oh<00:03:00.400> here's<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.609> good<00:03:00.820> trial<00:03:01.329> Oh

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.550 

that<00:03:10.700> should<00:03:10.879> be<00:03:11.000> off<00:03:11.090> now<00:03:11.689> this<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.079> using

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
that should be off now this is using

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.759 
that should be off now this is using
what<00:03:13.189> would<00:03:13.340> be<00:03:13.459> refrigerated<00:03:14.439> quokka<00:03:15.439> think

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
what would be refrigerated quokka think

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.369 
what would be refrigerated quokka think
these<00:03:16.069> two<00:03:16.519> reigns<00:03:16.939> but<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.510> not<00:03:17.750> really<00:03:17.989> a

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
these two reigns but it's not really a

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.479 
these two reigns but it's not really a
big<00:03:18.920> change<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.200> could<00:03:24.859> be<00:03:25.040> built

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
big change and this is could be built

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.420 
big change and this is could be built
underground<00:03:25.939> like<00:03:26.780> you've<00:03:26.959> done<00:03:26.989> in<00:03:27.379> your

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
underground like you've done in your

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
like ether is done in is and for his

like ether is done in is and for his
monster<00:03:32.480> truck<00:03:32.689> he's<00:03:32.840> added<00:03:33.230> some<00:03:33.439> nice

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
monster truck he's added some nice

ground this could all be down on the
ground<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.609> then<00:03:38.450> lead<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.409> red<00:03:39.889> stone<00:03:40.159> to

ground and then lead up the red stone to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.930 
ground and then lead up the red stone to
the<00:03:40.400> dispenser<00:03:41.030> but<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:43.430> will<00:03:43.579> probably<00:03:43.790> take

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
the dispenser but it will probably take

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.210 
the dispenser but it will probably take
is<00:03:44.120> probably<00:03:44.659> really<00:03:45.230> complicated<00:03:45.920> for<00:03:46.159> all

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
is probably really complicated for all

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.440 
is probably really complicated for all
the<00:03:46.370> dispensers<00:03:46.940> you've<00:03:47.090> got<00:03:47.269> in<00:03:47.420> your

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the dispensers you've got in your

the dispensers you've got in your
storage<00:03:47.750> room<00:03:48.190> anyway<00:03:49.190> um<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:50.750> is<00:03:51.019> how<00:03:51.290> work

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
storage room anyway um this is how work

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
kill you seriously seriously gosh thank

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.370 
kill you seriously seriously gosh thank
you<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:32.770> can<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:33.800> go<00:04:34.130> away<00:04:34.900> so<00:04:35.900> yeah<00:04:36.169> but

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
you so can you go away so yeah but

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:44.700 
you so can you go away so yeah but
anyway<00:04:37.810> so<00:04:38.810> this<00:04:39.289> is<00:04:39.470> how<00:04:39.620> we<00:04:39.680> click<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:40.729> once<00:04:40.940> I

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.760 

think<00:04:45.710> we<00:04:45.889> got<00:04:46.990> one<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.169> don't<00:04:48.440> know<00:04:48.590> actually

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
think we got one I don't know actually

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.159 
think we got one I don't know actually
and<00:04:49.460> if<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.729> stays<00:04:50.090> on<00:04:50.300> it<00:04:50.360> just<00:04:50.690> keeps<00:04:50.930> going

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
and if it stays on it just keeps going

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.980 
and if it stays on it just keeps going
but<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.130> turn<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.460> off<00:04:52.580> when<00:04:52.610> down<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:56.630> it<00:04:56.810> is

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
but you turn it off when down so it is

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.159 
but you turn it off when down so it is
in<00:04:57.349> the<00:04:57.650> off<00:04:57.860> mode<00:04:58.220> or<00:04:58.880> position<00:04:59.630> when<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.840> dig

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
in the off mode or position when I dig

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:05.740 
in the off mode or position when I dig
down<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:02.949> on<00:05:03.949> and<00:05:04.520> will<00:05:04.729> keep<00:05:04.940> giving<00:05:05.330> me<00:05:05.360> your

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
down and on and will keep giving me your

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.320 
down and on and will keep giving me your
blocks<00:05:06.580> and<00:05:07.580> leave<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.419> up<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:10.010> could<00:05:10.430> use<00:05:10.760> a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
blocks and leave it up you could use a

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.150 
blocks and leave it up you could use a
pressure<00:05:11.930> pad<00:05:12.260> let<00:05:12.979> you<00:05:13.099> come

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
pressure pad let you come

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.070 
pressure pad let you come
thank<00:05:14.370> you<00:05:14.520> that<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.180> think<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.600> level<00:05:15.780> works

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
thank you that I think the level works

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.420 
thank you that I think the level works
better<00:05:16.440> because<00:05:18.410> you<00:05:19.410> do<00:05:19.560> have<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.980> reset

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
better because you do have to reset

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.050 
better because you do have to reset
essentially<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.270> is<00:05:21.330> resetting<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:23.060> 22

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
essentially this is resetting the 22

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.080 
essentially this is resetting the 22
clock<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:25.370> don't<00:05:26.370> even<00:05:26.460> know<00:05:26.730> if<00:05:26.760> that's<00:05:27.000> the

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
clock I don't even know if that's the

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.900 
clock I don't even know if that's the
right<00:05:28.160> language<00:05:30.140> or<00:05:31.160> thing<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.340> call<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.730> but

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
right language or thing to call it but

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
right language or thing to call it but
anyway<00:05:34.310> that's<00:05:35.310> how<00:05:35.610> it<00:05:35.670> works<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.210> it<00:05:36.360> gives

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
anyway that's how it works and it gives

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.260 
anyway that's how it works and it gives
you<00:05:37.260> take<00:05:37.980> it<00:05:38.600> feathers<00:05:39.600> in<00:05:40.230> one<00:05:40.770> here<00:05:41.270> it'll

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
you take it feathers in one here it'll

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:52.520 
you take it feathers in one here it'll
give<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:45.620> princess<00:05:46.620> stuff<00:05:46.890> going<00:05:51.350> if<00:05:52.350> you

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
give you princess stuff going if you

00:05:52.530 --> 00:06:03.320 
give you princess stuff going if you
keep<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:52.950> on<00:05:55.010> and<00:05:56.010> switch<00:05:56.250> it<00:05:56.370> again<00:06:02.330> so

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
keep it on and switch it again so

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.840 
keep it on and switch it again so
everyone<00:06:03.600> am<00:06:03.780> i<00:06:03.900> doing<00:06:07.130> sit<00:06:08.130> down<00:06:08.160> gives<00:06:08.760> you

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
everyone am i doing sit down gives you

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.250 
everyone am i doing sit down gives you
one<00:06:09.120> and<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:11.490> turns<00:06:11.790> it<00:06:11.970> off<00:06:12.090> down<00:06:12.540> is<00:06:12.750> off<00:06:12.930> I

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
one and that turns it off down is off I

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:20.660 
one and that turns it off down is off I
think<00:06:13.770> already<00:06:14.040> said<00:06:14.280> that<00:06:14.430> Oh<00:06:19.550> gives<00:06:20.550> you

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
think already said that Oh gives you

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.310 
think already said that Oh gives you
eight<00:06:20.910> ain't<00:06:21.600> online<00:06:22.070> and<00:06:23.070> if<00:06:23.340> you<00:06:23.460> keep<00:06:23.730> it<00:06:23.910> up

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
eight ain't online and if you keep it up

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.500 
eight ain't online and if you keep it up
it<00:06:25.320> will<00:06:25.800> keep<00:06:26.340> giving<00:06:26.760> it<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:27.090> you<00:06:27.150> but<00:06:27.480> I

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
it will keep giving it to you but I

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.370 
it will keep giving it to you but I
don't<00:06:27.660> know<00:06:28.020> how<00:06:28.260> long<00:06:28.760> the<00:06:30.140> circuitry<00:06:31.140> will

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
don't know how long the circuitry will

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:38.810 
don't know how long the circuitry will
last<00:06:32.330> before<00:06:33.330> it<00:06:33.690> blows<00:06:37.220> so<00:06:38.220> if<00:06:38.280> that<00:06:38.370> happens

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
last before it blows so if that happens

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.680 
last before it blows so if that happens
you<00:06:38.970> hit<00:06:39.300> the<00:06:39.419> reset<00:06:39.840> do<00:06:40.770> it<00:06:40.919> again<00:06:41.419> this<00:06:42.419> seems

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
you hit the reset do it again this seems

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.510 
you hit the reset do it again this seems
to<00:06:42.810> be<00:06:42.840> significantly<00:06:43.620> faster<00:06:43.890> and<00:06:46.520> clicking

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
to be significantly faster and clicking

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.460 
to be significantly faster and clicking
it<00:06:47.640> because<00:06:48.120> individually<00:06:48.870> clicking<00:06:49.290> would

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
it because individually clicking would
