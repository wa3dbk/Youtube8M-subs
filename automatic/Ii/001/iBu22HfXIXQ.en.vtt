00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.790
 as there is issue with this really if it is 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.980
 that we have the opportunity to talk hours 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.660
 and hours because finally it 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.020
 the couple always has a lot to talk about 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.160
 but when it comes to defining 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.310
 effectively how can we establish 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.070
 the limits and at what time when 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.110
 We believe that we established everything 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.939
 corrupts one jumps the fence and the 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.190
 another one too and after a while we're 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.660
 totally missing us about it and 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.489
 passing us the limits that in a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.620
 principle we believe we had left well 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.329
 established why this happens how how 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.770
 we can solve good then for that 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.660
 we have our life coach here 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.160
 edmundo sanchez how is that world very 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.050
 welcome thank you for being with 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.850
 We are delighted to be here today 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.590
 the limits are supposed to be 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.750
 we establish in a very natural way the 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.790
 moment to start a relationship let's go 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.790
 making it clear what we do not like 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.640
 and how far can it happen to someone not 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:06.020
 most relationships begin 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.390
 based on assumptions and they tell you I think 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.100
 that this is what must happen and the other 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 person enters a base of assumptions 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.720
 who think what should happen then 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.790
 the expectation is rare that it is common 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.590
 couples have to develop the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.020
 communication skills to be able 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.240
 understand what is expected of me in the 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.820
 relationship of couple on the one hand and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.490
 another decide whether he got it or not that is very 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.200
 important and if you raise me that same 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.910
 couple relationship where you tell me 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.770
 you have to be here one night all 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.080
 the days come what may I say 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.720
 thank you but not 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.240
 next what follows I will not enter and 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.160
 Now I do feel that situation 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.050
 now a very important thing the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.270
 limits is that when we talk about putting 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.310
 limits most people think of 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.690
 what I will allow the other and that 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.150
 is the basis of the theory of limits 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.350
 I would say no and here he gives you a ball 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.300
 curve that I think it's going to leave seeing 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.880
 visions to more than two 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.430
 the central problem or the central task 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.759
 to put limits is to learn to put on 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.680
 limits to me that is what I should do 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.540
 and I should not do so much in my 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.700
 behavior is talking about the 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.350
 hour of return I am the one who takes 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.390
 I'm the one who sets the limits 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.310
 of that behavior I decide to what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.720
 hours I go to my house depending on which 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.410
 I'm in a relationship or I'm 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.360
 married 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.070
 and what is the frame of reference for me 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.320
 as a person that I should take to 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.560
 house and the second interpretation of the 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.500
 limits has to do with the I have me 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.900
 that limit me from being snooping to 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.760
 another checking the other getting into what 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.530
 that I do not care and that's what many 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.150
 sometimes enter the relationship of those chiqui 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.260
 Chiqui checks another one calling him to see where 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.080
 it's like this and why it has not called me 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.470
 then the boundaries have to start 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.200
 for putting oneself before thinking 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.180
 in putting limits on the other now 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.010
 extending that the concept by going 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.420
 towards this question of what was raised 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.280
 as today's theme of putting 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.340
 of carpet you have to make a distinction 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.190
 very important between when the other is 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.020
 doing something that was agreed that it was going to 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.700
 do or not was going to be done and when the 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.650
 another is doing is not doing what 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.920
 that they but that are two things very 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.360
 different if I'm waiting for you 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.490
 you are a person who arrives all the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.130
 days at eight o'clock I'm going alone 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.780
 in the tower but if you and I are left 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.910
 see us at eight to go to the movies and not 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.500
 you arrive then if you are going through 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.450
 on top of me are two very 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.010
 different because people get confused 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.460
 the does not say is not that it goes over 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.620
 My no 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.320
 and the one who wants does not arrive but sometimes he 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.060
 is an adult person or her and is 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.310
 autonomous and takes home at the time 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.620
 she thinks it's right now yes 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.320
 they were left to do something if you stayed 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.370
 what did you say I'm going to make a dinner 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.110
 spectacular I hope that at eight in 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.610
 point and the other reaches ten thirty 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.650
 so if it's happening to you 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.840
 then we could think the hoax that 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.210
 finally when we talk about limits in 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.170
 actually we are talking about regarding 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.630
 Agreements 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.400
 principal the couple if the couple has 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.200
 that finally have a respect a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.880
 agreement but what I respect if we have not 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.360
 agreed nothing clear once what 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.770
 we agreed 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.720
 exactly then there has to be a 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.280
 clarity of which of the expectation I 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.170
 I see with great sadness that many 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.970
 couples enter the relationship as you 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.770
 he said in a series of assumptions and 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.930
 expectations because this is what I 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.670
 I think it must be and the other thinks 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.380
 that this is what it must be and how 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.660
 each of us consider that 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.989
 we have the absolute truth then then 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.910
 that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.680
 It is a clash of the titans is not a duel 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.500
 truths and that out there is not the output 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.270
 the search for reason is never going to 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.740
 resolve a conflict in the couple in the 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.000
 world and you think that really if 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.430
 we could sit in the courtship 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.150
 before we get married, sit down to talk and 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.070
 agree 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.810
 would be those limits and we expect the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.620
 one of the other would really have 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.540
 marriages and would happen what is 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.340
 happening with statistics in usa 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.140
 there are fewer divorces statistically 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.370
 marriages exactly what would happen 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:55.320
 that would have maybe maybe we would not enter 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.940
 so fast the relationship if there would be less 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.750
 marriages statistically speaking 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.250
 but those who would enter would enter with a 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.990
 clearer definition and with very good 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.730
 forecast and they would be more relationships 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.410
 durable at least there would be better 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.630
 intentions in those who decided 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.640
 embark because of many relationships 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.710
 of couple that I have had to know both 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.200
 they are very aware of what the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.090
 limits that if they transgress they begin 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.860
 to annoy your partner and yet what 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.890
 they do because they are in the understanding that 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.640
 Hold clear, that's where you're already 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.710
 out of order 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.170
 total you're out of the place there you are 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.030
 hitting the car she is she is a 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.980
 crime to pursue that's why we talk about 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.320
 the premeditation the treachery and the 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.150
 advantage to qualify a crime when 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.280
 you are consciously running over 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.540
 your partner you know that hurts him and 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.730
 all the way you do it 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.290
 and then this one is attacking 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.490
 strongly and who knows until when 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.840
 endure and create what the other said 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.630
 of a person in my office not 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.580
 He said everything is practicing everything 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.880
 I did what I said and the panchos 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.440
 that she did to him and how he claimed him 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.990
 I said good here you have to give 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.700
 thank you that your girlfriend is not very 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.560
 not complete either because a person 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.230
 healthy would have left you a long time ago 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.170
 time like this is the reality say to 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.940
 someone who is as an adult adult 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.230
 autonomous can not stand those panchos that 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.960
 type of situations then 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:16.050
 unfortunately to end if you do not 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.060
 you compose you end up attracting someone 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.980
 that is just as ramshackle as you 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.750
 then it will be very interesting there 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.890
 as the titans fight told you but 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.890
 at least they will agree 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.870
 please your contact numbers and with 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.460
