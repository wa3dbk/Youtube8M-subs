 Carlos Fuller professor of the institute 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.870
 advertising plan I am a former student of the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.820
 institute of the fifth promotion I have 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.429
 my own advertising agency since 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.320
 independent work is year 90 and 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.780
 I am currently a professor of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.490
 three advertising sciences careers 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.289

 I will surely see the students of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.899
 all ways when they start with 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.880
 here and I will try to transmit that 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.880
 passion that is told by the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.519
 advertising to start the passion that is 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.649
 very important but it's not the only thing 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.210
 you need a person in these races 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.920
 that you get to work in any of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.350
 All three races need to have a lot 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 discipline to be able to subsist in the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.159
 business advertising you have hours of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 entry you do not have a departure time but if 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.399
 do you really like it and have that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.920
 discipline you're going to do the best 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.839
 way to see your children I call you children 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.729

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.860
 on television in the panels that 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.989
 They are there that help your customers to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.059
 achieve your communication goals is 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.559
 the greatest recognition that one can 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.150
 have outside the prizes that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 you can win many other ex-boys 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.780
 students who have left here already win 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.720
 prizes in cannes de san antonio 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.710
 they gladden apap in these own festivals 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.509
 I have the responsibility to train them 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.009
 from the first cycles to the boys 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.630
 of the three races and I try to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.060
 transmit that passion that I experienced 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.590
 outside and I lived it also being in the pp 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.930
 when I studied here as a student is 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 awesome not because it's not 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.040
 have begun to have learned the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.080
 knowledge of advertising here and one 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.640
 always dream so good to end up having 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.770
 your agency about my agency and then 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.510
 teach and re-teach where you 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.580
 you also learned that it was a dream 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.140
 additional that I met I see you guys 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.310
 As I said they have passed through my agency 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.780
 that are now in other agencies are 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.640
 art directors and creative liquors 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 in big agencies youtube is therefore that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.530
 in some way that strength that 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.040
 has the pp is not lost no we already have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.500
 27 years as an institution and I'm seeing 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.690
 as the boys go out and go and you 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.250
 you find them later in festivals 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.350
 these surveys in presales in 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.060
 advertising meetings and it's nice that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.040
 they come to you and I call you teacher what is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.069
 As it is, it was true what he told me 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.679
 not somewhere else sense teach 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.120
 to the first cycle kids here 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.799
 demanded that I give them is the same as 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.900
 I gave them to other fifth-graders 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.280
 century on another side then just in 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.409
 fourth or fifth cycle they were just 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.060
 seeing things that they should know from the 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.950
 start they have had a basic idea 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.629
 of what advertising is and it is already in 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.829
 our our courses where they 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.310
 they learn what is really the 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.310
 advertising
