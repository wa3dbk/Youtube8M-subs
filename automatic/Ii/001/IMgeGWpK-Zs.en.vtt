for some team new but despite the number

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.230 
for some team new but despite the number
since<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.040> Olympics<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.520> tripled<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.150> then

since the Olympics are tripled and then

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.300 
since the Olympics are tripled and then
again<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.780> splash<00:01:19.080> aired<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.530> January<00:01:19.680> that

again when splash aired in January that

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120 
again when splash aired in January that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the numbers went up again so I mean I'd

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
the numbers went up again so I mean I'd
like<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.759> diving<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> up

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
like to think that diving is on the up

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
like to think that diving is on the up
as<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> sport<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.040> hopefully<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.520> sport<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
as a sport and I hopefully the sport is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.010 
as a sport and I hopefully the sport is
gonna<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.090> bigger<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> bigger<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
gonna get bigger and bigger and the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.330 
gonna get bigger and bigger and the
funding<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.439> go<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.130> we'll<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.250> able

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
funding will go up so that we'll be able

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.179 
funding will go up so that we'll be able

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
to expand our diving teams and hopefully

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.440 
to expand our diving teams and hopefully
become<00:01:32.369> one<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> strongest<00:01:33.119> diving

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
become one of the strongest diving

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
become one of the strongest diving
nations<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> world<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.829> people<00:01:35.159> looked

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
nations in the world what people looked

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
nations in the world what people looked
at<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.329> injury<00:01:36.630> started<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.229> career

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
at you in the injury started your career

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.499 
at you in the injury started your career
and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.159> think<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:38.640> young<00:01:38.820> people<00:01:38.880> certainly

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and I think what young people certainly

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
and I think what young people certainly
took<00:01:39.689> inspiration<00:01:40.200> from<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
took inspiration from that this was a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.850 
took inspiration from that this was a
sport<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.689> could<00:01:42.869> maybe<00:01:43.020> achieve<00:01:43.380> things<00:01:43.590> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
sport it could maybe achieve things and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.010 
sport it could maybe achieve things and
from<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.220> young<00:01:44.369> age<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> keeps<00:01:45.509> well

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
from a young age is that it keeps well

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.450 
from a young age is that it keeps well
with<00:01:46.229> diving<00:01:46.530> it's<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> those<00:01:47.130> sports

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
with diving it's one of those sports

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.600 
with diving it's one of those sports
that<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.229> you<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.770> put<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that it's you just have to put in the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.179 
that it's you just have to put in the
hard<00:01:50.729> work<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.270> try<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.780> become<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.979> good<00:01:53.100> as

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
hard work and try and become as good as

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
hard work and try and become as good as
you<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.820> quick<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.240> but<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:55.409> me

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can as quick as you can but for me

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
you can as quick as you can but for me
like<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> diving<00:01:56.310> peak<00:01:56.700> age<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.060> between<00:01:57.149> 18

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
like the diving peak age of between 18

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.300 
like the diving peak age of between 18

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
and 22 I was aiming for my first

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.270 
and 22 I was aiming for my first
Olympics<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.790> 18<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> was<00:02:00.960> lucky<00:02:01.890> enough<00:02:02.040> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
Olympics at 18 but I was lucky enough to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
Olympics at 18 but I was lucky enough to
have<00:02:02.640> had<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.090> great<00:02:03.329> team<00:02:03.540> around<00:02:03.570> me<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> get

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
have had a great team around me to get

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
have had a great team around me to get

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
me to the Olympic Games in Beijing when

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.960 
me to the Olympic Games in Beijing when
I<00:02:06.030> was<00:02:06.180> 14<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:07.069> it's<00:02:08.069> one<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> those<00:02:08.340> things<00:02:08.670> but

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
I was 14 so it's one of those things but

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.390 
I was 14 so it's one of those things but
I<00:02:09.239> guess<00:02:09.599> with<00:02:09.989> hard<00:02:10.259> work<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:11.009> achieve

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I guess with hard work you can achieve

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.040 
I guess with hard work you can achieve
anything<00:02:11.870> you

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
anything you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.780

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
the London Games her her bag and impact

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.180 
the London Games her her bag and impact
is

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
is

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.040 
is
is<00:04:23.220> gonna<00:04:23.370> have<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:23.610> on<00:04:24.150> this<00:04:24.330> city<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
is gonna have on on this city for the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.420 
is gonna have on on this city for the
future<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:25.590> think<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.010> Commonwealth<00:04:26.340> Games

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
future I think the Commonwealth Games

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.700 
future I think the Commonwealth Games
gonna<00:04:26.730> have<00:04:26.850> a<00:04:26.880> massive<00:04:27.330> impact<00:04:27.450> on<00:04:27.930> Glasgow

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
gonna have a massive impact on Glasgow

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.020 
gonna have a massive impact on Glasgow
because<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.160> don't<00:04:29.490> think<00:04:29.610> anyone<00:04:29.910> can

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
because I don't think anyone can

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.430 
because I don't think anyone can
anticipate<00:04:30.330> what<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.020> going<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.290> like

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
anticipate what it's going to be like

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.100 
anticipate what it's going to be like
