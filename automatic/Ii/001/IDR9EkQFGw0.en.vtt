00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.450
 hello, I'm javi and this is the channel 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.280
 garden is easy 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.019
 drip risk is one of the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.719
 most effective irrigation systems 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.630
 today but to be able to apply it 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.240
 correctly to our crops the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.880
 orchard we must know first of all 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.550
 the types of drippers that exist and how 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.950
 work this next we are going to 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.410
 watch a video about the droppers 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.290
 self-compensating those who mostly 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.020
 I have my drip irrigation 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.700
 If you find it interesting and useful, give it to 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.440
 I like it and if you are interested in following 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.440
 the news of the subscribe channel 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.810
 well we have here a dropper I can 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.020
 self-compensating this this outgoing that 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:01.860
 you see here is because it is a dropper 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:05.850
 punctured and inserted into the pipeline 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.090
 Irrigation in the dropper branch portal as 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 you see has a thread here would enter 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.780
 the water that comes from the pipe 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.590
 and here it would go towards the plant towards 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.010
 the bench where we have our crop 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.030
 It is a self-compensating dropper because 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.070
 work at different pressures 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.500
 always providing the same flow this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.120
 Pressure range is variable 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.580
 depending on the brand of the house 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.620
 which manufactures commercial dropper in this 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.670
 case would always work in a 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.310
 range of pressures 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.790
 contributing a flow of 4 liters now 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.180
 this cotero specifically 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.870
 the pressures oscillate are very variable 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.640
 but well I have hardly any pressure and 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.200
 I can tell you that the dropper works 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.200
 providing enough water well 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.250
 unscrew 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.340
 and here we can see that the dropper consists 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.160
 of three parts 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.160
 in the emitting pipe 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.840
 the water tank to call it that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.420
 and the membrane or diaphragm in the water 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.189
 come here in this tank is the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.050
 bucket through that hole that 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.820
 you can not know if it will be there 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.030
 so it goes through the pipe 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.970
 the water to this tank as I say 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.980
 in this other part that carries the thread and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.860
 that takes the exit from the hole 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.670
 water outlet 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.450
 we have this little 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.450
 this little one 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.040
 cuvette where the diaphragm is inserted 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.349
 or membrane 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.629
 I do not know if you can appreciate it well but there 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.920
 there is a hole through which it passes 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:03.400
 the water and goes outside for that 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.190
 orifice 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.670
 all right 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.220
 the dropper would pass the water with the pressure 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.560
 from that water this membrane is pushed 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.420
 preventing too much water from flowing out 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560
 through that hole the water would pass 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.180
 what should come out 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.969
 calculated 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.640
 to 4 liters hour approximately that 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.830
 dropper 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.990
 and then through that hole as 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.200
 I say would the water pass what happens if 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.580
 work 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.129
 at more pressure as it can shutter I know 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.830
 the water pressure area would push this 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.870
 martial disguise of the background would prevent the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.720
 passage of water through the hole 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.170
 exit and on the contrary with pressures 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.519
 very low what happens is that that water 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.400
 does not push the diaphragm against that form 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.650
 that it has in such a way that it would be the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.400
 pretty loose diaphragm and it would happen more 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.110
 water that is calculated to come out 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.530
 the four liters hours later could 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.840
 eject 86 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.300
 variable depending on the pressure and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.209
 flow that we are contributing in the irrigation 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.940
 clear and more or less this consists 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.519
 basically the functioning of this 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.410
 self-compensating dropper that is the one that I 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.410
 I have in my irrigation system
