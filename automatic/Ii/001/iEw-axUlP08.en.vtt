00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.070
 jens you also live out of the 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.719
 bonner 7 launch event here in london i 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 Do you really hope it is right now 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 a bit noisy I have this way 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.900
 beautiful device just in the hands 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.300
 pressed for short video too 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.680
 That's why we're about to start 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.890
 and we go around here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.610
 In front we have a 52 inch display 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.050
 a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.280
 the whole protected with gorilla klaus 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.789
 otherwise the front is nothing else 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.089
 to see 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.870
 on this side we have the whole 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.149
 normal year 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 and also butt with the power button that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.899
 looks like it 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 and of course a very noble very beautiful 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 according to the master please everything relatively nice 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.390
 Of course, it's finally overbuilt, too 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.070
 Everything metal knows everything there 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.750
 full of sex there was not much metal left 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.970
 to see 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.720
 we're going to have the bottom here 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.399
 we quite normal micro usb standard and 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:13.619
 two speakers and on the top 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:18.690
 the head over entrance here a small one 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.370
 particularity an infrared sensor of 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.020
 the whole mobile phone in the universal 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.509
 remote control can transform 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.829
 then we go to the back and there 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:33.909
 we pretty much have the highlight of 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.100
 721 once a fingerprint sensor the 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.710
 not only finger is present but 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.630
 at the same time as a motzki 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.860
 Lister for all possible functions 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.899
 Does that mean you can do what you want 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.600
 directly to sms or what to grab or 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.509
 accept calls and up here we have 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.610
 the 20 megapixel camera protected with 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.610
 sapphire crystal the fantastic pictures 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.459
 we shall naturally record that 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.770
 Test again later and here 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.920
 You see, we have a normal led 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.780
 lightning and a led flash of it goes 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.819
 if that's what it means 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.569
 she did not tell us and then we leave 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:15.130
 on this side where we have two more 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.329
 I think that has special features 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.120
 best in the camera so maybe 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.860
 here you see there comes sim card 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.370
 pure but not one but two 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.790
 sim cards simultaneously fit the slot 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.560
 also a sd card to expand the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.299
 internal memory what really 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.580
 Fantastic is so there are many 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:36.010
 manufacturers increasingly refrain from doing so 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.140
 continues to put great on SD cards 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.800
 thing and here we have one more 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.760
 button 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.680
 the 1 button is and with that you can 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.960
 actually every app here wants 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.830
 set it on and the app will appear 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.900
 the display is the mobile phone it is 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.960
 a lot of software installed that is nice 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.570
 that should make life easier 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.490
 next in detail the article what 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.770
 less beautiful it is actually on the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.260
 motto seven that the hardware here 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.610
 inside is not so special, moreover 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.060
 women carriers 52 inch display gorilla-glass 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.310
 Also nice for this is the victim core 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.690
 Processor built the m9 I think 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.490
 rate of 2.2 gigahertz per core three 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.120
 gigabytes of memory and one 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.530
 battery with 3100 mah the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.840
 are all very nice features working 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.810
 there is nothing to any fund it from the armchair 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.740
 skin perhaps for what one already 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.280
 more of the armchair skin is the device for 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.290
 349 euros delivered directly from the bonner 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.630
 16 gb you have your own new one 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.050
 store which feels like minor and he gets 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.010
 her on the smartphone 50 euros 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.440
 discount is the end of this month 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.930
 credited and that are already rather house 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.420
 norbert what you then so one 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.250
 Let's call it upper middle class 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.700
 smartphone with a nice one 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.980
 Processing acceptable good hardware 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.430
 from many software features sell 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.640
 can 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.019
 that was a long sentence from me now 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.850
 unfortunately I can not thank you so much 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.000
 show because that is a sample of 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.709
 one of the staff and here i come 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.370
 not purely finger tight that only humans 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.750
 maybe I do not know 1 3 1 here 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.549
 all right 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.450
 I told you everything about the hall 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.020
 I hope I had already again 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.490
 like 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.770
 give me a thumbs up 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.750
 youtube and diligently have the channel 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.750
 thanks a lot for forgetting
