this feature some people are asking me
if<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.000> install<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.540> file<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
if I can if you can install a file and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
if I can if you can install a file and
install<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.090> actually<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
install it I think it's actually a

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
install it I think it's actually a
little<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.720> complicated<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.740> would<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
little bit complicated you would have to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
little bit complicated you would have to
install<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.670> custom<00:01:51.000> ROM<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.869> would<00:01:52.020> have

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
install a custom ROM or you would have

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.770 
install a custom ROM or you would have
to<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:53.009> modify<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> system<00:01:54.090> files<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.630> get

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to really modify the system files to get

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
to really modify the system files to get
it<00:01:54.869> working<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:55.860> know<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.100> it's

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
it working so I don't know if it's

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.889 
it working so I don't know if it's
possible<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:56.939> going<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.180> look<00:01:57.299> into<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.719> but

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
possible I'm going to look into it but

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.899 
possible I'm going to look into it but

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
for now you can go ahead and install a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.539 
for now you can go ahead and install a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
custom ROM such as this one with this

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060 
custom ROM such as this one with this
I'll<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.850> able<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.259> 7.3<00:02:04.259> days<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.829> battery

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
I'll be able to get 7.3 days of battery

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.960 
I'll be able to get 7.3 days of battery
life<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.520> 59%<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.740> I've<00:02:08.160> actually<00:02:08.310> tested<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
life on 59% and I've actually tested it

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.699 
life on 59% and I've actually tested it
out<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.840> get<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> won't

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
out and you can get you know you won't

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.500 
out and you can get you know you won't
get<00:02:10.920> exactly<00:02:11.430> seven<00:02:11.700> days<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.120> you'll<00:02:12.270> get

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
get exactly seven days but you'll get

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.260 
get exactly seven days but you'll get
you

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
you

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.790 
you
if<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.510> use<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.690> all<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.080> time<00:02:14.320> you'll<00:02:14.740> be

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
if you use it all the time you'll be

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.580 
if you use it all the time you'll be
able<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.130> get<00:02:15.250> near<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.870> six<00:02:16.870> days<00:02:17.170> you<00:02:17.470> know

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
able to get near like six days you know

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.590 
able to get near like six days you know
so<00:02:17.860> ultra<00:02:18.310> power<00:02:18.490> saving<00:02:18.580> mode<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.240> think<00:02:19.450> it's

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
so ultra power saving mode I think it's

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.540 
so ultra power saving mode I think it's
one<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.320> the<00:02:20.470> coolest<00:02:20.860> features<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:22.330> Samsung

that's why I hole true power saving mode

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.900 
that's why I hole true power saving mode
works<00:02:43.990> really<00:02:44.290> well<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:45.040> is<00:02:45.130> really<00:02:45.610> cool
