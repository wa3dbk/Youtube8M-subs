flight now ed in the voltages see it's
um<00:01:22.649> well<00:01:25.710> 3.76<00:01:26.789> pulled<00:01:27.789> so<00:01:28.180> tight<00:01:28.479> I'll<00:01:28.780> climb

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
um well 3.76 pulled so tight I'll climb

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.639 
um well 3.76 pulled so tight I'll climb
all<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.380> way<00:01:29.409> up<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:29.710> five<00:01:30.640> or<00:01:30.850> six<00:01:31.119> holes<00:01:31.649> if

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
all the way up to five or six holes if

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.609 
all the way up to five or six holes if
you<00:01:32.799> leave<00:01:33.039> it<00:01:33.070> be<00:01:33.369> when<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:33.820> connect<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.240> LED

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you leave it be when you connect the LED

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.169 
you leave it be when you connect the LED
and<00:01:35.619> close<00:01:35.860> back<00:01:36.130> down<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.550> threes<00:01:36.820> on<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
and close back down the threes on the

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:49.130 
and close back down the threes on the
bolts<00:01:43.800> connect<00:01:44.800> led

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.450 

drop-ins

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.980 

so<00:01:52.820> far<00:01:53.090> it<00:01:53.210> drops<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:54.820> steal<00:01:55.990> stabilizes

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
so far it drops to steal stabilizes

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.050 
so far it drops to steal stabilizes
around<00:01:57.290> there<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:58.580> LED<00:01:59.119> connected<00:02:01.060> slowly

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
around there is LED connected slowly

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.460 
around there is LED connected slowly
drops<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:02.840> guess<00:02:05.080> stabilizes<00:02:06.080> right<00:02:06.259> about

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
drops I guess stabilizes right about

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.770 
drops I guess stabilizes right about
there
