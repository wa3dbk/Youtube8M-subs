 new the channel today I bring you good a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.410
 video to show you the new interface 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.810
 which good here you have the new 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.759
 champion which we will present in the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.650
 next video we will see all your 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.090
 skills and others and well then something 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.460
 I wanted to teach pretty much everything 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.179
 that is the good one and that I forgot 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.440
 I have also changed this bar 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.200
 the menu that comes out when we skate 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.450
 They change us all 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 yellow wine I like but good for 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.190
 that you like is the little buttons and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.960
 other video I think this is a bug 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.390
 the yellow this is a bug is horrible 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.340
 and good has also changed when we go 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.730
 to the tabulator now I say because I'm 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.730
 just me 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.979
 photos that you know before 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.020
 good if this garcia and change a little 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.520
 and others quite curious enough 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.540
 quite curious I like I like them 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.009
 changes they are making to the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.500
 third season it shows that I know 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.149
 they're working pretty good hello 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.149
 everyone welcome in a month on the channel 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.189
 today I bring you another video of a new 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.420
 champion in this case will be to me a 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.429
 support one of the most champions 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.289
 expected finally bring other groups 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.640
 after lulu and well then in a 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.990
 principle it is said that this champion is going to 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.490
 being a potential student is going to have 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.250
 very much damage as well as going to be able 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.179
 raffle with their skills and good the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.369
 truth is that because of what I was seeing 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.020
 is a very very strong champion to the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.720
 time to draw has a lot of damage has 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.909
 very useful and good so let's go 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.350
 more or less to explain how it goes first 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.789
 teach your self attack the truth that 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.490
 It has enough range to be a super 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.020
 Well, I've already shown you a couple of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.190
 little things that I just remembered what 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.310
 we left earlier in ink in the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.610
 masters as well as good as this the 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.830
 uar is within movement that we 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.509
 they gave with mastery you can not even see 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.890
 there we see it can not be removed from 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.090
 no way even with a wow 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.170
 pink 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 and there is then the biscuit this sometimes 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 I wonder 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.680
 we have the chat 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.680
 OK 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.160
 to see the biscuit 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.050
 Nothing does not even have 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.400
 not even have picture yet because 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.600
 that gives us the regeneration of life and 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.760
 Mana and the truth is pretty good 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.950
 to start good, let's start with the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.330
 passive skills every time 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.820
 we use an ability on 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.050
 ourselves on our ally will 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.330
 we will give movement speed we the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.490
 we will give ourselves always and 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.080
 when depending on good then of 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.480
 our level we will give you a percentage 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.590
 which is increasing or simply we 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.590
 we make a skill 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.670
 here 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.830
 and we increase our speed 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.450
 movement for a short period of 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.290
 one time with 25 seconds so 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.060
 we see how we move to the cab q in 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.700
 a selected area is quite small 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.690
 but hey it's pretty pretty good 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.280
 we will study all good we will be 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.440
 we will launch into the air and study them 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.080
 for a couple of seconds at all 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.120
 enemy champions or minions that we 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.470
 find in that space the truth that 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.670
 quite small spaces but there is one 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.129
 skill at a time and can make a 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.079
 true destruction since apart from 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.030
 we see that it does not hit anything wrong are 136 for 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.600
 be a support with nothing of ap is very 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.390
 very good 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:37.030
 then let's go to the w this is a 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.590
 Somewhat special skill has glue 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.400
 both allied and enemy champions 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.400
 and jump and jump has up to a maximum of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.800
 three jumps is like for example the 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.390
 zurich in this one that is bouncing off 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.580
 enemy enemy of civil but good 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.260
 they are also allied to enemies to 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.050
 those who jump will simply hurt them 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.050
 and if anyone jumps the allied champion 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.610
 will give you give you life without more can do 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.490
 up to three jumps and I think 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.800
 that are completely random 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.760
 then let's go to the e and we can throw it 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.040
 also about 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.239
 an allied champion and in this way what 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.250
 we will do it will give you speed of 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.780
 motion biology of movements and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.370
 good movement speed by the 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.720
 passive and what we will do is that the three 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.579
 following auto attacks we make 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.650
 we if the other envelopes our 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.440
 ourselves or on any 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.510
 Allied champion will make a percentage of 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.350
 extra magic year which is not much 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.669
 but good the truth that hits quite 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.340
 to be a software like indigeste 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.680
 lulu style and good let's air the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.689
 skill one of the best is last 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.419
 that I've seen so far has a lot 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.679
 very much area as we see it hurts and 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.209
 throws all the airs 

00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:49.719
 enemy champions who are in 

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:51.789
 this extensive journey will slow them down 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:54.610
 60% or for a couple of seconds 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.139
 when when it ends and apart it will increase 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.289
 the time in which he threw for 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.360
 aires according to him the distance to which he has 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.579
 travel stability but good as much 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.309
 the strongest this skill we see 

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:08.799
 is the reach is almost a last louis in 

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:11.079
 power all this scope of this is 

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:13.569
 give root and ximo this for my taste 

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:15.869
 as well look how you see I shot from 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.869
 here to see 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.870
 you do not do not hurt the truth and 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.880
 see how far it gets if it arrives 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.530
 I do not know, I think it's very, very strong 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.090
 we'll see how this champion behaves 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.890
 in the phase of lines and the truth that 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.030
 looks pretty good and good other 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.680
 thing that I forgot in the base of 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.090
 the masters this mastery that we the 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.400
 I open every time we give a blow to 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.740
 any enemy or if it's just that 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.910
 we give him a blow we receive gold like that with 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.800
 one of the air about five seconds ago 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.810
 approximate good without approximately 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.490
 with about five seconds this is what 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.530
 I see very strong for range support 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.710
 because to the ml support as well 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.810
 said 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.640
 in the other video do not usually give auto 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.190
 attacks but nevertheless a support of 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.350
 range can be allowed to be 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.700
 constantly giving you attacks on the other and 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.620
 if above we have skills like this 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.310
 that makes us have more damage then 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.310
 much better 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.270
 which hits a lot very much this 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.330
 character for the seen and good then 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.070
 nothing this has not been all for nam and we 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.700
 we see in the following video 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.700
 two
