00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.560
 so mehdi mostefa we did not expect 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.509
 marisa on his right lane back 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.630
 as a right holder 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.270
 what can you say about 1 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.860
 on this match late not able to achieve no 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.900
 I will tell you about a collective plan 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.540
 we have a pretty good first half 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.590
 difficult because we were not too 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.260
 was boss a big fund was not 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.880
 that his group slipped a little 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.189
 Romanian with the balloon so 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.169
 there is largesse a little bit of our best 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.269
 in defense especially on the sides where 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.470
 they managed to amass afterwards by 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.570
 second half we rectified a small 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 little shot we stayed there most wholesale 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 saw that we worked in our 35 40 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 meters and we stayed because he got 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 felt that price there that you have to go to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 september because belgium that go 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.909
 have very very fast and we saw that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.710
 like that we managed to go on I'm going 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.850
 still 4 5 and occasioned you me 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.920
 attackers who showed very quickly 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.750
 after just betting worries problem 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 in front of the goal which only exports our 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.659
 attackers kept as a punishment 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.309
 exactly how do you explain this lack 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.320
 of realism we will say was not created 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.309
 bad luck but it's a bit 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500
 pity anyway how do I 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.720
 can try to explain so 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.670
 I think it needs better pensions 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.900
 and now the emerging countries who sees 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 there I come back we will not have as much 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.630
 against your opinion is that they take 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.020
 in belgium so I hope that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.579
 the striker the metropolises them 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.380
 the only beautiful of the two occases that 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.090
 will we have more success after y'a 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.420
 we leave an internship that was still 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.039
 long enough so a little bit of easy 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.869
 we'll say but that's what makes everything 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.130
 she knew the attackers it's like 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.840
 that I suddenly want a brand is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.509
 great goal of the puffs in front of the pack 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 dacca youth here it is it is the 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.140
 little things to settle as we have 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.350
 things to settle in defense so in 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.750
 break 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.430
 I hope we'll be ready the day 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.390
 that's the important thing you think the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.860
 three friendlies we could 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.080
 arguing against slovenia armenia 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 today romania was to help 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.830
 my test anyway it was 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.270
 quality equipment at the global because 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.250
 that you thought bank coupons 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.659
 is especially about the accompaniment I 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.960
 think it is 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.310
 it's really a step up from them 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.840
 2 how 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.159
 Armenia 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.159
 it's a team that could have played the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.110
 world we saw it tonight 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.570
 control of the ball 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.610
 have been playing together for quite a few years 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.120
 so frankly it's really and this 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.920
 that we have seen what we know 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.480
 level and we have seen that if we are not in 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.010
 big who are sitting we went from saying 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.510
 like that how the second half time 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.920
 especially 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.330
 it's going to be very, very hard so we got it 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.680
 learned we learned a lot from mistakes 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.190
 that we could do in particular program 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.710
 time so we are a young team to whom 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.209
 is a selection so that's all that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.530
 must think about it and it's not easy 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.970
 and tonight I think we have not seen not 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.950
 bad things especially second mi 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.650
 time we are a young team when we 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.870
 to say to himself launched m for the agent to repeat you 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.710
 meaning how in this team has the stuff 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.640
 of a quarter of that team in front 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.069
 4 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.970
 yes technical silence Algerian rafik 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.910
 Halliche 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.680
 it is true that it is true that after 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.240
 young people who are there I think about social 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.750
 feghouli am in a very big club 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.880
 so 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.209
 so here I think the group is 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.860
 homogeneous my group 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.060
 to us now the youngest of their 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.380
 give seven novels because we said 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.990
 it's international matches 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.550
 but there is really talent so a 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.900
 tool to channel all that and then two 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.150
 to be able to achieve great things 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.800
 at the world but said we then 28 means 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.020
 little bit on the right side post 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.940
 so he remains aissam indicated that they 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.070
 were young and promising but that's it 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.230
 chose to line up at this position 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.360
 it's a shame Belgium where it's for 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.890
 the world cup begins 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.490
 every month will tell us to align people 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.030
 Armenian and his line and this meaning I think 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.760
 that the choice is not made at all 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.990
 as the entire team so the 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.690
 competition is healthy down is fighting for 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.020
 all sides play the cinema is that the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.240
 soccer 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.320
 yes that's a very very very very 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.740
 great player very good player very 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.780
 promising 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.540
 he's on the ground against music the 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.159
 first break 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.159
 thanks to you but it's the worst of it
