lucky<00:00:58.440> enough<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> actually<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> PC<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.569 
lucky enough to actually have a PC and a
ps4<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.629> I've<00:01:00.719> got<00:01:00.840> two<00:01:01.020> platforms<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.129> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
ps4 so I've got two platforms that I can

actually use the game on but I can see

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
actually use the game on but I can see
how<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.830> disappointing<00:01:05.580> for

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
how this will be disappointing for

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.020 
how this will be disappointing for
people<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.439> ps4<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.670> Xbox

people that don't have a ps4 and Xbox

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.969 
people that don't have a ps4 and Xbox
one<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.570> PC<00:01:10.080> that's<00:01:10.200> good<00:01:10.409> enough<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> run<00:01:10.830> the

one a PC that's good enough to run the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190 
one a PC that's good enough to run the
game<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.670> cuts<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.810> quite<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> bit

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
game because that cuts out quite a bit

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.450 
game because that cuts out quite a bit
of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.380> audience<00:01:13.710> doesn't<00:01:14.010> at<00:01:14.070> me<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> know<00:01:14.430> a

lot of people have been converted over

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.370

to the newer consoles and might have a
newer<00:01:19.590> pcs<00:01:20.130> well<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.909> still<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> it's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
newer pcs well but I still say that it's

newer pcs well but I still say that it's
a<00:01:21.659> bit<00:01:21.810> disappointing<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.770> never

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
a bit disappointing that it's never

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
because there there must be quite a lot

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
because there there must be quite a lot
of<00:01:28.380> people<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.070> an<00:01:29.310> Xbox<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.759> I

disappointing<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:11.849> that's<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
disappointing but that's just the way it

surprisingly and the ps3 which is
surprising<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.900> me<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.379> I<00:02:19.470> thought

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
surprising to me because I thought

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.339 
surprising to me because I thought
they'd<00:02:19.829> be<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:20.250> keep<00:02:20.400> releasing<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.349> huge

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
they'd be just keep releasing a huge

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.750 
they'd be just keep releasing a huge
amount<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.680> time<00:02:22.829> like<00:02:22.980> they<00:02:23.099> did<00:02:23.549> with<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
amount of time like they did with the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.809 
amount of time like they did with the
ps2<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.900> isn't<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.260> case<00:02:25.290> f1<00:02:26.069> 2015

the new game and a new driving camera
mounted<00:02:47.730> near<00:02:48.299> the<00:02:48.450> front<00:02:48.780> wings<00:02:49.260> are

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
mounted near the front wings are

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.559 
mounted near the front wings are
thinking<00:02:50.159> that<00:02:50.280> front<00:02:50.639> wing<00:02:50.819> cameras<00:02:51.299> trying

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
thinking that front wing cameras trying

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.479 
thinking that front wing cameras trying
to<00:02:51.659> be<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:52.049> bit<00:02:52.409> more<00:02:52.530> realistic<00:02:52.920> if<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.459> a

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
to be a bit more realistic if you have a

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.030 
to be a bit more realistic if you have a
simulator<00:02:54.060> setup<00:02:54.599> like<00:02:54.840> myself<00:02:55.049> you<00:02:55.829> might

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
simulator setup like myself you might

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.309 
simulator setup like myself you might
you<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.459> go<00:02:56.730> towards<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.269> new<00:02:57.420> replay<00:02:58.079> and

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
you know go towards that new replay and

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.990 
you know go towards that new replay and
all<00:02:58.439> that's<00:02:58.590> really<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.829> new<00:02:59.040> camera<00:02:59.579> a<00:02:59.760> bit

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
all that's really that new camera a bit

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.789 
all that's really that new camera a bit
you<00:03:00.329> know<00:03:00.420> associated<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.139> bit<00:03:01.260> near<00:03:01.439> the<00:03:01.590> front

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
you know associated a bit near the front

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.589 
you know associated a bit near the front
wing<00:03:02.010> there<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:03.030> trying<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.299> make<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> I

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
wing there so that's trying to make it I

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.360 
wing there so that's trying to make it I
think<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.989> bit<00:03:04.230> more<00:03:04.260> realistic<00:03:04.739> especially<00:03:05.280> if

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
think a bit more realistic especially if

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.920 
think a bit more realistic especially if
your<00:03:05.489> whole<00:03:05.639> like<00:03:05.909> cockpit<00:03:06.420> setup<00:03:06.780> and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
your whole like cockpit setup and

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.440 
your whole like cockpit setup and
everything<00:03:06.959> maybe<00:03:07.769> if<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.189> have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.670> setup<00:03:09.150> but

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
everything maybe if you have a setup but

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.629 
everything maybe if you have a setup but
like<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.599> full<00:03:09.870> middle<00:03:10.019> one<00:03:10.290> race<00:03:10.560> meeting<00:03:11.159> they

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
like a full middle one race meeting they

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.129 
like a full middle one race meeting they
normally<00:03:12.120> have<00:03:12.209> a<00:03:12.239> little<00:03:12.480> set<00:03:12.689> up<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.019> know

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
normally have a little set up you know

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.020 
normally have a little set up you know
with<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.319> full<00:03:13.560> cockpit<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.099> an<00:03:14.189> f1<00:03:14.519> car<00:03:14.549> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
with a full cockpit in an f1 car and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.610 
with a full cockpit in an f1 car and
that<00:03:15.659> would<00:03:15.780> make<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.079> bit<00:03:16.200> more<00:03:16.349> realistic

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
that would make it a bit more realistic

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.770 
that would make it a bit more realistic
with<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.129> camera<00:03:17.549> view<00:03:17.730> as<00:03:17.790> well<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.419> think

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
with that camera view as well so I think

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.689 
with that camera view as well so I think
that's<00:03:19.109> interesting<00:03:19.290> couple<00:03:20.160> of<00:03:20.250> games<00:03:20.489> in

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
that's interesting couple of games in

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.789 
that's interesting couple of games in
recent<00:03:21.049> you<00:03:22.049> know<00:03:22.139> your<00:03:22.260> recent<00:03:22.560> years<00:03:22.709> have

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
recent you know your recent years have

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.140 
recent you know your recent years have
been<00:03:22.859> bringing<00:03:23.099> out<00:03:23.250> camera<00:03:23.669> views<00:03:23.849> a<00:03:23.879> bit

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
been bringing out camera views a bit

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.309 
been bringing out camera views a bit
like<00:03:24.299> that<00:03:24.329> I<00:03:24.510> don't<00:03:24.690> think<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.019> one<00:03:25.199> I'll

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
like that I don't think it's one I'll

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.379 
like that I don't think it's one I'll
particularly<00:03:25.889> use<00:03:26.069> myself<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.699> normally<00:03:27.269> go

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
particularly use myself I normally go

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.839 
particularly use myself I normally go
with<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:27.690> camera<00:03:28.049> here<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.650> sometimes<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
with this camera here and sometimes the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.849 
with this camera here and sometimes the
cockpit<00:03:30.389> camera<00:03:30.599> depending<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.260> how<00:03:31.409> good<00:03:31.470> it

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
cockpit camera depending on how good it

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.949 
cockpit camera depending on how good it
is<00:03:31.889> I<00:03:32.220> mean<00:03:32.489> some<00:03:32.819> years<00:03:33.030> just<00:03:33.329> terrible

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
is I mean some years just terrible

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.080 
is I mean some years just terrible
cockpit<00:03:34.470> camera<00:03:34.799> but<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.159> can't<00:03:35.549> really<00:03:35.790> you

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
cockpit camera but I can't really you

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.490 
cockpit camera but I can't really you
know<00:03:36.209> go<00:03:36.359> towards<00:03:36.750> this<00:03:36.900> one<00:03:37.139> it's<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.349> one

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
know go towards this one it's the one

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.680 
know go towards this one it's the one
that<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.739> see<00:03:37.889> most<00:03:38.280> from<00:03:38.669> and<00:03:38.909> that's

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
that you can see most from and that's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.420 
that you can see most from and that's
not<00:03:39.840> just<00:03:39.900> enjoyed<00:03:40.379> driving<00:03:40.620> cars<00:03:41.069> from<00:03:41.310> the

formula<00:03:44.729> 3<00:03:44.760> I<00:03:45.000> don't<00:03:45.209> mind<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.479> cockpit

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
formula 3 I don't mind the cockpit

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.809 
formula 3 I don't mind the cockpit
camera<00:03:46.109> but<00:03:46.319> you<00:03:46.500> know<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.099> bigger<00:03:47.370> formula

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
camera but you know the bigger formula

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.759 
camera but you know the bigger formula
cars<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.329> don't<00:03:48.389> particularly<00:03:49.109> like<00:03:49.290> seeing

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
cars I don't particularly like seeing

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.289 
cars I don't particularly like seeing
the<00:03:50.190> cockpit<00:03:50.609> camera<00:03:50.849> because<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.150> too

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
the cockpit camera because just too

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.759 
the cockpit camera because just too
close<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.810> steering<00:03:52.019> wheel<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.470> now

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
close to the steering wheel and now

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:53.689 
close to the steering wheel and now
that's<00:03:52.949> realistic

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
that's realistic

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.460 
that's realistic
but<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:53.970> just<00:03:54.150> don't<00:03:54.269> enjoy<00:03:54.599> driving<00:03:54.870> cars<00:03:55.290> from

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
but I just don't enjoy driving cars from

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.719 
but I just don't enjoy driving cars from
that<00:03:55.590> angles<00:03:55.949> that's<00:03:56.099> why<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.310> always<00:03:56.459> go

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:56.729 
that angles that's why I always go

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:59.449 
that angles that's why I always go
towards<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.180> T<00:03:57.329> cam<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:57.979> yes<00:03:58.979> I<00:03:59.129> was<00:03:59.190> good<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
towards the T cam and yes I was good to

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.909 
towards the T cam and yes I was good to
see<00:03:59.720> implementing<00:04:00.720> some<00:04:00.930> new<00:04:00.959> replay<00:04:01.470> cameras

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
see implementing some new replay cameras

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.619 
see implementing some new replay cameras
in<00:04:02.069> there<00:04:02.220> as<00:04:02.310> well<00:04:02.579> hopefully<00:04:03.239> we<00:04:03.329> had<00:04:03.419> to<00:04:03.510> get

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
in there as well hopefully we had to get

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.569 
in there as well hopefully we had to get
some<00:04:03.780> cool<00:04:03.989> shots<00:04:04.229> as<00:04:04.409> well<00:04:04.560> flight<00:04:04.739> montages

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
some cool shots as well flight montages

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.009 
some cool shots as well flight montages
in<00:04:05.729> everything<00:04:06.090> another<00:04:06.449> not<00:04:06.659> it's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.840> big

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
in everything another not it's a big

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.129 
in everything another not it's a big
community<00:04:07.199> she's<00:04:07.709> now<00:04:07.889> starting<00:04:08.400> up<00:04:08.879> big<00:04:09.750> sort

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
community she's now starting up big sort

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.680 
community she's now starting up big sort
of<00:04:10.489> community<00:04:11.489> one<00:04:11.669> charges<00:04:12.120> it<00:04:12.239> I<00:04:12.299> suppose<00:04:12.540> in

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
of community one charges it I suppose in

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.990 
of community one charges it I suppose in
a<00:04:12.780> way<00:04:12.810> for<00:04:13.440> f1<00:04:13.889> games<00:04:14.220> that'd<00:04:14.459> be<00:04:14.639> interesting

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
a way for f1 games that'd be interesting

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.789 
a way for f1 games that'd be interesting
to<00:04:15.060> see<00:04:15.239> if<00:04:15.389> those<00:04:15.569> new<00:04:15.780> replay<00:04:16.139> cameras<00:04:16.590> can

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
to see if those new replay cameras can

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.920 
to see if those new replay cameras can
help<00:04:17.010> out<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:18.150> don't<00:04:18.269> think<00:04:18.539> we're<00:04:18.840> gonna

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
help out and I don't think we're gonna

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.449 
help out and I don't think we're gonna
have<00:04:19.109> a<00:04:19.169> replay<00:04:19.709> camera<00:04:20.099> where<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.340> can

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
have a replay camera where you can

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.250 
have a replay camera where you can
switch<00:04:20.729> between<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.269> cars<00:04:21.479> but<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:21.900> do<00:04:21.989> think<00:04:22.109> I

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
switch between the cars but I do think I

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.170 
switch between the cars but I do think I
think<00:04:22.560> we<00:04:22.650> all<00:04:22.740> expected<00:04:23.340> there<00:04:23.580> something

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
think we all expected there something

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.850 
think we all expected there something
more<00:04:24.300> want<00:04:24.659> but<00:04:25.110> I<00:04:25.139> don't<00:04:25.289> think<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:25.710> going

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
more want but I don't think that's going

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.820 
more want but I don't think that's going
to<00:04:25.919> be<00:04:26.039> an<00:04:26.130> f1<00:04:26.400> 20

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
to be an f1 20

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.290 
to be an f1 20
