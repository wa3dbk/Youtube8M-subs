new<00:00:46.320> looking<00:00:46.860> pipe<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:49.160> that's<00:00:50.160> where<00:00:50.399> we

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
new looking pipe and that's where we

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.840 
new looking pipe and that's where we
hook<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.469> factory<00:00:52.469> exhaust<00:00:52.850> right

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
hook on to the factory exhaust right

hook on to the factory exhaust right
there<00:00:54.090> which<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:54.989> 3-inch<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.640> three

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
there which is 3-inch so we have three

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
there which is 3-inch so we have three
to<00:00:57.030> four<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.510> five

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

then it's got a seal clamp right behind

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.690 
then it's got a seal clamp right behind
with<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.729> 45<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.750> then<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> 90<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.580> the

stainless tack welded on to there so I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.109 
stainless tack welded on to there so I
thought<00:01:42.090> she's<00:01:42.720> looking<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.049> from<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.850> end

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
thought she's looking like from this end

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.990 
thought she's looking like from this end
of<00:01:45.240> things<00:01:45.450> knowing<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.490> only<00:01:47.610> thing<00:01:47.909> I

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
of things knowing of the only thing I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.170 
of things knowing of the only thing I
forgot<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> had<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.500> us<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:50.180> 3-inch

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
forgot that you had to get us a 3-inch

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.210 
forgot that you had to get us a 3-inch
steel<00:01:51.390> clamp<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:53.009> I've<00:01:53.070> been

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
steel clamp for there so I've been

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.260 
steel clamp for there so I've been
driving<00:01:53.520> around<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.759> last<00:01:53.880> couple<00:01:54.149> days

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
driving around the last couple days

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630 
driving around the last couple days
without<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:56.130> doesn't<00:01:56.549> look

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
without that there but it doesn't look

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.120 
without that there but it doesn't look
like<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.939> leaking<00:01:57.119> at<00:01:57.390> all

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
like it's leaking at all

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.190 
like it's leaking at all
so<00:01:59.130> yeah<00:01:59.340> I'll<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.299> crawl<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:01.020> under

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
so yeah I'll just crawl it from under

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
so yeah I'll just crawl it from under
here<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.560> I'll<00:02:01.619> show<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.860> guys<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.340> from

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
here and I'll show you guys from from

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.920 
here and I'll show you guys from from

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the outside and then this is the view

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.499 
the outside and then this is the view
from<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.229> back

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.440 

and<00:02:10.509> see<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.670> basically<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:12.819> just<00:02:13.030> comes<00:02:13.269> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
and see it basically it just comes to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.600 
and see it basically it just comes to
the<00:02:13.750> edge<00:02:13.900> of<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.440> box<00:02:14.950> where<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.310> rolls<00:02:15.519> back

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
the edge of the box where it rolls back

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.589 
the edge of the box where it rolls back
