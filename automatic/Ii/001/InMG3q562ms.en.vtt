this<00:00:27.119> raises<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.539> question<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.349> date

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
this raises a question how was the date

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
equinox obviously this year is going to

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.469 
equinox obviously this year is going to
be<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.220> little<00:01:26.220> bit<00:01:26.340> later<00:01:26.520> than<00:01:26.700> usually<00:01:27.210> and

be a little bit later than usually and
then<00:01:27.720> after<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.350> go<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.770> first

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
then after that you go to the first

understand<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> ancients<00:01:50.070> didn't<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.369> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
understand the ancients didn't have a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.649 
understand the ancients didn't have a
lot<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:50.939> night<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.329> could<00:01:51.450> look<00:01:51.540> at

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
lot to do at night so they could look at

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
lot to do at night so they could look at
the<00:01:51.720> sky<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:51.990> figure<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:52.649> things<00:01:52.979> that

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the sky and figure out these things that

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.889 
the sky and figure out these things that
they<00:01:53.790> figured<00:01:54.119> out<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.509> these<00:01:54.630> full

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
they figured out with all these full

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.350 
they figured out with all these full
moons<00:01:55.170> would<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:57.090> did<00:01:57.240> all

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
moons would be and so if they did all

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.060 
moons would be and so if they did all
the<00:01:57.450> computations<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:58.200> us<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.950> we

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the computations for us and so all we

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.920 
the computations for us and so all we
have<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.090> looking<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.570> book<00:02:00.780> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
have to do is it's looking a book and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.080 
have to do is it's looking a book and
know<00:02:01.110> when<00:02:02.009> marty<00:02:02.250> was<00:02:02.399> gonna<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:02.939> what's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
know when marty was gonna be but what's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.210 
know when marty was gonna be but what's
unusual<00:02:03.240> though<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.960> being<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
unusual though is being this

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.890 
unusual though is being this
this<00:02:06.400> would<00:02:06.550> be<00:02:06.640> an<00:02:06.760> unusually<00:02:07.270> long<00:02:07.510> Mardi

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
this would be an unusually long Mardi

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.900 
this would be an unusually long Mardi
Gras<00:02:08.050> season<00:02:08.290> because<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:09.399> beginning<00:02:09.850> of

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
Gras season because the beginning of

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.670 
Gras season because the beginning of
Carnival<00:02:10.330> season<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.780> always<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.110> fixed<00:02:11.530> date

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
Carnival season is always a fixed date

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.280 
Carnival season is always a fixed date
that's<00:02:12.370> 12<00:02:12.730> 9<00:02:13.000> on<00:02:13.150> january<00:02:13.360> sixth<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.230> we

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
that's 12 9 on january sixth and so we

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.740 
that's 12 9 on january sixth and so we
can<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.560> from<00:02:14.710> january<00:02:15.190> six<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:16.180> march<00:02:16.480> aids

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
can go from january six to march aids

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.140 
can go from january six to march aids
and<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.140> that's<00:02:17.380> two<00:02:18.370> months<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.790> two<00:02:18.940> things

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
and so that's two months and two things

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.380 
and so that's two months and two things
a<00:02:19.330> very<00:02:19.660> long<00:02:19.840> very<00:02:20.380> long<00:02:20.500> season<00:02:21.100> i<00:02:21.640> guess<00:02:22.210> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
a very long very long season i guess the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
a very long very long season i guess the
good<00:02:22.900> news<00:02:22.960> for<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.440> or<00:02:23.590> maybe<00:02:23.710> it's<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.950> bad

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
good news for that or maybe it's the bad

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.130 
good news for that or maybe it's the bad
news<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.970> means<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.540> it's<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:25.930> much

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
news is that means that it's that much

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.660 
news is that means that it's that much
longer<00:02:26.440> we're<00:02:26.530> going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.740> be<00:02:26.800> exposed<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.340> king

them little bit but economically a late
mardi<00:02:38.050> gras<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.260> usually<00:02:38.650> good<00:02:38.770> for<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> city

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
mardi gras is usually good for the city

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.820 
mardi gras is usually good for the city
because<00:02:39.490> because<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.330> longer<00:02:40.630> mardi<00:02:41.530> gras<00:02:41.650> is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
because because the longer mardi gras is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.440 
because because the longer mardi gras is
from<00:02:42.070> christmas<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.670> more<00:02:42.850> people<00:02:43.330> have

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
from christmas the more people have

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.520 
from christmas the more people have
chance<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.870> rebuild<00:02:44.140> their<00:02:44.290> incomes<00:02:45.390> to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
chance to rebuild their incomes to

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.930 
chance to rebuild their incomes to
re-build<00:02:47.530> their<00:02:47.770> discretionary<00:02:48.310> dollars<00:02:48.550> in

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
re-build their discretionary dollars in

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.000 
re-build their discretionary dollars in
the<00:02:49.090> end<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.780> travel<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.410> miss<00:02:50.620> person<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
the end to travel and miss person the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.470 
the end to travel and miss person the
wedding<00:02:51.280> gets<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.459> little<00:02:51.580> bit<00:02:51.730> warmer<00:02:52.060> too<00:02:52.240> and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
wedding gets a little bit warmer too and

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.960 
wedding gets a little bit warmer too and
so<00:02:53.140> financially<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:54.010> would<00:02:54.220> probably<00:02:54.430> be<00:02:54.760> a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
so financially it would probably be a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.880 
so financially it would probably be a
good<00:02:55.330> mardi<00:02:55.840> gras<00:02:55.990> for<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> city<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:56.800> a
