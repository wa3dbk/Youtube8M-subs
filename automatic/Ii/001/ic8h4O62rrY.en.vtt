Hello Everyone, this is Asahi

00:00:01.906 --> 00:00:06.878
Following May, and June I would like to 
 show you this month's Revlon nail art！

00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:11.382
If you haven't seen my previous videos, I will have the 
 links below so please take a look at them too!

00:00:11.382 --> 00:00:18.055
I would like to introduce to you new nail polish releases from Revlon

00:00:23.627 --> 00:00:26.882
There are 10 colors in total

00:00:26.882 --> 00:00:34.092
There are actually two brushes in this one product and on the 
 side where the label indicates 1, the brush size is normal

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:39.180
and the brush on the other side which is indicated as 2- 
 is a thin nail art brush so with one product,

00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:41.780
you will be able to do detailed 
 nail art so it is very handy!

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:46.885
The striped nails that I have on are simple vertical lines

00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:53.911
You can also change it up by making the lines horizontal and 
 I really like the combination of these two colors

00:00:53.911 --> 00:01:01.854
You can also write letters, and draw intricate drawings and lines 
 so I think you can enjoy them a lot

00:01:01.854 --> 00:01:08.205
Out of the bunch, I really like these 
 two because they are very summery

00:01:08.205 --> 00:01:11.011
The colors are very vibrant!

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:16.131
By using these, you can make nails like these 
 that are really colorful and fun like these

00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:20.632
There are some limited edition colors as well, so if you 
 are interested, please take a look at them in stores!

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:25.004
Now I would like to take you through on 
 how to create these two nail arts!

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:27.660
Let's start with the colorful leopard print!

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.877
These are the colors that I will be using

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:32.646
As a base, I apply the white nail polish

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:37.316
Add the lightest color in this case yellow in random places like so

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:40.620
It looks better if you make the shape and size all different

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.220
Next, apply the pink the same way in several places

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.320
By applying the polish on the edge and side of your 
 nails I think the design will look more natural

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:58.560
Finish off by adding the blue. 
As this color stands out the most, 
 it will balance out the whole look by drawing them smaller

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:04.160
Now, we will use this gold to draw 
 the edges around the design we made

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:13.130
Like I am doing here, if you surround one side like a bracket and 
 leave out some spots on the other side, I think it look good

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.770
I think your leopard print will look more 
 realistic if you draw each pattern randomly

00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:23.980
If there are spots that look a little unbalanced, you can add 
 the gold by drawing little 'c' shapes in the spots

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.010
Finish off by using a top coat

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:41.820
Now, let's get on with these fun heart nails

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:44.400
I am using white as a base for this nail art too

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:49.700
Today, I would like to add an edge and make 
 my hearts look as if they are moving

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:58.600
The tip to drawing the heart is to start off with a dot and 
 carefully drag your brush down and make it look like a tadpole

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:02.620
Do the same for the other half of the heart and connect it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.130
By making each heart a-symmetrical, it gives the heart more movement

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.900
If there is a certain heart shape that you 
 like, I think that is good too!

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:17.590
add in parts of the heart to the 
 tips and base of your nails

00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:22.170
Next, with the black we will draw the lines for the hearts

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:31.510
Even though I have a black, as it is the normal brush tip I will be using the 
 tip for the glitter polish as it is less likely to effect the color of the polish

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:36.490
After using it, make sure you clean it well with nail 
 varnish and the brush will be back to normal!

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:40.450
The tip to drawing the lines is to not 
 follow the shape of the heart

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:47.680
but to deliberately have the lines sticking out or drawing them on the heart and 
 this will make the lines stand out and makes it look like an illustration

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:51.220
Finish off with top coat

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.230
How was it? Did you enjoy it?

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:02.810
Obviously, you can re-create these nails with what you already have at home

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.300
They are so easy and cute so please have a go at them!

00:04:05.297 --> 00:04:12.110
Well, thank you for watching till the end, 
 see you in my next video! Bye!
