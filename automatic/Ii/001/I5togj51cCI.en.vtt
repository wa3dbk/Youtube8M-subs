CPUs<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> as<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.100> guys<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.369> see<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.000> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
CPUs so as you guys can see this this is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.269 
CPUs so as you guys can see this this is
the<00:00:18.210> box<00:00:18.510> itself<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.320> let's<00:00:19.500> go<00:00:19.680> ahead<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.920> see

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the box itself so let's go ahead and see

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:29.880 
the box itself so let's go ahead and see
what's<00:00:20.460> included<00:00:20.730> inside

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.890 

so<00:00:30.890> we<00:00:31.010> get<00:00:31.160> two<00:00:31.340> pieces<00:00:31.550> inside<00:00:32.060> one<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.689> the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
so we get two pieces inside one is the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.870 
so we get two pieces inside one is the
cooler<00:00:33.140> itself<00:00:33.560> and<00:00:33.800> the<00:00:33.950> other<00:00:33.980> box<00:00:34.460> contains

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
cooler itself and the other box contains

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.430

all the screws and other accessories

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.180 
all the screws and other accessories
that<00:00:36.620> will<00:00:36.950> be<00:00:37.130> needed<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.580> fit<00:00:37.730> this<00:00:37.880> in<00:00:39.190> so

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
that will be needed to fit this in so

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.460 
that will be needed to fit this in so
opening<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:40.880> box<00:00:41.120> it<00:00:41.390> contains<00:00:41.870> some<00:00:42.050> product

also<00:00:44.900> have<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:45.200> thermal<00:00:45.620> compound<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:46.400> a

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
also have a thermal compound and a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.000 
also have a thermal compound and a
variety<00:00:46.970> of<00:00:47.239> brackets<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:48.739> will<00:00:48.860> be

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
variety of brackets that you will be

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.479 
variety of brackets that you will be
using<00:00:49.160> depending<00:00:49.699> on<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:49.940> type<00:00:50.150> of<00:00:50.180> subject

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
using depending on the type of subject

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.860 
using depending on the type of subject
now<00:00:52.489> let's<00:00:52.760> have<00:00:52.879> a<00:00:52.940> closer<00:00:53.239> look<00:00:53.390> at<00:00:53.720> the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
now let's have a closer look at the

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.869 
now let's have a closer look at the
cooler<00:00:54.140> itself<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.160> can<00:00:55.309> see<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.550> three

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879

speed varying from 800 to 2800 rpm to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850 
speed varying from 800 to 2800 rpm to
install<00:01:05.149> this<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.660> need<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.080> screw<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:06.619> the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
install this you need to screw in the

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.889 
install this you need to screw in the
needed<00:01:07.190> pins<00:01:07.490> on<00:01:07.759> to<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.330> cooler<00:01:08.570> itself

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
needed pins on to the cooler itself

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.070 
needed pins on to the cooler itself
depending<00:01:09.560> on<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.830> socket<00:01:10.070> type<00:01:10.399> of<00:01:10.610> your<00:01:10.790> CPU

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
depending on the socket type of your CPU

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.570 
depending on the socket type of your CPU
once<00:01:12.080> it's<00:01:12.259> done<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:13.040> just<00:01:13.100> need<00:01:13.460> to

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
once it's done you just need to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.969 
once it's done you just need to
basically<00:01:14.030> clean<00:01:14.780> up<00:01:14.930> any<00:01:15.140> previous<00:01:15.590> thermal

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
basically clean up any previous thermal

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.770 
basically clean up any previous thermal
paste<00:01:16.160> and<00:01:16.490> apply<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.880> provided<00:01:17.450> Herrmann

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
paste and apply the provided Herrmann

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
paste and apply the provided Herrmann
paste<00:01:18.050> on<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.500> processor<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:19.130> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.120 

and<00:01:27.050> then<00:01:28.050> you<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.440> need<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> place<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and then you just need to place the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.040 
and then you just need to place the
cooler<00:01:29.340> over<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> make<00:01:30.390> sure<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.810> clicks

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
cooler over it and make sure it clicks

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.320 
cooler over it and make sure it clicks
in<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
in so that's pretty much it for the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.110 
in so that's pretty much it for the
installation<00:01:34.040> in<00:01:35.040> terms<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.640> performance

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
installation in terms of performance

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.270 
installation in terms of performance

earlier using my stock cooler I was

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.790 
earlier using my stock cooler I was
getting<00:01:38.580> about<00:01:38.760> 55<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.330> 60<00:01:39.810> degree<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.350> ideal

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
getting about 45 to 50 degree well that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.390 
getting about 45 to 50 degree well that
might<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.840> sound<00:01:46.260> much<00:01:46.440> of<00:01:46.650> a<00:01:46.740> difference<00:01:47.160> but

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
might not sound much of a difference but

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.580 
might not sound much of a difference but
do<00:01:47.640> trust<00:01:47.940> me<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.450> next<00:01:48.690> one<00:01:48.840> while

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
do trust me on the next one while

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.070 
do trust me on the next one while
rendering<00:01:49.890> onload<00:01:50.760> I<00:01:50.940> was<00:01:51.150> getting<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.630> 95

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
rendering onload I was getting about 95

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.110 
rendering onload I was getting about 95

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
with this cooler master tx3 Evo I'm

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.930 
with this cooler master tx3 Evo I'm
getting<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.780> 65<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.290> 70<00:01:58.770> degree<00:01:59.040> which<00:01:59.790> is

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
getting about 65 to 70 degree which is

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.730 
getting about 65 to 70 degree which is
like<00:02:00.090> almost<00:02:00.360> 30<00:02:00.660> degree<00:02:01.140> drop<00:02:01.170> while

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
like almost 30 degree drop while

like almost 30 degree drop while
rendering<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.550> I<00:02:02.670> think<00:02:02.850> it's<00:02:02.970> quite<00:02:03.090> amazing

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
rendering and I think it's quite amazing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.270 
rendering and I think it's quite amazing
and<00:02:04.160> best<00:02:05.160> of<00:02:05.310> all<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.970> cost<00:02:06.300> around

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
and best of all it just cost around

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.310 
and best of all it just cost around
1,500<00:02:08.280> Indian<00:02:08.550> rupee<00:02:08.790> which<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.119> around<00:02:09.360> $25<00:02:10.140> I

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
1,500 Indian rupee which is around $25 I

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.410 
1,500 Indian rupee which is around $25 I
