you actually tie the line on the spool
you're<00:00:32.119> not<00:00:32.270> going<00:00:32.419> to<00:00:32.480> be<00:00:32.570> able<00:00:32.689> to<00:00:32.840> actually

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
you're not going to be able to actually

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.410 
you're not going to be able to actually
wind<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.559> line<00:00:33.770> onto<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.340> spool<00:00:34.640> next<00:00:35.300> thing

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
wind the line onto the spool next thing

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.360 
wind the line onto the spool next thing
you<00:00:35.510> need<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.690> do<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:36.140> actually<00:00:36.500> tie<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.860> line

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
you need to do is actually tie the line

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.450 
you need to do is actually tie the line
onto<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.450> reel<00:00:38.660> itself<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:39.650> what<00:00:39.800> I<00:00:39.950> just<00:00:40.070> do

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
onto the reel itself so what I just do

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.100 
onto the reel itself so what I just do
is<00:00:40.580> again<00:00:40.820> nothing<00:00:41.000> complicated<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.020> the

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
is again nothing complicated for the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.560 
is again nothing complicated for the
actual<00:00:42.440> knot<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:43.580> all<00:00:43.730> it<00:00:43.880> is<00:00:43.910> is<00:00:44.060> it's<00:00:44.210> really

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
actual knot but all it is is it's really

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.810 
actual knot but all it is is it's really
just<00:00:44.840> an<00:00:45.020> overhand<00:00:45.650> knot<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.520> what<00:00:46.640> I'm<00:00:46.700> going

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
just an overhand knot so what I'm going

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.100 
just an overhand knot so what I'm going
to<00:00:46.880> do<00:00:47.000> I'm<00:00:47.120> going<00:00:47.240> to<00:00:47.300> tie<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:47.540> a<00:00:47.630> wrap<00:00:47.780> it

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
to do I'm going to tie it a wrap it

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.380 
to do I'm going to tie it a wrap it
around<00:00:48.200> the<00:00:48.410> spool<00:00:48.680> tie<00:00:49.400> one<00:00:49.670> overhand<00:00:50.180> knot

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
around the spool tie one overhand knot

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.569 
around the spool tie one overhand knot
just<00:00:50.690> like<00:00:50.810> I<00:00:50.900> was<00:00:51.020> doing<00:00:51.170> my<00:00:51.410> shoe<00:00:51.680> from<00:00:52.400> there

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
just like I was doing my shoe from there

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.979 
just like I was doing my shoe from there
I'm<00:00:52.670> going<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.820> take<00:00:52.970> another<00:00:53.210> overhand<00:00:53.810> knot

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
I'm going to take another overhand knot

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.380 
I'm going to take another overhand knot
and<00:00:54.170> do<00:00:54.380> the<00:00:54.500> exact<00:00:54.829> same<00:00:54.860> thing<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.550> tie<00:00:56.329> it

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
and do the exact same thing and tie it

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.610 
and do the exact same thing and tie it
and<00:00:56.660> pull<00:00:56.840> it<00:00:56.870> down<00:00:56.989> tight

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
and pull it down tight

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.260 
and pull it down tight
so<00:00:57.829> again<00:00:58.010> now<00:00:58.190> that<00:00:58.340> I've<00:00:58.460> got<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.730> tied<00:00:59.030> on

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
so again now that I've got it tied on

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.300 
so again now that I've got it tied on
there<00:00:59.570> one<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.320> things<00:01:00.380> that<00:01:00.739> I<00:01:00.770> always<00:01:01.070> do

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
there one of the things that I always do

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.149 
there one of the things that I always do
is<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.550> take<00:01:01.910> the<00:01:02.120> actual<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:03.230> actual<00:01:03.560> tag<00:01:03.829> end

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
is I take the actual the actual tag end

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.609 
is I take the actual the actual tag end
and<00:01:04.399> I<00:01:04.759> take<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> set<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:05.329> scissors<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:06.079> and<00:01:06.470> to

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
and I take a set of scissors here and to

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.490 
and I take a set of scissors here and to
make<00:01:06.770> sure<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.950> cut<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.399> as<00:01:07.520> close<00:01:07.970> as<00:01:08.180> I<00:01:08.299> can<00:01:08.500> so

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
make sure I cut it as close as I can so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.020 
make sure I cut it as close as I can so
that<00:01:09.560> it's<00:01:09.799> not<00:01:09.950> going<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.189> impede<00:01:10.609> the<00:01:10.850> line

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
that it's not going to impede the line

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.520 
that it's not going to impede the line
that's<00:01:11.299> coming<00:01:11.389> off<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.749> rest<00:01:12.109> of<00:01:12.259> the<00:01:12.319> reel

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
that's coming off the rest of the reel

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.469 
that's coming off the rest of the reel
one<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.249> tricks<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.639> I<00:01:13.670> also<00:01:13.939> do<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.359> I

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
one of the tricks that I also do is I

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.109 
one of the tricks that I also do is I
actually<00:01:14.659> take<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.200> sticker<00:01:15.799> from<00:01:16.369> my<00:01:16.700> spool

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
actually take the sticker from my spool

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.719 
actually take the sticker from my spool
and<00:01:17.659> I'll<00:01:17.810> also<00:01:18.020> put<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:18.530> over<00:01:18.979> top<00:01:19.219> of<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.460> so

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
and I'll also put it over top of that so

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.919 
and I'll also put it over top of that so
sometimes<00:01:20.149> you<00:01:20.299> do<00:01:20.420> need<00:01:20.569> to<00:01:20.719> take<00:01:20.869> the

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
sometimes you do need to take the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.649 
sometimes you do need to take the
scissors<00:01:21.380> cut<00:01:21.649> it<00:01:22.189> a<00:01:22.280> little<00:01:22.490> bit<00:01:22.700> smaller<00:01:23.060> but

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
scissors cut it a little bit smaller but

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.730 
scissors cut it a little bit smaller but
once<00:01:23.840> you've<00:01:23.990> actually<00:01:24.319> cut<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:24.649> a<00:01:24.709> bit

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
once you've actually cut it a bit

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.529 
once you've actually cut it a bit
smaller<00:01:25.039> and<00:01:25.340> you've<00:01:25.459> got<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.759> smaller<00:01:26.179> piece

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
smaller and you've got a smaller piece

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.120 
smaller and you've got a smaller piece

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
when you set it down you want to make

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.050 
when you set it down you want to make
sure<00:01:50.990> you've<00:01:51.229> got<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.499> label<00:01:51.740> facing<00:01:52.369> up<00:01:52.520> the

sure you've got the label facing up the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.059 
sure you've got the label facing up the
label<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.779> spool<00:01:54.079> facing<00:01:54.590> up<00:01:54.709> is<00:01:54.859> going<00:01:55.009> to

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
label of the spool facing up is going to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.910 
label of the spool facing up is going to
have<00:01:55.279> that<00:01:55.549> line<00:01:55.880> coming<00:01:56.270> off<00:01:56.479> clockwise<00:01:57.319> but

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
have that line coming off clockwise but

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.319 
have that line coming off clockwise but
it's<00:01:58.069> also<00:01:58.219> gonna<00:01:58.459> then<00:01:58.789> do<00:01:58.969> that's<00:01:59.179> gonna

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
it's also gonna then do that's gonna

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.419 
it's also gonna then do that's gonna
match<00:01:59.719> it<00:01:59.749> up<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:00.319> the<00:02:00.590> way<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.069> line<00:02:01.279> is

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
match it up to the way that the line is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.669 
match it up to the way that the line is
going<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.639> be<00:02:01.759> going<00:02:01.969> on<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.509> reel<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.319> line

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
going to be going on the reel so line

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.379 
going to be going on the reel so line
again<00:02:04.189> whether<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.549> monofilament<00:02:04.999> or

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
again whether it's monofilament or

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:08.650 
again whether it's monofilament or
fluorocarbon<00:02:06.189> has<00:02:07.189> some<00:02:07.459> memory<00:02:07.789> so<00:02:08.390> it's<00:02:08.509> got

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
fluorocarbon has some memory so it's got

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.260 
fluorocarbon has some memory so it's got
memory<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.349> this<00:02:09.530> size<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:10.009> school<00:02:10.280> going<00:02:11.000> into

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
memory to this size of school going into

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.449 
memory to this size of school going into
a<00:02:11.300> smaller<00:02:11.690> spool<00:02:12.110> but<00:02:12.440> it's<00:02:12.560> also<00:02:12.740> got<00:02:13.010> memory

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
a smaller spool but it's also got memory

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.550 
a smaller spool but it's also got memory
into<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.760> direction<00:02:14.329> it's<00:02:14.450> going<00:02:14.540> if<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.379> can

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
into the direction it's going if you can

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.630 
into the direction it's going if you can
keep<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.860> going<00:02:16.099> in<00:02:16.189> the<00:02:16.280> right<00:02:16.310> direction

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
keep it going in the right direction

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.280 
keep it going in the right direction
it's<00:02:17.420> going<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.629> make<00:02:17.780> things<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.110> lot<00:02:18.260> easier

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
it's going to make things a lot easier

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.420 
it's going to make things a lot easier
for<00:02:18.650> you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
for you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.099 
for you
then<00:02:19.579> all<00:02:19.700> I'm<00:02:19.819> doing<00:02:20.120> again<00:02:20.510> I'm<00:02:20.629> holding<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
then all I'm doing again I'm holding it

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.170 
then all I'm doing again I'm holding it
nice<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.319> tight<00:02:21.680> I've<00:02:21.890> got<00:02:22.040> my<00:02:22.189> drag<00:02:22.430> down<00:02:22.790> I'm

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
nice and tight I've got my drag down I'm

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.670 
nice and tight I've got my drag down I'm
making<00:02:23.599> sure<00:02:23.719> that<00:02:23.840> I've<00:02:23.959> got<00:02:24.109> it<00:02:24.200> pinched<00:02:24.560> in

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
making sure that I've got it pinched in

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.890 
making sure that I've got it pinched in
my<00:02:24.799> fingers<00:02:25.129> again<00:02:25.310> real<00:02:25.670> tight<00:02:25.969> don't<00:02:26.629> whine

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
my fingers again real tight don't whine

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.440 
my fingers again real tight don't whine
too<00:02:27.349> too<00:02:27.620> fast<00:02:27.980> if<00:02:28.219> you<00:02:28.340> wind<00:02:28.640> really<00:02:29.150> really

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
too too fast if you wind really really

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.000 
too too fast if you wind really really
fast<00:02:29.719> as<00:02:30.019> you're<00:02:30.170> bringing<00:02:30.469> the<00:02:30.590> line<00:02:30.769> through

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
fast as you're bringing the line through

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.559 
fast as you're bringing the line through
you<00:02:31.129> might<00:02:31.310> burn<00:02:31.519> your<00:02:31.790> fingers

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
you might burn your fingers

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.240 
you might burn your fingers
but<00:02:32.870> again<00:02:33.049> I'm<00:02:33.170> holding<00:02:33.409> it<00:02:33.650> nice<00:02:33.859> and<00:02:33.890> tight

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
but again I'm holding it nice and tight

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.770 
but again I'm holding it nice and tight
to<00:02:34.430> make<00:02:34.549> sure<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.849> don't<00:02:35.060> have<00:02:35.209> any<00:02:35.359> issues

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
to make sure that don't have any issues

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.629 
to make sure that don't have any issues
I'm<00:02:36.109> gonna<00:02:36.379> keep<00:02:36.590> winding<00:02:36.859> it<00:02:37.099> on<00:02:37.219> the<00:02:37.340> spool

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:37.639 
I'm gonna keep winding it on the spool

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.920 
I'm gonna keep winding it on the spool
there<00:02:37.879> until<00:02:38.299> it's<00:02:38.450> full

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
there until it's full

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.229 
there until it's full
now<00:02:39.469> when<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.680> say<00:02:39.920> full<00:02:40.250> what<00:02:40.519> full<00:02:40.819> means<00:02:41.060> is

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
now when I say full what full means is

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.270 
now when I say full what full means is
you<00:02:41.329> want<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.689> it<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:42.010> maybe<00:02:43.010> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you want to have it just maybe a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.849 
you want to have it just maybe a
sixteenth<00:02:43.939> of<00:02:44.090> an<00:02:44.239> inch<00:02:44.359> below<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.109> capacity

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
sixteenth of an inch below the capacity

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.920 
sixteenth of an inch below the capacity
of<00:02:45.889> the<00:02:46.159> spool<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.939> the<00:02:47.120> capacity<00:02:47.719> would<00:02:47.870> be

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
of the spool so the capacity would be

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.020 
of the spool so the capacity would be
with<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.379> line<00:02:48.620> being<00:02:49.040> completely<00:02:49.579> flush

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
with the line being completely flush

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.089 
with the line being completely flush
with<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.359> spool<00:02:50.629> itself<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.709> know<00:02:51.950> just

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
with the spool itself so you know just

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.649 
with the spool itself so you know just
keep<00:02:52.189> winding<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.849> on<00:02:52.970> there<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.329> tell<00:02:53.540> you

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
keep winding it on there and tell you

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.599 
keep winding it on there and tell you
get<00:02:53.810> close<00:02:54.049> to<00:02:54.079> that<00:02:54.349> point<00:02:54.709> I'm<00:02:55.370> getting

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:55.609 
get close to that point I'm getting

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.539 
get close to that point I'm getting
pretty<00:02:55.790> close<00:02:55.939> right<00:02:56.480> now<00:02:57.220> so<00:02:58.220> that<00:02:58.370> should

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
pretty close right now so that should

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.240 
pretty close right now so that should
give<00:02:58.700> me<00:02:58.730> yeah<00:02:59.510> I'll<00:02:59.750> give<00:02:59.959> me<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.349> about<00:03:00.590> 100

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
give me yeah I'll give me just about 100

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.339 
give me yeah I'll give me just about 100
yards<00:03:01.430> probably<00:03:02.150> just<00:03:02.480> over<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.810> hundred<00:03:03.169> yards

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
yards probably just over a hundred yards

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.500 
yards probably just over a hundred yards
on<00:03:03.620> this<00:03:03.799> spool<00:03:04.069> what<00:03:04.730> I'm<00:03:04.819> then<00:03:05.000> gonna<00:03:05.120> do<00:03:05.389> I'm

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
on this spool what I'm then gonna do I'm

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.909 
on this spool what I'm then gonna do I'm
going<00:03:05.629> to<00:03:05.689> take<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:05.989> same<00:03:06.290> pair<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.560> scissors

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
going to take that same pair of scissors

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.190 
going to take that same pair of scissors
I<00:03:07.040> cut<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.430> label<00:03:08.030> with<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.659> cut<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.019> line

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
I cut the label with and cut the line

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.069 
I cut the label with and cut the line
now<00:03:09.799> bad<00:03:10.310> habit<00:03:10.790> rub<00:03:11.209> it<00:03:11.329> with<00:03:11.450> your<00:03:11.480> teeth

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079

now bad habit rub it with your teeth
I<00:03:12.109> do<00:03:12.680> it<00:03:12.919> sometimes<00:03:13.040> too<00:03:13.549> I'm<00:03:13.700> sure<00:03:13.730> everybody

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
I do it sometimes too I'm sure everybody

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:15.970 
I do it sometimes too I'm sure everybody
does<00:03:14.389> but<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.049> always<00:03:15.200> chip<00:03:15.469> a<00:03:15.560> teapot<00:03:15.919> a

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
does but you can always chip a teapot a

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.589 
does but you can always chip a teapot a
tooth<00:03:16.189> you're<00:03:16.489> probably<00:03:17.150> making<00:03:17.329> your

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
tooth you're probably making your

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.240 
tooth you're probably making your
dentist's<00:03:18.019> life<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.349> little<00:03:18.469> easier<00:03:18.919> but<00:03:19.129> it's

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
dentist's life a little easier but it's

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.979 
dentist's life a little easier but it's
not<00:03:19.310> something<00:03:19.609> you<00:03:19.760> want<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.090> do<00:03:20.239> from<00:03:20.840> there

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
not something you want to do from there

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.569 
not something you want to do from there
again<00:03:21.319> like<00:03:21.469> I<00:03:21.590> said<00:03:21.650> I'm<00:03:21.919> just<00:03:21.950> gonna<00:03:22.129> cut<00:03:22.430> the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
again like I said I'm just gonna cut the

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.490 
again like I said I'm just gonna cut the
line<00:03:22.760> from<00:03:23.510> there<00:03:23.720> you<00:03:23.840> can<00:03:23.959> take<00:03:24.109> a<00:03:24.169> look<00:03:24.349> at

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
line from there you can take a look at

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.920 
line from there you can take a look at
the<00:03:24.590> spool<00:03:24.949> and<00:03:25.220> see<00:03:26.090> what<00:03:26.239> I<00:03:26.269> mean<00:03:26.479> when<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.690> say

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the spool and see what I mean when I say

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.930 
the spool and see what I mean when I say
it's<00:03:27.079> full<00:03:27.349> it's<00:03:27.829> not<00:03:28.010> overfilled<00:03:28.729> that's

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
it's full it's not overfilled that's

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.059 
it's full it's not overfilled that's
probably<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.540> max<00:03:29.870> capacity<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.799> would<00:03:30.949> ever

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
probably the max capacity you would ever

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.339 
probably the max capacity you would ever
want<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.400> put<00:03:31.549> on<00:03:31.699> your<00:03:31.849> reel<00:03:32.120> that's<00:03:32.629> just<00:03:33.199> to

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
want to put on your reel that's just to

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.439 
want to put on your reel that's just to
the<00:03:33.379> edge<00:03:33.650> slightly<00:03:34.370> below<00:03:34.729> the<00:03:34.879> edge<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.359> the

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
the edge slightly below the edge of the

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.509 
the edge slightly below the edge of the
reel<00:03:35.629> itself<00:03:36.019> now<00:03:36.739> what<00:03:36.919> I'm<00:03:37.010> gonna<00:03:37.159> do<00:03:37.400> is

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
reel itself now what I'm gonna do is

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.729 
reel itself now what I'm gonna do is
actually<00:03:37.639> show<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.180> trick<00:03:38.569> to<00:03:38.930> actually

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
actually show you a trick to actually

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.500 
actually show you a trick to actually
make<00:03:39.859> sure<00:03:39.889> that<00:03:40.069> you<00:03:40.189> can<00:03:40.340> cast<00:03:40.579> right<00:03:40.970> away<00:03:41.239> a

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
make sure that you can cast right away a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.360 
make sure that you can cast right away a
lot<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.079> times<00:03:42.290> like<00:03:42.409> I<00:03:42.620> said<00:03:42.889> you've<00:03:43.069> got<00:03:43.099> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
lot of times like I said you've got the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.580 
lot of times like I said you've got the
memory<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.939> the<00:03:44.090> line<00:03:44.299> which<00:03:44.569> is<00:03:44.689> a<00:03:44.720> nylon<00:03:45.049> line

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
memory of the line which is a nylon line

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.679 
memory of the line which is a nylon line
whether<00:03:46.220> it's<00:03:46.459> monofilament<00:03:46.970> whether<00:03:47.449> it's

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
whether it's monofilament whether it's

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.629 
whether it's monofilament whether it's
fluorocarbon<00:03:48.470> any<00:03:48.650> of<00:03:48.889> that<00:03:49.129> it's<00:03:49.400> going<00:03:49.549> to

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
fluorocarbon any of that it's going to

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.300 
fluorocarbon any of that it's going to
come<00:03:49.819> off<00:03:49.849> a<00:03:49.970> spool<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:50.629> size<00:03:50.989> onto<00:03:51.979> a<00:03:52.009> spool

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
come off a spool this size onto a spool

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.249 
come off a spool this size onto a spool
this<00:03:52.549> size<00:03:52.849> which<00:03:53.479> is<00:03:53.659> going<00:03:53.750> to<00:03:53.810> give<00:03:54.019> it<00:03:54.139> the

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:54.259 
this size which is going to give it the

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:56.439 
this size which is going to give it the
tendency<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.829> want<00:03:54.979> to<00:03:55.099> jump<00:03:55.489> off<00:03:55.669> the<00:03:55.970> spool

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
tendency to want to jump off the spool

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.149 
tendency to want to jump off the spool
you'll<00:03:56.780> make<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.989> cast<00:03:57.319> you'll<00:03:57.590> have<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.949> line

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
you'll make a cast you'll have that line

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.460 
you'll make a cast you'll have that line
jump<00:03:58.699> off<00:03:58.909> and<00:03:59.150> it'll<00:03:59.359> create<00:03:59.659> a<00:03:59.780> big<00:03:59.930> knot<00:04:00.169> for

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
jump off and it'll create a big knot for

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.050 
jump off and it'll create a big knot for
you<00:04:00.590> so<00:04:01.099> what<00:04:01.250> you<00:04:01.310> want<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.549> do<00:04:01.669> is<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.909> want

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
you so what you want to do is you want

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.580 
you so what you want to do is you want
to<00:04:02.120> take<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.389> spool<00:04:02.720> off<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.199> way<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.379> take

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
to take the spool off the way you take

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.210 
to take the spool off the way you take
the<00:04:03.709> spool<00:04:03.979> off<00:04:04.159> is<00:04:04.840> untwist<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.049> the<00:04:06.379> drag<00:04:06.709> so

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
the spool off is untwist the the drag so

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.860 
the spool off is untwist the the drag so
you<00:04:07.280> want<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.489> make<00:04:07.579> the<00:04:07.669> drag<00:04:07.939> again<00:04:08.359> as<00:04:08.509> loose

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
you want to make the drag again as loose

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.199 
you want to make the drag again as loose
as<00:04:08.900> it'll<00:04:09.290> possibly<00:04:09.919> go<00:04:10.099> and<00:04:10.340> that'll<00:04:10.909> allow

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
as it'll possibly go and that'll allow

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.909 
as it'll possibly go and that'll allow
you<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.479> take<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.689> spool<00:04:12.139> of<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.409> reel<00:04:12.620> itself

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
you to take the spool of the reel itself

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.469 
you to take the spool of the reel itself
off<00:04:13.189> so<00:04:13.459> again<00:04:13.879> you<00:04:13.970> want<00:04:14.090> to<00:04:14.120> keep<00:04:14.299> it<00:04:14.449> going

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:14.479 
off so again you want to keep it going

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.420 
off so again you want to keep it going
until<00:04:14.780> it's<00:04:15.109> real<00:04:15.319> loose<00:04:15.530> eventually<00:04:16.250> it'll

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
until it's real loose eventually it'll
