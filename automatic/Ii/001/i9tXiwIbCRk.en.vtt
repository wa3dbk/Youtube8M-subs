00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.779
 world today I find you for 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.700
 a new video so it's a video 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.450
 a bit special because it's a 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.760
 little an inspiration and a tutorial to the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.590
 time so I'll show you all that 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.820
 today I propose a tutorial on 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.440
 this stuff 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.850
 so what happens is that I saw 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.830
 a lot of pictures between chin and that 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.250
 on tumblr on instagram of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.480
 pictures of navy naomi photos from 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.190
 a lot of girls with this kind of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.020
 things and I thought why not 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.210
 you make a video of how to do it 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.120
 so that's what I realized with a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 liner so only with a liner so 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.079
 that's what I realized 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.999
 personally so to carry out alone 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.699
 or that I got inspired so 2.7 the 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.229
 navy naomi's photo of the photo of the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.780
 blogger I believe she is 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:51.629
 Norwegian but I'm not sure Lisa 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.519
 and another girl who was in 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.889
 the iss is celebrating or the one on one side 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.589
 so the uci who also realized 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.819
 according to things below on instagram I 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.769
 I was told why not offered a 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.539
 video of how I realized mine 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.860
 may be able to help you knowing 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.750
 I'm not an artist at all 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.980
 and so that's within the reach of all 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.390
 world after if I can advise you 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.650
 something really was to use 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.270
 a waterproof liner because 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.160
 personally I will not go out 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.860
 with that but why not for a look 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.230
 festivals or for any 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 other style of evening or anything 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.750
 it can still be nice enough to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.970
 carry 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.440
 so do not forget to use a liner 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.960
 waterproof what you see me I can 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.670
 put my hand on it without the sleeve 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.050
 and go away personally 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.940
 will see that I went to the fingers 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.560
 you are really free to choose the 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.180
 shape you want is really the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.230
 reasons that you wish anyway 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.790
 I hope this video a little 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.620
 different you will like and that she is a 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.120
 little different and that's something you 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.260
 who might interest you 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.430
 do not hesitate to put in the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.020
 comments of the videos you 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.370
 would like to see I do big kisses 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.880
 julia quarter or next video 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.800
 not bad so for these tutorials 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.180
 I use my liner marc jacobs which we 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.860
 will start first by doing a 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.540
 kind of little bracelet at the level of 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.979
 wrist for really a bit of limits 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 and the drawings we're going to do I 'm going 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.979
 then make big petals so everything 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.380
 is done by show of hands it does not need 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.340
 to be perfect and you reproduce that to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.750
 about the entire width of the headband 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.299
 knowing that I did not do 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.490
 of error here I left my hand 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.800
 discovery 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.720
 I do then similar to 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 inside so to do even more 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.860
 of contrasts more motives that's 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.600
 really feel me I show you 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.670
 the reasons I realized but there's 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.890
 really a lot of possibilities you 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.240
 are really able to do what 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.770
 you want then I add 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.200
 little circus performers on the tour 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.230
 same to still make motives and 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.450
 that I fill with smaller ones for 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.430
 give contrast to my little ones 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.350
 spheres that I put around and you see 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.680
 I'm still doing a pyramid system I 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.110
 filled I add reasons all being 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880
 an eternal renewal between 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.140
 quotation marks and it's always motives 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.490
 very easy to do and very fast I 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.770
 then make small dots for 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.780
 continue to fill but kind of 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.220
 similar petals to prevent it from being 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.590
 Too much life I found it a little fast without 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.640
 nothing so we do not take the lead and we 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.640
 makes peas 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.800
 Then we go to the second part of 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.370
 the headline and I'm going to redo a 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.870
 kind of little little bracelet for 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.940
 still limits and the reasons that I 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.190
 will realize after that allows not too much 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.900
 getting lost from not going too far and I 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.420
 will make crosses for this 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.190
 part there so always the same hand 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.690
 lifting they are not perfect 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.730
 honestly they are not very right 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.990
 they are not the same size but 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.380
 frankly we only see fire 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.290
 knowing that we will really fill 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.270
 inter inter crossing so same 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.530
 I still remake my little 2002 me 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.730
 circle to really have a 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.890
 continuity in what I had done at 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.660
 above with the petals so I fill 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:52.550
 really the entire cuff 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.550
 between the crosses with that kind of things 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.220
 then I'm like I'm doing a third 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.690
 bracelet always for really 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.520
 delineate the patterns knowing that I 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.860
 change each round is so for 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.050
 this part I'm going to realize 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.700
 small petals on the edge so all the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.880
 long that I fill with points the 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.890
 name of my bracelet I add then 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.480
 a big black dot for the same 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.220
 to fill my petals is to avoid 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.780
 they are a little less there I'm going 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.500
 to make a huge flower so we make a 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.650
 half century 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:24.060
 I fill it with small strokes and 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.060
 then I will realize the petals 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.360
 this time I make the petals 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.040
 big enough to really fill a 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.390
 little part of my headlines for 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.100
 really do something a little 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.020
 different and I'm leaving a little bit on the 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.090
 same reason that I had made bone so 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.460
 with the filling 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.170
 knowing that I'm doing a try again 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.130
 always coordinate but pattern with 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.140
 what I did on the cuff 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.970
 from before the device I fill you see 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.530
 with small streamers 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.660
 it's not very pretty and finally all that goes 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.860
 just bring volume and 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.360
 filling in my drawing then I'm going 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.040
 move on to must so I decided to 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.750
 to do a kind of little bac so I 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.250
 go around and I'm going to realize 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.110
 little feathers so I make them from 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.300
 different sizes like that very easy 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.040
 you put a line and full of 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.540
 small strokes on the sides and you have 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.540
 feathers is super easy to achieve 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.480
 then I make an arrow so on my 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.890
 index quite stupidly because I 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.080
 found that it was a little fast on 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.640
 I have therefore got a little amused and I 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 always make small dots I try 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.170
 to always keep the same spirit 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.680
 in my motives here with the spirals 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.750
 small dots and housings 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.360
 things and then there I do another 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.920
 base of antrim and and here I resume the 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.790
 pattern of the cross I made on the 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.380
 second part of my eating the same 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.810
 filled again but spiral of which 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.940
 always points to be is always 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.450
 very easy to do and that's what 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.280
 it gives 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.600
 I hope that this total is you liked me 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.600
 you make lots of big kisses giaba
