00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:16.560 

I'm<00:00:02.220> still<00:00:02.460> considering<00:00:02.820> it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.960 

agent<00:00:16.960> Walker<00:00:17.170> is<00:00:17.770> everything<00:00:18.220> okay<00:00:18.520> it's

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
agent Walker is everything okay it's

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.210

about<00:00:19.180> Chuck<00:00:19.420> safety<00:00:19.900> I<00:00:20.170> thought<00:00:21.040> he<00:00:21.189> just

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
about Chuck safety I thought he just

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.410 
about Chuck safety I thought he just
needed<00:00:21.580> some<00:00:21.880> sleep

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
needed some sleep

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.660 
needed some sleep
well<00:00:22.900> it's<00:00:23.110> about<00:00:23.230> me<00:00:23.619> managing<00:00:24.160> Chuck<00:00:24.430> and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
well it's about me managing Chuck and

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.310 
well it's about me managing Chuck and
keeping<00:00:25.240> his<00:00:25.390> emotions<00:00:25.510> in<00:00:25.930> check<00:00:25.960> so<00:00:26.290> that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
keeping his emotions in check so that

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.950 
keeping his emotions in check so that
the<00:00:26.470> intersect<00:00:26.590> can<00:00:27.190> work<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:28.570> beginning<00:00:28.930> to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
the intersect can work I'm beginning to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.330 
the intersect can work I'm beginning to
think<00:00:29.050> I'm<00:00:29.289> more<00:00:29.440> part<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.770> the<00:00:29.830> problem<00:00:30.190> than

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
think I'm more part of the problem than

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.490 
think I'm more part of the problem than
the<00:00:30.400> solution<00:00:30.430> and<00:00:31.090> I<00:00:31.750> think<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:32.260> different

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
the solution and I think a different

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.990 
the solution and I think a different
agent<00:00:33.010> might<00:00:33.129> have<00:00:33.280> more<00:00:33.460> success<00:00:33.489> in

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
agent might have more success in

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.090 
agent might have more success in
training<00:00:34.210> him<00:00:34.510> let<00:00:35.230> me<00:00:35.350> be<00:00:35.470> clear<00:00:35.620> agent

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
training him let me be clear agent

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.630 
training him let me be clear agent
