and<00:00:18.510> when<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.720> look<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.140> tree<00:00:19.320> right<00:00:19.560> now

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
and when you look at the tree right now

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.370 
and when you look at the tree right now
you're<00:00:20.279> gonna<00:00:20.400> notice<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.050> just

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
you're gonna notice that it is just

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.290 
you're gonna notice that it is just
loaded<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.130> apples<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.029> one<00:00:24.180> little

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
loaded with apples just that one little

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.749 
loaded with apples just that one little
bit<00:00:24.449> there's<00:00:24.869> about<00:00:25.079> Oh<00:00:25.349> a<00:00:25.770> dozen<00:00:26.250> apples

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
bit there's about Oh a dozen apples

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.029 
bit there's about Oh a dozen apples
right<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.119> through<00:00:27.300> here<00:00:27.800> there's<00:00:28.800> two<00:00:29.009> over

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
right in through here there's two over

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
right in through here there's two over
here<00:00:29.340> if<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.239> apples<00:00:30.630> at<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.110> stage<00:00:31.380> are<00:00:31.590> not

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
here if the apples at this stage are not

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.700 
here if the apples at this stage are not
touching<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.150> good<00:00:33.300> idea<00:00:33.449> to<00:00:34.110> leave<00:00:34.530> them

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
touching it's a good idea to leave them

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.020 
touching it's a good idea to leave them
alone<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.190> you've<00:00:35.309> got<00:00:35.339> areas<00:00:35.879> where

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
alone but if you've got areas where

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.280 
alone but if you've got areas where
they're<00:00:36.150> gonna<00:00:36.269> all<00:00:36.480> grow<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:36.960> each<00:00:37.080> other

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
they're gonna all grow into each other

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590 
they're gonna all grow into each other
this<00:00:37.980> whole<00:00:38.220> area<00:00:38.550> should<00:00:38.580> be<00:00:38.790> thinned<00:00:39.120> out<00:00:39.269> -

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
this whole area should be thinned out -

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.640 
this whole area should be thinned out -
oh<00:00:40.220> maybe<00:00:41.220> two<00:00:41.610> or<00:00:42.030> three<00:00:42.059> apples<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
oh maybe two or three apples and if you

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.619 
oh maybe two or three apples and if you
do<00:00:43.769> it<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.339> this<00:00:44.640> stage<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.150> game<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
do it this at this stage of the game you

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.250 
do it this at this stage of the game you
can<00:00:46.199> have<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:47.040> good<00:00:47.519> crop<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.120> better<00:00:48.690> apples

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
can have a good crop of better apples

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
can have a good crop of better apples
now<00:00:49.920> look<00:00:50.100> at<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.309> area<00:00:50.699> right<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.030> it's

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
now look at this area right here it's

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.600 
now look at this area right here it's
just<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.660> many<00:00:52.469> little<00:00:52.890> apples<00:00:53.219> coming<00:00:53.430> in

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
just so many little apples coming in

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
just so many little apples coming in
there<00:00:53.840> so<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.620> done<00:00:55.680> quite<00:00:56.190> easily

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
there so this can be done quite easily

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490 
there so this can be done quite easily
with<00:00:56.699> bare<00:00:56.969> hand<00:00:57.210> pruners<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
with bare hand pruners just kind of in a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.520 
with bare hand pruners just kind of in a
minute<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.890> snip<00:00:59.160> snip<00:00:59.370> snip<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.410> if<00:01:01.410> you've

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
minute just snip snip snip and if you've

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.349 
minute just snip snip snip and if you've
got<00:01:01.769> an<00:01:01.949> apple<00:01:02.280> tree<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.579> your<00:01:02.730> property<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
got an apple tree on your property and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.410 
got an apple tree on your property and
you<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:04.289> want<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.280> get<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> best<00:01:05.940> apples

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you really want to get the best apples

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.840 
you really want to get the best apples
that<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.690> possibly<00:01:06.899> can<00:01:07.410> it's<00:01:08.190> critical<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that you possibly can it's critical that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.810 
that you possibly can it's critical that
you<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.450> at<00:01:09.690> this<00:01:09.960> stage<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.649> game

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you do this at this stage of the game

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
you do this at this stage of the game
most<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.910> my<00:01:12.000> clients<00:01:12.420> wait<00:01:12.600> until<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> apples

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
most of my clients wait until the apples

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.760 
most of my clients wait until the apples
get<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.920> oh<00:01:14.160> you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.090> maybe<00:01:15.929> an<00:01:16.380> inch<00:01:16.560> or

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
get to be oh you know maybe an inch or

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.810 
get to be oh you know maybe an inch or
two<00:01:17.100> across<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.630> at<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.750> point<00:01:19.369> it's<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
two across and at that point it's it's a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.339 
two across and at that point it's it's a
lot<00:01:21.030> harder<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.539> they're<00:01:21.840> pushing<00:01:22.200> on

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:22.349 
lot harder because they're pushing on

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:23.749 
lot harder because they're pushing on
each<00:01:22.470> other<00:01:22.679> when<00:01:22.890> they're<00:01:22.979> real<00:01:23.160> smaller<00:01:23.520> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
each other when they're real smaller so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.870 
each other when they're real smaller so
it's<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.209> easy<00:01:24.390> job<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.580> when<00:01:26.729> you're

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
it's a really easy job now when you're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's a really easy job now when you're
working<00:01:27.000> on<00:01:27.330> thinning<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> fruit<00:01:28.289> in<00:01:28.649> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
working on thinning the fruit in this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
working on thinning the fruit in this
case<00:01:28.979> apples<00:01:29.550> look<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.509> areas<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> are

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
case apples look for areas that are

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.050 
case apples look for areas that are
really<00:01:31.740> really<00:01:32.009> congested

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
really really congested

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.300 
really really congested
you've<00:01:33.720> got<00:01:33.869> four<00:01:34.319> you've<00:01:34.679> got<00:01:34.800> about<00:01:34.920> ten

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
you've got four you've got about ten

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.040 
you've got four you've got about ten
apples<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.239> little<00:01:36.450> area<00:01:36.780> right

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
apples in this one little area right

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.839 
apples in this one little area right
here<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:37.739> would<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.099> be<00:01:38.190> thinned<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.839 --> 00:01:38.849 
here this would really be thinned out to

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:41.330 
here this would really be thinned out to
this<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.479> maybe<00:01:39.929> three<00:01:40.380> same<00:01:40.830> as<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.099> area

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this two maybe three same as this area

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.479 
this two maybe three same as this area
right<00:01:41.580> here<00:01:41.940> if<00:01:42.660> you<00:01:42.780> let<00:01:42.929> them<00:01:43.080> all<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.649> then

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:44.489 
right here if you let them all go then

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.940 
right here if you let them all go then
you'll<00:01:44.640> end<00:01:44.819> up<00:01:44.940> with<00:01:45.149> ten<00:01:45.869> inferior<00:01:46.440> apples

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you'll end up with ten inferior apples

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
you'll end up with ten inferior apples
little<00:01:47.459> tiny<00:01:47.670> ones<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.149> rub<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.479> each<00:01:48.660> other

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
little tiny ones that rub on each other

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.089 
little tiny ones that rub on each other
and<00:01:49.170> bruise<00:01:49.349> each<00:01:49.590> other

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:50.099 
and bruise each other

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:52.190 
and bruise each other
a<00:01:50.130> lot<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> them<00:01:51.239> are<00:01:51.330> way<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.599> on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> ends

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
a lot of them are way out on the ends

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740 
a lot of them are way out on the ends
and<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.039> you're<00:01:53.160> doing<00:01:53.369> some<00:01:53.729> pruning<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:54.569> this

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
and if you're doing some pruning at this

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.419 
and if you're doing some pruning at this
time<00:01:54.929> of<00:01:55.020> year<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.319> can<00:01:55.530> thin<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> crop<00:01:56.220> of

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
time of year you can thin the crop of

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.639 
time of year you can thin the crop of
bits<00:01:56.670> by<00:01:57.660> cutting<00:01:58.050> back<00:01:58.229> some<00:01:58.470> of<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
bits by cutting back some of the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.770 
bits by cutting back some of the
branches<00:01:59.119> like<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.239> said<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.479> would<00:02:00.599> have<00:02:00.690> been

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
branches like I said it would have been

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.940 
branches like I said it would have been
better<00:02:00.929> to<00:02:01.020> prune<00:02:01.379> this<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.590> little<00:02:01.770> bit

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
better to prune this a little bit

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.029 
better to prune this a little bit
earlier<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.959> fruit<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.379> developing<00:02:04.920> on

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
earlier but the fruit is developing on

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.240 
earlier but the fruit is developing on
it<00:02:05.190> right<00:02:05.340> now<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:07.349> the<00:02:07.470> best<00:02:08.009> way

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it right now and you know the best way

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.919 
it right now and you know the best way
to<00:02:08.310> thin<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.450> kind<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.690> get<00:02:09.810> in

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to thin this it's just to kind of get in

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.210 
to thin this it's just to kind of get in
there<00:02:10.050> with<00:02:10.229> your<00:02:10.349> fingers<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:10.920> kind<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
there with your fingers and just kind of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
there with your fingers and just kind of
twist<00:02:11.910> off<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.599> know<00:02:12.690> all<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.989> excess<00:02:13.410> when

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
twist off you know all the excess when

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.650 
twist off you know all the excess when
we<00:02:13.770> leave<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.190> or<00:02:14.220> two<00:02:14.340> or<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.239> can<00:02:15.390> use<00:02:15.510> this

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
we leave one or two or you can use this

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110 
we leave one or two or you can use this
to<00:02:15.950> hold<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.099> whole<00:02:17.280> bunch<00:02:17.489> off<00:02:17.670> without<00:02:17.849> one

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
to hold that whole bunch off without one

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.960 
to hold that whole bunch off without one
but<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:19.379> okay<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.099> just<00:02:20.129> get<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> a

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
but that's okay you just get it to a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.790 
but that's okay you just get it to a
point<00:02:21.209> where<00:02:21.360> there's<00:02:21.599> you<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.500> branch

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
point where there's you know this branch

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440 
point where there's you know this branch
should<00:02:23.040> only<00:02:23.190> support

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
should only support

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.290 
should only support
two<00:02:25.140> or<00:02:25.319> three<00:02:25.590> apples<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.000> had<00:02:27.090> ten

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
two or three apples if you had ten

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.600 
two or three apples if you had ten
apples<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.720> would<00:02:27.810> be<00:02:27.959> bending<00:02:28.500> way<00:02:28.709> down<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
apples it would be bending way down and

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.390 
apples it would be bending way down and
possibly<00:02:30.420> breaking<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.860> lot<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.129> people

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
possibly breaking and a lot of people

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.699 
possibly breaking and a lot of people
think<00:02:32.730> more<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.180> better<00:02:33.209> on<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> fruit<00:02:34.200> tree<00:02:34.500> and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
think more is better on a fruit tree and

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.339 
think more is better on a fruit tree and
I<00:02:35.610> can't<00:02:36.540> tell<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.750> how<00:02:36.840> many<00:02:36.900> times<00:02:37.110> I've

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
I can't tell you how many times I've

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.589 
I can't tell you how many times I've
seen<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.590> tree<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:38.640> basically<00:02:39.120> commits

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
seen the tree that basically commits

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.040 
seen the tree that basically commits
suicide<00:02:39.780> from<00:02:40.440> too<00:02:40.769> much<00:02:40.950> weight<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:42.269> now<00:02:42.900> is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
suicide from too much weight so now is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.180 
suicide from too much weight so now is
the<00:02:43.200> time<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.530> get<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.769> there<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:43.980> start

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
the time to get in there and start

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.670 
the time to get in there and start
thinning<00:02:44.610> your<00:02:44.640> fruit<00:02:45.019> this<00:02:46.019> other<00:02:46.290> Apple

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
thinning your fruit this other Apple

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.860 
thinning your fruit this other Apple
over<00:02:46.800> here<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.849> that<00:02:48.090> this<00:02:48.239> is<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.450> Golden

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
over here is that this is a Golden

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.610 
over here is that this is a Golden
Delicious<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.739> one<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.099> a<00:02:50.280> Fuji<00:02:50.940> and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
Delicious and this one is a Fuji and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.050 
Delicious and this one is a Fuji and
this<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:52.799> is<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> little<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.400> slower<00:02:53.760> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
this one is a little bit slower the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.970 
this one is a little bit slower the
senator<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.750> interestingly<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.620> client

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
senator and interestingly the client

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.100 
senator and interestingly the client
told<00:02:56.099> me<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.459> last<00:02:56.910> year<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.599> one<00:02:57.870> leaf

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
told me that last year this one leaf

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.770 
told me that last year this one leaf
doubt<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.739> bloomed<00:02:59.430> first<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.599> was

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
doubt and bloomed first and this one was

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.270 
doubt and bloomed first and this one was
was<00:03:01.170> later<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.599> there's<00:03:03.599> there's<00:03:04.319> no<00:03:04.500> rules<00:03:04.799> as

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
was later so there's there's no rules as

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.170 
was later so there's there's no rules as
to<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:06.000> these<00:03:06.209> things<00:03:06.480> happen<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.349> a<00:03:08.150> lot<00:03:09.150> of

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
to when these things happen but a lot of

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.630 
to when these things happen but a lot of
a<00:03:09.690> lot<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:10.049> how<00:03:10.170> well<00:03:10.410> your<00:03:10.620> crop<00:03:10.860> turns<00:03:11.130> out<00:03:11.370> is

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
a lot of how well your crop turns out is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.850 
a lot of how well your crop turns out is
dependent<00:03:12.299> upon<00:03:12.360> what<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> do<00:03:12.989> at<00:03:13.200> this<00:03:13.530> point

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860

dependent upon what you do at this point
in<00:03:14.069> time<00:03:14.280> now<00:03:15.620> there's<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.680> disease<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.220> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
in time now there's a disease that you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.120 
in time now there's a disease that you
find<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.060> apple<00:03:18.420> trees<00:03:18.690> it's<00:03:19.470> called<00:03:19.799> fire

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
find in apple trees it's called fire

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.620 
of this there's one infected branch
right<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.579> there<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.060> want<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.329> cut<00:03:30.510> it

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
right up there and you want to cut it

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.250 
right up there and you want to cut it
beyond<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.370> blackening<00:03:32.370> there's<00:03:33.359> not<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.569> lot

beyond the blackening there's not a lot

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.629 
beyond the blackening there's not a lot
of<00:03:34.290> fire<00:03:34.590> blight<00:03:34.799> in<00:03:34.950> this<00:03:35.040> tree<00:03:35.190> but<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.489> want

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
of fire blight in this tree but you want

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.920 
of fire blight in this tree but you want
to<00:03:35.730> get<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:35.970> all<00:03:36.120> out<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.359> there<00:03:36.600> here's<00:03:36.870> a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
to get it all out of there here's a

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.930 
to get it all out of there here's a
there's<00:03:37.590> another<00:03:37.680> little<00:03:38.190> example<00:03:38.310> of<00:03:38.730> some

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
there's another little example of some

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.590 
there's another little example of some
fire<00:03:39.150> blight<00:03:39.420> so<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:40.470> takes<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:41.100> bit<00:03:41.280> of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
fire blight so that takes a bit of

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.020 
fire blight so that takes a bit of
picking<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:43.590> was<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.889> fire<00:03:44.130> blight<00:03:44.370> branch

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
picking this was a fire blight branch

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.190 
picking this was a fire blight branch
those<00:03:45.269> cut<00:03:45.480> out<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.750> can<00:03:45.870> see<00:03:45.959> where<00:03:46.079> it's

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
those cut out and you can see where it's

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.840 
those cut out and you can see where it's

there's one two three here maybe too

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:35.390 
there's one two three here maybe too
many<00:05:33.750> little<00:05:34.620> tiny<00:05:34.650> ones<00:05:35.039> that<00:05:35.159> don't<00:05:35.250> look

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
many little tiny ones that don't look

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.149 
many little tiny ones that don't look
good<00:05:35.460> just<00:05:35.789> pick<00:05:36.060> them<00:05:36.120> off<00:05:36.270> as<00:05:36.509> you<00:05:36.659> go<00:05:36.919> it's<00:05:37.919> a

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
good just pick them off as you go it's a

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.399 
good just pick them off as you go it's a
it's<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.460> bit<00:05:38.580> of<00:05:38.699> a<00:05:38.759> pain<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.150> do<00:05:39.270> this<00:05:39.449> but<00:05:39.780> the

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
it's a bit of a pain to do this but the

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.350 
it's a bit of a pain to do this but the
results<00:05:40.889> really<00:05:41.159> end<00:05:41.400> up<00:05:41.550> with<00:05:41.699> a<00:05:41.759> much<00:05:42.120> much

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
results really end up with a much much

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.140 
results really end up with a much much
better<00:05:42.659> crop<00:05:43.250> apples<00:05:44.250> are<00:05:44.400> bigger<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:45.000> have

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
better crop apples are bigger you have

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.860 
better crop apples are bigger you have
less<00:05:45.360> bruising<00:05:46.070> you<00:05:47.070> have<00:05:47.370> less<00:05:47.610> likely<00:05:48.509> put<00:05:49.349> a

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
less bruising you have less likely put a

less bruising you have less likely put a
branches<00:05:50.650> breaking<00:05:50.880> and<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:52.900> know<00:05:52.990> where<00:05:53.170> you

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
branches breaking and you know where you

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.900 
branches breaking and you know where you
got<00:05:53.500> these<00:05:53.680> it<00:05:53.860> takes<00:05:54.070> its<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.310> few<00:05:54.460> minutes<00:05:54.760> you

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
got these it takes its a few minutes you

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.150 
got these it takes its a few minutes you
can<00:05:54.940> you<00:05:55.510> can<00:05:55.630> kind<00:05:55.780> of<00:05:55.840> break<00:05:56.470> them<00:05:56.680> off<00:05:56.860> in

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
can you can kind of break them off in

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.440 
can you can kind of break them off in
one<00:05:57.460> direction<00:05:57.610> you<00:05:57.880> don't<00:05:58.030> want<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.240> pull

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 
one direction you don't want to pull

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.270 
one direction you don't want to pull
them<00:05:58.570> if<00:05:58.750> you<00:05:58.870> pull<00:05:59.110> them<00:05:59.290> like<00:05:59.830> if<00:05:59.950> you<00:06:00.040> pull

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
them if you pull them like if you pull

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.800 
them if you pull them like if you pull
this<00:06:00.400> whole<00:06:00.580> thing<00:06:00.639> down<00:06:01.120> you<00:06:01.180> break<00:06:01.630> the

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
this whole thing down you break the

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.220 
this whole thing down you break the
whole<00:06:01.990> piece<00:06:02.440> off<00:06:02.650> like<00:06:02.950> that<00:06:03.720> it<00:06:04.720> was<00:06:04.990> okay

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
whole piece off like that it was okay

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.590 
whole piece off like that it was okay
because<00:06:05.290> we<00:06:05.470> plenty<00:06:05.740> of<00:06:05.800> apples<00:06:06.130> here<00:06:06.310> but

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
because we plenty of apples here but

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.090 
because we plenty of apples here but
ideally<00:06:07.600> you<00:06:07.780> want<00:06:07.930> to<00:06:07.990> just<00:06:08.169> take<00:06:08.500> that<00:06:08.530> a

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
ideally you want to just take that a

ideally you want to just take that a
little<00:06:09.430> bit<00:06:09.580> and<00:06:09.790> just<00:06:09.820> kind<00:06:10.090> of<00:06:10.120> break<00:06:10.389> the

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
little bit and just kind of break the

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.260 
little bit and just kind of break the
apples<00:06:11.350> individually<00:06:12.070> off<00:06:12.280> before<00:06:13.060> you<00:06:13.150> can

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
apples individually off before you can

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.420 
apples individually off before you can
do<00:06:13.419> it<00:06:13.510> with<00:06:13.600> pruning<00:06:13.960> Cheers<00:06:14.350> fuses<00:06:15.100> pretty

once and leave one or two in some of
these<00:06:22.510> areas<00:06:22.960> so<00:06:23.200> it's<00:06:23.980> uh<00:06:24.780> and<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:25.900> takes

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
about an hour or so per tree to do this

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.409 
about an hour or so per tree to do this
sort<00:06:28.450> of<00:06:28.510> thing<00:06:28.890> it's<00:06:29.890> like<00:06:30.220> it's<00:06:30.850> relaxing

the<00:06:34.660> apples<00:06:35.350> to<00:06:35.530> do<00:06:35.919> develop<00:06:36.370> so<00:06:37.230> I<00:06:38.400> really

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
the apples to do develop so I really

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.170 
the apples to do develop so I really
think<00:06:39.550> you<00:06:39.669> gotta<00:06:39.790> give<00:06:39.970> it<00:06:40.000> a<00:06:40.090> try<00:06:40.360> a<00:06:42.180> necklace

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
think you gotta give it a try a necklace

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.480 
think you gotta give it a try a necklace
for<00:06:43.330> other<00:06:43.479> fruit<00:06:43.750> too<00:06:44.020> not<00:06:44.590> just<00:06:44.620> apples<00:06:45.250> a

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:45.490 
for other fruit too not just apples a

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.280 
for other fruit too not just apples a
lot<00:06:46.030> of<00:06:46.180> fruit<00:06:46.360> especially<00:06:46.479> the<00:06:46.900> really<00:06:47.140> heavy

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
lot of fruit especially the really heavy

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.320 
lot of fruit especially the really heavy
fruit<00:06:47.650> the<00:06:48.130> stone<00:06:48.370> fruit<00:06:48.610> the<00:06:48.760> peaches<00:06:49.000> of

fruit the stone fruit the peaches of
special<00:06:49.810> pages<00:06:50.080> and<00:06:50.470> nectarines<00:06:50.979> I<00:06:51.220> can't

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
special pages and nectarines I can't

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.070 
special pages and nectarines I can't
tell<00:06:52.180> you<00:06:52.270> how<00:06:52.330> many<00:06:52.389> times<00:06:52.690> I've<00:06:52.900> seen<00:06:53.020> a

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
tell you how many times I've seen a

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.170 
tell you how many times I've seen a
peach<00:06:53.320> tree<00:06:53.590> with<00:06:53.919> all<00:06:54.100> the<00:06:54.130> branches<00:06:54.640> broken

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
peach tree with all the branches broken

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.690 
peach tree with all the branches broken
because<00:06:56.050> they<00:06:56.200> just<00:06:56.350> got<00:06:56.530> so<00:06:56.979> excessively

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:57.700 
because they just got so excessively

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.300 
because they just got so excessively
heavy<00:06:57.940> a<00:06:58.320> lot<00:06:59.320> of<00:06:59.440> times<00:06:59.590> farmers<00:06:59.890> will<00:07:00.160> put

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.310 
heavy a lot of times farmers will put

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.010 
heavy a lot of times farmers will put
props<00:07:00.640> up<00:07:00.910> underneath<00:07:01.180> the<00:07:01.390> branches<00:07:01.840> so<00:07:01.990> they

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
props up underneath the branches so they

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.310 
props up underneath the branches so they
get<00:07:02.260> a<00:07:02.290> bigger<00:07:02.530> crop<00:07:02.890> but<00:07:03.490> homeowners<00:07:04.320> often

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.320 
get a bigger crop but homeowners often

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.270 
get a bigger crop but homeowners often
neglect<00:07:05.740> this<00:07:05.950> step<00:07:06.310> and<00:07:07.140> the<00:07:08.140> weight<00:07:08.350> of<00:07:08.979> a

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
neglect this step and the weight of a

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.409 
neglect this step and the weight of a
crop<00:07:09.520> can<00:07:09.820> destroy<00:07:10.479> a<00:07:10.510> tree<00:07:11.039> so<00:07:12.390> thinning<00:07:13.390> your

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
crop can destroy a tree so thinning your

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.710 
crop can destroy a tree so thinning your
fruit<00:07:13.750> very<00:07:14.229> important
