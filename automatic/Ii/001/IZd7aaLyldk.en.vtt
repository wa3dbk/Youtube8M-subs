00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Desteni cross-dimensional space connection access: Am I dead? - Moon 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.220
 Oh, this is the moon, I am here to say: I am not dead. 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.640
 And this is what I am, the ultimate 'perception' 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.000
 I am now, this is - this wonderful is out of this, the 'night and day' materialization is reversed' 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:49.150
 That is, I am waiting for the moon and 'this sun', I will say, just because of what is - 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.320
 Appear, it is also the unity of the universe, and so on. 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.610
 This sun, representing 'this day', shows performance, when it is this dusk 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.350
 When this moon is like myself, wait for this skeleton structural entity 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 It’s been always, 'the separation of the poles’ is just like humans. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
 Individuals are materialized in existence, such as individual self (itself) 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.770
 The basic reflection of a human being in itself (with) 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.480
 That is, the separation of men and women, when in the 'inside' of humans, 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.140
 This left side represents this woman, showing the application of expression 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.180
 However, this right side represents the male structural skeleton - the actual body 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 And even if you look at it, let us love in humans. 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.340
 And now, human beings themselves, if you are a woman, represent the performance of this woman. 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.740
 And this male, that is, represents the male bone structure 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:51.270
 And out of the 'men and women relationship' to the world, this is, male and female 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.100
 Male - this feminine show expressiveness is combined with this male, real body, etc. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.910
 And this is what is recognized as 'oneness' in this embodiment of 'men and women' - it should be this 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.010
 That is, when you are in the 'consciousness', you will see it as such, that is, it should not be the same. 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.380
 So it will be fun to watch in this process, it really will happen 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.760
 In existence, that is, its overall existence, when humans begin - 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.280
 In themselves, it is perceived that this male and female homology is one, remove this 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.260
 And just stand and wait like 'I am' 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.680
 When the bone is structurally oriented, the performance is shown, the combination is equal to one (body) 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.040
 When this is in every human being 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.940
 I am curious as to 'the existence' will change into what is because 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:45.450
 Existence is a right, and in this world, the basic reflections of human beings, the actual anti-display (body) 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.650
 So this is the moon 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.040
 This is my right, this present existence and the view of 'myself' 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.570
 So let us see if - 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.180
 One, if it is 'I am', it will be materialized 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.940
 Thank you very much. This is the moon. 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.200
 Oh, another point, this is interesting, this, the shape of the moon 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.620
 And this sun belongs to the planet is - 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.030
 An actual anti-express of 'O' is 'one' (English one) 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.820
 Just insight, it will be fun, when all, these little ones are combined 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.230
 Thank you very much.
