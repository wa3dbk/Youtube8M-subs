 hoya signing the contract that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.279
 it was probably very juicy for him

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.649

 ahead 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:49.820
 Well yes, as Alejandro has just said 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.820
 the fight is already done for 14 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.210
 September had been negotiating already 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.129
 for several weeks and good at last and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.379
 out is the fight everyone 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.920
 wants to see what the two fighters 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.740
 They say it is the most favorable to well 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 what ladies and gentlemen we have the mega 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.549
 fight that everyone is waiting for 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.740
 on September 14 today jaime one thing 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.210
 that I have a great enough doubt already 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.530
 had even spoken the cinnamon 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.569
 it seems that he had already accepted a fight 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.610
 previously but it was falling as they come to 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:23.990
 an agreement on this occasion 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:28.610
 the afternoon is coming because cinnamon accepted 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.640
 lower the weight taken out of 152 pounds for 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.010
 that this fight would happen 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.979
 mayweather the wii against robert warrior 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 he fought at 147 pounds which is welterweight 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.770
 this is going to be the junior middle school or 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.690
 superwelter the same thing 154 pounds the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.490
 limit but they will fight at 152 pounds 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.979
 who was jaime in the negotiation in 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.159
 how much is going to repeat distribute the bag 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.979
 and how 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.409
 for the loss that fell for the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.630
 negotiation rather said that fell 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.180
 between them two cinnamon and he had told me 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 in an interview that he had followed and 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.020
 that he had practically accepted 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.319
 all the conditions that there were 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.180
 planted the levels for this I guess 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.120
 who also had to give a little more 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:22.620
 Canelo Mayweather yes 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 cinnamon goes down 152 pounds at the beginning it 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.500
 speculated that 9 was not going to accept the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.720
 fight if it was in 147 canelo can not 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.849
 down to so much so he also had to 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.930
 give a little but in terms of money 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.459
 still have not been given any 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.750
 specifications how much it will be that 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.110
 they will win either of the two 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.780
 last 9 won 32 million in the last 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.519
 fight against theft and warrior imagine 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.739
 for this is going to be much more and for the 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.450
 cinnamon is also going to be the most 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.739
 great that he has had in his career such 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.319
 Once the biggest challenge most important 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.269
 you have, we are talking about 152 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.700
 pounds it seems that Jaime has more 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.770
 comfortable then to cinnamon as you see who 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.740
 It has the advantage of this weight 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:08.070
 and now I have to make it difficult for 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.920
 canelo because canelo is a man who is 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.930
 quite big pretty strong and although 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.120
 He has been fighting not for long 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.160
 at 154 pounds his body could give 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.980
 for more when he gets in the ring 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.990
 it's about 170 pounds, so that's how 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.510
 Once that is also necessary to see how much is 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.520
 that the contract says it can go up 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.410
 fight after rehydrating after 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.690
 of the weighing if I think that maybe you 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.850
 favors a little more to me and webber 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.210
 because he is so much more that we do 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.280
 about 150 pounds but wants to stay 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.430
 quick to counteract the strength of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.630
 canelo jaime motta to say goodbye 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.130
 we know that much is missing but who 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.310
 will appear as a favorite in bets 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.819
 I'm curious 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.620
 but I think that to begin with it's going to 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.450
 make the favorite in bets me 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.230
 I dare to say that even up to 3 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.140
 for 1 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.069
 to start bets what yes I 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.680
 said cinnamon is that the promotional tour 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.069
 begins on June 23 in new york 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.349
 will be eleven cities will end in the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.330
 angels and of course between them is already 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:17.160
 also working on one of those 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.140
 stops will be the city of mexico 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.700
 well there is all the information jaime 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.460
 motta a hug to the angels and 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.590
 thank you very much for this report 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.590
