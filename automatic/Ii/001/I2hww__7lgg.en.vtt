00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hi, people. I'm going to show you today. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.740
 some care that it is important that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.260
 you have with your feet 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.980
 it is he who takes us everywhere 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.199
 every day it helps people to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.910
 maintain our routine that is often 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.250
 super run 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 so it 's important that you 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.320
 take special care of them and I 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.359
 I do not have a step by step step 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.239
 fast and let's go step by step 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.700
 I use this avon scrub is from 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.700
 red fruits and it is an exfoliant 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 which is not extremely brazil 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 so it's important that you do not use this 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.840
 It was before it was too thick and rubbish 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.510
 also sometimes the person sees the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 heel so peeling and I think 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.449
 She has to let it go to release. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.420
 that skin and in fact that skin is 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.770
 a defense of a helton defense 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.910
 skin 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.820
 is this curiosity these skins in 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.480
 they are called hyper 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.330
 keratinization then if your skin becomes 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.050
 feel it has increased production 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:24.090
 of keratin that is irresponsible by 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.000
 protect our skin and release 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.030
 keratin makes your skin more 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.460
 thicker piece then use an exfoliant 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 thinner and make circular movements 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.350
 or the entire length of your foot next 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.070
 step we're going to use the oil is 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.220
 flavoring and a salt-type shower 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.320
 for me to do ours 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.290
 it's to the feet 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.300
 then this is it is a bowl with water 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.080
 with aromas with a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.540
 It leaves relaxing then it can be 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.180
 if you do not have the same site boy you 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.580
 can use the thick heel he has 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.690
 same function as the bank site is 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.330
 energizing 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.940
 this step is very important that you 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.340
 Make it fresh and that 's too much. 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.370
 It's nice to be careful with your 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.540
 feet to put it in a basin with water 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.500
 warm and put these products to 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.660
 relax and this will also cause 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.450
 after you have cooled, rinse the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.120
 your foot and you put it so a 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.870
 bowl with water makes you feel 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.930
 what 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.870
 that it is lighter even in the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.180
 parts that have more callosity all 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.610
 tends to give a relaxed 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.080
 so you make him spread his feet 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:03.310
 so it's only a matter of 30 minutes 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.980
 relaxing and the next step I'll use 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:11.500
 a moisturizer for the chestnut feet of the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.420
 natura and green clay and water clay 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.430
 green clay 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:21.100
 she is very important in this process is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.730
 treatment with the 10 for people who 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.740
 have a super sweating in the feet you 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.720
 that has the staff problem quite 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.230
 so not only helps to moisturize your foot 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.420
 like clay she makes a control like that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.270
 of the sweat of your feet 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.310
 So it's simple, you just have to get one. 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.060
 reasonable amount you see that goes 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.770
 give your two feet put 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.700
 moisturizer a little water and 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.550
 mix 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.150
 so I'll use the plastic film to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.370
 do not do much dirt a lot of mess and 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.220
 but we'll stay for a while 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.370
 with one with clay in the foot 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.280
 It's important that you put the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.280
 plastic to get you to walk is from 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.560
 races you have with the products in 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.519
 your foot is wearing the clay mask 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.819
 no century 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.609
 so just go 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:21.190
 is a treatment of the 10 is not only in the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.470
 tetanus plant is only in the sole you have 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.470
 to do on the dorsum of the foot as well 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.710
 but there are in all the extension of the feet 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:43.950
 and now it's time to roll with Basque 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.230
 movie do not need to press it 's just you 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.410
 and even roll that plastic it already is 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:53.820
 Fear that is already sticking but does not need 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:56.010
 type just too tightly wrapping same , and 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.440
 then do the same process with the other foot 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.950
 or adjust the plastic 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.420
 product then so people clay it 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.200
 There are countless good functions for you. 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.570
 skin 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.820
 then it is an inexpensive product that gives 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.060
 you enjoy in all areas 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:19.880
 your body is for the stain to hold 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:22.530

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.330
 with running water 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.760
 in this next step I will use a 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.190
 moisturizer that is on the same line as the 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.820
 exfoliates a moisturizer from the grandmother where 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:50.310
