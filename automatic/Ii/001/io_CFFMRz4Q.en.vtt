00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.049
 this is the most accurate copy of the crop 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.110
 bolton circles of August 15, 2002 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.619
 this critic has a message and he does not 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.379
 had discovered so far and if the 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.760
 I want to show message of 2002 says 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.040
 Beware the bearers of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.530
 states present for broken tables the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.360
 message of 1937 says careful because there 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.370
 many false prophets and guides that 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.560
 they operate in your world 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.770
 the 2002 message says a lot about lopera 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.450
 a time the 1977 says we come to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 warn them of the fate of their planet 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.830
 so that they communicate it to their 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.080
 similar and this the ufologists do not 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:46.090
 they are doing they are not going to do it either 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.820
 they are looking for the best take on the 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.800
 best picture nothing more 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.420
 well we continue the path that must 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.220
 take to avoid the disaster that 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 threat to your planet and the inhabitants of 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.960
 our planets that surround them 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.920
 the good king this word comes in there not 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.340
 it can be decoded and I think the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.440
 folios prevented you from learning that 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.560
 existed so that you could decode 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.860
 the one still does not know what is there and there 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.860
 is 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.860
 the good is out there 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.390
 says the 1977 message is free to 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.220
 accept to reject our teachings 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.229
 but only those who can live in peace 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.899
 and goodwill will go to levels 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.150
 superiors of spiritual evolution 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.000
 Sirs 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.000
 not the bible are teachings 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.210
 they left us teachings to see 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.979
 reason somebody and I are saying that 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.780
 only if we follow his teachings we 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.820
 we oppose the deceptions they 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.119
 will select your energy energy that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.159
 they call money giving them garbage in return 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.549
 your inner divinity will protect you from 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.549
 this 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.330
 we will work with this who could be 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.460
 the only divinity that could be in 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.790
 this moment on earth 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.750
 divinity that can be right now in the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.120

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.980

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.190
 found on earth and that all the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.470
 world has ignored what has been passed 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.380
 they believe that it is a false prophet they believe that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.830
 is a false christ and there is always what 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.990

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.880

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.070

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.290
 great loneliness feeling of happiness at
