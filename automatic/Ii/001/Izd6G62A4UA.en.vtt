00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
to do paddleboarding and I thought it

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.280 
to do paddleboarding and I thought it
was<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.459> great<00:02:21.299> way<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.540> me<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:21.959> hopefully

up<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.379> level<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.769> it<00:02:26.280> hadn't<00:02:27.060> been<00:02:27.090> before

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
up to a level that it hadn't been before

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.860 
up to a level that it hadn't been before
in<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:28.109> in<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.799> way<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.549> much<00:02:29.940> more<00:02:29.970> fun<00:02:30.390> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
