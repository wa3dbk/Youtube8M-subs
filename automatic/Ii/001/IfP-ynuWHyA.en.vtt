hey<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.220> hellacious<00:00:02.689> made<00:00:03.689> like<00:00:04.020> you

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
hey this is hellacious made like you

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.550 
hey this is hellacious made like you
know<00:00:04.890> an<00:00:05.100> 11<00:00:05.580> minute<00:00:05.759> long<00:00:06.150> video<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:07.319> me

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
know an 11 minute long video about me

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.440 
know an 11 minute long video about me
doing<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:08.040> subtlety<00:00:08.400> rotation<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.300> these

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
doing a subtlety rotation on these

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.259 
doing a subtlety rotation on these
target<00:00:10.019> dummies<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.160> then<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.550> realized<00:00:12.000> that

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
target dummies and then I realized that

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.600 
target dummies and then I realized that
my<00:00:12.450> mic<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:12.990> turned<00:00:13.259> off<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.250> didn't<00:00:14.490> get

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
my mic was turned off so you didn't get

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.390 
my mic was turned off so you didn't get
any<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.940> my<00:00:15.059> like<00:00:15.509> commentary<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.619> because<00:00:17.369> i

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
any of my like commentary and because i

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.840 
any of my like commentary and because i
like<00:00:17.699> hearing<00:00:18.029> myself<00:00:18.300> speak<00:00:19.490> that's<00:00:20.490> just

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
like hearing myself speak that's just

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.019 
like hearing myself speak that's just
unacceptable<00:00:21.740> so<00:00:22.740> here's<00:00:23.640> what's<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
unacceptable so here's what's going to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.370 
unacceptable so here's what's going to
happen<00:00:24.420> i'm<00:00:24.510> going<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.689> make<00:00:24.810> another<00:00:25.080> video

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
happen i'm going to make another video

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.730 
happen i'm going to make another video
somebody<00:00:25.949> asks<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> official<00:00:26.939> forums

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
somebody asks on the official forums

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
somebody asks on the official forums
what<00:00:28.740> um<00:00:31.070> basically<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.759> someone<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.660> make<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
what um basically if someone can make a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.250 
what um basically if someone can make a
video<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:35.300> hopefully<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:36.989> give

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
video that hopefully would you know give

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.920 
video that hopefully would you know give
insight<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.100> why<00:00:38.550> combat<00:00:39.030> feels<00:00:39.239> smoother

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
insight as to why combat feels smoother

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.340 
insight as to why combat feels smoother
I<00:00:41.090> honestly<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.140> much<00:00:43.290> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
I honestly I don't really get much of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.760 
I honestly I don't really get much of
that<00:00:43.620> may<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.219> subtlety<00:00:44.789> just

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
that may be because subtlety just

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.340 
that may be because subtlety just
doesn't<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:46.920> just<00:00:47.610> stubborn<00:00:48.030> like<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:49.020> there's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
doesn't is just stubborn like if there's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.770 
doesn't is just stubborn like if there's
one<00:00:49.559> speck<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.000> most<00:00:51.180> stubborn<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
one speck that's the most stubborn of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.240 
one speck that's the most stubborn of
all<00:00:51.930> rogue<00:00:52.170> expects<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.680> definitely

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
all rogue expects it's definitely

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.490 
all rogue expects it's definitely
subtlety<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.199> i'm<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> be

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
subtlety like you know i'm going to be

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.590 
subtlety like you know i'm going to be
having<00:00:55.649> positional<00:00:56.280> requirements<00:00:57.000> dynamic

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
having positional requirements dynamic

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
having positional requirements dynamic
so<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> anyway<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.809> maybe<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.050> guys<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.440> see

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
so so anyway but maybe you guys can see

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
so so anyway but maybe you guys can see
the<00:01:01.710> smoothness<00:01:01.980> i'm<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.390> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the smoothness i'm just going to do a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
the smoothness i'm just going to do a
quick<00:01:03.719> test<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.700> using<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> training

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
quick test right here using the training

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.679 
quick test right here using the training
dummies<00:01:06.540> talk<00:01:06.900> about<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:08.060> relative<00:01:09.060> rotation

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
dummies talk about the relative rotation

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.219 
dummies talk about the relative rotation
a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:10.020> bit<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.740> currently<00:01:11.010> stands<00:01:11.460> and

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
a little bit as it currently stands and

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
a little bit as it currently stands and
i<00:01:13.229> hope<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.280> enjoy<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:15.060> else<00:01:15.299> figure<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
i hope you enjoy or else figure that you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
i hope you enjoy or else figure that you
figure<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.680> don't<00:01:16.890> enjoy<00:01:17.220> quickly

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
figure out that you don't enjoy quickly

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
figure out that you don't enjoy quickly
and<00:01:17.970> stop<00:01:18.420> watching<00:01:18.710> seriously<00:01:21.950> quick<00:01:22.950> point

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
and stop watching seriously quick point

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.460 
and stop watching seriously quick point
right<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.479> Alpha<00:01:25.140> hemorrhage<00:01:26.330> deals<00:01:27.470> more

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
right now on Alpha hemorrhage deals more

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.840 
right now on Alpha hemorrhage deals more
damage<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:29.280> backstab<00:01:30.829> if<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:32.460> include<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
damage than backstab if you include the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.570 
damage than backstab if you include the
bleed

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
bleed

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.510 
bleed
with<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:35.330> in<00:01:35.450> mind<00:01:35.980> I'm<00:01:36.980> not<00:01:37.250> going<00:01:37.400> to<00:01:37.460> be

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
with that in mind I'm not going to be

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.100 
with that in mind I'm not going to be
using<00:01:37.640> hemorrhaging<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.180> be<00:01:38.390> using<00:01:38.570> backstab

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
using hemorrhaging and be using backstab

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.830 
using hemorrhaging and be using backstab
that's<00:01:40.040> just<00:01:40.220> because<00:01:40.370> it<00:01:40.910> is<00:01:41.240> still<00:01:41.720> the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
that's just because it is still the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.200 
that's just because it is still the
optimal<00:01:42.230> rotation<00:01:42.980> or<00:01:43.340> its<00:01:43.490> intended<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.120> be

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
optimal rotation or its intended to be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.940 
optimal rotation or its intended to be
the<00:01:44.300> optimal<00:01:44.630> rotation<00:01:44.990> use<00:01:45.110> backstab<00:01:45.590> and

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
the optimal rotation use backstab and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.270 
the optimal rotation use backstab and
I'm<00:01:46.850> more<00:01:47.180> testing<00:01:47.660> and<00:01:47.870> showing<00:01:48.170> how<00:01:48.440> really

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
I'm more testing and showing how really

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.370 
I'm more testing and showing how really
how<00:01:49.460> easy<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:50.120> is<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.270> play<00:01:50.540> subtlety<00:01:51.050> right

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
how easy it is to play subtlety right

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.200 
how easy it is to play subtlety right
now<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.980> am<00:01:52.790> in<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.390> item<00:01:53.840> level<00:01:55.240> 5<00:01:56.240> 16<00:01:57.110> gear<00:01:57.500> I

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
now I am in this item level 5 16 gear I

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.320 
now I am in this item level 5 16 gear I
am<00:01:59.210> level<00:01:59.510> 92<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.250> slightly<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.180> my

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
am level 92 so that is slightly so my

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.990 
am level 92 so that is slightly so my
rotations<00:02:02.900> going<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.170> slightly<00:02:03.440> slower<00:02:04.000> or

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
rotations going to be slightly slower or

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.920 
rotations going to be slightly slower or
at<00:02:05.060> least<00:02:05.210> my<00:02:05.300> haste<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:05.690> going<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:05.870> be

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
at least my haste is going to be

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.430 
at least my haste is going to be
slightly<00:02:06.110> slower<00:02:06.560> then<00:02:07.300> what<00:02:08.300> 516<00:02:08.990> gear<00:02:09.290> would

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
slightly slower then what 516 gear would

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.820 
slightly slower then what 516 gear would
be<00:02:09.679> for<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.250> level<00:02:10.520> 90<00:02:10.850> online<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.050> that's<00:02:13.420> yeah

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
be for a level 90 online so that's yeah

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.199 
be for a level 90 online so that's yeah
14.2<00:02:15.830> 2%<00:02:16.310> haste<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:19.220> one<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.730> half<00:02:19.760> extra

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
14.2 2% haste so one and a half extra

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.790 
14.2 2% haste so one and a half extra
energy<00:02:20.330> per<00:02:20.600> second<00:02:20.959> not<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.040> much<00:02:23.500> let's<00:02:24.500> go

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
energy per second not that much let's go

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.430 
energy per second not that much let's go
start<00:02:25.370> off<00:02:25.490> with<00:02:25.700> pre-med<00:02:26.390> and<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.990> machine<00:02:27.290> is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
start off with pre-med and a machine is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.930 
start off with pre-med and a machine is
open<00:02:27.800> with<00:02:27.890> Garrett<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.370> don't<00:02:28.610> know<00:02:28.670> which<00:02:28.760> is

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
open with Garrett I don't know which is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.990 
open with Garrett I don't know which is
optimal<00:02:29.390> but<00:02:29.890> whatever

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000

using<00:02:41.319> solder<00:02:41.950> futures<00:02:42.459> is<00:02:42.580> why<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> am<00:02:42.879> bushed

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
using solder futures is why I am bushed

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.339 
using solder futures is why I am bushed
immediately<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> I'm<00:02:46.450> just<00:02:46.599> gonna<00:02:46.720> get<00:02:47.230> my

alright so the main thing i noticed
phone<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.790> at<00:03:06.939> executing<00:03:07.599> this<00:03:07.720> rotation<00:03:08.319> is

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
phone do at executing this rotation is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.530 
phone do at executing this rotation is
that<00:03:08.739> I<00:03:08.980> can<00:03:09.189> refresh<00:03:09.459> rupture<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.150> slice<00:03:10.329> and

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that I can refresh rupture and slice and

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.619 
that I can refresh rupture and slice and
dice<00:03:10.739> incredibly<00:03:11.739> early<00:03:11.950> right<00:03:12.370> now<00:03:12.629> that's

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
dice incredibly early right now that's

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.330 
dice incredibly early right now that's
because<00:03:13.870> they<00:03:13.989> did<00:03:14.140> something<00:03:14.439> with<00:03:14.920> JT<00:03:15.129> where

because they did something with JT where

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.920 
because they did something with JT where
they<00:03:15.459> like<00:03:15.640> copy<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:16.090> over<00:03:16.150> some<00:03:16.540> warlock

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
they like copy it over some warlock

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.059 
they like copy it over some warlock
ability<00:03:17.409> so<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:19.390> right<00:03:19.569> now<00:03:19.769> Webster's<00:03:20.769> at

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
ability so like right now Webster's at

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.330 
ability so like right now Webster's at
about<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> quarter<00:03:21.489> left<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:22.150> can<00:03:22.629> refresh<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
about a quarter left I can refresh it it

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.670 
about a quarter left I can refresh it it
goes<00:03:24.549> up<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.790> 26<00:03:25.209> seconds<00:03:25.599> now<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.440> time<00:03:26.650> to

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
goes up to 26 seconds now I have time to

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.289 
goes up to 26 seconds now I have time to
refresh<00:03:27.010> slice<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.549> dice<00:03:27.640> too<00:03:27.879> well<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.609> I<00:03:30.970> can

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
refresh slice and dice too well so I can

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.940 
refresh slice and dice too well so I can
refresh<00:03:31.540> slice<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:31.959> dice<00:03:32.049> where<00:03:32.200> it's<00:03:32.319> at<00:03:32.409> 13

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
refresh slice and dice where it's at 13

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.059 
refresh slice and dice where it's at 13
seconds<00:03:33.489> left<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.780> will<00:03:34.959> get<00:03:35.079> all<00:03:35.319> those<00:03:35.650> 13

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
seconds left and I will get all those 13

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.509 
seconds left and I will get all those 13
seconds<00:03:36.519> added<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> end<00:03:37.359> so<00:03:37.629> I<00:03:37.659> could<00:03:37.900> have

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
seconds added to the end so I could have

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.330 
seconds added to the end so I could have
like<00:03:39.519> of<00:03:39.989> almost<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.200> 50-second<00:03:41.950> slice<00:03:42.129> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
like of almost a 50-second slice and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.780 
like of almost a 50-second slice and
dice<00:03:42.489> that's<00:03:43.420> really<00:03:43.810> useful<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:45.340> see<00:03:45.670> what<00:03:45.760> I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
dice that's really useful you see what I

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.280 
dice that's really useful you see what I
do<00:03:45.909> with<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.180> rupture<00:03:46.629> again<00:03:46.720> it's<00:03:47.049> just

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
do with the rupture again it's just

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.629 
do with the rupture again it's just
thirty<00:03:47.620> percent<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:49.450> magic<00:03:49.599> number

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
thirty percent this is the magic number

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.550 
thirty percent this is the magic number
so<00:03:51.639> that's<00:03:51.909> really<00:03:52.120> useful<00:03:52.420> because<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.530> I

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
so that's really useful because then I

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.259 
so that's really useful because then I
can<00:03:53.680> do<00:03:53.829> things<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.129> slight<00:03:54.430> refresh<00:03:54.940> listen

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
can do things like slight refresh listen

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.910 
can do things like slight refresh listen
guys<00:03:55.359> really<00:03:55.750> early<00:03:56.109> and<00:03:56.139> going<00:03:56.409> to<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.650> dance

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
guys really early and going to a dance

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.460 
guys really early and going to a dance
which<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.519> what<00:03:57.670> i<00:03:57.700> just<00:03:57.790> did<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:58.659> then<00:03:59.170> yeah

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
which is what i just did and then yeah

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.440 
which is what i just did and then yeah
i'm<00:03:59.859> going<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.250> need<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.459> refresh<00:04:00.879> rupture

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
i'm going to need to refresh rupture

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.220 
i'm going to need to refresh rupture
during<00:04:02.019> find<00:04:02.409> weakness<00:04:03.359> but<00:04:04.359> that's<00:04:04.959> a<00:04:05.049> lot

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
during find weakness but that's a lot

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.199 
during find weakness but that's a lot
better<00:04:05.590> than<00:04:05.889> rupture<00:04:06.280> and<00:04:06.489> slice<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.030> dice

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
better than rupture and slice and dice

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.170 
better than rupture and slice and dice
so<00:04:07.690> i'll<00:04:07.780> get<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.109> open<00:04:08.230> quickly<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.970> keep

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
so i'll get that open quickly and keep

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.930 
so i'll get that open quickly and keep
going<00:04:10.389> and<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.889> live<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.370> might<00:04:12.549> even<00:04:12.760> be

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
going and on live it might even be

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.990 
going and on live it might even be
better<00:04:13.329> I<00:04:13.750> wonder<00:04:14.139> if<00:04:14.410> or<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.340> know<00:04:15.790> when<00:04:15.910> they

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
better I wonder if or you know when they

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.250 
better I wonder if or you know when they
hash<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.419> out<00:04:16.510> a<00:04:16.570> little<00:04:16.690> bit<00:04:16.780> more<00:04:16.959> it<00:04:17.109> might

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
hash it out a little bit more it might

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
hash it out a little bit more it might
even<00:04:17.349> be<00:04:17.500> better<00:04:17.859> to<00:04:18.190> use<00:04:19.060> hemorrhage<00:04:19.690> and

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
even be better to use hemorrhage and

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.500 
even be better to use hemorrhage and
then<00:04:21.280> select<00:04:22.150> a<00:04:22.330> to<00:04:22.389> extend<00:04:23.020> that<00:04:24.510> sanguinary

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
then select a to extend that sanguinary

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.589 
then select a to extend that sanguinary
vein<00:04:25.870> opening<00:04:26.380> just<00:04:26.590> a<00:04:26.680> little<00:04:27.070> bit<00:04:27.250> longer<00:04:27.599> so

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
vein opening just a little bit longer so

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.770 
vein opening just a little bit longer so
that<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:29.110> can<00:04:29.169> get<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.889> know<00:04:30.210> eviscerate<00:04:31.210> in

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
that I can get you know eviscerate in

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.010 
that I can get you know eviscerate in
the<00:04:32.080> fine<00:04:32.320> weakness<00:04:32.860> window<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.639> then<00:04:34.300> you

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
the fine weakness window and then you

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.080 
the fine weakness window and then you
know<00:04:35.110> rupture<00:04:35.590> fades<00:04:35.949> but<00:04:36.580> it's<00:04:36.760> okay<00:04:37.060> because

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
know rupture fades but it's okay because

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.689 
know rupture fades but it's okay because
I<00:04:37.300> have<00:04:37.419> a<00:04:37.479> hammer<00:04:37.720> age<00:04:37.990> that's<00:04:38.610> giving<00:04:39.610> me

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
I have a hammer age that's giving me

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.339 
I have a hammer age that's giving me
that<00:04:39.820> twenty<00:04:40.120> percent<00:04:40.389> damage<00:04:40.599> buff<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.260> a

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
that twenty percent damage buff just a

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.200 
that twenty percent damage buff just a
little<00:04:41.530> bit<00:04:41.620> longer<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:42.580> all<00:04:42.760> depends<00:04:43.090> on

both<00:05:15.370> so<00:05:16.330> early<00:05:16.930> so<00:05:17.890> that's<00:05:18.070> pretty

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
both so early so that's pretty

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.040 
both so early so that's pretty
significant<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.360> that's<00:05:19.570> going<00:05:19.750> to<00:05:19.870> change

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
significant and that's going to change

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.210 
significant and that's going to change

that I'm not enough party right now so

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.090 
that I'm not enough party right now so
the<00:05:28.750> fact<00:05:28.990> that<00:05:29.110> I'm<00:05:29.290> not<00:05:29.410> enough<00:05:29.590> party<00:05:29.980> it

the fact that I'm not enough party it

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.730 
the fact that I'm not enough party it
means<00:05:30.250> that<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.730> in<00:05:31.000> actuality<00:05:31.530> somebody<00:05:32.530> is

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
means that in in actuality somebody is

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:44.610 
means that in in actuality somebody is
going<00:05:32.920> to<00:05:33.040> be<00:05:33.160> even<00:05:33.490> easier<00:05:33.970> than<00:05:34.300> this<00:05:43.620> which

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
going to be even easier than this which

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620 
going to be even easier than this which
ones<00:05:44.800> are<00:05:44.920> actually<00:05:45.010> wonder<00:05:45.580> if<00:05:45.730> people<00:05:46.390> are

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
ones are actually wonder if people are

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.290 
ones are actually wonder if people are
gonna<00:05:46.720> be<00:05:46.840> using<00:05:47.430> by<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.490> way<00:05:48.700> front<00:05:49.090> stab

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
about here

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.040 
about here
over<00:06:00.880> here<00:06:01.120> i<00:06:01.150> don't<00:06:01.330> think<00:06:01.510> i<00:06:01.600> can<00:06:01.660> use<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.080> no

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
over here i don't think i can use it no

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.530 
over here i don't think i can use it no
there<00:06:05.050> that's<00:06:05.560> it

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
there that's it

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.580 
there that's it
anyway<00:06:08.350> that's<00:06:09.210> really<00:06:10.210> all<00:06:10.600> there<00:06:10.660> is<00:06:11.200> to<00:06:11.560> say

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
anyway that's really all there is to say

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.470 
anyway that's really all there is to say
but<00:06:12.310> yeah<00:06:12.430> I<00:06:12.460> do<00:06:12.610> wonder<00:06:12.940> if<00:06:13.090> people<00:06:13.210> aren't

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 
but yeah I do wonder if people aren't

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.850 
but yeah I do wonder if people aren't
going<00:06:13.660> to<00:06:13.720> be<00:06:13.840> using<00:06:13.960> metric<00:06:14.410> just<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.680> little

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
going to be using metric just a little

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.130 
going to be using metric just a little
bit<00:06:14.950> more<00:06:15.100> just<00:06:15.370> because<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:16.300> this<00:06:16.480> change<00:06:16.540> and

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
bit more just because of this change and

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.810 
bit more just because of this change and
how<00:06:17.260> much<00:06:17.410> easier<00:06:18.040> it's<00:06:18.160> going<00:06:18.310> to<00:06:18.430> be<00:06:18.550> and

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
how much easier it's going to be and

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.330 
how much easier it's going to be and
might<00:06:20.130> yeah<00:06:22.500> we'll<00:06:23.500> say<00:06:23.620> it'll<00:06:24.160> probably

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
might yeah we'll say it'll probably

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.790 
might yeah we'll say it'll probably
depend<00:06:24.640> on<00:06:24.730> that<00:06:24.820> encounter<00:06:25.030> a<00:06:25.270> bit

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
depend on that encounter a bit

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.630 
depend on that encounter a bit
definitely<00:06:26.800> though<00:06:26.920> if<00:06:27.040> you<00:06:27.130> can<00:06:27.310> use<00:06:27.490> the

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
definitely though if you can use the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.890 
definitely though if you can use the
combo<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.560> cooldown<00:06:29.560> resetting<00:06:30.130> property

and<00:06:31.900> already<00:06:32.320> on<00:06:32.620> live<00:06:32.860> they're<00:06:33.220> pretty<00:06:33.490> close

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
and already on live they're pretty close

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.390 
and already on live they're pretty close
to<00:06:33.790> even<00:06:34.330> and<00:06:35.200> without<00:06:35.380> shadow<00:06:35.800> plays<00:06:36.070> to<00:06:36.250> get

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
extra combo points the only time you're

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.530 
extra combo points the only time you're
going<00:06:38.830> to<00:06:38.890> be<00:06:38.950> wasting<00:06:39.400> it<00:06:39.520> is<00:06:39.820> in<00:06:40.150> shadow
