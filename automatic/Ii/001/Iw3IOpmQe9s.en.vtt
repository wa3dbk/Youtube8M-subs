 normal rotation completing at least 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.810
 two full turns to allow the

 engine at top dead center for 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.610
 the ignition cylinder number one and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.560
 check that the location of all the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.790
 adjustment marks suit the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.010
 indications from the manufacturer's manual 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.770
 now adjusts the security lock of the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.780
 Tensioner with the recommended torque 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.490
 replace the cover of the

 front give you the necessary tension 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.679
 to the correct torque and placed back 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.659
 the auxiliary transmission belts 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.479
 to move the auxiliary equipment according 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.220
 to the specifications of the vehicle put 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.390
 Start the engine and check that
