00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.529 
into place make sure that this portion
is<00:01:53.380> in<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.740> same<00:01:54.610> position<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.179> it<00:01:55.390> was

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
is in the same position that it was

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.990 
is in the same position that it was
before<00:01:55.780> not<00:01:56.229> upside-down<00:01:56.619> because<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:57.789> easy

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
before not upside-down because it's easy

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.290 
before not upside-down because it's easy
to<00:01:58.119> twist<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.080> around<00:01:59.580> this<00:02:00.580> parts<00:02:00.910> don't<00:02:01.090> come

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
to twist it around this parts don't come

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.790 
to twist it around this parts don't come
out<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:01.750> have<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.110> kind<00:02:02.500> of<00:02:02.590> work<00:02:02.740> around

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
out so you have to kind of work around

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.230 
out so you have to kind of work around
and<00:02:03.280> clean<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:03.819> way

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and clean it that way

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.900 
and clean it that way
so<00:02:04.840> once<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.259> bolts<00:02:05.560> are<00:02:05.649> all<00:02:05.800> put<00:02:06.009> placed<00:02:06.700> in

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
so once the bolts are all put placed in

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.740 
so once the bolts are all put placed in
there<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.750> put<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.140> back<00:02:08.259> on<00:02:08.470> the<00:02:08.560> shaft<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
there and put it back on the shaft and

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.540 
there and put it back on the shaft and

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
get the snap ring engaged once that is

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.880 
get the snap ring engaged once that is
engaged<00:02:16.120> I'm<00:02:16.810> not<00:02:16.990> going<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.230> do<00:02:17.349> that<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:17.740> you

engaged I'm not going to do that but you
get<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> idea<00:02:18.390> yeah<00:02:19.390> kind<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.810> have<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.080> hammer

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
get the idea yeah kind of have to hammer

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.790 
get the idea yeah kind of have to hammer
this<00:02:20.590> way<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.220> get<00:02:21.580> their<00:02:22.080> snap<00:02:23.080> ring<00:02:23.319> back<00:02:23.560> on

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
this way to get their snap ring back on

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.660 
this way to get their snap ring back on
and<00:02:24.370> it's<00:02:24.700> when<00:02:25.360> it's<00:02:25.540> old<00:02:25.750> firm<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.520> can

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
and it's when it's old firm then you can

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.370 
and it's when it's old firm then you can
pack<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.090> grease<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.780> pack<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.140> grease

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
pack the grease if you pack the grease

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.930 
pack the grease if you pack the grease
first<00:02:29.770> then<00:02:30.069> it's<00:02:30.250> going<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.459> be<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> little<00:02:30.790> bit

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
first then it's going to be a little bit

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.520 
first then it's going to be a little bit
difficult<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.480> put<00:02:31.900> this<00:02:32.080> back<00:02:32.319> together<00:02:32.940> so

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
difficult to put this back together so

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.000 
difficult to put this back together so
don't<00:02:35.530> forget<00:02:35.739> to<00:02:35.950> put<00:02:36.250> there

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.589
