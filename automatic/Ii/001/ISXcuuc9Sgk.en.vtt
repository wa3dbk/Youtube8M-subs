00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.210 

and<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.440> next<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.770> I'm<00:02:16.860> going<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.069> show<00:02:17.190> you

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
is pretty tricky I'm gonna have to admit

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.520 
is pretty tricky I'm gonna have to admit
I<00:02:19.830> sort<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.880> stole<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.360> idea<00:02:21.540> from<00:02:21.720> Tom<00:02:22.200> Quayle

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
I sort of stole the idea from Tom Quayle

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
I sort of stole the idea from Tom Quayle
and<00:02:23.000> it's<00:02:24.000> his<00:02:24.870> type<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.350> lick<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.400> can

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and it's his type of lick but you can

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.490 
and it's his type of lick but you can
definitely<00:02:27.000> use<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.420> is<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> store<00:02:28.380> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
definitely use it is in the store you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.080 
definitely use it is in the store you
got<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.800> go<00:02:28.920> back<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.370> that's<00:02:29.640> where<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.819> got<00:02:29.970> the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
got to go back so that's where I got the

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.640 
got to go back so that's where I got the
idea<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.690> had<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.020> credit<00:02:31.350> them<00:02:31.440> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
idea from I just had to credit them and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:41.840 
idea from I just had to credit them and
so<00:02:32.640> here<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:32.880> go<00:02:33.000> lick<00:02:33.420> number<00:02:33.569> three<00:02:40.850> here's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
so here we go lick number three here's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:03:03.620 
so here we go lick number three here's
the<00:02:42.000> third<00:02:42.209> leg<00:02:42.450> slowdown<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.540> is

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
the third leg slowdown and here it is

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:31.650 
the third leg slowdown and here it is
again<00:03:03.900> slower

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.970 

so<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.810> last<00:03:32.990> one<00:03:33.110> is<00:03:33.320> an<00:03:33.470> ascending

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
so this last one is an ascending

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.590 
so this last one is an ascending
arpeggiated<00:03:34.670> part<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.090> i<00:03:35.120> came<00:03:35.300> up<00:03:35.330> with<00:03:35.480> a

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
arpeggiated part that i came up with a

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.970 
arpeggiated part that i came up with a
few<00:03:35.810> months<00:03:36.050> ago<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.470> it's<00:03:36.710> definitely
