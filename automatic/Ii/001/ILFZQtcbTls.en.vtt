00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.350
 the criminal judge of 2nd shift the doctor 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.880
 pedro salazar took here to the place of the 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.639
 facts is working together with police 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.530
 technique instructing everything he understands 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.719
 convenient to clarify 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.500
 indeed the facts but it seems to me 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.869
 important 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.410
 a fact that we can provide you with 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.810
 testimony of the neighbors and is that I 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.180
 they said yesterday in this same place and 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.369
 also with a child an accident 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.320
 of characteristics or to see us in the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.899
 circumstances were similar 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.969
 obviously the derivations totally 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.069
 different is true with neighbors or 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.949
 If you have the position here, work 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:41.659
 diary told me that also yesterday happened 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.339
 an event an accident that involved 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:47.719
 also a child here on this machine yes 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:50.539
 exactly yesterday afternoon but here 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.789
 we have a lot of gurisada 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.859
 notice that here we have freedom we have 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.170
 soccer field halfway down the block 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:01.039
 we have a school where about 400 children 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.539
 among which there are 40 50 cars are 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.070
 very busy and belloni is 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.950
 awesome how are you can 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.380
 see the speed of how the 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.210
 the cars the people are that same is a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.280
 very congested ability 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 transition to mind are very busy 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.920
 and good and you have to see the 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 drivers that are driving and good to see 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.820
 if the characteristic of these problems 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.210
 and influence on the transit of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.210
 bus 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 to you in images to the doctor salazar 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.930
 who is making the contacts 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.120
 relevant telephone numbers and has been 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.870
 working in the place I did not ask 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 specifically if the buses circulate to 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.900
 high speed for this place if they have 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.550
 reason I go be normal is also the 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.920
 problem are the departmental ones that 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.030
 walk a little way out because poor them 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.030
 anybody asked 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.130
 internally because in 30 minutes is 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.400
 in the center 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.460
 instead in one of these 110 189 lehman 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.380
 45 50 minutes arrives faster more 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.880
 fast to walk more quickly but 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.150
 also in terms of the signage that 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.220
 look for signage to signal the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.710
 crosses exactly here we have a 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.560
 school dedicated to 50 meters of a 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:24.140
 school in 400 children where they come 40 50 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.120
 cars and different hours because it is 8 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.920
 at 12 you're twelve and a half past one and a half 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.920
 five o'clock five o'clock 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.690
 I think it 's requested and supposedly what 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.270
 will go to put because by bellone 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.330
 supposedly they are going to place the traffic light 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.640
 in many streets that was decided that 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.260
 they were going to do it so this but the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.700
 true that there is too much used and 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.270
 well we have to take care to 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.270
 children 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.300
 pick what you are reviewing here 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.070
 just that the issue of transit is 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.020
 a very, very congested artery 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.240
 with many children obviously why 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.160
 because it's about school zones and 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.720
 well obviously genes generate 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.850
 difficulties let's see if we can 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.950
 us after he finishes his job 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.510
 the salazar doctor chat with him so that 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.360
 tell us to tell us basically what 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.580
 type of instructions to the store 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.990
 hiroshi while your conversation lasted 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.020
 with this neighbor these minutes was 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:23.630
 Permanent transit passing despite 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.040
 that surely there is a 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.300
 slowing down as a result of all the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.670
 operative that is being developed there 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.770
 but traffic was permanent and if there 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.630
 schools and lyceums in that area there are 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.490
 private schools is surely a 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.490
 place of much transit of children also
