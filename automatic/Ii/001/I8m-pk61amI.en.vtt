is completely unscientific but hopefully
you'll<00:00:12.599> find<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.900> useful<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.980> length<00:00:14.130> of

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
you'll find it useful and the length of

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.560 
you'll find it useful and the length of

again quite a reasonably priced lens so
let's<00:00:50.640> see<00:00:50.789> how<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.270> stacks<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.750> against<00:00:52.140> the

for<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.920> three<00:01:02.910> point<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:04.159> then<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.309> have<00:01:05.339> Mir

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
for at three point a then we have Mir

cannon at you point a Zeiss a 2.8
and<00:01:16.560> then<00:01:17.310> tax<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.910> Chobani<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.700> hard

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
and then tax at Chobani it's really hard

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.670 
and then tax at Chobani it's really hard
to<00:01:21.210> judge<00:01:21.450> sharpness<00:01:21.900> though<00:01:22.050> so<00:01:22.260> let's<00:01:22.440> have

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
to judge sharpness though so let's have

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.650 
to judge sharpness though so let's have
a<00:01:22.740> look<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.280> Hanna<00:01:23.460> millimeter<00:01:23.850> timeline

a look at you Hanna millimeter timeline

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:38.860 
a look at you Hanna millimeter timeline
crops

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.290 

and<00:01:39.770> now<00:01:39.950> si<00:01:40.280> besides<00:01:40.670> which<00:01:40.880> really<00:01:41.090> shows

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
and now si besides which really shows

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.840 
and now si besides which really shows
the<00:01:41.480> difference<00:01:41.810> between<00:01:42.050> these<00:01:42.350> lenses<00:01:42.850> next

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
the difference between these lenses next

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.000 
the difference between these lenses next
up<00:01:43.940> we'll<00:01:44.090> have<00:01:44.210> all<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.600> lenses<00:01:44.870> at<00:01:45.080> 5.6<00:01:45.620> and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
up we'll have all the lenses at 5.6 and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.220 
up we'll have all the lenses at 5.6 and
now<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.850> performance<00:01:47.510> is<00:01:47.720> definitely<00:01:48.050> much

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
now the performance is definitely much

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.020 
now the performance is definitely much
more<00:01:48.260> even<00:01:48.800> across<00:01:48.980> the<00:01:49.100> board<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.880> might

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
more even across the board you might

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.090 
more even across the board you might
also<00:01:50.240> notice<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.960> mir<00:01:51.350> is<00:01:51.380> definitely<00:01:51.890> wider

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
also notice that mir is definitely wider

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.910 
also notice that mir is definitely wider
than<00:01:52.400> all<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.880> other<00:01:53.090> lenses<00:01:53.830> apart<00:01:54.830> from

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
than all the other lenses apart from

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.680 
than all the other lenses apart from
sharpest<00:01:55.400> it's<00:01:55.610> quite<00:01:55.820> obvious<00:01:56.210> that<00:01:56.270> every

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
sharpest it's quite obvious that every

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.420 
sharpest it's quite obvious that every
lens<00:01:56.840> has<00:01:57.050> different<00:01:57.440> tone<00:01:57.620> and<00:01:57.830> contrast

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
lens has different tone and contrast

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.700 
lens has different tone and contrast
some<00:01:58.880> people<00:01:59.180> like<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.450> low<00:01:59.600> contrast<00:01:59.990> others

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
some people like it low contrast others

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.030 
some people like it low contrast others
like<00:02:00.890> high<00:02:01.190> contrast<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.150> all<00:02:02.450> subjective

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
like high contrast it's all subjective

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.710 
like high contrast it's all subjective
and<00:02:04.040> now<00:02:04.220> let's<00:02:04.460> have<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.640> look<00:02:04.790> at<00:02:05.000> 200%

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
and now let's have a look at 200%

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.889 
and now let's have a look at 200%
timeline<00:02:06.230> crops<00:02:06.560> at<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:07.040> 5.6<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:07.940> you<00:02:08.540> can<00:02:08.660> see

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
timeline crops at a 5.6 and you can see

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.130 
timeline crops at a 5.6 and you can see
how<00:02:09.110> different<00:02:09.580> every<00:02:10.580> lens<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:11.090> there<00:02:12.050> is

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
how different every lens is there is

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.770 
how different every lens is there is
massive<00:02:12.650> difference<00:02:12.980> in<00:02:13.220> tone<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.790> there<00:02:14.630> is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
massive difference in tone and there is

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.490 
massive difference in tone and there is
difference<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:15.580> contrast<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.760> sharpness<00:02:16.790> to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
difference in contrast and sharpness to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.800 
difference in contrast and sharpness to
with<00:02:18.500> Pentax<00:02:19.190> value<00:02:19.610> being<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:20.000> sharpest<00:02:20.570> and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
with Pentax value being the sharpest and

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.770 
with Pentax value being the sharpest and
punches<00:02:21.740> with<00:02:22.280> mere<00:02:22.580> beam<00:02:22.760> lowest<00:02:23.300> contrast

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
punches with mere beam lowest contrast

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.770 
punches with mere beam lowest contrast
and<00:02:24.130> maybe<00:02:25.130> even<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.760> softest<00:02:26.210> but<00:02:26.510> keep<00:02:26.690> in

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
and maybe even the softest but keep in

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.810 
and maybe even the softest but keep in
mind<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.110> contrast<00:02:27.740> affects<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.430> perceived

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
mind that contrast affects the perceived

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.300 
mind that contrast affects the perceived
sharpness<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:29.720> well<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.470> lastly<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.920> wanted<00:02:31.250> to

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
sharpness as well and lastly I wanted to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.010 
sharpness as well and lastly I wanted to
see<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.700> close<00:02:31.910> focusing<00:02:32.300> ability<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.840> each

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
see the close focusing ability of each

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.350 
see the close focusing ability of each
lens<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.680> bulky<00:02:34.010> it<00:02:34.160> produces<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.090> solid

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
lens and the bulky it produces the solid

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400 
lens and the bulky it produces the solid
where<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.630> least<00:02:35.810> impressive<00:02:36.020> but<00:02:36.380> I

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
where is the least impressive but I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.930 
where is the least impressive but I
really<00:02:36.650> like<00:02:36.800> this<00:02:36.950> really<00:02:37.100> bulky<00:02:37.550> around<00:02:37.850> the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
really like this really bulky around the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.970 
really like this really bulky around the
edges<00:02:38.210> contacts<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.020> little<00:02:39.410> bit<00:02:39.530> better<00:02:39.710> on

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
edges contacts is a little bit better on

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.490 
edges contacts is a little bit better on
the<00:02:40.040> gloss<00:02:40.280> focusing<00:02:40.760> distance<00:02:41.320> Canon<00:02:42.320> is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the gloss focusing distance Canon is

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.930 
the gloss focusing distance Canon is
supposed<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.860> be<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.100> same<00:02:43.340> but<00:02:43.610> it's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
supposed to be the same but it's

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.170 
supposed to be the same but it's
actually<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.420> bit<00:02:44.540> closer<00:02:45.640> sides<00:02:46.640> will<00:02:46.850> get<00:02:47.000> you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
actually a bit closer sides will get you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.900 
actually a bit closer sides will get you
really<00:02:47.390> close<00:02:47.720> with<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> buttery<00:02:49.130> smooth<00:02:49.489> bokeh

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
really close with a buttery smooth bokeh

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.229 
really close with a buttery smooth bokeh
