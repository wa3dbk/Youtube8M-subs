00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
know I could cheese and West but yeah in

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.330 
know I could cheese and West but yeah in
this<00:00:33.960> game<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> do<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> four<00:00:35.130> gate

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
this game I'm going to do a four gate

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.380 
this game I'm going to do a four gate
with<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> proxy<00:00:36.450> pylon<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> side<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.300> his

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
with a proxy pylon to the side of his

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.500 
with a proxy pylon to the side of his
base<00:00:42.079> yeah<00:00:43.789> it's<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> pretty<00:00:45.059> good<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
base yeah it's a pretty good game I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.069 
base yeah it's a pretty good game I
thing

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.799 

did<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.769> standard<00:00:50.280> pylon<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.179> ten<00:00:51.890> protoss

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
did the standard pylon at ten protoss

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
did the standard pylon at ten protoss
he's<00:00:54.809> doing<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:56.179> supply<00:00:57.179> depot<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.809> eleven<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
he's doing the supply depot at eleven I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.360 
he's doing the supply depot at eleven I
guess<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.399> taryn<00:01:00.890> trying<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> scout<00:01:02.100> his<00:01:02.219> base

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
guess for taryn trying to scout his base

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.420 
guess for taryn trying to scout his base
ah<00:01:02.549> but<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.789> send<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.210> probe<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.899> wrong<00:01:04.430> base

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
ah but I send my probe to the wrong base

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.249 
ah but I send my probe to the wrong base
first<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> don't<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.600> him

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.539 

yeah<00:01:14.259> he<00:01:14.439> he<00:01:14.770> wanted<00:01:14.979> to<00:01:15.040> challenge<00:01:15.189> me<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.400> a

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
yeah he he wanted to challenge me to a

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.240 
yeah he he wanted to challenge me to a
game<00:01:15.610> he<00:01:16.030> thought<00:01:16.060> he'd<00:01:16.390> beat<00:01:16.540> me<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:17.250> actually

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
game he thought he'd beat me I actually

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.520 
game he thought he'd beat me I actually
beat<00:01:18.460> him<00:01:18.549> twice<00:01:18.670> this<00:01:19.540> is<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:20.170> first<00:01:20.350> game

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
beat him twice this is a the first game

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.200 
beat him twice this is a the first game
we<00:01:20.770> played<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:21.490> actually<00:01:21.640> bit<00:01:21.909> shorter

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
we played and it's actually bit shorter

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.420 
we played and it's actually bit shorter
second<00:01:22.720> game<00:01:22.869> at<00:01:23.380> end<00:01:23.649> up<00:01:23.950> taking<00:01:24.250> some

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
second game at end up taking some

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.810 
second game at end up taking some
classes<00:01:24.580> class<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.689> to<00:01:26.290> win<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:27.520> him<00:01:27.610> he's

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
classes class I to win see him he's

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.550 
classes class I to win see him he's
trying<00:01:28.000> to<00:01:28.119> scout<00:01:28.450> me<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.170> he<00:01:29.229> goes<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.409> the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
trying to scout me and he goes to the

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.820 
trying to scout me and he goes to the
wrong<00:01:29.799> base<00:01:30.070> also<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.659> now<00:01:31.810> my<00:01:32.049> probes<00:01:32.590> going

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
wrong base also but now my probes going

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.499 
wrong base also but now my probes going
down<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.100> correct<00:01:33.340> base<00:01:33.520> I'll<00:01:34.090> see<00:01:34.330> these

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
down to the correct base I'll see these

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.490 
down to the correct base I'll see these
down<00:01:34.720> there<00:01:36.539> but<00:01:37.539> my<00:01:37.659> simulator<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.170> while<00:01:38.350> i'm

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
down there but my simulator a while i'm

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.910 
down there but my simulator a while i'm
building<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.860> gateway<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.990> i<00:01:41.020> can<00:01:41.380> time<00:01:41.710> that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
building the gateway so i can time that

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.010 
building the gateway so i can time that
with<00:01:42.189> cybernetics<00:01:42.970> core<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.360> get<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.600> warp

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
with cybernetics core to get the warp

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.600 
with cybernetics core to get the warp
gate<00:01:44.200> as<00:01:44.560> soon<00:01:44.830> as<00:01:44.860> possible

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.030 

now<00:01:49.970> my<00:01:50.150> probe<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.350> finally<00:01:51.650> reaching<00:01:51.830> his

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
now my probe is finally reaching his

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.060 
now my probe is finally reaching his
base<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.270> i<00:01:53.330> could<00:01:53.480> see<00:01:53.660> he's<00:01:53.810> doing<00:01:54.110> i<00:01:54.380> kind<00:01:54.950> of

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
base so i could see he's doing i kind of

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.340 
base so i could see he's doing i kind of
assumed<00:01:55.190> he<00:01:55.640> was<00:01:55.760> going<00:01:56.090> on<00:01:56.270> Reapers<00:01:56.990> since<00:01:57.260> he

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
assumed he was going on Reapers since he

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.180 
assumed he was going on Reapers since he
had<00:01:57.440> his<00:01:57.620> a<00:01:57.650> gas<00:01:58.280> up<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:58.640> fast<00:01:59.230> but<00:02:00.230> the<00:02:00.410> he's

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
had his a gas up so fast but the he's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.250 
had his a gas up so fast but the he's
not<00:02:01.540> he's<00:02:02.540> actually<00:02:02.690> gonna<00:02:02.900> be<00:02:03.050> going

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
not he's actually gonna be going

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.030 
not he's actually gonna be going

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
scout the base as long as possible thank

scout the base as long as possible thank
you<00:02:10.020> probe<00:02:11.420> he<00:02:12.420> still<00:02:12.660> doesn't<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:12.930> where

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you probe he still doesn't know where

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.720 
you probe he still doesn't know where
I'm<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.260> hat<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:15.890> located<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.220> 12<00:02:17.610> in

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
that iconic boost it out right to his

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.100 
that iconic boost it out right to his
face<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:28.560> try<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.340> get<00:02:29.490> some<00:02:29.730> pressure<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:31.020> we

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
face to try and get some pressure so we

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.570 
face to try and get some pressure so we
can't<00:02:31.940> mess<00:02:32.940> up<00:02:33.000> too<00:02:33.360> many<00:02:34.040> Marauders<00:02:35.040> because

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
can't mess up too many Marauders because

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.130 
can't mess up too many Marauders because
once<00:02:35.910> he<00:02:36.000> has<00:02:36.150> too<00:02:36.240> many<00:02:36.300> Marauders<00:02:36.720> I<00:02:36.840> can't
