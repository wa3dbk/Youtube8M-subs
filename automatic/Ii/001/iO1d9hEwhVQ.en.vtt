00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
tools from fab your nails I probably put

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.399 
tools from fab your nails I probably put
a<00:02:02.729> little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.090> too<00:02:03.329> much<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> polish<00:02:04.170> onto

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
a little bit too much of the polish onto

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.780 
a little bit too much of the polish onto
the<00:02:04.649> plate<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> that's<00:02:05.189> why<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> ended<00:02:05.610> up

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the plate and that's why I ended up

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.310 
the plate and that's why I ended up
scraping<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.329> like<00:02:06.450> three<00:02:06.630> times<00:02:06.750> but

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
scraping it like three times but

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
scraping it like three times but
normally<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:08.009> would<00:02:08.459> only<00:02:08.550> scrape<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.030> once

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
normally you would only scrape it once

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.570 
normally you would only scrape it once
or<00:02:09.479> twice<00:02:09.629> at<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.170> most<00:02:10.319> then<00:02:11.009> just<00:02:11.220> roll<00:02:11.400> your

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
or twice at the most then just roll your

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
or twice at the most then just roll your
stand<00:02:11.849> /<00:02:11.970> /<00:02:12.300> you'll<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:13.050> good<00:02:13.080> image

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
stand / / you'll get a really good image
and<00:02:13.890> then<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.700> roll<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.180> onto<00:02:15.330> your<00:02:15.600> nail<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
