00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
tools they

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.979 
tools they
very<00:02:13.829> hot<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:14.879> excess<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.569> hours<00:02:15.959> that

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
very hot with the excess of hours that

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.649 
very hot with the excess of hours that
it<00:02:16.230> takes<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.560> mix<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.920> master<00:02:17.310> um<00:02:17.659> only

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
it takes a mix and master um only

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.440 
it takes a mix and master um only
drawback<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:20.129> are<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> band<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.150> only

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
drawback is if you are a band it only

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.850 
drawback is if you are a band it only
