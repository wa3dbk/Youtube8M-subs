11 simona welcome here in Wuhan after a
long<00:00:11.160> journey<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.759> arrived<00:00:12.090> well<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:12.750> yes

flight because we are living on time so

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.020 
flight because we are living on time so
we<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.920> went<00:00:31.920> inside<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> plane<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.880> then

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
we just went inside the plane and then

we just went inside the plane and then
out<00:00:33.350> how<00:00:34.350> do<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.649> cope<00:00:34.920> during<00:00:35.670> these<00:00:35.880> long

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
out how do you cope during these long

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380 
out how do you cope during these long
journeys<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.430> mean<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.610> not<00:00:38.730> many<00:00:38.910> years<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
journeys I mean it's not many years that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.959 
journeys I mean it's not many years that
we<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.660> used<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.930> come<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.200> Asia<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.160> trying

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
we are used to come to Asia so we trying

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
we are used to come to Asia so we trying
every<00:00:42.329> time<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.780> get<00:00:42.930> better<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.500> get<00:00:43.710> more

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
every time to get better and get more

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
every time to get better and get more
used<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> time<00:00:44.579> change<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:46.350> best<00:00:46.530> way<00:00:46.710> for

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
used to the time change the best way for

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440 
used to the time change the best way for
us<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> always<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> give<00:00:47.789> our<00:00:47.879> body<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.210> small

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
us is always to give our body and small

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
us is always to give our body and small
shock<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.870> warm<00:00:49.050> up<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.550> simulate<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.730> there

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
shock to warm up to simulate if there

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.010 
shock to warm up to simulate if there
was<00:00:50.969> no<00:00:51.090> international<00:00:51.390> competition<00:00:51.989> which

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
was no international competition which

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
was no international competition which
we<00:00:52.230> usually<00:00:52.379> always<00:00:52.620> dance<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
we usually always dance if we have the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.130 
we usually always dance if we have the
possibility<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.750> unfortunately

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
possibility this time and unfortunately

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560 
possibility this time and unfortunately
not<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.469> had<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> create<00:00:56.550> our<00:00:56.730> own<00:00:56.850> competition

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
not we had to create our own competition

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.810 
not we had to create our own competition
and<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> small<00:00:58.920> simulation<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and do a small simulation out of the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.240 
and do a small simulation out of the
competition<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.230> already<00:01:01.620> shocked<00:01:01.890> he

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
competition so but is already shocked he

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.009 
competition so but is already shocked he
already<00:01:02.430> got<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> first<00:01:03.000> shock<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.480> now

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
already got the first shock and now

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
already got the first shock and now
Sunday<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.769> hopefully<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> more

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
Sunday you will be hopefully in a more

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.359 
Sunday you will be hopefully in a more
relaxed<00:01:06.360> condition<00:01:06.830> simulation<00:01:07.830> means<00:01:08.040> what

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
relaxed condition simulation means what

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.780 
relaxed condition simulation means what
that<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.299> actually<00:01:09.510> do<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> studio<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.400> real

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that we actually do in the studio a real

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.080 
that we actually do in the studio a real
semi<00:01:12.600> final<00:01:13.080> final<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:15.060> a

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
semi final final so we have really a

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.090 
semi final final so we have really a
stamina<00:01:15.630> practice<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.320> stamina<00:01:16.560> practice

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
stamina practice more stamina practice

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.090 
stamina practice more stamina practice
where<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.549> try<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.509> perform<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.560> way<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.920> would

on after European already we always try
to<00:01:48.659> improve<00:01:49.409> every<00:01:50.310> competition<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to improve every competition to have a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.910 
to improve every competition to have a
small<00:01:51.810> talk<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.140> our<00:01:52.259> teacher<00:01:52.560> William

quinones<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.520> arbitrarily<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.659> see<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.110> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
quinones and arbitrarily to see what is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.920 
quinones and arbitrarily to see what is
the<00:01:55.530> missing<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:56.219> could<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.520> better<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the missing what could be better what is

the missing what could be better what is
already<00:01:58.259> very<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.100> which<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
already very good so which we have to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.170 
already very good so which we have to
keep<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.829> priority<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:03.000> because

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
keep and the priority is I think because

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
keep and the priority is I think because
we<00:02:03.479> did<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> good<00:02:04.049> preparation<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:05.210> enjoy<00:02:06.210> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
we did a good preparation to enjoy and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.619 
we did a good preparation to enjoy and
make<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.570> small<00:02:06.840> show<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.629> yes

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
make a small show out of it probably yes

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.809 
make a small show out of it probably yes
so<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> keep<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.760> to

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
so we know what to keep and what to

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.860 
so we know what to keep and what to
improve<00:02:12.239> yes

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
improve yes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.589 
improve yes
and<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.190> means<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.640> look<00:02:14.819> forward<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and that means we look forward to the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.740 
and that means we look forward to the
solar<00:02:16.110> dances<00:02:16.650> oh<00:02:16.830> yeah<00:02:17.519> for<00:02:17.700> sure<00:02:17.730> for<00:02:18.120> sure<00:02:18.180> I

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
solar dances oh yeah for sure for sure I

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.479 
solar dances oh yeah for sure for sure I
mean<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> solar<00:02:19.170> dances<00:02:19.560> always<00:02:19.830> give<00:02:20.010> us<00:02:20.190> a

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
mean the solar dances always give us a

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.809 
mean the solar dances always give us a
good<00:02:20.760> feeling<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.510> possibility<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.790> have<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
good feeling the possibility to have a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.940 
good feeling the possibility to have a
very<00:02:24.269> close<00:02:24.599> look<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.110> couple's<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.709> think

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
very close look to the couple's I think

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.530 
very close look to the couple's I think
it's<00:02:26.069> not<00:02:26.190> only<00:02:26.310> good<00:02:26.580> for<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.940> judges<00:02:27.150> but

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it's not only good for the judges but

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.479 
it's not only good for the judges but
also<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.019> audience<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.830> only<00:02:29.159> one

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
also for the audience to have only one

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.979 
also for the audience to have only one
couple<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:29.940> can<00:02:30.090> concentrate<00:02:30.629> on<00:02:30.659> and
