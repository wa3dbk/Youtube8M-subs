form<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.630> rows<00:01:40.840> by<00:01:41.050> putting<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.500> petals<00:01:41.860> on

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
form the rows by putting the petals on

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.399 
form the rows by putting the petals on
the<00:01:42.159> cone<00:01:42.400> send<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.420> edge<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.140> first

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
the cone send the edge of the first

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.280 
the cone send the edge of the first
petal<00:01:44.920> and<00:01:45.100> then<00:01:45.430> place<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:46.060> about<00:01:46.450> 1/8<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.170> an

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
petal and then place it about 1/8 of an

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.770 
petal and then place it about 1/8 of an
inch<00:01:47.440> above<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.010> point<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> cone<00:01:48.820> wrap

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
inch above the point of the cone wrap

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.390 
inch above the point of the cone wrap
one<00:01:50.050> side<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.590> petal<00:01:50.770> around<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> other

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
one side of the petal around the other

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.700 
one side of the petal around the other
and<00:01:51.790> you<00:01:52.270> don't<00:01:52.479> want<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.690> see<00:01:52.840> too<00:01:53.110> much<00:01:53.290> into

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
and you don't want to see too much into

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.790 
and you don't want to see too much into
the<00:01:53.830> interior<00:01:54.490> so<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.790> see<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.210> cone<00:01:55.479> and

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
the interior so you see the cone and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.140 
the interior so you see the cone and
then<00:01:56.800> all<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.100> remaining<00:01:57.550> petals<00:01:57.729> will<00:01:58.030> be

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
then all the remaining petals will be

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.650 
then all the remaining petals will be
thin<00:01:58.390> before<00:01:58.570> you<00:01:58.869> use<00:01:59.110> them<00:02:00.360> petal<00:02:01.360> number

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
thin before you use them petal number

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.420 
thin before you use them petal number
two<00:02:01.900> will<00:02:02.229> go<00:02:02.380> where<00:02:02.560> petal<00:02:02.950> number<00:02:03.220> one

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
two will go where petal number one

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.600 
two will go where petal number one
overlaps<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:04.930> place<00:02:05.259> it<00:02:05.290> about<00:02:05.680> 1/8<00:02:06.250> of<00:02:06.460> an

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
overlaps so place it about 1/8 of an

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.130 
overlaps so place it about 1/8 of an
inch<00:02:06.759> above<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.360> point<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:07.990> petal<00:02:08.350> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
inch above the point of the petal and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.420 
inch above the point of the petal and
leave<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.350> two<00:02:11.590> side<00:02:12.010> flaps<00:02:12.430> open<00:02:14.430> petal

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
leave the two side flaps open petal

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.260 
leave the two side flaps open petal
three<00:02:15.790> will<00:02:16.030> go<00:02:16.180> opposite<00:02:16.780> petal<00:02:17.200> 2<00:02:18.270> now

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
three will go opposite petal 2 now

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.630 
three will go opposite petal 2 now
looking<00:02:19.630> from<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> back<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> petal<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
looking from the back of the petal the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.220 
looking from the back of the petal the
right<00:02:21.850> side<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.080> outside

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
right side is going to go on the outside

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.490 
right side is going to go on the outside
as<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.890> overlap<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.700> petals<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:26.290> will

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
as you overlap the petals this will

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.150 
as you overlap the petals this will
create<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:27.040> spiral<00:02:27.400> look<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> petals<00:02:29.160> so

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
create a spiral look to the petals so

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160 
create a spiral look to the petals so
shape<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.670> petals<00:02:30.850> at<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.239> base<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.810> then

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
shape the petals at the base and then

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.630 
shape the petals at the base and then
bend<00:02:32.440> them<00:02:32.650> back<00:02:32.680> slightly<00:02:33.459> with<00:02:33.610> your

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
bend them back slightly with your

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.630 
bend them back slightly with your
fingers

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.340 

petals<00:02:37.640> four<00:02:37.910> five<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.360> six<00:02:38.660> will<00:02:38.870> go<00:02:38.990> on<00:02:39.170> in

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
petals four five and six will go on in

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.480 
petals four five and six will go on in
the<00:02:39.470> same<00:02:39.740> way<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.880> first<00:02:41.090> petal<00:02:41.450> four<00:02:42.080> is

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the same way the first petal four is

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.900 
the same way the first petal four is
going<00:02:43.490> to<00:02:43.610> sit<00:02:44.380> where<00:02:45.380> petals<00:02:45.890> two<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.520> three

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
going to sit where petals two and three

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.630 
going to sit where petals two and three
overlap<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.870> again<00:02:48.560> about<00:02:48.950> an<00:02:49.130> eighth<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.490> an

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
overlap and again about an eighth of an

overlap and again about an eighth of an
inch<00:02:49.880> above<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:50.510> last<00:02:50.930> petals<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:54.110> adhere<00:02:54.500> it

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
inch above the last petals so adhere it

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.530 
inch above the last petals so adhere it
to<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.800> base<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.340> leave<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.760> flaps<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.420> the

to the base and leave the flaps of the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.490 
to the base and leave the flaps of the
petals<00:02:56.900> open

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.950 

petals<00:03:02.500> five<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.250> six<00:03:04.140> will<00:03:05.140> go<00:03:05.350> on<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:06.190> form<00:03:06.580> a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
petals five and six will go on to form a

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.600 
petals five and six will go on to form a
triangle<00:03:07.960> of<00:03:08.590> petals<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.880> four<00:03:10.270> five<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.990> six

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
triangle of petals so four five and six

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.880 
triangle of petals so four five and six
when<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.730> look<00:03:12.940> down<00:03:13.410> will<00:03:14.410> look<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:14.830> a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
when you look down will look like a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.560 
when you look down will look like a
triangle

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.850 

like<00:03:19.570> we<00:03:19.750> did<00:03:19.930> before<00:03:20.050> we're<00:03:20.650> going<00:03:20.800> to

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
like we did before we're going to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.800 
like we did before we're going to
overlap<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.580> petals<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.330> right<00:03:22.540> side

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
overlap the petals with the right side

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.810 
overlap the petals with the right side
of<00:03:22.990> the<00:03:23.110> petal<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.710> outside<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.370> form<00:03:24.640> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
of the petal on the outside to form the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.960 
of the petal on the outside to form the
spiral<00:03:25.360> and<00:03:25.570> then<00:03:26.440> squeeze<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.340> flower<00:03:27.580> at

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
spiral and then squeeze the flower at

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.780 
spiral and then squeeze the flower at
the<00:03:28.000> base<00:03:28.450> to<00:03:28.900> form<00:03:29.230> it<00:03:29.490> then<00:03:30.490> you're<00:03:30.610> going<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
the base to form it then you're going to

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.970 
the base to form it then you're going to
take<00:03:31.060> and<00:03:31.330> slightly<00:03:31.930> Bend<00:03:32.230> back<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.590> petals

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
take and slightly Bend back the petals

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.330 
take and slightly Bend back the petals
with<00:03:33.130> your<00:03:33.280> fingers

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.550 

we<00:03:37.340> need<00:03:37.519> five<00:03:37.760> more<00:03:38.060> petals<00:03:38.390> we're<00:03:39.170> missing

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
we need five more petals we're missing

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.110 
we need five more petals we're missing
one<00:03:39.590> so<00:03:40.040> I'm<00:03:40.159> going<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.340> show<00:03:40.549> you<00:03:40.609> how<00:03:40.819> to<00:03:40.849> make

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
one so I'm going to show you how to make

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.559 
one so I'm going to show you how to make
one<00:03:41.299> by<00:03:41.510> hand<00:03:41.840> so<00:03:42.769> take<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.010> small<00:03:43.459> ball<00:03:43.939> of<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
one by hand so take a small ball of the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.160 
one by hand so take a small ball of the
clay<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.430> then<00:03:46.430> flatten<00:03:46.849> one<00:03:47.239> side<00:03:47.629> like<00:03:47.959> the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
clay and then flatten one side like the

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.809 
clay and then flatten one side like the
top<00:03:48.379> of<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.680> petals<00:03:49.069> like<00:03:49.400> we've<00:03:49.640> been

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
top of the petals like we've been

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.550 
top of the petals like we've been
flattening<00:03:50.359> the<00:03:50.510> other<00:03:50.629> petals<00:03:51.079> we<00:03:51.230> made<00:03:51.409> with

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
flattening the other petals we made with

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.559 
flattening the other petals we made with
the<00:03:51.680> cutter<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.819> don't<00:03:53.000> really<00:03:53.120> have<00:03:53.299> to<00:03:53.450> be

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
the cutter you don't really have to be

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.679 
the cutter you don't really have to be
too<00:03:53.780> precise<00:03:54.200> on<00:03:54.439> the<00:03:54.470> bottom<00:03:55.420> place<00:03:56.420> this

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
too precise on the bottom place this

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:58.390 
too precise on the bottom place this
petal<00:03:57.109> will<00:03:57.260> one<00:03:57.470> set<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:57.980> previous

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
petal will one set of the previous

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.119 
petal will one set of the previous
petals<00:03:58.819> overlap<00:03:59.590> then<00:04:00.590> we're<00:04:00.769> going<00:04:01.010> to

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
petals overlap then we're going to

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.119 
petals overlap then we're going to
continue<00:04:01.700> with<00:04:01.849> the<00:04:02.000> remaining<00:04:02.389> petals

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
continue with the remaining petals

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.940 
continue with the remaining petals
thinning<00:04:04.129> them<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.670> then<00:04:05.000> placing<00:04:05.569> them<00:04:05.810> in<00:04:06.139> a

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
thinning them and then placing them in a

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.050 
thinning them and then placing them in a
spiral<00:04:07.540> around<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.780> rose<00:04:12.489> again<00:04:13.489> looking

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
spiral around the rose again looking

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.029 
spiral around the rose again looking
from<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.389> back<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.930> right<00:04:15.139> side<00:04:15.439> is<00:04:15.709> going<00:04:15.769> to

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
from the back the right side is going to

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.719 
from the back the right side is going to
be<00:04:16.160> on<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.579> outside<00:04:17.320> now<00:04:18.320> I'm<00:04:19.190> pulling<00:04:19.609> away

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
be on the outside now I'm pulling away

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.770 
be on the outside now I'm pulling away
the<00:04:20.150> first<00:04:20.389> petal<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:22.150> because<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.539> last

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
the first petal here because the last

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.850 
the first petal here because the last
petal<00:04:25.360> needs<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.599> go<00:04:26.750> underneath<00:04:27.199> the<00:04:27.620> first

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
petal needs to go underneath the first

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.900 
petal needs to go underneath the first
petal

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.090 

so<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> can<00:04:34.330> curve<00:04:34.600> back<00:04:34.900> these<00:04:35.320> petals<00:04:35.680> also
