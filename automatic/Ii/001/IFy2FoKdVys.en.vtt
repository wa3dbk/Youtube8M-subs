something that's hidden in a game if

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.100 
something that's hidden in a game if
done<00:01:28.829> law<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.250> find<00:01:29.460> his<00:01:29.610> hidden<00:01:29.820> secret<00:01:30.270> and

done law can find his hidden secret and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
done law can find his hidden secret and
you<00:01:31.500> have<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> find<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> within<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.430> oasis

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you have to find it within the oasis

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.450 
you have to find it within the oasis
which<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.150> kind<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.420> virtual<00:01:33.780> reality

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
which is kind of virtual reality

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.100 
which is kind of virtual reality
essentially<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> there's<00:01:36.479> three<00:01:36.750> gates<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
essentially and there's three gates a

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.289 
essentially and there's three gates a
after<00:01:37.350> lock<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> coolest<00:01:38.850> thing<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
after lock but the coolest thing that I

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.910 
after lock but the coolest thing that I
think<00:01:39.509> was<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> Ernest<00:01:40.650> Cline

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
think was really and the Ernest Cline

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.160 
think was really and the Ernest Cline
did<00:01:41.159> about<00:01:41.880> several<00:01:42.479> weeks<00:01:42.689> ago<00:01:42.869> he<00:01:42.990> announced

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
did about several weeks ago he announced

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.440 
did about several weeks ago he announced

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
which I'm excited about but I don't

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.240 
which I'm excited about but I don't
think<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:37.959> gonna<00:02:38.049> be<00:02:38.170> nearly<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.040> good<00:02:39.129> as

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
think it's gonna be nearly as good as

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.289 
think it's gonna be nearly as good as
this<00:02:39.400> because<00:02:39.669> there's<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:39.909> many<00:02:40.030> good

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
this because there's so many good

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.360 
this because there's so many good
obscure<00:02:40.780> references<00:02:41.379> in<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.889> book<00:02:42.129> I<00:02:42.250> mean
