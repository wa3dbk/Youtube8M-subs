guys<00:03:58.159> communicate<00:03:58.959> there's<00:03:59.959> a<00:04:00.019> lot<00:04:00.169> of

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
guys communicate there's a lot of

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.929 
guys communicate there's a lot of
physiological<00:04:00.500> stuff<00:04:01.250> that<00:04:01.400> happens<00:04:01.729> when<00:04:01.849> we

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:01.939 
physiological stuff that happens when we

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.640 
physiological stuff that happens when we
elevate<00:04:02.449> our<00:04:02.569> heart<00:04:02.750> rates<00:04:02.989> one<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
elevate our heart rates one of the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.839 
elevate our heart rates one of the
things<00:04:03.859> we<00:04:04.010> lose<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.489> ability<00:04:04.819> to

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
things we lose is the ability to

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.369 
things we lose is the ability to
communicate<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.540> we<00:04:05.629> believe<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:05.989> training

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
communicate so we believe in training

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.809 
communicate so we believe in training
for<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.620> here<00:04:06.859> you'll<00:04:07.010> hear<00:04:07.189> loud<00:04:07.459> verbal

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
for that here you'll hear loud verbal

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.089 
for that here you'll hear loud verbal
commands<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.569> need<00:04:08.780> to<00:04:08.959> consider<00:04:09.590> auditory

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099
