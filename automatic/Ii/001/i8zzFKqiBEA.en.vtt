00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
interviews and so all of august i should

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.929 
interviews and so all of august i should
be<00:00:27.050> doing<00:00:27.170> interviews<00:00:27.680> for<00:00:27.980> internships<00:00:28.730> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
be doing interviews for internships and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.669 
be doing interviews for internships and
I<00:00:29.000> just<00:00:29.240> felt<00:00:29.390> like<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:29.779> will<00:00:29.990> be<00:00:30.019> more

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
I just felt like this will be more

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.110 
I just felt like this will be more
appropriate<00:00:31.550> for<00:00:31.820> that<00:00:32.769> whole<00:00:33.769> type<00:00:34.699> of<00:00:34.910> stuff

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
appropriate for that whole type of stuff

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.329 
appropriate for that whole type of stuff
and<00:00:35.269> I<00:00:35.360> think<00:00:35.690> the<00:00:35.840> curly<00:00:36.680> hair<00:00:36.860> will<00:00:37.040> be<00:00:37.070> that

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
and I think the curly hair will be that

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:38.619 
and I think the curly hair will be that
appropriate<00:00:37.879> cuz<00:00:38.030> it's<00:00:38.150> kind<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.360> big<00:00:38.600> and

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
appropriate cuz it's kind of big and

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:40.840 
appropriate cuz it's kind of big and
stuff<00:00:39.140> like<00:00:39.290> that<00:00:39.350> I<00:00:39.530> don't<00:00:39.769> I<00:00:40.070> just<00:00:40.340> want<00:00:40.730> to

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
stuff like that I don't I just want to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.790 
stuff like that I don't I just want to
make<00:00:40.910> sure<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.360> have<00:00:41.719> every<00:00:42.079> single<00:00:42.260> chance<00:00:42.590> I

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
make sure I have every single chance I

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.330 
make sure I have every single chance I
don't<00:00:42.980> want<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:44.260> deter<00:00:45.260> people<00:00:45.590> from<00:00:45.890> other

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
don't want to deter people from other

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.549 
don't want to deter people from other

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
reasons to not hire me for something

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.680 
reasons to not hire me for something

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
just don't want to take any stretch

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.040 
just don't want to take any stretch
chances<00:01:04.550> just<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.030> know<00:01:05.180> keep<00:01:05.420> it<00:01:05.630> simple

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
chances just you know keep it simple

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.320 
chances just you know keep it simple
keep<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:07.130> looking<00:01:07.430> professional<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.240> stuff

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
keep it looking professional and stuff

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.320 
keep it looking professional and stuff
like<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.660> and<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:09.619> I<00:01:09.649> did<00:01:10.070> diet<00:01:10.340> black<00:01:10.789> but

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
like that and so I did diet black but

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.350 
like that and so I did diet black but
I'm<00:01:11.479> glad<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.690> did<00:01:11.810> diet<00:01:12.259> back<00:01:12.530> because<00:01:13.300> it<00:01:14.300> uh

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
I'm glad I did diet back because it uh

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.559 
I'm glad I did diet back because it uh
makes<00:01:15.349> it<00:01:15.530> easier<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.920> blend<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.520> so<00:01:17.149> this<00:01:17.330> is

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
makes it easier to blend and so this is

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.859 
makes it easier to blend and so this is
two<00:01:17.869> bundles<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:19.160> closure<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:20.060> I<00:01:20.810> think

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
two bundles and a closure and I think

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.219 
two bundles and a closure and I think
the<00:01:21.229> bundles<00:01:21.619> on<00:01:21.740> 14<00:01:22.250> 12<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.810> 10<00:01:24.050> inch

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
the bundles on 14 12 and a 10 inch

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.300 
the bundles on 14 12 and a 10 inch
closure<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:26.410> hope<00:01:27.410> my<00:01:27.590> blending<00:01:28.069> is<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
closure and hope my blending is the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.070 
closure and hope my blending is the
closure<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.729> good<00:01:28.789> I<00:01:29.209> didn't<00:01:29.599> bleach<00:01:29.840> the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
closure is good I didn't bleach the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.469 
closure is good I didn't bleach the
knots<00:01:30.289> on<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.649> closure<00:01:30.920> because<00:01:31.190> last<00:01:32.060> time<00:01:32.240> I

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
knots on the closure because last time I

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.999 
knots on the closure because last time I
bleached<00:01:32.720> knots<00:01:32.810> on<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.229> closer<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:33.800> turned

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
bleached knots on the closer and turned

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.889 
bleached knots on the closer and turned
the<00:01:34.130> closure<00:01:34.369> until<00:01:34.610> like<00:01:34.849> this<00:01:35.090> brassy<00:01:35.660> color

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
the closure until like this brassy color

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:39.880 
the closure until like this brassy color
it<00:01:36.560> was<00:01:36.679> just<00:01:36.800> so<00:01:37.039> hard<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.489> just<00:01:38.649> work<00:01:39.649> with

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
it was just so hard to just work with

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.410 
it was just so hard to just work with
this<00:01:40.069> I<00:01:40.250> was<00:01:40.459> like<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.610> nope<00:01:40.880> not<00:01:41.209> going<00:01:41.360> to

update when i finish wearing it from the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.560 
update when i finish wearing it from the
end<00:04:48.470> of<00:04:48.590> august<00:04:49.070> and<00:04:49.550> then<00:04:49.700> do<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:49.880> final<00:04:50.180> update

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
end of august and then do a final update

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.120 
end of august and then do a final update
i<00:04:50.600> like<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.960> wear<00:04:51.080> my<00:04:51.230> hair<00:04:51.470> for<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.680> long<00:04:51.860> time

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
i like to wear my hair for a long time

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.160 
i like to wear my hair for a long time
so<00:04:52.490> I<00:04:52.520> feel<00:04:52.790> like<00:04:52.820> four<00:04:53.240> weeks<00:04:53.510> is<00:04:53.690> not<00:04:53.870> really

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
so I feel like four weeks is not really

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:56.500 
so I feel like four weeks is not really
a<00:04:54.200> good<00:04:54.440> enough<00:04:55.190> time<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:55.700> determine<00:04:55.820> if<00:04:56.240> hair

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
a good enough time to determine if hair

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.530 
a good enough time to determine if hair
is<00:04:56.630> good<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.910> you'll<00:04:58.910> probably<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.300> be<00:04:59.510> a

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
is good so you'll probably just be a

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.450 
is good so you'll probably just be a
four<00:04:59.810> week<00:04:59.960> update<00:05:00.170> if<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.740> do<00:05:00.800> that<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.370> then
