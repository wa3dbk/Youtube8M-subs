00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.400
 on 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:11.309
 the day after 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.709
 Diego four thither by the layman hurt on the web pages to man of the hour 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.969
 Marco the climber of the red devils knows every blade of grass in the 

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:25.100
 Stadium and leads us to the place where fate took its course and remains 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.989
 Despite all the euphoria, FCK Hatakka describe this as eleven years for the first time 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.090
 Bayern Munich occupied 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.240
 Listen, you can see how a go-kart is painted 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.729
 No, that's fantastic 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:39.090
 it is full 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.900
 we imagined that we dreamed of it but that one 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.450
 should not call realistic 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.170
 from there it is scary round thing back then in the game 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.690
 all expected to offer limit euro yes I had managers 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.420
 on your own 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.730
 So who 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.780
 had to play the percent of time against Bayern Munich 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.770
 favorable 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.810
 we have many internationals in the opposing ranks the percent 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.930
 which is not in the training rhythm is the stuff we already have in the body 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.580
 in advantage 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.240
 but I also knew that a lot of this belongs to luck playing gameplay 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.670
 the game went so Bayern has the first big chance if the in there 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.090
 Maybe it's different 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.370
 he resumed her fantastic double whammy within us when 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.700
 bring right direction 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.430
 So much had to happen but we were not the better with her 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.710
 Team but it was not an undeserved victory after the bottom line 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.259
 Game Nama Langenau 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.700
 the beautiful Dutchwoman 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.410
 we have the boys Denmark 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.410
 yes, we will explain this in the round 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.610
 it is the moment where I came to all players shortly after the game yes that is 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.080
 our in the cinema in the offense field Feldes that is a very closed 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.310
 circle 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.259
 the eights are then heard short words to play use boys 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.690
 Storks come 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.330
 what you can do so on 4 4 open basis but is still here 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.650
 by the praise 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.130
 and at the same time yes to the feedback that it is 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.839
 that it is possible to beat Bayern 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.169
 also cup the atmosphere here 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.349
 to care for and what will give the future a lot of power Xavier 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.939
 Boog for money 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 For the whole team, this is not an Iran coach philosophy 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.979
 yes I am contact person not enough foot to pick up and 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.709
 communication services to give the travels feedback i 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.409
 Of course try as well 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:39.290
 Developing games that's important to me I see myself as a whole I see 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.329
 me as part of the team 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.329
 but you have to be around and the players know that even for clear 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.170
 Set up lines dpa Marco briefly the Respect person 15 years he stood on the 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.179
 Place 300 Bundesliga games 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.429
 he defended in Stuttgart and Nuremberg was announced in the 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.029
 uefa cup in Dortmund the bowl 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.029
 but most of the time he played for the lions 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.389
 The 93 players were living nearby 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.309
 since the games against Bayern Munich 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.479
 they all won games and ordered to stay even after the game was held 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.669
 therefore he had 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.799
 the successor is hoping to come into the world 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.479
 Professor Salerno people 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.399
 wants a family man Dr 

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:29.539
 how do you deal with your family living 400 kilometers away? 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.370
 who that is the dark side 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.289
 that's a thrilling so beautiful it's called percent 

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:37.979
 At times you are stressful 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:41.379
 That's just when the water benefits the job 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.599
 That's why I can also percent 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.599
 Heinke take distraction by the work but it is 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:51.789
 it is not what the percentages show or have as optimal there 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.339
 I believe that again 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:58.469
 To get to the top 15 that must be fine, Nabhan 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:01.959
 What follows is not 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.749
 I care fundamentally 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:06.779
 Manno with the editorial offices at the employer I have here 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:08.849
 around 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.759
 possible 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.759
 and the virus relatively quickly in the Betfair 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.099
 and I want to do that too 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.859
 I said that - that's proud 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.030
 like Geromel time allowed to lament this madness here
