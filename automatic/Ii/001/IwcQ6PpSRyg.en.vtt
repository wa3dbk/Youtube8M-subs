00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi dear viewers my name is arthur 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 do you listen to another podcast 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.189
 but in fact he is just another to me 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.990
 that it is dedicated to innovation on u tuba 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.300
 and the questions that you have on 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.340
 languages for probably a day 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.949
 I have asked and East times that I 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 decided to create what kind of video 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.310
 appeal in which actually tell 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.279
 about what is happening now and about what 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.930
 will happen soon 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.730
 let's go on the shelves ie yesterday or 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.980
 even the day before yesterday I do not know when exactly 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.399
 youtube introduced a new identification system 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.110
 content that has stalled finally 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.210
 youtube is generally focused with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 last probably a year and a half kill 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.590
 youtube I mean I'm already sitting on it 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 almost 4 years and i can see that in 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 the last time has gone already some kind 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.910
 just there regress frankly stagnation 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.789
 this is sad in my opinion because bosses and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 and dubai google boss and do not know why 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.510
 they do it they lose pretty 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.800
 impressive piece of cake i am comfortable in 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.539
 In principle, I think there will be soon. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.730
 any replacement because holy place 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.140
 empty does not happen 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.539
 oh well let's go back to ours 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.339
 rams so here is the new system 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:08.939
 identification of content on the tube 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.390
 so bad for us and as far as 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.670
 good for rights holders that notices 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 almost any music is valid if 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.979
 you play let's say in some flippers of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.110
 ace and suddenly somewhere away those in 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.689
 radio to turn on some songs 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.580
 there are about five seconds 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.380
 the identification system finds out about it and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.240
 find that we use someone else's 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.520
 content which in itself is of course stupid and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.540
 funny but nonetheless a fact 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.820
 At the moment, in principle, it is not 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.720
 scary and for the most part all solved 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 however, this system was supported by large 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.970
 publishers type activision electronics art 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.240
 and so at the moment I don't know I 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.820
 I think in the near future any 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.149
 the passage of the games of large companies 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.409
 have console holders 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.650
 just big publishers of the same type 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.860
 activision and there 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.810
 have say electronics artis again 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.740
 you should not wait 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.990
 just because they themselves do not want 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.759
 This developers from notch admissible 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.470
 the developers of the last office are open 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.500
 they say that I like to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.490
 our games earn though some 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.530
 Earnings in fact and in short 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:28.450
 generally speaking, such things are very 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:29.740
 damn it does not matter in general it is very serious 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 problem for those people who 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.530
 engaged in flysplay and gaming 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.660
 content in general but not very big 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.580
 The problem is essentially for me because I 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.390
 this is very easy to take first 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.070
 the second is the content itself as it is now 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.320
 fashionable to say who are spreading myself 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.850
 on the channel he is usually on the games 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.720
 indie developers themselves 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.670
 don't send 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.850
 games either agree to posting 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.650
 when let the recent stasis now 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.750
 which we pass underhill 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.430
 Underhill I keep in touch with 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.050
 developers they are ready to send me 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.970
 even cracker so that you have everything 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.420
 more understandable for you to see what 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.959
 In general, what the game is in short such 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.640
 affairs that is politics my channels have been 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.100
 always following horror 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.959
 we pass indie games and we pass old 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.140
 games in principle I think if we will 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.050
 continue to follow this direction 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.450
 then nothing will happen to us even if 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.700
 something happens something even if something 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.880
 something happens to me everything will be in 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 alright from with you so even though 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.600
 that many there really 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.519
 apocalyptic any thoughts and 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.800
 moods people running clutching 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.299
 head and beat against the wall but in essence 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:48.489
 nothing bad happened bad yes 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.600
 deadly no channel still 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.430
 worth 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.840
 however i would like to draw your attention 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.940
 the fact that coming somewhere around two three hours 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.260
 I advise those people who did not watch 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.170
 my old videos we which they 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.570
 interesting and download them to yourself yes 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.880
 see because soon 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.790
 will remove all previous content from 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.620
 channel mn 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.680
 than from scratch just to not 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.930
 risk there is a channel essentially these 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.880
 video they are very dear to me because well 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.970
 for three years i have been investing there 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.530
 force time and the output was getting very 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.870
 much support from you for what you 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.440
 thank you very much for making it and 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.050
 henceforth 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.289
 it will have to shake yourself off and 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.729
 move forward in general these are the cases 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.440
 I hope you treat this with 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.870
 understanding again nothing there 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.300
 critical of such straight wildly complex not 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.410
 just happened youtube once again 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.949
 showed that google 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.080
 he is such a google and yet it is not 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.880
 mortally we will move on now 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.190
 it will be more difficult but in principle 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.330
 doable so watch out for 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.210
 channel updates 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.199
 see you there was arthur all the best 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.199
 bye Bye Bye
