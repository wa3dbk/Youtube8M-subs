but um what I am changing up in my

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.020 
but um what I am changing up in my
routine<00:03:36.840> though<00:03:37.140> is<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> amount<00:03:38.550> of<00:03:38.700> reps

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
routine though is the amount of reps

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.540 
routine though is the amount of reps
that<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.330> do<00:03:39.450> with<00:03:39.990> each<00:03:40.140> set<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.770> I<00:03:41.160> might<00:03:41.370> up

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
that I do with each set and I might up

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.510 
that I do with each set and I might up
my<00:03:41.880> sets<00:03:42.150> also<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:43.290> before<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.890> was<00:03:44.130> doing

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
my sets also so before I was doing

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.430 
my sets also so before I was doing
around<00:03:44.730> eight<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.240> ten<00:03:45.480> trying<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.080> get<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.260> lot

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
of size on and now I'll probably be

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.400 
of size on and now I'll probably be
doing<00:03:49.260> around<00:03:49.620> 12<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.250> 15<00:03:50.760> per<00:03:51.060> set<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.600> might

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410
