00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Everyone needs them enough 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.549
 workspace but where should it be now? 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.899
 In addition, a microphone will be placed 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.400
 and so you just go inside 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.540
 can speak without any 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.730
 make contortions 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.110
 the answer to that is a microphone poor 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 and in this video we compare the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 low- microphone psa 1 from rohde with the ma 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 2050 of millennium 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.560
 Let's start with the psa 1 by rhode 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.330
 in the first moment one of the falls on the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.099
 Processing is high quality and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.689
 leaves absolutely nothing to be desired 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.099
 especially that completely 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.230
 high-quality metal is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.239
 it is a pity that the cable 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.460
 not about millennium outside the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.360
 must attach poor 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.090
 however, it is also remarkable 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.980
 that one does not screw a psa 1 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.410
 you have to tighten and still keep it in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.120
 the same position remains fixed 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 can the ps1 as well as the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.930
 millennium with the help of a clamp or 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.030
 by drilling in the table where the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 terminal also looks very high quality 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.120
 and do your service 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.980
 in direct comparison to the millennium 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.870
 however, the maximum extendable falls 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.359
 longer to criticize a little shorter 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.399
 However, that sps r1 was only one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.960
 has three eighths and one man 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.880
 a small adapter needed to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.430
 example, to connect the red safely 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.380
 but now we come to ma 20 50 of 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.520
 millennium in the reason it fulfills its 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.080
 order as micro 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.150
 however, there is a lot to it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 complain so the tripod is made to 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.240
 metal yet it seems very unstable and 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.040
 that's it too 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 it is necessary to put screws for fixing 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.759
 attract it so that it is bright and too 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.680
 turn the screw against 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.659
 attachment to the bracket is not 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.030
 optimally solved and the color dissolves 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 also fast from the metal flexible 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.689
 It is, however, despite everything and how 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.780
 with the psa 1 , the microphone can be synonymous 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.350
 attach over the head equal to three 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.180
 Attachment options include 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 Scope of delivery of the evening millennium 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.020
 so there are two fixed brackets for 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.790
 drill and a pinch, however 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.290
 not because of their small size 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.450
 is especially trustworthy 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.040
 positive notice, however, is that when 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.960
 millennium microphones already have in 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.000
 xlr cable in three meters length 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.070
 which is additionally supplied 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.259
 still in the same arm runs and so 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.149
 is optimally stored and hidden 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.219
 but what arm should you now be? 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.530
 Buy that is clearly a question 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.850
 your budget lies between the two 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.410
 a very large price range 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.209
 that's what the millennium evening is all about 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.550
 for about 30 to 40 euros 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.610
 while you double for the ps1 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.560
 have to pay about 80 to 90 euros with 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.840
 We recommend a sufficient budget 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 you though the high psa 1 but also the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.050
 millenium arm does its duty and is 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.760
 for his price to be recommended 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.170
 of course, you can find both arms in the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.940
 video description linked and can 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.200
 They buy there also directly table 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.120
 By the way, tripods are a good one 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 possibility to set up your microphone 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.390
 and this is what we do on our right 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.340
 above linked video or sown 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.680
 just below our review ceo the nts 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.540
 to a very good big brown too 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.160
 microphone with the among others this one 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.569
 video was also just recorded 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.459
