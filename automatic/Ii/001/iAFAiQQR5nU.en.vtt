ok<00:00:01.050> there's<00:00:01.530> my<00:00:02.100> spelling<00:00:02.580> engine<00:00:02.879> running<00:00:03.449> on

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
ok there's my spelling engine running on

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.820 
ok there's my spelling engine running on
an<00:00:04.650> ice<00:00:04.859> pack<00:00:05.600> it's<00:00:06.600> just<00:00:07.020> starting<00:00:07.379> up<00:00:07.500> so

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
an ice pack it's just starting up so

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.379 
an ice pack it's just starting up so
it's<00:00:07.980> getting<00:00:08.189> pretty<00:00:08.370> slow<00:00:08.790> but<00:00:09.030> after<00:00:09.360> a

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
it's getting pretty slow but after a

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.360 
it's getting pretty slow but after a
couple<00:00:10.050> seconds<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.769> actually<00:00:11.070> speed<00:00:11.340> up

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
couple seconds for the actually speed up

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.570 
couple seconds for the actually speed up
I<00:00:12.139> would<00:00:13.139> run<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.920> sunlight<00:00:14.849> for<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.269> but

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
I would run it on sunlight for you but

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.580 
I would run it on sunlight for you but
unfortunately<00:00:17.580> there's<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.930> Sun<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.380> right

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
unfortunately there's this Sun out right

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.040 
unfortunately there's this Sun out right
now<00:00:20.029> well<00:00:21.029> coming<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.570> through<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.779> window<00:00:22.020> I

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
now well coming in through the window I

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.269 
now well coming in through the window I
don't<00:00:22.230> want<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> take<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.650> outside<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.980> put<00:00:23.189> on

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
don't want to take it outside and put on

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.370 
don't want to take it outside and put on
the<00:00:23.400> ground<00:00:23.609> because<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.570> acrylic<00:00:25.050> scratch

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the ground because the acrylic scratch

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.450 
the ground because the acrylic scratch
is<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:25.830> easy<00:00:27.830> it<00:00:28.830> wouldn't<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> great

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
is really easy it wouldn't be that great

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.900 
is really easy it wouldn't be that great
to<00:00:29.730> look<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:30.060> any<00:00:30.480> more<00:00:30.689> butter<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:32.759> it's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to look at any more butter and now it's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.200 
to look at any more butter and now it's
starting<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.270> speed<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:34.820> get<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> better<00:00:36.059> look

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
starting to speed up get a better look

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.090 
starting to speed up get a better look
at<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:39.079> flywheel<00:00:40.079> doesn't<00:00:40.379> wobble<00:00:40.530> week<00:00:40.920> at

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
at it flywheel doesn't wobble week at

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.540 
at it flywheel doesn't wobble week at
all<00:00:41.340> anymore<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.329> fix<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:45.890> but<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.219> will<00:00:47.399> go

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
all anymore I fix it but it will go

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
all anymore I fix it but it will go
pretty<00:00:47.700> fast<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.210> think<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.629> had<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.110> like

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
pretty fast I think I had it like

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.119 
pretty fast I think I had it like
running<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.950> 60<00:00:50.460> RPM<00:00:50.610> well<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> don't<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
running at 60 RPM well I don't have a

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.000 
running at 60 RPM well I don't have a
one<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> those<00:00:53.280> meters<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.230> am<00:00:55.230> used<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> stop

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
one of those meters so I am used to stop

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.689 
one of those meters so I am used to stop
watch<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:57.090> counted<00:00:57.980> how<00:00:58.980> many<00:00:59.010> revolutions

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
watch and I counted how many revolutions

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.009 
watch and I counted how many revolutions
and<00:01:00.350> I<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.649> about<00:01:01.980> 60<00:01:02.579> RPM<00:01:02.760> off<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> heat

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and I got about 60 RPM off of the heat

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
and I got about 60 RPM off of the heat
of<00:01:04.170> my<00:01:04.229> hand<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.640> was<00:01:05.760> actually<00:01:05.909> pretty

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
of my hand so that was actually pretty

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:15.830 
of my hand so that was actually pretty
cool<00:01:07.369> where<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:09.530> ya<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:13.010> all<00:01:14.010> right<00:01:14.310> we'll<00:01:14.840> set

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
cool where are ya so all right we'll set

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.010 
cool where are ya so all right we'll set
down<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.080> camera<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> second<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.750> let<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
down the camera in a second and let that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.240 
down the camera in a second and let that
run<00:01:20.299> there<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.560> something<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> put<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
run there we got something to put the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.010 
run there we got something to put the
camera<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.610> quickly

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.840 

too<00:01:32.020> far<00:01:32.260> so<00:01:33.299> they're<00:01:34.299> ok<00:01:35.140> I<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:36.610> let<00:01:36.820> that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
too far so they're ok I will let that

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:44.280 
too far so they're ok I will let that
run<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:39.040> should<00:01:39.909> speed<00:01:40.450> up<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:44.020> could

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
run and it should speed up and you could

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.999 
run and it should speed up and you could
see<00:01:44.860> there<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.280> should<00:01:45.460> be<00:01:45.610> able<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.909> see<00:01:46.149> how

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
see there you should be able to see how

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.010 
see there you should be able to see how
it<00:01:48.009> works<00:01:48.369> it's<00:01:48.990> set<00:01:49.990> 90<00:01:50.770> degrees<00:01:51.509> off<00:01:52.509> the

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it works it's set 90 degrees off the

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.930 
it works it's set 90 degrees off the
both<00:01:53.920> cranks<00:01:54.369> so<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.840> will<00:01:55.960> rise<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:56.530> then

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
both cranks so one will rise and then

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.109 
both cranks so one will rise and then
the<00:01:57.940> other<00:01:57.970> will<00:01:58.330> rise<00:01:59.190> like<00:02:00.190> right<00:02:00.460> after<00:02:00.640> I

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
the other will rise like right after I

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.980 
the other will rise like right after I
don't<00:02:01.990> know<00:02:02.050> if<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.229> could<00:02:02.380> tell<00:02:02.590> but<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
don't know if you could tell but you

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.009 
don't know if you could tell but you
should<00:02:05.920> be<00:02:05.950> able<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.369> see<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> displacer

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
should be able to see that the displacer

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.310 
should be able to see that the displacer
Rises<00:02:08.530> and<00:02:08.739> then<00:02:09.640> when<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> rises<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.899> piston

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
Rises and then when it rises the piston

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.940 
Rises and then when it rises the piston
will<00:02:11.769> go<00:02:12.640> down<00:02:12.850> because<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:14.140> all<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.590> arrow<00:02:14.739> we

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
will go down because it all the arrow we

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.190 
will go down because it all the arrow we
at<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.220> bottom<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:16.269> know<00:02:16.300> contract<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.110> I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
at the bottom you know contract like I

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.490 
at the bottom you know contract like I
was<00:02:17.319> talking<00:02:17.650> about<00:02:17.709> my<00:02:17.860> previous<00:02:18.220> video<00:02:18.730> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
was talking about my previous video and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.820 
was talking about my previous video and
as<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.090> displacer<00:02:22.660> drops<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.470> piston

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
as it the displacer drops the piston

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.140 
as it the displacer drops the piston
will<00:02:23.920> go<00:02:24.040> up<00:02:24.250> because<00:02:24.430> all<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.910> air<00:02:25.120> is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
will go up because all that air is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.930 
will go up because all that air is
rising<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.260> hot<00:02:26.500> plate<00:02:26.800> which<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> top

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
rising to the hot plate which is the top

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.819 
rising to the hot plate which is the top
one<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.269> this<00:02:28.360> case<00:02:31.049> but<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.380> does<00:02:32.560> run<00:02:32.769> pretty

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
one in this case but it does run pretty

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.740 
one in this case but it does run pretty
fast<00:02:33.160> off<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.760> sunlight<00:02:34.120> if<00:02:34.390> there<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:35.230> lot

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
fast off of sunlight if there is a lot

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.539 
fast off of sunlight if there is a lot
so<00:02:37.750> that's<00:02:38.440> actually<00:02:38.890> pretty<00:02:39.010> cool<00:02:39.130> but

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
so that's actually pretty cool but

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.850 
so that's actually pretty cool but
unfortunately<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.079> said<00:02:41.260> before<00:02:41.290> no

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
unfortunately as I said before no

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.319 
unfortunately as I said before no
sunlight<00:02:42.130> so<00:02:43.410> yeah<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.680> got<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.340> ice<00:02:46.030> pack<00:02:46.299> for

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
sunlight so yeah I got a ice pack for

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.210 
sunlight so yeah I got a ice pack for
you<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.019> don't<00:02:47.170> have<00:02:47.320> any<00:02:47.530> chemical<00:02:48.010> hand

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
you and I don't have any chemical hand

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.759 
you and I don't have any chemical hand
warmers<00:02:48.579> or<00:02:48.700> something<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.180> and<00:02:49.769> I

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
warmers or something like that and I

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.229 
warmers or something like that and I
don't<00:02:50.799> feel<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.160> running<00:02:51.430> downstairs<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
don't feel like running downstairs to

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.759 
don't feel like running downstairs to
that<00:02:52.390> big<00:02:52.600> cup<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> water<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.010> boil<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:57.280> uh

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
that big cup of water and boil it but uh

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.140 
that big cup of water and boil it but uh
you<00:02:59.769> should<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.190> idea<00:03:00.459> off<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.609> ice<00:03:00.850> pack

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
you should get the idea off the ice pack

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.420 
you should get the idea off the ice pack
and<00:03:01.359> it<00:03:02.049> will<00:03:02.170> run<00:03:02.350> for<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.650> long<00:03:02.859> time<00:03:03.130> even

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
and it will run for a long time even

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:29.870 
and it will run for a long time even
after<00:03:03.760> i<00:03:03.940> take<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.630> off<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.870> ice<00:03:04.989> pack<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:08.670> yeah

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.390 

you<00:03:30.840> should<00:03:31.050> be<00:03:31.110> able<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.410> see<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.740> 90<00:03:32.070> degrees

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
you should be able to see the 90 degrees

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.320 
you should be able to see the 90 degrees
with<00:03:32.820> the<00:03:33.000> Kranks<00:03:33.780> up<00:03:33.930> here<00:03:34.820> ones<00:03:35.820> attached<00:03:36.150> to

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
with the Kranks up here ones attached to

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.670 
with the Kranks up here ones attached to
the<00:03:36.450> flywheel<00:03:36.900> once<00:03:37.170> attached<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.800> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
the flywheel once attached to the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.350 
the flywheel once attached to the
crankshaft<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:43.490> this<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.970> would<00:03:45.150> be<00:03:45.270> the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
crankshaft and this is this would be the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.230 
crankshaft and this is this would be the
power<00:03:45.540> piston<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.730> this<00:03:47.730> would<00:03:47.940> be<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
power piston and this would be the

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.080 
power piston and this would be the
displacer

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.559 

I<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.840> tried<00:03:58.080> making<00:03:58.500> one<00:03:58.650> of<00:03:58.680> these<00:03:58.830> out<00:03:59.160> of

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
I have tried making one of these out of

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.550 
I have tried making one of these out of
scraps<00:04:00.569> like<00:04:00.959> tin<00:04:01.440> cans<00:04:01.739> and<00:04:02.160> foam<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.560> CDs

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
scraps like tin cans and foam and CDs

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.170 
scraps like tin cans and foam and CDs
and<00:04:04.890> a<00:04:04.950> lot<00:04:05.239> but<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.900> haven't<00:04:07.530> been<00:04:07.769> able<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.610> get

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and a lot but I haven't been able to get

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.839 
and a lot but I haven't been able to get
this<00:04:09.510> part<00:04:09.870> shield<00:04:10.560> completely<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.580> that<00:04:11.610> it

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
this part shield completely so that it

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.569 
this part shield completely so that it
would<00:04:11.970> look<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:13.230> don't<00:04:13.410> have<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.250> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
would look and I don't have is it the

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.719 
would look and I don't have is it the
heat<00:04:17.790> resistant<00:04:20.870> adhesive<00:04:21.870> so<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.650> wasn't<00:04:23.639> able

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
heat resistant adhesive so I wasn't able

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.730 
heat resistant adhesive so I wasn't able
to<00:04:24.500> completely<00:04:25.500> seal<00:04:25.860> up<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:27.740> displacer

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
to completely seal up the displacer

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.760 
to completely seal up the displacer
without<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.580> leaking<00:04:29.820> because<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.720> used<00:04:31.139> on<00:04:31.410> hot

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
without it leaking because I used on hot

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.400 
without it leaking because I used on hot
glue<00:04:32.070> which<00:04:32.370> seals<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.850> really<00:04:33.060> good<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.510> at

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
glue which seals it really good but at

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.320 
glue which seals it really good but at
the<00:04:34.590> temperatures<00:04:35.040> it<00:04:35.250> needs<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.610> run<00:04:35.790> it

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
the temperatures it needs to run it

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.040 
the temperatures it needs to run it
would<00:04:36.540> melt<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.650> would<00:04:37.830> make<00:04:38.220> it<00:04:38.280> leak

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
would melt so that would make it leak

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.219 
would melt so that would make it leak
and<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:41.400> couldn't<00:04:41.700> find<00:04:41.940> anything<00:04:42.360> to<00:04:42.660> use<00:04:42.720> as<00:04:43.200> a

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
and I couldn't find anything to use as a

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.420 
and I couldn't find anything to use as a
power<00:04:43.620> piston<00:04:45.200> really<00:04:46.200> except<00:04:46.710> for<00:04:46.950> that

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
power piston really except for that

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.200 
power piston really except for that
balloon<00:04:47.910> type<00:04:48.300> kind<00:04:49.139> of<00:04:49.260> thing<00:04:49.440> which<00:04:49.590> got<00:04:49.950> the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
balloon type kind of thing which got the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.680 
balloon type kind of thing which got the
diaphragm<00:04:51.410> instead<00:04:52.410> of<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.560> piston<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.690> tried

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
diaphragm instead of a piston I tried

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.450 
diaphragm instead of a piston I tried
that<00:04:54.720> but<00:04:55.199> I<00:04:55.260> couldn't<00:04:55.650> get<00:04:55.770> it<00:04:55.919> to<00:04:56.039> run<00:04:56.220> I

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
that but I couldn't get it to run I

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.950 
that but I couldn't get it to run I
don't<00:04:56.910> know<00:04:57.000> why<00:04:59.030> so<00:05:00.030> basically<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.720> haven't

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
don't know why so basically I haven't

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
don't know why so basically I haven't
gotten<00:05:01.110> one<00:05:01.229> or<00:05:01.440> unsuccessful<00:05:02.160> yet<00:05:03.680> but<00:05:04.680> uh

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
gotten one or unsuccessful yet but uh

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.550 
gotten one or unsuccessful yet but uh
yeah<00:05:05.940> I'll<00:05:06.240> take<00:05:06.510> this<00:05:06.690> off<00:05:06.930> now<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.470> can

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
yeah I'll take this off now and you can

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:20.420 
yeah I'll take this off now and you can
see<00:05:07.770> how<00:05:07.800> long<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.220> runs<00:05:08.460> ok<00:05:16.669> so<00:05:19.400> watch<00:05:20.400> that

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
see how long it runs ok so watch that

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:34.470 
see how long it runs ok so watch that
run

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.250 

get<00:05:35.200> you<00:05:35.470> from<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.860> back<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:38.020> will<00:05:38.110> actually

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
get you from the back it will actually

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:47.250 
get you from the back it will actually
run<00:05:38.560> for<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:38.890> long<00:05:39.040> time

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.440 

and<00:05:47.470> that<00:05:48.130> clicking<00:05:48.640> is<00:05:48.880> from<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:51.450> power

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
and that clicking is from the power

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.740 
and that clicking is from the power
piston<00:05:52.920> because<00:05:53.920> there's<00:05:54.250> a-rod<00:05:54.880> coming<00:05:55.450> out

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
piston because there's a-rod coming out

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.900 
piston because there's a-rod coming out
of<00:05:55.780> it<00:05:56.020> which<00:05:56.650> attaches<00:05:57.010> to<00:05:57.250> the<00:05:57.490> connecting

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
of it which attaches to the connecting

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.050 
of it which attaches to the connecting
rod<00:05:58.090> and<00:05:58.330> that<00:05:59.320> hole<00:05:59.560> is<00:05:59.890> a<00:05:59.950> little<00:06:00.670> tiny<00:06:00.910> bit

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
rod and that hole is a little tiny bit

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.760 
rod and that hole is a little tiny bit
bigger<00:06:01.600> in<00:06:01.810> the<00:06:01.870> connecting<00:06:02.440> rod<00:06:02.620> will

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
bigger in the connecting rod will

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.580 
bigger in the connecting rod will
actually<00:06:03.130> move<00:06:03.310> up<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:03.670> down<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:03.880> little<00:06:04.180> bit

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
actually move up and down a little bit

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.650 
actually move up and down a little bit
inside<00:06:05.590> that<00:06:05.890> hole<00:06:06.270> that's<00:06:07.270> what<00:06:07.510> that

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
inside that hole that's what that

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:19.260 
inside that hole that's what that
clicking<00:06:08.050> is<00:06:13.260> yeah<00:06:16.260> so<00:06:17.760> you<00:06:18.760> don't<00:06:18.880> look<00:06:19.090> at

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
clicking is yeah so you don't look at

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:25.290 
clicking is yeah so you don't look at

that if you see that in there then the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.760 
that if you see that in there then the
displacer<00:06:26.290> wad<00:06:26.470> there<00:06:27.280> isn't<00:06:27.520> much<00:06:27.550> space<00:06:28.030> so

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
displacer wad there isn't much space so

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.580 
displacer wad there isn't much space so
Oh<00:06:30.300> in<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.420> power<00:06:31.630> piston<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:32.080> clicker<00:06:32.380> is

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
Oh in the power piston that clicker is

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:34.890 
Oh in the power piston that clicker is
also<00:06:32.890> from<00:06:33.100> it<00:06:33.400> moving<00:06:33.820> up<00:06:33.970> and<00:06:34.060> down<00:06:34.180> before

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
also from it moving up and down before

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.630 
also from it moving up and down before
the<00:06:35.020> connecting<00:06:35.380> rasta<00:06:35.740> connecting<00:06:36.430> on<00:06:36.550> it

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:36.640 
the connecting rasta connecting on it

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.610 
the connecting rasta connecting on it
does<00:06:39.180> then<00:06:40.180> you've<00:06:40.330> got<00:06:40.540> the<00:06:40.750> firewheel<00:06:41.440> and

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
does then you've got the firewheel and

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.860 
does then you've got the firewheel and
you<00:06:41.710> can<00:06:41.830> see<00:06:42.010> how<00:06:42.100> that<00:06:42.280> doesn't<00:06:42.580> wobble

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
you can see how that doesn't wobble

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.760 
you can see how that doesn't wobble
anymore<00:06:45.450> if<00:06:46.450> you<00:06:46.690> do<00:06:46.870> see<00:06:47.050> it's<00:06:47.170> like<00:06:47.350> lava<00:06:47.590> was

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
anymore if you do see it's like lava was

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.140
