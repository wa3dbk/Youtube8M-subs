00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
go straight into the water instead let's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.650 
go straight into the water instead let's
talk<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.390> little<00:00:53.420> bit<00:00:53.630> first<00:00:55.090> this<00:00:56.090> other

moment<00:00:57.110> is<00:00:57.940> quite<00:00:58.940> dry<00:00:59.860> possibly<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.550> last

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
moment is quite dry possibly the last

moment is quite dry possibly the last
one<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.210> water<00:01:02.949> would<00:01:03.949> have<00:01:04.040> been<00:01:04.190> yesterday

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
one the water would have been yesterday

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.540 
one the water would have been yesterday
or<00:01:05.449> two<00:01:05.720> days<00:01:05.900> before<00:01:06.170> turn<00:01:06.830> by<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.190> how<00:01:07.340> dry

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
or two days before turn by and how dry

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.719 
or two days before turn by and how dry
as<00:01:07.729> balsa<00:01:08.119> has<00:01:08.210> been<00:01:08.360> quite<00:01:08.810> hot<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:10.430> can<00:01:10.610> go

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
as balsa has been quite hot so we can go

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.880 
as balsa has been quite hot so we can go
and<00:01:10.850> ride<00:01:11.030> quite<00:01:11.330> quickly<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:12.410> then<00:01:12.590> further

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
and ride quite quickly and then further

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.080 
and ride quite quickly and then further
I<00:01:13.009> go<00:01:13.190> down<00:01:13.399> it<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.759> bit<00:01:14.000> more<00:01:15.550> wet<00:01:16.550> but<00:01:16.940> it's

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
I go down it is a bit more wet but it's

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.620 
I go down it is a bit more wet but it's
not

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
not

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.070 
not
I'd<00:01:18.259> say<00:01:18.530> it's<00:01:18.710> not<00:01:18.860> wet<00:01:19.070> enough<00:01:20.080> basically

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
I'd say it's not wet enough basically

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:30.430 
I'd say it's not wet enough basically
the<00:01:21.350> stand<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:26.170> my<00:01:27.170> heavy<00:01:27.820> I'd<00:01:28.820> say<00:01:29.440> it's

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
the stand with my heavy I'd say it's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.719 
the stand with my heavy I'd say it's
just<00:01:31.630> lightly<00:01:34.420> around<00:01:35.420> yeah<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:37.490> sure<00:01:37.520> you

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
just lightly around yeah make sure you

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.770 
just lightly around yeah make sure you
get<00:01:37.789> all<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.710> bits

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
get all the bits

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.170 
get all the bits
nice<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.200> wet<00:01:41.350> and<00:01:43.380> doesn't<00:01:44.380> overflow<00:01:45.180> too

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
nice and wet and doesn't overflow too

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.830 
nice and wet and doesn't overflow too
much

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
much

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.520 
much
then<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> should<00:01:47.830> soak<00:01:48.070> down<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.530> usually

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
then I should soak down in and usually

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.660 
then I should soak down in and usually
at<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.740> point<00:01:51.060> wait<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.720> see<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.490> comes

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
at that point wait to see if it comes

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.780 
at that point wait to see if it comes
out<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.030> bottom<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:56.890> probably<00:01:57.220> won't<00:01:57.490> do

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
out the bottom but you probably won't do

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.330 
out the bottom but you probably won't do
with<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.090> one<00:01:58.649> when<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.770> does<00:01:59.950> come<00:02:00.159> out<00:02:00.280> the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
with this one when it does come out the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.289 
with this one when it does come out the
bottom<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:04.180> mostly<00:02:04.479> watered<00:02:05.259> enough

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
bottom then it's mostly watered enough

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.809 
bottom then it's mostly watered enough
this<00:02:07.299> is<00:02:07.360> if<00:02:07.930> it's<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.200> hot<00:02:08.380> day<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.920> water<00:02:09.670> it

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
this is if it's a hot day I water it

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.820 
this is if it's a hot day I water it
again<00:02:10.149> if<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.539> hasn't<00:02:10.750> quite<00:02:11.020> bottom<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:11.650> it's

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
again if it hasn't quite bottom if it's

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.640 
again if it hasn't quite bottom if it's
just<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.160> standard<00:02:12.930> day<00:02:13.930> and<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.230> think<00:02:14.470> I'll

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
just a standard day and you think I'll

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.800 
just a standard day and you think I'll
husband<00:02:14.980> once<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> while<00:02:15.700> then<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.570> surface

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
husband once in a while then the surface

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.380 
husband once in a while then the surface
water<00:02:17.200> could<00:02:17.530> probably<00:02:17.709> be<00:02:18.100> enough

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
water could probably be enough

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.090 
water could probably be enough

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
a root rot which we actually encountered

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.360 
a root rot which we actually encountered
on<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.319> few<00:02:32.769> plants<00:02:33.010> last<00:02:33.340> year<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.390> have

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
on a few plants last year and I have

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.500 
on a few plants last year and I have
actually<00:02:36.370> got<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.819> which<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:38.560> getting<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:39.510> due

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
actually got one which is getting it due

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.050 
actually got one which is getting it due
to<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.989> roofs<00:02:41.200> not<00:02:41.290> expanding<00:02:41.950> properly<00:02:42.340> into

the pot and they're just staying in one
location<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:45.489> getting<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.820> damp<00:02:46.500> this

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
location and just getting to damp this

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.800 
location and just getting to damp this
will<00:02:48.190> cause<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.459> leaves<00:02:48.910> to<00:02:49.360> start<00:02:49.600> going

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
will cause the leaves to start going

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.370 
will cause the leaves to start going
brown<00:02:51.390> there<00:02:52.390> are<00:02:52.540> everything's<00:02:52.989> exposed

brown there are everything's exposed
leaves<00:02:53.920> get<00:02:54.100> brown<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.549> over<00:02:55.120> use<00:02:56.019> of

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
leaves get brown like over use of

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.470 
leaves get brown like over use of
nitrogen<00:02:56.500> for<00:02:57.010> example<00:02:57.489> under<00:02:58.120> use<00:02:58.360> of

nitrogen for example under use of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.630 
nitrogen for example under use of
nitrogen<00:02:58.630> would<00:02:59.019> make<00:02:59.200> them<00:02:59.320> go<00:02:59.470> yellow

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.870 

well<00:03:03.240> that's<00:03:03.420> pretty<00:03:03.660> much<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:05.400> they're

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
well that's pretty much it they're

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.800 
well that's pretty much it they're
coming<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:07.020> it<00:03:07.110> needs<00:03:07.290> generally<00:03:08.810> every

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
coming for you it needs generally every

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.300 
coming for you it needs generally every
time<00:03:10.020> they<00:03:10.170> wear<00:03:10.410> out<00:03:10.590> sometimes<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.220> to

fire<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.690> number<00:03:41.020> two<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:42.010> reason<00:03:42.340> for<00:03:42.520> this<00:03:42.760> is

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
fire a number two the reason for this is

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.430 
fire a number two the reason for this is
because<00:03:44.280> some<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.400> leaves<00:03:46.260> where<00:03:47.260> I'm

possibly be edema which is a cause of
too<00:03:58.900> much<00:03:59.050> water<00:03:59.400> and<00:04:00.400> leaving<00:04:00.730> it<00:04:01.030> lying<00:04:01.569> in

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
too much water and leaving it lying in

too much water and leaving it lying in
the<00:04:01.989> bottom<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.100> tray<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:04.510> I'd<00:04:04.599> suggest<00:04:04.959> to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
the bottom of a tray so I'd suggest to

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.300 
the bottom of a tray so I'd suggest to
not<00:04:05.230> leave<00:04:05.410> it<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.739> bottom<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.099> tray

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
not leave it in the bottom of the tray

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.920 
not leave it in the bottom of the tray
unless<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:07.000> like<00:04:07.120> a<00:04:07.150> really<00:04:07.390> hot<00:04:07.780> day<00:04:09.540> or<00:04:10.540> for

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
unless it's like a really hot day or for

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
unless it's like a really hot day or for
more<00:04:11.170> than<00:04:11.380> an<00:04:11.500> hour<00:04:11.620> really<00:04:12.310> ideally<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.980> yeah

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
more than an hour really ideally so yeah

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.449 
more than an hour really ideally so yeah
I<00:04:16.090> suppose<00:04:16.720> we're<00:04:16.870> gonna<00:04:16.930> move<00:04:17.139> on<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.560> further

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
I suppose we're gonna move on to further

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.320 
I suppose we're gonna move on to further
watering<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:20.070> how<00:04:21.070> that's<00:04:21.459> gonna<00:04:21.609> be<00:04:21.669> done<00:04:21.910> so

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
watering and how that's gonna be done so

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.240

has been done couple weeks the reason

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.370 
has been done couple weeks the reason
for<00:04:51.850> this<00:04:52.000> is<00:04:52.330> that<00:04:52.390> when<00:04:52.930> you<00:04:52.960> use

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
for this is that when you use

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.860 
for this is that when you use
fertilizers<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.520> plant<00:04:54.789> takes<00:04:55.180> up<00:04:55.419> the<00:04:55.539> parts

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.480 

yes<00:05:16.230> it<00:05:16.470> is<00:05:16.590> absolutely<00:05:16.830> pouring<00:05:17.490> out<00:05:17.820> awesome

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
yes it is absolutely pouring out awesome

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.530 
yes it is absolutely pouring out awesome
taking<00:05:20.490> me<00:05:20.580> to<00:05:20.760> go<00:05:20.880> through<00:05:22.700> but<00:05:23.700> we<00:05:24.240> went<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.480> a

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
taking me to go through but we went to a

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.470 
taking me to go through but we went to a
garden<00:05:24.690> center<00:05:25.170> and<00:05:25.200> they<00:05:25.380> said<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:26.460> it<00:05:27.210> were

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
garden center and they said that it were

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.080 
garden center and they said that it were
could<00:05:28.020> just<00:05:28.290> be<00:05:28.410> limescale<00:05:28.920> from<00:05:29.370> house<00:05:29.820> water

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
could just be limescale from house water

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.750 
could just be limescale from house water
whatever<00:05:30.750> but<00:05:31.110> for<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.920> chemistry<00:05:32.310> soon<00:05:32.580> I

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
whatever but for the chemistry soon I

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.730 
whatever but for the chemistry soon I
knew<00:05:32.940> how<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.150> do<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.600> test<00:05:33.900> between<00:05:34.650> the

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
knew how to do a test between the

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.680 
knew how to do a test between the
difference<00:05:35.070> between<00:05:35.190> lime<00:05:35.490> scale<00:05:35.820> and<00:05:36.180> salt

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
difference between lime scale and salt

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.290 
difference between lime scale and salt
so<00:05:37.200> they<00:05:37.260> put<00:05:37.440> some<00:05:37.560> acid<00:05:37.680> on<00:05:37.950> it<00:05:37.980> and<00:05:38.370> it<00:05:39.270> just

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
so they put some acid on it and it just

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.300 
so they put some acid on it and it just
dissolved<00:05:39.930> did<00:05:40.200> bubble<00:05:40.470> salt<00:05:42.410> if<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.530> usually

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
dissolved did bubble salt if you usually

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.790 
dissolved did bubble salt if you usually
see<00:05:44.700> it<00:05:44.760> if<00:05:44.940> you<00:05:45.120> growing<00:05:45.630> in<00:05:45.780> a<00:05:46.140> pot<00:05:46.350> and<00:05:46.590> doors

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
see it if you growing in a pot and doors

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.960 
see it if you growing in a pot and doors
on<00:05:46.980> a<00:05:47.010> tray<00:05:47.310> and<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:48.180> trach<00:05:48.570> is<00:05:48.720> covered<00:05:49.110> in<00:05:49.230> a

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
on a tray and the trach is covered in a

00:05:49.970 --> 00:06:03.050 
on a tray and the trach is covered in a
sort<00:05:50.970> of<00:05:51.030> yellowy<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.660> know<00:05:52.970> salt<00:05:54.800> yeah<00:06:01.460> well<00:06:02.460> we

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 
sort of yellowy I know salt yeah well we

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.720 
sort of yellowy I know salt yeah well we
found<00:06:03.330> that<00:06:03.420> the<00:06:03.540> salt<00:06:03.840> buildup<00:06:04.520> tends<00:06:05.520> to

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
found that the salt buildup tends to

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:10.190 
found that the salt buildup tends to
stop<00:06:06.060> plans<00:06:08.060> just<00:06:09.060> has<00:06:09.210> a<00:06:09.240> general

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
stop plans just has a general

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.360 
stop plans just has a general
deterioration<00:06:12.800> so<00:06:13.800> that's<00:06:13.920> probably<00:06:14.190> it<00:06:14.340> for

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370 
deterioration so that's probably it for

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.040 
deterioration so that's probably it for
that<00:06:16.160> should<00:06:17.160> be<00:06:17.220> washed<00:06:17.430> out<00:06:17.610> but<00:06:18.090> usually

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
that should be washed out but usually

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.350 
that should be washed out but usually
you<00:06:19.620> don't<00:06:19.770> do<00:06:19.980> this<00:06:20.160> as<00:06:20.550> it'll<00:06:20.970> just<00:06:21.120> keep<00:06:21.240> the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
you don't do this as it'll just keep the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.330 
you don't do this as it'll just keep the
plant<00:06:21.540> far<00:06:21.780> too<00:06:21.990> wet<00:06:22.140> so<00:06:22.170> she's<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:22.920> hot<00:06:23.130> bay

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
plant far too wet so she's a hot bay

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.570 
plant far too wet so she's a hot bay
where<00:06:23.640> it's<00:06:23.760> gonna<00:06:23.910> dry<00:06:24.390> out<00:06:24.420> again<00:06:24.570> quickly

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:28.580 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:35.720 

anything<00:06:29.580> else<00:06:29.700> so<00:06:30.620> only<00:06:31.620> that<00:06:34.310> after<00:06:35.310> you've

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
anything else so only that after you've

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.600 
anything else so only that after you've
done<00:06:36.210> the<00:06:36.420> run-through<00:06:36.800> I'd<00:06:37.800> say<00:06:38.160> about<00:06:38.250> two

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
done the run-through I'd say about two

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.270 
done the run-through I'd say about two
days<00:06:38.760> after<00:06:39.300> a<00:06:39.330> new<00:06:40.070> layer<00:06:41.070> of<00:06:41.100> fertilizer<00:06:41.790> on

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
days after a new layer of fertilizer on

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.000 
days after a new layer of fertilizer on
one<00:06:44.280> out<00:06:44.640> for<00:06:44.780> have<00:06:45.780> one<00:06:45.960> of<00:06:46.110> one<00:06:46.590> of<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:46.830> ones

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
one out for have one of one of the ones

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.250 
one out for have one of one of the ones
that<00:06:47.310> are<00:06:47.610> in<00:06:47.760> the<00:06:47.790> essentials<00:06:48.660> video<00:06:48.960> I

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
that are in the essentials video I

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.510 
that are in the essentials video I
basically<00:06:50.210> use<00:06:51.210> a<00:06:51.240> one<00:06:52.080> of<00:06:52.170> either<00:06:52.680> the<00:06:53.040> liquid

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
basically use a one of either the liquid

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.040 
basically use a one of either the liquid
fertilizer<00:06:54.390> or<00:06:54.720> the<00:06:54.930> solid<00:06:55.500> one<00:06:56.750> which<00:06:57.750> you

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
fertilizer or the solid one which you

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.110 
fertilizer or the solid one which you
just<00:06:58.410> palms<00:06:58.770> at<00:06:58.980> the<00:06:59.040> top<00:06:59.280> and<00:06:59.580> then<00:06:59.760> basically

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
just palms at the top and then basically

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.810 
just palms at the top and then basically
you<00:07:00.360> start<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.900> cycle<00:07:01.620> over<00:07:01.980> again<00:07:02.130> and<00:07:02.760> the

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
you start the cycle over again and the

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.000 
you start the cycle over again and the
plant<00:07:03.060> will<00:07:03.240> use<00:07:03.510> that<00:07:03.810> and<00:07:04.380> then<00:07:04.500> about<00:07:04.770> two

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
plant will use that and then about two

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.940 
plant will use that and then about two
weeks<00:07:05.250> or<00:07:05.490> sometimes<00:07:05.940> even<00:07:06.030> up<00:07:06.240> to<00:07:06.390> a<00:07:06.420> month

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
weeks or sometimes even up to a month

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.880 
weeks or sometimes even up to a month
depending<00:07:07.950> on<00:07:08.520> oh<00:07:09.350> yeah<00:07:10.350> how<00:07:10.530> much<00:07:10.650> fertilizer

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
depending on oh yeah how much fertilizer

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.670 
depending on oh yeah how much fertilizer
you<00:07:11.250> might<00:07:11.490> use<00:07:11.730> and<00:07:12.120> how<00:07:12.780> dry<00:07:13.140> it<00:07:13.170> is<00:07:13.380> in<00:07:13.560> your

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
you might use and how dry it is in your

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.100 
you might use and how dry it is in your
area<00:07:13.950> and<00:07:14.040> size<00:07:14.280> of<00:07:14.430> plant<00:07:14.610> yet<00:07:14.960> so<00:07:15.960> that's

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:16.110 
area and size of plant yet so that's

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.800 
area and size of plant yet so that's
that's<00:07:16.950> basically<00:07:17.190> it<00:07:17.670> if<00:07:18.420> you<00:07:18.510> have<00:07:18.660> any
