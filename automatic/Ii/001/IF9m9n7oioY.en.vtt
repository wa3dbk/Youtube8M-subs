now present if you recall in a previous
video<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> did<00:00:24.330> before<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.140> showed<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.189> the

vintage<00:00:28.340> microwave<00:00:29.340> well<00:00:30.000> as<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.929> said<00:00:31.170> before

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
vintage microwave well as I said before

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.620 
vintage microwave well as I said before
that<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:32.690> has<00:00:33.690> been<00:00:33.960> recycled<00:00:34.559> because<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
that one has been recycled because the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.680 
that one has been recycled because the
control<00:00:36.630> panel<00:00:37.020> went<00:00:37.320> completely<00:00:37.620> out<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
control panel went completely out on it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
control panel went completely out on it
so<00:00:39.690> during<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> house<00:00:40.739> tour<00:00:41.190> he<00:00:41.489> probably<00:00:41.790> saw

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this microwave and so now we're gonna go

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.630 
this microwave and so now we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.280> give<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> little

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.720 
demonstration of it and as you can see
the<00:00:52.410> door<00:00:52.649> opens<00:00:54.739> sideways<00:00:55.739> instead<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the door opens sideways instead of

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.709 
the door opens sideways instead of
downward<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.140> old<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.500> did<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.719> in

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
downward like the old one did and in

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.730 
downward like the old one did and in
here<00:01:01.760> there's<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.739> glass<00:01:04.739> ah<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:07.380> might<00:01:07.500> want

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.950 
here there's a glass ah you might want
to<00:01:07.799> say<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> glass<00:01:08.700> plate<00:01:09.479> or<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
to say it's like a glass plate or a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.899 
to say it's like a glass plate or a
glass<00:01:10.369> dish<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:12.600> goes<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
glass dish and this goes on the

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.359 
glass dish and this goes on the
turntable<00:01:14.909> underneath<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.280> when<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
turntable underneath and when the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.039 
turntable underneath and when the
microwave<00:01:17.759> runs<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.979> rotates<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
microwave runs this rotates and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.999 
microwave runs this rotates and
depending<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> time<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> start

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
depending on the the time that you start

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.109 
depending on the the time that you start
the<00:01:26.159> microwave<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:28.040> automatically<00:01:29.040> goes<00:01:29.670> in

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the microwave this automatically goes in

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.749 
the microwave this automatically goes in
the<00:01:30.270> opposite<00:01:30.689> direction<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.549> every<00:01:32.549> other

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the opposite direction so every other

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.530 
the opposite direction so every other
start<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.869> microwave<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:36.119> could<00:01:36.299> say

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
start of the microwave you could say

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.980 
start of the microwave you could say
this<00:01:36.840> goes<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.439> direction<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.220> then

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
this goes in one direction and then

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.840 
this goes in one direction and then
likewise<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.770> goes<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> opposite

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
likewise it goes in the opposite

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.920 
likewise it goes in the opposite
direction<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.799> what<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.890> gonna<00:01:44.009> do<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.750> got

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
direction so what I'm gonna do is I got

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.800 
direction so what I'm gonna do is I got
this<00:01:47.000> pepperoni<00:01:48.000> roll<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> I'm<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
heat up and it's not going to take very

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.929 
heat up and it's not going to take very

if you if you are looking for a new

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:50.500 
if you if you are looking for a new
microwave

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
microwave

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.740 
microwave
I<00:02:50.810> do<00:02:51.940> recommend<00:02:52.940> this<00:02:53.299> one

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
I do recommend this one

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.550 
I do recommend this one
my<00:02:54.500> Kenmore<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:56.569> can<00:02:56.720> see<00:02:56.900> right<00:02:57.109> here<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
my Kenmore you can see right here it's

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.390 
my Kenmore you can see right here it's
got<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:59.060> emblem<00:03:00.459> for<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.959> name<00:03:03.400> Kenmore

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
got the the emblem for the name Kenmore

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.190 
got the the emblem for the name Kenmore
I<00:03:04.430> believe<00:03:04.879> that's<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.209> emblem<00:03:05.659> for<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:06.079> and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
I believe that's the emblem for it and

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.640 
I believe that's the emblem for it and
just<00:03:09.200> got<00:03:09.409> it<00:03:09.609> during<00:03:10.609> this<00:03:10.730> past<00:03:10.970> summer<00:03:11.239> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
just got it during this past summer so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.309 
just got it during this past summer so
it's<00:03:12.650> not<00:03:12.829> that<00:03:13.040> old<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.900> we're<00:03:15.019> gonna<00:03:15.109> go

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
it's not that old so we're gonna go

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.150 
it's not that old so we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.739> heat<00:03:16.340> up<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.549> pepperoni<00:03:17.150> roll<00:03:17.419> and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
ahead and heat up the pepperoni roll and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.759 
ahead and heat up the pepperoni roll and
being<00:03:19.160> that<00:03:19.489> this<00:03:20.019> heats<00:03:21.019> up<00:03:21.290> very<00:03:21.319> very

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
being that this heats up very very

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.259 
being that this heats up very very
quickly<00:03:22.010> we're<00:03:22.639> just<00:03:22.819> gonna<00:03:22.970> give<00:03:23.239> it

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
quickly we're just gonna give it

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.140 
quickly we're just gonna give it
probably<00:03:23.930> about<00:03:24.370> well<00:03:25.370> it's<00:03:25.489> frozen<00:03:25.790> let's

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
probably about well it's frozen let's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.530 
probably about well it's frozen let's
try<00:03:26.419> 45<00:03:27.049> seconds<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> start<00:03:28.160> so<00:03:28.760> we'll<00:03:28.879> hit<00:03:29.090> 4

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
try 45 seconds to start so we'll hit 4

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.539 
try 45 seconds to start so we'll hit 4
and<00:03:31.480> then<00:03:33.430> 5<00:03:34.430> there<00:03:35.180> we<00:03:35.299> go<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:36.220> look<00:03:37.220> how<00:03:37.400> it

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
and then 5 there we go and look how it

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.890 
and then 5 there we go and look how it
tells<00:03:37.790> you<00:03:38.530> what<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.560> do<00:03:39.799> after<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.780> so<00:03:41.780> you

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
tells you what to do after that so you

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.539 
tells you what to do after that so you
have<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.230> time<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.709> then<00:03:42.799> it<00:03:42.919> says<00:03:43.160> touch

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
have the time and then it says touch

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.780 
have the time and then it says touch
start<00:03:44.480> or<00:03:45.280> power<00:03:46.840> level<00:03:48.040> so<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.099> can<00:03:49.220> actually

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
start or power level so you can actually

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.689 
start or power level so you can actually
you<00:03:50.599> can<00:03:50.629> actually<00:03:50.959> set<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.859> power<00:03:52.040> level<00:03:52.579> of

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
you can actually set the power level of

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:58.420 
you can actually set the power level of
of<00:03:53.389> different<00:03:54.579> cooking<00:03:56.319> speeds<00:03:57.319> well<00:03:58.250> we're

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
of different cooking speeds well we're

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.830 
of different cooking speeds well we're
just<00:03:58.459> going<00:03:58.699> to<00:03:58.730> do<00:03:58.849> this<00:03:59.000> on<00:03:59.180> full<00:03:59.389> power<00:03:59.599> so

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
just going to do this on full power so

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.280 
just going to do this on full power so
we're<00:04:00.079> going<00:04:00.199> to<00:04:00.260> hit<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.500> start

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.550 

and<00:04:04.379> now<00:04:05.329> you<00:04:06.329> can<00:04:06.510> see<00:04:06.719> that<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.049> pepperoni

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
and now you can see that the pepperoni

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.740 
and now you can see that the pepperoni
roll<00:04:07.969> is<00:04:09.709> rotating<00:04:10.709> in<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:12.599> microwave<00:04:13.640> and

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
roll is rotating in the microwave and

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.270 
roll is rotating in the microwave and
you<00:04:15.750> could<00:04:15.930> probably<00:04:16.049> see<00:04:16.500> how<00:04:16.680> fast<00:04:17.009> it's

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
you could probably see how fast it's

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.379 
you could probably see how fast it's
starting<00:04:17.789> to<00:04:17.910> thaw<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:19.789> think<00:04:20.789> that's<00:04:20.970> what<00:04:21.239> was

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
starting to thaw I think that's what was

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.659 
starting to thaw I think that's what was
wrong<00:04:21.630> with<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.289> old<00:04:22.500> microwave<00:04:23.009> to<00:04:23.370> begin

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
wrong with the old microwave to begin

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.550 
wrong with the old microwave to begin
with<00:04:23.880> because<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.360> wasn't<00:04:24.780> heating<00:04:25.139> up<00:04:25.259> very

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
with because it wasn't heating up very

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.460 
with because it wasn't heating up very
quickly<00:04:25.889> it<00:04:26.669> would<00:04:26.880> heat<00:04:27.060> up<00:04:27.090> food<00:04:29.600> but<00:04:30.600> not

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
quickly it would heat up food but not

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.029 
quickly it would heat up food but not
very<00:04:31.710> quickly<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:34.590> one<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:35.009> really

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
very quickly and this one is really

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.050 
very quickly and this one is really
really<00:04:36.320> thawing<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.650> pepperoni<00:04:38.280> roll<00:04:38.610> fast

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
really thawing that pepperoni roll fast

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.050 
really thawing that pepperoni roll fast
and<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:40.860> could<00:04:41.039> see<00:04:41.220> it's<00:04:41.400> turning<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.940> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
and you could see it's turning to the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.529 
and you could see it's turning to the
right

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:47.240 

now<00:04:45.539> I'm<00:04:45.690> probably<00:04:45.960> I'm<00:04:46.710> almost<00:04:46.979> positive

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
now I'm probably I'm almost positive

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.100 
now I'm probably I'm almost positive
that<00:04:47.580> if<00:04:47.849> I<00:04:47.940> would<00:04:48.120> start<00:04:48.419> it<00:04:48.570> again<00:04:48.660> it<00:04:48.990> would

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
that if I would start it again it would

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.089 
that if I would start it again it would
turn<00:04:49.289> it<00:04:49.410> to<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> left<00:04:51.530> now<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.590> could<00:04:52.830> see<00:04:53.009> it

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
turn it to the left now you could see it

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.450 
turn it to the left now you could see it
says<00:04:53.340> cook<00:04:53.729> end<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:55.530> then<00:04:55.710> when<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.949> push<00:04:56.190> this

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
says cook end so then when you push this

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.110 
says cook end so then when you push this
button<00:04:56.699> to<00:04:56.940> open<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.270> door

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
button to open the door

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.420 
button to open the door
it<00:05:00.120> says<00:05:03.380> food<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.620> ready<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.979> think<00:05:05.280> that's

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
it says food is ready I think that's

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.089 
it says food is ready I think that's
what<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.639> said<00:05:05.849> food<00:05:06.120> is<00:05:06.300> ready<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.590> let's<00:05:07.620> see

what it said food is ready so let's see

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.430 
what it said food is ready so let's see
oh<00:05:08.250> yeah<00:05:08.870> yeah<00:05:09.870> that's<00:05:10.440> definitely<00:05:10.889> hot

oh yeah yeah that's definitely hot
almost<00:05:13.440> too<00:05:13.830> hot<00:05:14.070> so<00:05:14.820> I<00:05:14.849> have<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.090> let<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.360> sit<00:05:15.599> a

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
almost too hot so I have to let it sit a

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.740 
almost too hot so I have to let it sit a
little<00:05:15.780> bit<00:05:16.580> yeah<00:05:17.580> that's<00:05:18.150> that's<00:05:18.479> definitely

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
little bit yeah that's that's definitely

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.779 
little bit yeah that's that's definitely

a hot pepperoni roll there so anyway
that's<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.120> little<00:05:24.150> demonstration<00:05:24.599> of<00:05:25.110> the

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 
that's a little demonstration of the
