00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
you might want to watch your health

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.089 
you might want to watch your health
while<00:00:24.750> you're<00:00:24.930> killing<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.350> they're<00:00:25.920> not

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
while you're killing these they're not

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.560 
while you're killing these they're not
aggressive<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> worry

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
aggressive so you don't have to worry

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.179 
aggressive so you don't have to worry
about<00:00:27.660> getting<00:00:28.320> attacked<00:00:28.710> right<00:00:28.890> when<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.099> go

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
about getting attacked right when you go

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.380 
about getting attacked right when you go
in<00:00:29.340> there<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.789> kind<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:29.970> makes<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.210> slow

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
in there and it kind of makes it slow

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.959 
in there and it kind of makes it slow
tasks<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.320> little<00:00:32.160> more<00:00:32.309> boring<00:00:32.579> but

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
tasks a little a little more boring but

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
tasks a little a little more boring but
they<00:00:33.420> attack<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.809> melee<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.829> use

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
they attack with melee but if you use

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.410 
they attack with melee but if you use
protect<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.610> melee<00:00:35.969> or<00:00:36.090> something<00:00:36.329> like

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
protect from melee or something like

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.850 
protect from melee or something like
that<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:36.809> attack<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.200> range<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.620> mage

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
that they will attack with range in mage

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.060 
that they will attack with range in mage
so<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.600> protect<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.350> melee<00:00:40.620> method<00:00:40.920> isn't

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
so the protect from melee method isn't

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.150 
so the protect from melee method isn't
too<00:00:41.910> great<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.649> the<00:00:43.649> drops<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:43.920> gonna<00:00:44.010> want

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
fall below around 350 because like I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.960 
fall below around 350 because like I
said<00:02:37.780> they<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:37.900> have<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> 279<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.280> that

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
said they can have up to 279 and that

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.340 
said they can have up to 279 and that
could<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.210> really<00:02:40.450> bad<00:02:40.600> because<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.960> can<00:02:41.170> hit

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
could be really bad because I can hit

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.800 
could be really bad because I can hit
them<00:02:41.440> twice<00:02:41.650> in<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:41.920> row<00:02:42.070> or<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:43.060> how<00:02:43.360> kind<00:02:43.750> of

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
them twice in a row or so so how kind of

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.260 
them twice in a row or so so how kind of
suck<00:02:44.050> but<00:02:45.040> yeah<00:02:45.550> like<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.910> said<00:02:45.940> they're

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
suck but yeah like I said they're

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.000 
suck but yeah like I said they're
unaggressive<00:02:46.660> they<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.410> be<00:02:47.530> kind<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.830> boring

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
unaggressive they can be kind of boring

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.710 
unaggressive they can be kind of boring
because<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.460> have<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.700> right-click<00:02:48.940> them<00:02:49.480> and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
because you have to right-click them and

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.410 
because you have to right-click them and
they're<00:02:50.080> unaggressive<00:02:50.470> so<00:02:51.100> that's<00:02:51.820> kind<00:02:52.270> of

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
they're unaggressive so that's kind of

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.210 
they're unaggressive so that's kind of
boring<00:02:52.750> about<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.320> task<00:02:53.530> but<00:02:53.830> other<00:02:54.040> than

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
boring about the task but other than

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.100 
boring about the task but other than
that<00:02:54.310> if<00:02:55.210> you<00:02:55.300> just<00:02:55.450> have<00:02:55.600> some<00:02:55.630> people<00:02:56.020> to

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
that if you just have some people to

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.630 
that if you just have some people to
talk<00:02:56.320> to<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.710> flies<00:02:57.010> by<00:02:57.310> believe<00:02:57.790> me<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:59.640> yeah

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
talk to it flies by believe me but yeah

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.850 
talk to it flies by believe me but yeah
like<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:01.030> said<00:03:01.060> with<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.960> protect<00:03:02.290> from<00:03:02.440> melee

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
like I said with the protect from melee

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.920 
like I said with the protect from melee
they<00:03:03.250> usually<00:03:03.730> talk<00:03:04.060> with<00:03:04.270> melee<00:03:04.570> but<00:03:04.720> if<00:03:04.840> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
they usually talk with melee but if you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.870 
they usually talk with melee but if you
protect<00:03:05.260> from<00:03:05.500> melee<00:03:05.830> they'll<00:03:06.280> talk<00:03:06.520> was<00:03:06.730> like

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
protect from melee they'll talk was like

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.360 
protect from melee they'll talk was like
range<00:03:07.180> or<00:03:07.510> mage<00:03:07.900> or<00:03:08.050> something<00:03:08.410> like<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.590> so

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
range or mage or something like that so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.150 
range or mage or something like that so
it<00:03:09.730> doesn't<00:03:10.000> always<00:03:10.150> work<00:03:10.300> but<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.620> always

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
it doesn't always work but I always

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.700 
it doesn't always work but I always
recommend<00:03:12.340> praying<00:03:12.940> with<00:03:13.060> piety<00:03:13.510> or<00:03:13.810> ultimate

reflexes or ultimate something the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.380 
reflexes or ultimate something the

which is really helpful I've actually

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.660 
which is really helpful I've actually
used<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.150> quite<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.540> bit<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:50.250> extend<00:03:51.250> my<00:03:51.370> tasks

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
lot more obviously if I would have

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.460

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
them and although they were kind of

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.670 
them and although they were kind of
boring<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.270> was<00:04:56.300> worth<00:04:56.690> doing<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:57.350> lot<00:04:57.500> better

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680
