00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 and in this video we'll talk about 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.199
 how to create new databases because 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.230
 what for some scripts that you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.660
 will install on your website 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.410
 it is often required to create a new one 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.990
 Database 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.500
 especially if the script is some serious 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.510
 big 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.900
 they will demand from you such 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.730
 database access options so here 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.829
 database is created here panel 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.989
 controls here on this base point 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.739
 data mais quel 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.090
 here you just come up with a name 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.010
 This database is valid if I will be there 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.700
 install some online store 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.710
 I would call the base for it. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.079
 This is already given the tail of the thread 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.059
 let's say my case is ourselves 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.059
 we think out and we think out the password 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.140
 click create 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.930
 on this database I got 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.020
 Now if you fill in here according to the instructions 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.640
 which let's say they give you access to 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.600
 database in my case it will be 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:23.030
 look like this tail lokalkhost name 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.180
 the database that we created 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.940
 username is again the same this 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.320
 password that you came up with in my 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.350
 case it was password 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.460
 Now if I prescribe when installing 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.530
 some script 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.710
 such parameters he unimpeded 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.720
 will contact this database and be able to 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.729
 her interact there add there 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.580
 data read this data like him 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.880
 need and so on here and plus here still 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.890
 the opportunity to go inside this 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.899
 database something to see there 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.280
 make add there to fulfill the request 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:00.560
 what is more for people 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.140
 advanced so let's say for programmers 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.319
 different but you should also know what 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.660
 such an opportunity and if you click on 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:12.790
 link bake direct exchange and enter password 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.830
 from this base we will get special 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.709
 database tool 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.620
 here it is this hole for it so far nothing 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.730
 and here I can already let you create there 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.459
 some table 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.090
 there can add it there are two fields 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.090
 let's say 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.860
 call these fields give them a certain 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.260
 type specify the length of the fields and so on 3 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.470
 the set is more for programmers 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.470
 who are already creating some kind of script 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.540
 specifically allow for your project and they 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.260
 he will come here will create there the necessary 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.080
 tables in this database and so on 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:55.640
 here you may need it only in 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.670
 rare cases so here's the principle of all that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.350
 on databases I wanted to say have 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.350
 just mind that again, depending 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.200
 from the tariff you give a specific amount 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.600
 bases in this case I'm on the very first 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.330
 I have two databases available here 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.030
 1 I have already been used pan blog 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.810
 wordpress that I have established a 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.910
 second here i just created on this 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.910
 see you all here in the next video
