one first off you came here to be very

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.819 
one first off you came here to be very
independent<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:47.750> important<00:00:48.829> independence

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
independent very important independence

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.799 
independent very important independence
is<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> must<00:00:50.550> when<00:00:51.120> you're<00:00:51.300> done<00:00:51.449> with<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
is a must when you're done with the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.100 
is a must when you're done with the
number<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.780> by

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
number one you look at one one is by

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.500 
number one you look at one one is by
itself<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:56.570> single<00:00:57.570> has<00:00:58.199> nothing<00:00:58.770> else<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
itself a single has nothing else with it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.209 
itself a single has nothing else with it
so<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:02.039> learn

to be original when you look at the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.270 
to be original when you look at the
number<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.659> once<00:01:21.930> again<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.890> deals<00:01:23.189> with

number one once again it deals with

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
number one once again it deals with
being<00:01:23.610> unique<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> original<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:25.380> it's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
being unique and original because it's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.219 
being unique and original because it's
the<00:01:25.799> first<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.000> talk<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.900> first

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the first when we talk about the first

a<00:01:35.670> first<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.420> beginning<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
a first or beginning so you as a one you

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.660 
a first or beginning so you as a one you
want<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.240> begin<00:01:39.659> certain<00:01:40.229> things<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
kilise hill that is you may not finish

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.310 
kilise hill that is you may not finish
as<00:01:44.009> much<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> start<00:01:45.030> because<00:01:45.840> you're

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
as much as you start because you're

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
as much as you start because you're
you're<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.680> first<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.369> want<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.759> start

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you're the first you want to just start

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780 
you're the first you want to just start
beings<00:01:48.420> pop-ins<00:01:48.930> off<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.220> may<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.579> want

beings pop-ins off but you may not want
to<00:01:50.939> finish<00:01:51.149> or<00:01:51.479> anything<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
to finish or anything is more like a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.889 
to finish or anything is more like a
number<00:01:52.950> nine<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.119> these<00:01:54.390> things<00:01:54.630> are<00:01:54.869> very

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
number nine so all these things are very

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.980 
number nine so all these things are very
important<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.030> plus<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> were<00:01:57.659> born

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
important and plus if you were born

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.750 
important and plus if you were born
unlike<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
unlike a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.690 
unlike a
and<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.750> have<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> one<00:02:00.320> light<00:02:00.560> path<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.550> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
and you have a one light path that it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.430 
and you have a one light path that it
probably<00:02:01.910> gives<00:02:02.240> you<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.540> ability<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:03.200> not

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
probably gives you the ability that not

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.470 
probably gives you the ability that not
only<00:02:03.560> initiate<00:02:03.950> things<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:04.760> things<00:02:04.970> popping

they're self-absorbed the number one is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.110 
they're self-absorbed the number one is
that's<00:02:24.560> sort<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:24.920> an<00:02:25.190> ending<00:02:25.610> channel

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120
