00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
to put a little bit of wood graining in

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.350 
to put a little bit of wood graining in
there<00:00:07.690> all<00:00:08.650> you<00:00:08.830> have<00:00:08.980> to<00:00:09.130> do<00:00:10.740> side<00:00:11.740> though

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
start on my chisel and on my chisel

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.400 
start on my chisel and on my chisel
struggle<00:00:17.110> my<00:00:17.199> chisel<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.880> on<00:00:19.119> my<00:00:19.240> chisel<00:00:19.600> and

struggle my chisel and on my chisel and

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.839 
struggle my chisel and on my chisel and
what<00:00:20.560> I<00:00:20.589> usually<00:00:20.830> do<00:00:21.130> when<00:00:21.279> I'm<00:00:21.429> doing<00:00:21.699> wood

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
what I usually do when I'm doing wood

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.200 
what I usually do when I'm doing wood
graining<00:00:22.119> is<00:00:22.599> I<00:00:23.410> make<00:00:23.650> subsequently<00:00:24.519> smaller

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
graining is I make subsequently smaller

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.130 
graining is I make subsequently smaller
strokes<00:00:25.750> one<00:00:26.169> inside<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:26.589> other<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:27.369> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
strokes one inside the other and the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.040 
strokes one inside the other and the
shape<00:00:29.140> that<00:00:29.169> I<00:00:29.470> take<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:30.220> try<00:00:31.119> to<00:00:31.179> mimic<00:00:31.720> that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
shape that I take I try to mimic that

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.440 
shape that I take I try to mimic that
each<00:00:32.230> time<00:00:32.590> I<00:00:32.860> float<00:00:33.250> so<00:00:33.610> if<00:00:33.730> I<00:00:33.820> put<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.120> little

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
each time I float so if I put a little

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.240 
each time I float so if I put a little
wiggle<00:00:34.660> in<00:00:34.870> there<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.079> want<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:35.350> continue<00:00:36.220> that

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
wiggle in there I want to continue that

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.580 
wiggle in there I want to continue that
a<00:00:36.400> little<00:00:36.670> wiggle<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.120> use<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:38.079> water<00:00:38.289> edge

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
a little wiggle and use the water edge

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.290 
a little wiggle and use the water edge
of<00:00:38.710> your<00:00:38.829> brush<00:00:39.039> just<00:00:39.370> smooth<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.030> soften

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
of your brush just smooth and soften

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.979 
of your brush just smooth and soften
then<00:00:41.250> another<00:00:42.250> thing<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:43.000> I<00:00:43.210> like<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.449> do<00:00:43.690> is

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
then another thing that I like to do is

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.380 
then another thing that I like to do is
sometimes<00:00:44.440> I'll<00:00:44.739> flip<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.160> brush<00:00:45.340> over<00:00:45.579> so<00:00:46.270> my

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
sometimes I'll flip the brush over so my

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.709 
sometimes I'll flip the brush over so my
paint<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.840> going<00:00:47.050> is<00:00:47.350> on<00:00:47.859> the<00:00:47.980> other<00:00:48.129> side<00:00:48.719> and

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
paint is going is on the other side and

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.470 
paint is going is on the other side and
I'm<00:00:49.870> gonna<00:00:49.989> again<00:00:50.379> I'm<00:00:50.500> gonna<00:00:50.620> mimic<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
I'm gonna again I'm gonna mimic that so

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.759 
I'm gonna again I'm gonna mimic that so
that<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.719> kind<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:52.989> enhances<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.440> can<00:00:56.559> come

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
that it kind of enhances it you can come

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.709 
that it kind of enhances it you can come
back<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.190> and<00:00:57.340> you<00:00:57.399> can<00:00:57.579> refine<00:00:58.090> some<00:00:58.449> of<00:00:58.510> those

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
back in and you can refine some of those

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.119 
back in and you can refine some of those
if<00:00:58.960> you<00:00:59.079> want<00:00:59.230> to<00:00:59.289> make<00:00:59.410> some<00:00:59.679> look<00:00:59.859> a<00:00:59.949> little

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
if you want to make some look a little

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:08.330 
if you want to make some look a little
more<00:01:00.429> deep

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.179 

another<00:01:09.119> wood<00:01:09.899> grain<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.290> like<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.829> is

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
another wood grain that I like to do is

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.789 
another wood grain that I like to do is
just<00:01:11.250> really<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> pull<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.439> is

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just really just to kind of pull it is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
just really just to kind of pull it is
elopes<00:01:14.220> down<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> again<00:01:18.360> I'm<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
elopes down and again I'm going to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:29.710 
elopes down and again I'm going to
stretch<00:01:19.079> it<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> water<00:01:19.680> edge

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.280 

again<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.620> start<00:01:31.040> on<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.190> chisel<00:01:31.610> edge<00:01:32.140> walk<00:01:33.140> it

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
again I start on the chisel edge walk it

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:41.320 
again I start on the chisel edge walk it
down<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.540> create<00:01:36.820> my<00:01:37.820> shape<00:01:40.030> smaller<00:01:41.030> and

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
down and create my shape smaller and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.720 
down and create my shape smaller and
smaller<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.020> use<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.040> water<00:01:43.250> edge<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.610> your

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
smaller and use the water edge of your

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.430 
smaller and use the water edge of your
brush<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.540> stretch<00:01:44.840> it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.110 

you<00:01:51.340> could<00:01:51.490> flip<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:51.880> brush<00:01:52.090> over<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.910> kind

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
you could flip the brush over and kind

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.330 
you could flip the brush over and kind
of<00:01:55.210> mimic<00:01:55.480> it<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:56.350> again<00:01:56.650> I<00:01:56.680> use<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.130> water

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
of mimic it and again I use that water

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:13.660 
of mimic it and again I use that water
edge<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:58.210> soften<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:58.840> smear

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.030 

to<00:02:14.240> make<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.980> Knothole<00:02:16.599> you<00:02:17.599> can<00:02:17.780> come<00:02:18.020> in<00:02:18.230> and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
to make a Knothole you can come in and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.000 
to make a Knothole you can come in and
just<00:02:19.069> put<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:20.030> little<00:02:21.250> Center<00:02:22.250> there<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:24.770> can

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
just put a little Center there you can

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:37.360 
just put a little Center there you can
float

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.599 

under<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.489> maybe<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.790> couple<00:02:39.180> times<00:02:40.430> makes<00:02:41.430> it

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
under it maybe a couple times makes it

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.599 
under it maybe a couple times makes it
pretty<00:02:41.849> simple<00:02:42.950> you<00:02:43.950> don't<00:02:44.069> have<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.459> make

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
pretty simple you don't have to make

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.140 
pretty simple you don't have to make
this<00:02:44.879> elaborate<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:46.670> woodgrain<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.730> your

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this elaborate of woodgrain on your

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.839 
this elaborate of woodgrain on your
fence<00:02:48.480> this<00:02:49.139> is<00:02:49.379> just<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.889> just<00:02:50.489> wanted<00:02:50.730> to

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
fence this is just I just wanted to

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.650 
fence this is just I just wanted to
share<00:02:51.090> with<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.749> little<00:02:52.049> bit<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.409> I<00:02:52.439> do
