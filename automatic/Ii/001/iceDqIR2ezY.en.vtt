00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
uncovered this so I could figure out how

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.240 
uncovered this so I could figure out how
to<00:00:30.520> rebuild<00:00:30.849> it<00:00:31.140> since<00:00:32.140> I<00:00:32.290> just<00:00:32.829> had<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:32.980> redo

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
to rebuild it since I just had to redo

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.120 
to rebuild it since I just had to redo
this<00:00:33.370> reporting<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:35.020> let's<00:00:35.170> show<00:00:35.380> you<00:00:35.410> need<00:00:35.950> a

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
2 by 5 by 4 hole and you'll need four

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.620 
2 by 5 by 4 hole and you'll need four
pistons<00:00:41.710> force<00:00:42.310> and<00:00:42.579> some<00:00:42.940> redstone<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.360> some

pistons force and some redstone and some
repeaters<00:00:44.079> and<00:00:44.200> other<00:00:45.149> building<00:00:46.149> material<00:00:46.540> is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
repeaters and other building material is

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.779 
repeaters and other building material is
optional<00:00:47.050> well<00:00:47.769> it's<00:00:47.920> normally<00:00:48.250> optional<00:00:48.609> but

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
want alright so let's place the four

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.849 
want alright so let's place the four
repeaters<00:00:56.559> like<00:00:57.160> so<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:59.469> where<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.710> door

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
repeaters like so that's where the door

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
repeaters like so that's where the door
will<00:01:00.010> be<00:01:00.129> if<00:01:00.219> you<00:01:00.309> haven't<00:01:00.550> figured<00:01:00.609> that<00:01:00.789> out

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
will be if you haven't figured that out

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.570 
will be if you haven't figured that out
so<00:01:02.079> dirt<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:03.309> then<00:01:03.460> repeaters<00:01:03.910> on<00:01:04.180> last<00:01:04.900> delay

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so dirt and then repeaters on last delay

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.260 
so dirt and then repeaters on last delay
its<00:01:06.580> why<00:01:06.730> are<00:01:06.790> these<00:01:07.000> up<00:01:07.240> but<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.870> right<00:01:07.990> here

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
its why are these up but the right here

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.480 
its why are these up but the right here
leave<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.300> space<00:01:10.660> right<00:01:11.170> here<00:01:11.200> or<00:01:11.800> else<00:01:12.310> the

pistons on Noda ladle and then wires to

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.760 
pistons on Noda ladle and then wires to
both<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.730> them<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:29.290> can<00:01:29.440> go<00:01:29.500> ahead<00:01:29.560> and

OOP<00:01:38.320> let's<00:01:39.320> grab<00:01:39.530> a<00:01:39.560> fever<00:01:43.990> there<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.109> go<00:01:47.740> and

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
OOP let's grab a fever there we go and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.740 
OOP let's grab a fever there we go and
it's<00:01:49.100> also<00:01:49.280> replaceable<00:01:49.909> with<00:01:50.000> gravel<00:01:50.360> which

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
it's also replaceable with gravel which

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.929 
it's also replaceable with gravel which
is<00:01:50.929> a<00:01:51.200> given<00:01:51.770> I<00:01:51.950> know<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.459> sound<00:01:52.700> retarded

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
is a given I know I sound retarded

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.959 
is a given I know I sound retarded
saying<00:01:53.329> that<00:01:53.539> but<00:01:53.979> yeah<00:01:54.979> pretty<00:01:55.759> easy

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
saying that but yeah pretty easy

saying that but yeah pretty easy
tutorial<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.569> can<00:01:56.630> actually<00:01:56.990> hide<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.500> wire

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
tutorial you can actually hide this wire

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.889 
tutorial you can actually hide this wire
to<00:01:58.009> go<00:01:58.130> underneath<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.670> lever<00:01:58.880> no<00:01:59.539> problem

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
to go underneath the lever no problem

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.289 
to go underneath the lever no problem
these<00:02:00.109> cover<00:02:00.500> this<00:02:00.709> up<00:02:00.859> and<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.100> still<00:02:01.310> works

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.259 

whatever<00:02:05.299> I'll<00:02:05.479> fix<00:02:05.659> in<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> second<00:02:07.269> actually

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
whatever I'll fix in a second actually

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.639 
whatever I'll fix in a second actually
that<00:02:08.390> needs<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.720> still<00:02:08.929> be<00:02:08.989> open<00:02:09.140> since<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that needs to still be open since the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.890 
that needs to still be open since the
wires<00:02:09.829> going<00:02:10.099> through<00:02:11.290> storage<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.410> fine<00:02:13.900> so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
wires going through storage is fine so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.960 
wires going through storage is fine so
yeah<00:02:15.680> thank<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.040> guys<00:02:16.220> for<00:02:16.280> watching<00:02:16.459> and
