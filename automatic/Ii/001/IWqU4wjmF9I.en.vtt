google<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.800> would<00:02:50.010> start<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:50.370> home<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:50.970> have

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
google so I would start with home I have

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.960 
google so I would start with home I have
the<00:02:51.630> rooms<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.260> next<00:02:52.890> page<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.430> would

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the rooms as the next page I would

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.490 
the rooms as the next page I would
probably<00:02:54.420> start<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.840> new<00:02:54.990> section<00:02:55.320> called

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
probably start a new section called

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.860 
probably start a new section called
amenities<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.910> reason<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.360> would<00:02:57.420> do<00:02:57.660> that

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
amenities and the reason I would do that

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
like so i would argue replacing this

like so i would argue replacing this
with<00:06:06.150> something<00:06:07.110> that's<00:06:07.169> a<00:06:07.289> little<00:06:07.349> more<00:06:07.500> room

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
photos and it perhaps a rotating series

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
there so that virtual tour is gone I

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.250 
there so that virtual tour is gone I
would<00:07:01.000> recommend<00:07:01.270> since<00:07:01.840> this<00:07:01.930> is<00:07:02.110> such<00:07:02.140> a

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
would recommend since this is such a

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.110 
would recommend since this is such a
nice<00:07:02.530> tour<00:07:02.830> to<00:07:02.920> bring<00:07:03.190> this<00:07:03.370> forward<00:07:03.700> somehow

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
nice tour to bring this forward somehow

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.860 
nice tour to bring this forward somehow
maybe<00:07:04.930> this<00:07:05.520> somehow<00:07:06.520> replaces<00:07:07.150> this<00:07:07.450> image

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
maybe this somehow replaces this image

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:10.800 
maybe this somehow replaces this image
and<00:07:08.140> becomes<00:07:08.560> a<00:07:08.890> main<00:07:09.280> main<00:07:09.880> component<00:07:10.540> of<00:07:10.660> the
