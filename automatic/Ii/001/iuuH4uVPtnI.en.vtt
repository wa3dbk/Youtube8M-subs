sounds great as they do in Mac OS 10 but
that's<00:03:50.189> just<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.459> feature<00:03:50.639> of<00:03:50.790> because<00:03:51.720> you

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
that's just a feature of because you

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.249 
that's just a feature of because you
know<00:03:52.430> boot<00:03:53.430> camp<00:03:53.759> and<00:03:54.030> whatnot<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.419> stuff

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.259
