to<00:01:10.439> sleep<00:01:10.680> after<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> long<00:01:11.220> duration<00:01:11.790> if<00:01:12.090> you're

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
to sleep after a long duration if you're

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.289 
to sleep after a long duration if you're
plugged<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:13.189> because<00:01:14.189> sometimes<00:01:14.580> it'll<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
plugged in because sometimes it'll go to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.810 
plugged in because sometimes it'll go to
sleep<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.840> didn't<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> wake<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.820> it's

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
sleep and it didn't want to wake up it's

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.820 
sleep and it didn't want to wake up it's
not<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.720> time<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.290> does<00:01:19.470> happen<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
not all the time but it does happen so I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.460 
not all the time but it does happen so I
would<00:01:23.100> say<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.090> laptop<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.780> plugged

pretty straightforward and it's

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.589 
pretty straightforward and it's
completely<00:02:36.430> based<00:02:36.610> on<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.970> type<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.180> user<00:02:37.480> you

through your battery a little quicker

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.099
