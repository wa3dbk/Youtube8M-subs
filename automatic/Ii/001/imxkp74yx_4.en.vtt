00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
off with thirty six rounds in each clip

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.969 
off with thirty six rounds in each clip
and<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.630> weapon<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:33.960> start<00:01:34.259> off<00:01:34.320> with<00:01:34.439> 28

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.890 
recoil of fires a little slower it's
just<00:02:15.470> not<00:02:16.190> really<00:02:16.550> not<00:02:16.910> quite<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.210> precision

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
just not really not quite a precision

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.510 
just not really not quite a precision

can still one birch people up to a

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.080 
can still one birch people up to a
thousand<00:02:52.070> in-game<00:02:52.340> units<00:02:52.670> which<00:02:52.820> is<00:02:52.940> pretty

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
thousand in-game units which is pretty

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.810 
thousand in-game units which is pretty
far<00:02:53.420> like<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.110> obsidian<00:02:54.860> Steve<00:02:55.100> bow<00:02:55.400> can

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
far like the obsidian Steve bow can

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.090 
far like the obsidian Steve bow can
three<00:02:56.090> shot<00:02:56.300> up<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.570> 1200<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.680> it's<00:02:57.830> it's

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
three shot up to 1200 so it's it's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.590 
three shot up to 1200 so it's it's
pretty<00:02:58.370> far<00:02:58.580> range<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.240> still<00:02:59.450> one

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
pretty far range that it can still one

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.970 
pretty far range that it can still one

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
slower the boar strike I'm talking about

from<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> burst<00:03:16.720> enemies<00:03:17.720> can't<00:03:17.990> really<00:03:18.170> be

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
from the burst enemies can't really be

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.020

tap the burst you know to burst them

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.390

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
into that territory of to bursting

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.500 
into that territory of to bursting
people<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.740> iron<00:03:31.040> more<00:03:31.160> Thunder<00:03:31.550> tusk<00:03:31.760> can

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
people the iron more Thunder tusk can

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.540 
people the iron more Thunder tusk can
fire<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:33.020> that<00:03:33.170> second<00:03:33.590> burst<00:03:33.770> a<00:03:34.040> lot<00:03:34.310> faster

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
fire that that second burst a lot faster

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.980 
fire that that second burst a lot faster
than<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.030> board<00:03:35.240> strike<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:35.630> that's<00:03:35.930> a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
than the board strike because that's a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.250 
than the board strike because that's a
faster<00:03:36.380> fire<00:03:36.590> rate<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.840> you're<00:03:38.840> gonna<00:03:38.990> need

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
faster fire rate and you're gonna need

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.490 
faster fire rate and you're gonna need
two<00:03:39.470> bursts<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.950> usually<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.400> kill<00:03:40.580> anyway<00:03:40.970> so

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
two bursts to usually to kill anyway so

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.110 
two bursts to usually to kill anyway so
why<00:03:42.500> not<00:03:42.530> use<00:03:42.740> something<00:03:43.250> that<00:03:43.280> fires<00:03:43.580> face<00:03:43.850> I

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
why not use something that fires face I

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.550 
why not use something that fires face I

Thunder<00:04:29.840> touch<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.230> because<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.590> its

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
Thunder touch just because of its

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.730 
Thunder touch just because of its
precision<00:04:31.220> now<00:04:32.210> as<00:04:32.570> far<00:04:32.750> as<00:04:32.810> attachments<00:04:33.380> go<00:04:33.530> I

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
precision now as far as attachments go I

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.860 
precision now as far as attachments go I
would<00:04:34.130> always<00:04:34.340> recommend<00:04:34.490> this<00:04:35.210> stock<00:04:35.540> and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
would always recommend this stock and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.870 
would always recommend this stock and
extended<00:04:36.350> mags<00:04:36.500> for<00:04:36.590> any<00:04:36.800> assault<00:04:37.100> rifle<00:04:37.430> but

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
extended mags for any assault rifle but

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.830 
extended mags for any assault rifle but
in<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.090> case<00:04:38.330> I'm<00:04:38.510> going<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.690> recommend

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
in this case I'm going to recommend

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.350 
in this case I'm going to recommend
stock<00:04:39.380> extended<00:04:39.980> mags<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.310> quick<00:04:40.670> draw<00:04:40.910> now

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
stock extended mags and quick draw now

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.090 
stock extended mags and quick draw now
because<00:04:41.660> it's<00:04:41.810> a<00:04:41.870> burst<00:04:42.110> weapon<00:04:42.500> i<00:04:42.620> recommend

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
because it's a burst weapon i recommend

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.280 
because it's a burst weapon i recommend
quick-draw<00:04:43.700> over<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.870> know<00:04:44.990> other

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
quick-draw over you know other

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.450 
quick-draw over you know other
attachments<00:04:45.920> because<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.190> don't<00:04:46.340> really

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
attachments because you don't really

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.100 
attachments because you don't really
need<00:04:46.640> grip<00:04:46.910> because<00:04:47.120> it's<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.420> burst<00:04:47.660> weapon<00:04:47.990> I

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
need grip because it's a burst weapon I

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.420 
need grip because it's a burst weapon I
prefer<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.590> run<00:04:48.710> stock<00:04:49.010> quick<00:04:49.220> drawing

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
prefer to run stock quick drawing

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.590 
prefer to run stock quick drawing
extended<00:04:49.790> mags<00:04:49.940> the<00:04:50.120> reason<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.450> like

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
extended mags the reason I like

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.240 
extended mags the reason I like
quick-draw<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:51.260> because<00:04:51.710> it<00:04:51.830> is<00:04:51.890> a<00:04:51.950> burst

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
quick-draw is because it is a burst

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.890 
quick-draw is because it is a burst
weapon<00:04:52.640> so<00:04:53.060> you're<00:04:53.210> gonna<00:04:53.330> want<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:53.780> your

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
weapon so you're gonna want to get your

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.570 
weapon so you're gonna want to get your
first<00:04:54.170> shot<00:04:54.440> you<00:04:54.860> know<00:04:54.980> you<00:04:55.040> always<00:04:55.280> want<00:04:55.550> to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
first shot you know you always want to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.550 
first shot you know you always want to
have<00:04:55.640> first<00:04:55.940> shot<00:04:56.060> with<00:04:56.690> anything<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.140> do<00:04:57.320> and

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
have first shot with anything you do and

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.920 
have first shot with anything you do and
I<00:04:58.340> just<00:04:58.640> feel<00:04:58.790> like<00:04:58.940> quick-draw<00:04:59.330> works<00:04:59.600> for<00:04:59.810> me

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
I just feel like quick-draw works for me

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.210 
I just feel like quick-draw works for me
now<00:05:00.200> there<00:05:00.350> is<00:05:00.470> one<00:05:00.500> thing<00:05:00.770> i<00:05:00.860> want<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.100> add

now there is one thing i want to add
real<00:05:01.430> quickly<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.090> is<00:05:02.330> in<00:05:02.510> my<00:05:02.720> opinion

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
real quickly and that is in my opinion

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.980 
real quickly and that is in my opinion
the<00:05:03.520> IMR<00:05:04.520> impact<00:05:04.940> which<00:05:05.150> is<00:05:05.300> an<00:05:05.420> enlisted

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
the IMR impact which is an enlisted

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.470 
the IMR impact which is an enlisted
version<00:05:06.380> of<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.590> IMR<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.330> statistically<00:05:08.330> the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
version of the IMR is statistically the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.300 
version of the IMR is statistically the
best<00:05:08.510> version<00:05:09.230> of<00:05:09.290> the<00:05:09.410> IMR<00:05:09.740> you<00:05:09.830> can<00:05:09.950> get<00:05:10.130> it

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
best version of the IMR you can get it

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.550 
best version of the IMR you can get it
has<00:05:10.670> the<00:05:10.850> damage<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.600> bore<00:05:11.990> strike<00:05:12.320> and

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
has the damage of the bore strike and

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.080 
has the damage of the bore strike and
actually<00:05:13.130> has<00:05:13.250> the<00:05:13.280> fire<00:05:13.640> rate<00:05:13.850> of<00:05:13.970> the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
actually has the fire rate of the

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.760 
actually has the fire rate of the
Thunder<00:05:14.360> toss<00:05:14.510> I<00:05:14.810> mean<00:05:15.170> yeah<00:05:15.350> it's<00:05:15.470> not<00:05:15.650> as

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
Thunder toss I mean yeah it's not as

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.230 
Thunder toss I mean yeah it's not as
accurate<00:05:15.980> as<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.340> Thunder<00:05:16.580> tusk<00:05:16.790> but<00:05:17.000> it's<00:05:17.150> a

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
accurate as the Thunder tusk but it's a

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.640 
accurate as the Thunder tusk but it's a
first<00:05:17.450> weapon<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:17.870> it's<00:05:17.990> fairly<00:05:18.200> accurate

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
first weapon so it's fairly accurate

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.410 
first weapon so it's fairly accurate
already<00:05:18.890> such<00:05:19.400> as<00:05:19.550> my<00:05:19.700> opinion<00:05:20.090> if<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:20.270> guys
