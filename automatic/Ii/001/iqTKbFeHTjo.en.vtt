type<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.340> cosmic<00:00:26.670> interstellar<00:00:27.390> motion

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
type of cosmic interstellar motion

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.509 
type of cosmic interstellar motion
something<00:00:28.140> like<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.070> tip<00:00:29.340> isn't

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
something like that this tip isn't

something like that this tip isn't
basically<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> technique<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.689> going<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
basically this technique is going to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500 
basically this technique is going to
show<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.140> how<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> do<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.180> first<00:00:33.180> off<00:00:33.329> let's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
show you how to do that first off let's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.410 
show you how to do that first off let's
take<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> fan<00:00:34.079> brush<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:35.579> some<00:00:35.790> pigments

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
take a fan brush and get some pigments

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.389 
take a fan brush and get some pigments
now<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:36.989> pigments<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> stay<00:00:37.950> towards

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
now this pigments going to stay towards

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.040 
now this pigments going to stay towards
the<00:00:38.520> tips<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> fan<00:00:39.149> brush<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.930> can

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the tips of the fan brush you can

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
the tips of the fan brush you can
actually<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.500> where<00:00:40.649> I've<00:00:40.770> stained<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> fan

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
actually see where I've stained the fan

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.250 
actually see where I've stained the fan
brush<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.940> past<00:00:42.210> paintings<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.020> shouldn't

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
brush with past paintings you shouldn't

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.660 
brush with past paintings you shouldn't
be<00:00:43.320> getting<00:00:43.410> much<00:00:43.680> deeper<00:00:44.010> than<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
be getting much deeper than that for the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.180 
be getting much deeper than that for the
fan<00:00:44.879> brush<00:00:45.170> next<00:00:46.170> we're<00:00:46.289> gonna<00:00:46.350> use<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.800> media

already getting wonderfully grimy
now<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.360> basically<00:01:39.540> repeat<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> effect

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
now you can basically repeat this effect

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.260 
now you can basically repeat this effect
as<00:01:40.799> many<00:01:41.130> times<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.579> want<00:01:41.729> depending<00:01:41.970> on

as many times as you want depending on
how<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:43.049> basically<00:01:43.950> speckling<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.820> um<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
how much basically speckling or um you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.780 
how much basically speckling or um you
know<00:01:46.229> liquid<00:01:46.950> effects<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> want<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.640> your

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
know liquid effects you want on your

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
know liquid effects you want on your
canvas<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:48.990> angles<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.409> put<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
canvas the more angles you put into this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
canvas the more angles you put into this
the<00:01:50.610> more<00:01:50.640> motion<00:01:51.149> you'll<00:01:51.329> get<00:01:51.540> you'll<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the more motion you'll get you'll get it

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.330 
the more motion you'll get you'll get it
where<00:01:52.110> it'll<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.920> speckles<00:01:53.250> will

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
where it'll like the the speckles will

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700 
where it'll like the the speckles will
hit<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.520> impact<00:01:53.820> then<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.930> go<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> certain

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
hit on impact then go this go a certain

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
hit on impact then go this go a certain
direction<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.850> definitely<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.329> mean<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.600> can

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
direction so definitely I mean you can

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.880 
direction so definitely I mean you can
think<00:01:57.869> about<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.619> let<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
think about this you can then let this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.709 
think about this you can then let this
dry<00:01:59.130> come<00:01:59.430> back<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.000> another<00:02:00.210> speckling

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
dry come back to it do another speckling

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.050 
dry come back to it do another speckling
in<00:02:00.840> black<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.439> another<00:02:01.950> color<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.549> mean<00:02:02.939> I've

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
in black or another color I mean I've

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.550 
in black or another color I mean I've
seen<00:02:03.240> almost<00:02:03.390> entire<00:02:03.719> canvases<00:02:04.170> built<00:02:04.409> up

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
seen almost entire canvases built up

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.180 
seen almost entire canvases built up
over<00:02:04.770> multiple<00:02:05.340> layers<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.610> speckling
