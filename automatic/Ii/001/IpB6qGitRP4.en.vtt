and today i'd like to show a technique
I've<00:00:07.799> been<00:00:07.950> kind<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.220> developing<00:00:09.800> not<00:00:10.800> sure<00:00:10.980> if

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
I've been kind of developing not sure if

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.580 
I've been kind of developing not sure if
it's<00:00:11.160> really<00:00:11.759> effective<00:00:12.389> mining<00:00:13.139> technique

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it's really effective mining technique

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.970 
it's really effective mining technique
but<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.280> sure<00:00:15.240> fun<00:00:15.500> we're<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.830> now

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
but it's sure fun we're going to do now

let's leave it to make a path through
the<00:01:32.579> bottom<00:01:32.880> there<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:35.780> little<00:01:36.780> bit<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:38.840> glitch

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the bottom there a little bit of glitch

know<00:01:43.770> we're<00:01:43.920> running<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> multiple<00:01:44.430> 30<00:01:44.640> river

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
know we're running a multiple 30 river

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.940 
know we're running a multiple 30 river
right<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.540> some<00:01:45.780> following<00:01:46.320> stuff<00:01:46.619> comes

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
right now so some following stuff comes

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.730 
right now so some following stuff comes
down<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.460> money<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.200> think<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> started<00:01:49.680> from

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
down to money I think that started from

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.789 
down to money I think that started from
us<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.070> beta<00:01:50.280> back<00:01:50.640> down<00:01:50.939> oh<00:01:52.700> all<00:01:53.700> right<00:01:54.799> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
us with beta back down oh all right you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:04.090 
us with beta back down oh all right you
guys

on<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.190> bottom<00:02:05.370> they're<00:02:05.670> making<00:02:06.120> a<00:02:06.150> nest<00:02:06.300> a

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510
