 Hello everyone, Alex and today I 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.920
 tell you how to make a horse Pegasus Georges 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.860
 for this you will need a flying horse 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.220
 let's go up here and now on 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.359
 I sit her I brought her in the last series to us 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.859
 need to rise above the clouds 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.189
 since I donâ€™t see clouds 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.660
 let's rise here to such a height 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 farther let's tears with her oh very 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:40.820
 opened the map as fun I have a horse 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.820
 lost several times here it is thank God 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.390
 well let's feed and the essence of color 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:57.770
 my goodness what a beauty you see it 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.050
 Pegasus is a real white fairy 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.809
 stunning let me sit on it then 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.809
 have you have to rise above the clouds and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 although even take a picture of yourself and feed 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.920
 its essence and on the left you first need 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.420
 get off is not enough then feed the essence 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.600
 light it is desirable to do it 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.570
 above water, that is, although in creative wear 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 she does well over water to you 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.009
 show that is you if you fall not 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.150
 when you fall you fall into the water and with 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.150
 nothing will be you 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.020
