might be throwing across or it might be

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.439 
might be throwing across or it might be
throwing<00:00:48.339> a<00:00:48.399> counter<00:00:48.699> hook<00:00:48.879> which<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.089> also

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
throwing a counter hook which is also

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:50.579 
throwing a counter hook which is also
very<00:00:49.629> common<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.079> puts<00:00:50.260> your<00:00:50.379> head

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
very common and puts your head

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.979 
very common and puts your head
underneath<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.129> level<00:00:51.399> of<00:00:52.239> that<00:00:52.480> punch<00:00:52.780> and

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
underneath the level of that punch and

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.959 
underneath the level of that punch and
then<00:00:53.140> you<00:00:53.230> pop<00:00:53.409> back<00:00:53.620> up<00:00:53.649> coming<00:00:54.100> forward<00:00:54.399> and

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
then you pop back up coming forward and

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.579 
then you pop back up coming forward and
explode<00:00:55.329> into<00:00:55.480> a<00:00:55.600> cross<00:00:55.839> so<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.320> this<00:00:56.379> case

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
explode into a cross so in this case

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.040 
explode into a cross so in this case
we'll<00:00:56.769> keep<00:00:56.859> it<00:00:57.039> simple<00:00:57.219> and<00:00:57.550> call<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.390> a<00:00:58.449> 1<00:00:58.629> 1<00:00:58.809> 2

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
we'll keep it simple and call it a 1 1 2

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.930 
we'll keep it simple and call it a 1 1 2
coming<00:00:59.409> in<00:00:59.559> but<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.829> second<00:01:00.219> one<00:01:00.429> the<00:01:00.609> second
