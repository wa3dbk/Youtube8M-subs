00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
one chain and on the other ones there

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530 
one chain and on the other ones there
are<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.170> chains<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.879> know<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.090> you've

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
are two chains so if you know if you've

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.060 
are two chains so if you know if you've
got<00:00:33.720> a<00:00:33.750> manual<00:00:34.110> mechanism<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.800> how<00:00:35.010> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
got a manual mechanism this is how you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.640 
got a manual mechanism this is how you
can<00:00:35.309> tell<00:00:35.960> essentially<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.410> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> be

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
can tell essentially there's going to be

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.280 
can tell essentially there's going to be
a<00:00:37.710> handle<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:39.030> drops<00:00:39.269> down<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.140> your

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
a handle here it drops down and your

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720 
a handle here it drops down and your
platform<00:00:40.769> goes<00:00:40.949> down<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> go<00:00:41.489> drop

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
platform goes down because you go drop

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.280 
platform goes down because you go drop
it<00:00:41.910> down<00:00:42.030> manually<00:00:42.449> when<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> want<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.110> write

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it down manually when you want to write

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
it down manually when you want to write
raise<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.160> platform<00:00:44.430> I'm<00:00:45.150> going<00:00:45.330> to<00:00:45.390> grab

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
raise this platform I'm going to grab

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.780 
raise this platform I'm going to grab
that<00:00:45.809> handle<00:00:46.409> pull<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.309> until<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.580> hear

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
that handle pull it up until you hear

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.280 
that handle pull it up until you hear
that<00:00:47.909> sound<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.510> you're<00:00:48.659> doing<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.900> manually

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
that sound so you're doing it manually

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.039 
that sound so you're doing it manually
it's<00:00:49.860> important<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> notice<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.790> is<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.299> moved

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:52.049 
it's important to notice here is I moved

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:53.689 
it's important to notice here is I moved
my<00:00:52.320> machine<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:53.040> this<00:00:53.159> platform<00:00:53.400> it's

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
my machine off of this platform it's

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.460 
my machine off of this platform it's
very<00:00:53.940> important<00:00:54.330> if<00:00:54.420> you're<00:00:54.540> moving<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.019> you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
very important if you're moving this you

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.140 
very important if you're moving this you
know<00:00:55.589> platform<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:56.790> down<00:00:56.909> that<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
know platform up and down that you

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.340 
know platform up and down that you
remove<00:00:57.479> your<00:00:57.600> machine<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.229> can

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
remove your machine because you can

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.039 
remove your machine because you can
crack<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.070> mechanism<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.790> you're<00:00:59.909> using<00:01:00.210> the

got this ruler here this is sitting way

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.069 
got this ruler here this is sitting way
too<00:01:17.159> low<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.789> adjust<00:01:18.539> this<00:01:18.719> you're<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
too low to adjust this you're going to

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.410 
too low to adjust this you're going to
take<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.320> chain<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.219> when<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.969> too<00:01:21.180> low

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
take that chain and when it's too low

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
take that chain and when it's too low
you're<00:01:21.869> going<00:01:21.899> to<00:01:22.079> want<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.380> move<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.710> bolt

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you're going to want to move that bolt

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
you're going to want to move that bolt
down<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.579> that<00:01:23.729> platform<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.539> you<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
down to that platform or you want to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950 
down to that platform or you want to
move<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.289> up<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.950> platform<00:01:26.520> raises<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.270> if

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
move it up so that platform raises up if

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.499 
move it up so that platform raises up if
you<00:01:28.109> do<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> correctly<00:01:31.939> as<00:01:32.939> you'll<00:01:33.149> notice

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
you do that correctly as you'll notice

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.560 
you do that correctly as you'll notice
when<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.689> set<00:01:33.929> it<00:01:33.960> here<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.640> now<00:01:35.820> have<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> level

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
when we set it here you now have a level

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.139 
when we set it here you now have a level
sewing<00:01:37.079> surface<00:01:37.560> if<00:01:37.890> your<00:01:38.579> machine<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.909> not

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
sewing surface if your machine is not

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.929 
sewing surface if your machine is not
sitting<00:01:39.570> too<00:01:39.689> low<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.109> instead<00:01:40.950> sitting<00:01:41.399> too

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
sitting too low but instead sitting too

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.779 
sitting too low but instead sitting too
high<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.719> in<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.259> case<00:01:43.649> again<00:01:44.249> you're<00:01:44.700> going

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
high as in this case again you're going

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:46.819 
high as in this case again you're going
to<00:01:44.880> take<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> bolt<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to take that bolt and you're going to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.739 
to take that bolt and you're going to
lower<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.280> down<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.909> platform<00:01:48.420> will

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
lower it down so your platform will

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:52.899 
lower it down so your platform will
verse<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:49.109> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:51.890> correctly

you'll notice your sewing machine again
it's<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.929> to<00:01:57.990> be<00:01:58.249> level<00:01:59.539> so<00:02:00.539> to<00:02:00.899> understand

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it's going to be level so to understand

it's going to be level so to understand
what<00:02:01.319> I'm<00:02:01.409> saying<00:02:01.679> we're<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.280> take<00:02:02.399> our

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
what I'm saying we're going to take our

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.609 
what I'm saying we're going to take our
Tasmanian<00:02:03.179> table<00:02:03.539> here<00:02:03.810> what's<00:02:04.409> nice<00:02:04.590> about

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
Tasmanian table here what's nice about

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.330 
Tasmanian table here what's nice about
our<00:02:04.799> Tasmanian<00:02:05.460> table<00:02:06.109> is<00:02:07.109> it<00:02:08.069> flips

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
our Tasmanian table is it flips

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
our Tasmanian table is it flips
vertically<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.929> chains

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
vertically so you can see the chains

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.580 
vertically so you can see the chains
here<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.850> on<00:02:12.180> your<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.480> bolt<00:02:12.900> there's<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.319> wingnut

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
here so on your I bolt there's a wingnut

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.940 
here so on your I bolt there's a wingnut
and<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.940> were<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.840> take<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.290> wingnut<00:02:16.590> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
and if you were to take that wingnut and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.220 
and if you were to take that wingnut and
go<00:02:17.069> lower<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:18.300> platform<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.020> lower

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
go lower the platform is going to lower

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.250 
go lower the platform is going to lower
down<00:02:19.350> if<00:02:19.909> you<00:02:20.909> take<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.569> bolt<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.110> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
down if you take that I bolt and you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800 
down if you take that I bolt and you
raise<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.769> wingnut<00:02:23.099> all<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> way<00:02:23.730> up<00:02:23.970> that

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
raise that wingnut all the way up that

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.880 
raise that wingnut all the way up that
platform<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.349> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.500> go

all<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> way<00:02:26.460> up<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:26.880> let's<00:02:27.450> say<00:02:27.540> you've<00:02:27.660> done

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
all the way up so let's say you've done

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.900 
all the way up so let's say you've done
that<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.350> still<00:02:28.680> doesn't<00:02:28.890> matter<00:02:29.250> then

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
that and it still doesn't matter then

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.250 
that and it still doesn't matter then
you're<00:02:30.120> going<00:02:30.210> to<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> take<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.840> screw

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
you're going to have to take this screw

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.830 
you're going to have to take this screw
and<00:02:31.500> move<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.400> screw<00:02:32.670> down<00:02:32.880> links<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.630> this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
and move the screw down links on this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.290 
and move the screw down links on this
chain<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.860> do<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.370> need<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.910> two

looking for now if you don't have these

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.450 
looking for now if you don't have these
tools<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.740> worst<00:03:01.950> case<00:03:02.100> scenario<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.370> can

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
tools the worst case scenario you can

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.910 
tools the worst case scenario you can
always<00:03:02.640> use<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> needlenose<00:03:03.270> pliers<00:03:03.830> you<00:03:04.830> know

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
always use a needlenose pliers you know

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.350 
always use a needlenose pliers you know
you're<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.100> gonna<00:03:05.250> have<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.459> manually<00:03:05.820> turn

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
you're just gonna have to manually turn

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.590 
you're just gonna have to manually turn
this<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.470> screw<00:03:07.709> out<00:03:08.510> so<00:03:09.510> you're

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
this to get that screw out so you're

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.870 
this to get that screw out so you're
going<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> come<00:03:10.110> over<00:03:10.140> here<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:13.610> take<00:03:14.610> that

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
going to come over here and take that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.520 
going to come over here and take that
screw<00:03:15.240> all<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.540> way<00:03:15.750> out<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:17.480> on<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> tables

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
screw all the way out and on the tables

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.830 
screw all the way out and on the tables
that<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.950> two<00:03:20.340> chains<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:21.030> are<00:03:21.450> going<00:03:21.750> to

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
that have two chains that are going to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.190 
that have two chains that are going to
be<00:03:21.930> twelve<00:03:22.260> links<00:03:22.850> two<00:03:23.850> links<00:03:24.270> equal<00:03:24.690> one<00:03:24.959> inch

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
be twelve links two links equal one inch

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.960 
be twelve links two links equal one inch
so<00:03:25.650> most<00:03:25.950> likely<00:03:26.190> you're<00:03:26.550> going<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.700> need<00:03:26.850> to

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
so most likely you're going to need to

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.640 
so most likely you're going to need to
measure<00:03:27.120> machine<00:03:27.600> but<00:03:28.110> most<00:03:28.290> likely<00:03:28.530> you're

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
measure machine but most likely you're

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.960 
measure machine but most likely you're
going<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.800> need<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.100> move<00:03:29.220> it<00:03:29.340> probably<00:03:29.670> up<00:03:29.820> an

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
going to need to move it probably up an

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.530 
going to need to move it probably up an
inch<00:03:30.150> so<00:03:30.930> what<00:03:31.140> we<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.800> we<00:03:32.550> take<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.120> screw

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
inch so what we do is we take this screw

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.970 
inch so what we do is we take this screw
and<00:03:33.810> we're<00:03:34.050> going<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.230> dip<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.560> wood<00:03:34.769> glue

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
and we're going to dip it in wood glue

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.710 
and we're going to dip it in wood glue
first<00:03:35.280> it's<00:03:35.519> really<00:03:35.640> important<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.630> know

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
first it's really important to you know

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.060 
first it's really important to you know
put<00:03:36.900> some<00:03:36.930> wood<00:03:37.140> glue<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.620> screw<00:03:37.800> before

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
put some wood glue on the screw before

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.610 
put some wood glue on the screw before
you<00:03:38.160> stick<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.459> back<00:03:38.580> in<00:03:38.790> that<00:03:38.880> same<00:03:39.150> hole<00:03:39.620> so

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
you stick it back in that same hole so

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.130 
you stick it back in that same hole so
move<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.519> screw<00:03:42.209> up<00:03:42.360> where<00:03:42.660> you<00:03:42.840> need<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.019> to
