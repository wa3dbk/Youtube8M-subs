 Latin America and before we start with 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.330

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.830
 information about things on the channel 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.110

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.549
 a lot about about it you have not 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.130
 asked a lot about when I'm going to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 post pokémon heartgold and when I go 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 to make another direct the theme of live 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.230
 I do not know I have no idea I'm missing 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 time every day because only 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.519
 I sleep between 5 and 6 hours and with that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.260
 time to sleep is difficult to decide 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.060
 this day this is I have to plan 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.679
 It is not valid and I will warn you so that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.420
 time and you can all be like in the 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.739
 last direct attends tranquility the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.050
 day I 'm going to do a live I notice 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 before maybe 45 days before I say that 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.129
 there is a live show within 5 days and so 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.780
 quietly do not worry that more 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.250
 good thing about little wet goal for now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.870
 It is nothing but good Sunday 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.719
 because because I do not have time to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.239
 record and upload more videos not and as 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.300
 I already told you, sleeping 5 or 6 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.680
 I lack time to live and what 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.800
 I really need this is a hobby not 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.510
 do not kill me well outside outside 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 nonsense we will not be with the sun 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.320
 but as you can see here I have I think that 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 I did it like that in the Spanish version 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030
 not in the Spanish draw 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 'Spain and I caught all the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.659
 participants with their names and 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.259
 surnames here in a file not the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.390
 I have here 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.350
 these are those of Latin America are 400 and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.119
 peak to two hours the concrete 6 453 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.009
 people I have removed duplicates to the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.840
 better have come out as 20 records or 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.180
 25 records of people who had 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.289
 stuck a couple of times but well I have not 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.720
 removed to those who know half 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.660
 duplicates because if good person 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 ok what we are going to do is 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:39.390
 selecting all the ones I'm going to copy 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.540
 ok and as the draw says in Spanish 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.210
 I put in the page drawn 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.190
 the machine to draw 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.440
 I hit you all now this the best thing 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.360
 you say you have duplicates and I've 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.760
 suicide and various things where it is done 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.860
 here the shorts that start to draw 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.930
 I always ask myself where number of 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.430
 prizes I'm going to put that 3 ok I did it 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 I think that also when I did the draw 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.150
 for Spain because 3 because if the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.680
 first he does not answer and that he wins 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.270
 answer the second that is in the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.280
 list is must go to win past 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.340
 a few days and if the second does not answer the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.370
 third it is possible that it happens but it is little 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.480
 usual to comment also you have 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.370
 asked a lot of things about the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 draw had tried to answer them by 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.180
 comments but good you said 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.550
 on the theme of the game region 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.380
 this will vary depending on the winner 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.910
 I know there are people from Latin America who 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.280
 the console of europe has been bought and 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.980
 that's why you need the European game if I am 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.780
 from there in Latin America and you have the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.120
 the game you do not have the American console 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.130
 how am I going to talk to the winner 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.810
 I'll talk by mail and then we'll go 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.459
 see what version you need 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.930

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.250

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.069
 I could give it to everyone but it 's for 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.330

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.310
 also where I get the games 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.930
 worth this really has been thanks to 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.790
 many ads will say that they are a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.590
 shit and it's boring to have to 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.239
 wait to watch the videos because of 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.010
 the ads good because thanks to the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.599
 ads you have this is worth this is 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.489
 thanks to the announcements to which 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:16.080
 they swallow the ads because that thanks to 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.480
 they thrilled me all the money in full 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.640
 of what I have gained this time I do not 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.590
 I'm spending in the raffle that is not 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.390
