00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
CC down switch you can also take this to

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.640 
CC down switch you can also take this to
another<00:02:00.280> level<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.940> that's<00:02:01.360> it<00:02:01.660> going<00:02:02.380> on

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
another level and that's it going on

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.920 
another level and that's it going on
each<00:02:02.950> side<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.700> when<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.420> first<00:02:04.690> start

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
each side so when you first start

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.560 
each side so when you first start
learning<00:02:05.080> it's<00:02:05.740> good<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.400> learn<00:02:06.610> back<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
learning it's good to learn back and

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.080 
learning it's good to learn back and
forth<00:02:07.840> because<00:02:08.500> there's<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.920> habit<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.489> it<00:02:09.580> but

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
forth because there's a habit in it but

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.699 
forth because there's a habit in it but
you<00:02:10.209> also<00:02:10.390> want<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.810> max<00:02:11.049> it<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.500> each

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
you also want to max it on each

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.729 
you also want to max it on each
individual<00:02:12.340> side<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.180> start<00:02:13.510> off<00:02:13.630> on<00:02:14.440> let's

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
individual side so start off on let's

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.229 
individual side so start off on let's
say<00:02:14.890> my<00:02:15.070> left<00:02:15.310> side<00:02:15.489> with<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.330> right<00:02:16.540> foot<00:02:18.239> back

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
say my left side with my right foot back

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.560 
say my left side with my right foot back
and<00:02:19.570> forth<00:02:20.549> learning<00:02:21.549> hot<00:02:21.790> bounce<00:02:22.150> from<00:02:22.480> one

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
and forth learning hot bounce from one

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.690 
and forth learning hot bounce from one
foot<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> other<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.799> really<00:02:24.459> going<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
foot to the other is really going to
