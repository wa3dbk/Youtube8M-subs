out right first if you want to adjust

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.050 
out right first if you want to adjust
that<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.399> on<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> corner

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that up and down it's this on the corner

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.280 
that up and down it's this on the corner
and<00:01:51.240> then<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.509> will<00:01:51.659> make<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.810> smaller<00:01:52.200> or

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and then it will make it smaller or

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.109 
and then it will make it smaller or
bigger<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.700> they've<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
bigger it's that and they've got to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.429

just go to overlay on here but now you
obviously<00:06:16.020> isn't<00:06:16.170> a<00:06:16.350> crap<00:06:16.620> in<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:16.830> background

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
obviously isn't a crap in the background

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.040 
obviously isn't a crap in the background
so<00:06:17.820> what<00:06:18.000> you<00:06:18.090> do<00:06:18.210> is<00:06:18.240> you<00:06:18.420> right<00:06:18.660> click<00:06:18.810> on<00:06:18.990> it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
and go on to create clipping layer and

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.330 
and go on to create clipping layer and
this<00:06:21.570> just<00:06:21.870> puts<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:22.260> over<00:06:22.410> the<00:06:22.590> text<00:06:23.010> and<00:06:23.130> text

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
this just puts it over the text and text

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.360 
this just puts it over the text and text
alone<00:06:23.670> so<00:06:24.450> um<00:06:24.750> yeah<00:06:25.470> it<00:06:25.590> doesn't<00:06:25.740> take<00:06:26.100> up<00:06:26.220> on

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370
