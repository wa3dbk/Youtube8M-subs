okay<00:00:00.930> this<00:00:01.110> video<00:00:01.199> within<00:00:01.500> cyclicality<00:00:02.040> touch

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
okay this video within cyclicality touch

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.550 
okay this video within cyclicality touch
our<00:00:02.669> fly<00:00:02.970> line<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> back<00:00:03.750> in<00:00:03.929> using<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
our fly line to a back in using the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.419 
our fly line to a back in using the
Albright<00:00:04.830> knot<00:00:05.180> so<00:00:06.180> we<00:00:06.509> do<00:00:06.660> is<00:00:06.779> take<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.170> end

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
Albright knot so we do is take the end

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.440 
Albright knot so we do is take the end
of<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.820> fly<00:00:09.030> line<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:10.230> just<00:00:10.260> double<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.769> over

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
of the fly line we just double it over

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.120 
of the fly line we just double it over
like<00:00:12.450> parallel<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.230> just<00:00:13.349> pinch<00:00:13.620> between<00:00:13.980> our

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
like parallel and just pinch between our

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.290 
like parallel and just pinch between our
index<00:00:14.519> finger<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.120> thumb<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.750> create<00:00:15.990> loop

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
index finger and thumb to create loop

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.660 
index finger and thumb to create loop
then<00:00:18.300> take<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> backing<00:00:19.039> we<00:00:20.039> go<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.400> through

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
then take the backing we go up through

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.220 
then take the backing we go up through
the<00:00:20.789> bottom<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.210> loop<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.660> again<00:00:21.779> just

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the bottom of the loop and again just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.830 
the bottom of the loop and again just
trap<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.060> between<00:00:24.060> our<00:00:24.210> index<00:00:24.600> finger

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
trap in that between our index finger

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.080 
trap in that between our index finger
and<00:00:25.140> thumb<00:00:25.199> which<00:00:25.680> pull<00:00:25.980> through<00:00:26.250> seven<00:00:27.000> or

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and thumb which pull through seven or

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.490 
and thumb which pull through seven or
eight<00:00:27.150> inches<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:28.260> tag<00:00:28.710> line<00:00:29.359> and<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:31.080> make<00:00:31.289> sure

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
eight inches of tag line and I make sure

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.620 
eight inches of tag line and I make sure
with<00:00:31.679> him<00:00:31.859> lay<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.309> nice<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.579> neat<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.630> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
with him lay it nice and neat like so so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.650 
with him lay it nice and neat like so so
let<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> tag<00:00:37.320> end<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.149> we<00:00:39.149> wrap<00:00:39.450> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
let me take the tag end and we wrap it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.510 
let me take the tag end and we wrap it
with<00:00:40.290> nice<00:00:40.559> neat<00:00:40.890> touching<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.610> end<00:00:43.520> seven

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
with nice neat touching to end seven

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:58.950 
with nice neat touching to end seven
times<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.780> loop

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.830 

and<00:00:59.050> then<00:00:59.800> we<00:01:00.129> passed<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.640> tag<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.059> back<00:01:01.480> down

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
and then we passed the tag and back down

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.510 
and then we passed the tag and back down
through<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.410> loop<00:01:02.980> from<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.370> top<00:01:04.590> and<00:01:05.590> then

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
through the loop from the top and then

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.200 
through the loop from the top and then
we<00:01:06.640> just<00:01:07.320> pull<00:01:08.320> slightly<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.430> live<00:01:12.820> end<00:01:13.060> of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
we just pull slightly on the live end of

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.620 
we just pull slightly on the live end of
the<00:01:13.300> vacuum<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.670> we<00:01:15.820> can<00:01:16.000> let<00:01:16.150> go<00:01:16.330> with<00:01:16.509> our

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
the vacuum and we can let go with our

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.950 
the vacuum and we can let go with our
finger<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.229> thumb<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.360> I<00:01:19.390> want<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.659> do<00:01:19.780> now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
finger and thumb so I want to do now

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.760 
finger and thumb so I want to do now
just<00:01:19.990> slowly<00:01:20.470> tease<00:01:21.810> loops<00:01:22.810> down<00:01:23.140> towards<00:01:23.560> the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
just slowly tease loops down towards the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
just slowly tease loops down towards the
end<00:01:23.860> little<00:01:23.950> loop<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.399> our<00:01:24.490> fly<00:01:24.970> line<00:01:25.420> just

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
end little loop in our fly line just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.109 
end little loop in our fly line just
keeping<00:01:28.090> control<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.720> all<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.610> tag<00:01:30.610> ends<00:01:30.850> as

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
keeping control of all the tag ends as

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.940 
keeping control of all the tag ends as
we<00:01:31.270> do<00:01:31.450> start<00:01:31.840> pulling<00:01:32.380> everything<00:01:32.710> nice<00:01:32.920> and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950

we do start pulling everything nice and
neat<00:01:33.190> with<00:01:33.369> together<00:01:34.890> tease<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:35.920> down<00:01:36.399> with

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
neat with together tease that down with

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.560 
neat with together tease that down with
your<00:01:36.759> finger<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.420> thumb<00:01:37.810> nail<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:42.570> as

your finger and thumb nail and then as

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.950 
your finger and thumb nail and then as
we<00:01:43.720> get<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.899> the<00:01:44.080> end<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:44.649> can<00:01:44.710> just<00:01:45.960> pull

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
we get to the end you can just pull

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.380 
we get to the end you can just pull
tight<00:01:49.289> on<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.440> live<00:01:50.649> end<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.789> then<00:01:52.090> we<00:01:52.240> can

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
tight on the live end and then we can

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.899 
tight on the live end and then we can
also<00:01:54.810> pull<00:01:55.810> down<00:01:56.050> on<00:01:56.380> the<00:01:56.619> tag<00:01:56.830> end<00:01:57.039> now<00:01:57.670> if<00:01:57.789> you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
also pull down on the tag end now if you

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.710 
also pull down on the tag end now if you
want<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.119> get<00:01:58.210> that<00:01:58.360> little<00:01:58.569> tighter<00:02:00.690> take<00:02:01.690> a

want to get that little tighter take a
pair<00:02:01.929> of<00:02:01.960> forceps<00:02:02.470> on<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.830> tag<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.479> just

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
pair of forceps on the tag and just

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:05.819 
pair of forceps on the tag and just
click<00:02:04.720> them<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:04.990> just<00:02:05.140> wrap<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.439> around<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.710> few

click them and just wrap it around a few

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.229 
click them and just wrap it around a few
times<00:02:05.890> dot<00:02:06.759> do<00:02:06.909> this<00:02:07.119> on<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:08.040> live<00:02:09.040> end<00:02:09.310> and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
times dot do this on the live end and

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.210 
times dot do this on the live end and
then<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.570> pull<00:02:10.869> I'll<00:02:11.680> tighten<00:02:12.010> everything

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
then just pull I'll tighten everything

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.449 
then just pull I'll tighten everything
down<00:02:13.890> and<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.190> see<00:02:15.430> there<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:18.310> now

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
down and you can see there that we now

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.850 
down and you can see there that we now
have<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.670> nice<00:02:18.880> neat<00:02:19.269> knot

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.110 

so<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.340> take<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> pair<00:02:27.090> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
so then all we do take a pair of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:36.470 
so then all we do take a pair of
scissors<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.600> trim<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.550> tag<00:02:32.850> ends<00:02:35.480> go

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
scissors and just trim the tag ends go

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.050 
scissors and just trim the tag ends go
as<00:02:36.540> close<00:02:36.750> as<00:02:37.020> you<00:02:37.110> like<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:39.200> fly<00:02:40.200> line

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
as close as you like with the fly line

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.290 
as close as you like with the fly line
trim<00:02:42.060> them<00:02:42.270> off<00:02:46.790> call<00:02:47.790> them<00:02:47.910> make<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> better

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
trim them off call them make a better

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.110 
trim them off call them make a better
cook<00:02:48.480> than<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
cook than that

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.330 
cook than that
there<00:02:51.120> we<00:02:51.240> go<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:52.440> our<00:02:52.560> fly<00:02:52.830> line<00:02:53.040> attached<00:02:53.310> to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
there we go of our fly line attached to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.940 
there we go of our fly line attached to
our<00:02:53.580> back<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.910> using<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.300> Albright<00:02:54.660> knot<00:02:54.950> and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
our back in using the Albright knot and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.600 
our back in using the Albright knot and
it's<00:02:56.070> a<00:02:56.190> very<00:02:56.490> very<00:02:56.880> secure<00:02:57.330> knot
