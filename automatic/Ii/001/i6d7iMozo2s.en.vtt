00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 in a dream debut for Hercules 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 gomez by marking three times a 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.869
 only escuín three of tijuana tipped 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.599
 the biggest win with Jorge Almirón in the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.599
 bench when defeating for club beating 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.210
 sports victory of Honduras 6 to 0 on 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.189
 last Thursday in corresponding match 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.230
 to the group stage of the league 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 champions of the concacaf that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.550
 developed in the calero stadium and managed 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.550
 that happy for the triumph 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.589
 but I think the team is a campus 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.420
 broad that we all work the same and 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.039
 today it was demonstrated I think all the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
 players who want to demonstrate technical 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.390
 that are to play and well today was a 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.429
 sample of this from the Aztec dogs not 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.829
 It took time to make it clear that they were looking for 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.239
 get ahead on the scoreboard and on the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 first minute 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.739
 paul arriola took powerful shot from 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.149
 outside the area that crashed in the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.149
 right post by john bodden 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.410
 the same arriola put again in 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.930
 danger the victory city arch at 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.970
 2 minute when firing a ball flush with 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.470
 grass that was deflected by the defense 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.470
 visitor touching the post 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.630
 good always wins good at the group level 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.310
 the team and they are good matches out there 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 today it was for most of the boys 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.009
 that he was not playing and they showed they knew 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.679
 of height and that at any time 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.329
 they can be and that's important 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.670
 it's a good competition and good downhill 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.990
 there will be Sunday in Puebla do 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.719
 a great game we get a good 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.759
 result as to start 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.810
 get into a zone of liguilla which is the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.179
 goal that we have 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.219
 Gomez had an unbeatable debut at 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.679
 60th minute was present on the blackboard 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.200
 with the annotation that originated with pass 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.269
 profound of cristian pellerano with the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.370
 that the batter was left alone before the goalkeeper 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.510
 taking a shot that passed between 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.510
 legs of jonh bodden 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.380
 if it gave me the opportunity to release me 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.410
 in the field of fiction what already 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.470
 I had integrated bullets to make 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.230
 has suffered these last months to see 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.630
 my colleagues and the effort that they have 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.670
 done inside the court and can not be 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.380
 part of that then and it's finally finally 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.700
 gave and most of all happy for the three 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.170
 points if they do not go here for what is called 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.850
 attention court humility or before 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.850
 the pain of our edges I speak of the 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.240
 three points is the most important the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.190
 What I really love about this 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.800
 team this organization is from this 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.800
 hobby is that nobody puts the name of 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.250
 back by the front and here we are a 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.340
 group 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.250
 we win together we lose together then 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.600
 with the pass something good to someone is for 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.240
 the group comes the group then very 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.730
 glad to be part of this obviously 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.210
 as it says now comes the beautiful with the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.830
 triumph those directed by jorge almirón 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.510
