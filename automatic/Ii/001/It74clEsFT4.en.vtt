00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.620

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
and we can see that the pin has now

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.770 
and we can see that the pin has now
moved<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.920> outer<00:04:22.190> portion<00:04:22.850> of<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:26.330> hole
