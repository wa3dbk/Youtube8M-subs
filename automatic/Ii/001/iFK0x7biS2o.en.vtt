00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 radio Komsomolskaya truth due to there 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.320
 two questions that you covered on 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.240
 which answer we donâ€™t know which ones 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.150
 This attitude depends on the history of the question. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 The first question of age is not up to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 Pugachev and Galkina can 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.140
 And these two can not be more than that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 I remind you that in the Soviet Union was 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.349
 such Ukrainian Soviet 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.720
 socialist republic 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.540
 some are now known for their creative 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.700
 the pseudonym of Ukraine in this republic 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.399
 like all other republics had their 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.450
 own family code and that's not in 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 middle asia 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.649
 and in Ukraine girls officially 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.960
 allowed to marry at the age of 16 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.750
 there is no special 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.710
 circumstances there at just 16 years old she 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.510
 17 years old just 16 years old if parents 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 separately fix that don't mind 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 Do you understand this is Ukraine? 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.770
 humanitarian Soviet times very much 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.840
 civilized and they really understand why 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.510
 under Soviet rule, 16 could 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.850
 marry in Ukraine and with the current 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.890
 Russian authorities in Chechnya in the 17 years of 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.210
 annoying someone 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.590
 questions actually 2 but the question 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.189
 age gap 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.229
 Well, find out was such a poet year if you do not 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.659
 want to take a Caucasian example take 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.920
 European example who married 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.259
 18-year-old help darken greatly and he 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.560
 the truth was also high ranking 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.880
 officials his horse here now but here 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.130
 questions 2 1 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.439
 has there been a coercion about which 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:50.670
 writes new to be the second happy groom 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:53.939
 he was married or not officially if he 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 officially married then this is a criminal 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.649
 a crime if he is not officially 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.800
 wife actually someone who 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.290
 how are people there 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.590
 friend condition was whether coercion we 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.750
 from here we will not see as to 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.820
 new newspapers authenticity I know that 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.450
 on air of one media to another to speak not 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.180
 accepted 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.390
 but with the exception of Eric Eric &amp; Eric's article 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.870
 Murtazina I would not consider material 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.410
 as a source of information self-sufficient 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.650
 it can be and could be and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.840
 to another that is here above in this 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 moment missing the ground to indicate 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.010
 order to have some me by the way 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.690
 was he married is a big question 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.020
 because it was originally reported that 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.620
 coachman married or game reported 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.420
 so if you are already publishing 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.560
 called a new newspaper well, so I say 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.830
 that when he talked about blood 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.510
 your tank pouring down francisque street 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.080
 st petersburg which is then on 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.630
 the calibration of the day turns out to be a quiet gathering 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.209
 conservatives and easier easier 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.750
 how would there be sources of information that 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.700
 for me are a source of opinions 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.980
 source of news source 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.320
 fulfilling the agenda of the day 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.910
 this agenda but not the source 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.130
 information in the truest sense of the word 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.680
 this is my personal opinion based on 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.080
 experience 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.580
 well that is, we need to understand whether 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.180
 This man was married at 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.390
 today more than that we are unlikely 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.739
 we can get answers to these questions 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.989
 when viewed from a formal point of view 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.450
 then everything is fine there all official 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.510
 people said everything was fine including 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.700
 Mr. Astakhov which you say 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.400
 obviously didn't follow expressions when in 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.230
 basis of their point of view and docks in 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.840
 his address is fair because 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.350
 how would there be political correctness is 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.940
 impolite and he behaved extremely 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.860
 admitted present admitted limit 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.620
 I do not see the ess but apologized in the end 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.870
 damn him he is our ombudsman protector 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.489
 children they are a protector of women so sort of 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.450
 radio crash 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.450
 Komsomolsk
