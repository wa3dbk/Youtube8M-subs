00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
the center and we will cook or link up

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.430 
the center and we will cook or link up
as<00:03:58.100> we<00:03:58.670> take<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.030> back<00:03:59.209> step<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.750> then<00:04:00.320> when

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
as we take the back step and then when

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.960 
as we take the back step and then when
we<00:04:00.530> go<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.950> side<00:04:01.190> we're<00:04:01.459> going<00:04:01.580> to<00:04:01.640> be

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
we go to the side we're going to be

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.930 
we go to the side we're going to be
forward<00:04:02.450> into<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.720> partner<00:04:03.170> again<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.160> then

forward into a partner again and then

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.790 
forward into a partner again and then
hook<00:04:05.209> on<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> back<00:04:05.690> step<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.500> we<00:04:06.620> have<00:04:06.770> a

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
hook on the back step so we have a

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.220 
hook on the back step so we have a
little<00:04:07.040> contraction<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.000> expansion<00:04:08.270> it
