hair it could pass for but um I didn't
really<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.840> how<00:02:10.080> big<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.800> curls<00:02:11.220> were

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
really like how big the curls were

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.360 
really like how big the curls were
and<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.870> top<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.320> I<00:02:13.530> straighten<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and on top of that I straighten the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.080 
and on top of that I straighten the
piece<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:15.290> straightened<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.350> piece<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.920> then<00:02:17.820> I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
piece I straightened a piece and then I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.330 
piece I straightened a piece and then I
tried<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.140> put<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.040> left<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
tried to I put it and left it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.960 
tried to I put it and left it
straightened<00:02:20.880> for<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.510> while<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.530> then<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.970> wet

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
straightened for a while and then I wet

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.700 
straightened for a while and then I wet
it<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.300> see<00:02:24.480> if<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.720> natural<00:02:25.110> curl<00:02:25.320> will<00:02:25.500> come

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
it to see if the natural curl will come

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.440 
it to see if the natural curl will come
back<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:27.860> then<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.980> also<00:02:30.860> so<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.070> what<00:02:32.460> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
back and then I also so this is what the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.160 
back and then I also so this is what the
wait<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.310> wave<00:02:35.310> looks<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.910> after<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:36.900> been

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
wait the wave looks like after it's been

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.260 
wait the wave looks like after it's been
curled<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.920> actually<00:02:38.520> back<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.150> its

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
curled it's not actually back to its

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.780 
curled it's not actually back to its
natural<00:02:39.480> curl<00:02:40.020> but<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.250> how<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.760> looks

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
natural curl but this is how it looks

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.820 
natural curl but this is how it looks
like<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.570> we'll<00:02:42.930> put<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.380> against<00:02:43.620> something

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
like and we'll put it against something

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.050 
like and we'll put it against something
white<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.430> see<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:47.970> not

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
white so you can see so you see it's not

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.010 
white so you can see so you see it's not
the<00:02:48.660> same<00:02:49.140> curl<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.390> these<00:02:51.390> ones<00:02:51.720> right<00:02:51.870> here

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
the same curl as these ones right here

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.430 
the same curl as these ones right here
and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.190> quickly<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.690> tried<00:02:54.990> it<00:02:55.110> again<00:02:55.200> on

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
and then I quickly I tried it again on

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.660 
and then I quickly I tried it again on
another<00:02:55.530> side<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.190> here<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:58.670> straightened

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
another side up here and I straightened

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.449 
another side up here and I straightened
it<00:02:59.760> and<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.500> left<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.250> for

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
it and for and I left it like that for

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.699 
it and for and I left it like that for
like<00:03:02.730> probably<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.300> 10<00:03:03.720> minutes<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.590> other

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
like probably like 10 minutes the other

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.970 
like probably like 10 minutes the other
side<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.100> left<00:03:05.430> for<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.820> few<00:03:06.030> days<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.990> then<00:03:07.050> I

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
side I left for a few days and then I

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.480 
side I left for a few days and then I
curl<00:03:08.370> put<00:03:08.820> it<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.060> water<00:03:09.240> and<00:03:10.220> it's<00:03:11.220> pretty

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
curl put it in water and it's pretty

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.610 
curl put it in water and it's pretty
much<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:13.230> same<00:03:14.990> but<00:03:15.990> a<00:03:16.020> little<00:03:16.470> bit

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
much like the same but a little bit

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.280 
much like the same but a little bit
looser<00:03:16.769> than<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.610> natural<00:03:17.820> side<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.110> I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
looser than the natural side and I

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.190 
looser than the natural side and I
didn't<00:03:19.530> want<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:19.980> wanted<00:03:20.370> something<00:03:21.200> the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
didn't want that I wanted something the

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.140 
didn't want that I wanted something the
curls<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.769> more<00:03:23.070> curlier<00:03:23.519> rather<00:03:23.850> than<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
curls to be more curlier rather than a

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.130 
curls to be more curlier rather than a
wave<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.890> um<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.700> asked<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.690> guy<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:27.900> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
wave so um I asked the guy for the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
wave so um I asked the guy for the
curlies<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.040> he<00:03:29.190> had<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.140> um<00:03:31.140> yes<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.130> I

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
curlies here that he had and um yes so I

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.210 
curlies here that he had and um yes so I
got<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.519> 22<00:03:32.940> inch<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.840> very<00:03:34.350> very<00:03:34.470> true<00:03:34.950> to

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
got a 22 inch and it's very very true to

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.680 
got a 22 inch and it's very very true to
lend<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:37.290> ends<00:03:37.769> are<00:03:37.920> not<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.910> bad<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.480> mean

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
lend the ends are not that bad I mean

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.150 
lend the ends are not that bad I mean
it's<00:03:39.900> curly<00:03:40.260> hair<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.709> know<00:03:40.890> you're<00:03:41.040> going

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
it's curly hair so you know you're going

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.490 
it's curly hair so you know you're going
to<00:03:41.220> have<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> few<00:03:41.670> bushy<00:03:42.000> ends<00:03:42.360> but<00:03:42.630> it's

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
to have a few bushy ends but it's

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.920 
to have a few bushy ends but it's
actually<00:03:43.739> not<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.370> bad<00:03:45.830> as<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.250> can<00:03:47.400> see<00:03:47.930> um

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
actually not that bad as you can see um

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.720 
actually not that bad as you can see um
it<00:03:49.560> feels<00:03:50.010> really<00:03:50.790> beautiful<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.930> says

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
it feels really beautiful and it says

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.570 
it feels really beautiful and it says
Queen<00:03:53.730> like<00:03:54.680> one<00:03:55.680> hundred<00:03:55.950> percent<00:03:55.980> human

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
Queen like one hundred percent human

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.420 
Queen like one hundred percent human
brazilian<00:03:57.090> hair<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:57.900> this<00:03:58.050> is<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.230> 22<00:03:58.620> inch<00:03:59.040> and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
brazilian hair so this is a 22 inch and

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.509 
brazilian hair so this is a 22 inch and
as<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.060> put<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.330> myself<00:04:01.010> it<00:04:02.010> goes<00:04:02.220> down<00:04:02.459> to

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
as I put it to myself it goes down to

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.000 
as I put it to myself it goes down to
here<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.350> I<00:04:04.350> am<00:04:05.780> 52<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.290> half<00:04:07.500> or<00:04:07.830> five

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
here and I am 52 and a half or five

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.670 
here and I am 52 and a half or five
three<00:04:08.370> one<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.670> those<00:04:08.850> but<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.810> goes<00:04:10.019> down<00:04:10.410> to

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
three one of those but it goes down to

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.190 
three one of those but it goes down to
here<00:04:11.570> we're<00:04:12.570> 22<00:04:13.100> then<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.310> also<00:04:14.549> got<00:04:15.150> an<00:04:15.420> 18<00:04:16.019> inch

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
here we're 22 then I also got an 18 inch

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.140 
here we're 22 then I also got an 18 inch
oh<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.739> forgot<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.370> show<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.580> how<00:04:17.820> thick<00:04:18.030> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
oh I forgot to show you how thick the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.330 
oh I forgot to show you how thick the
wife's<00:04:18.330> are<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:19.260> Webster<00:04:19.590> kind<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:19.979> fig<00:04:20.190> I

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
wife's are the Webster kind of fig I

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.159 
wife's are the Webster kind of fig I
thought<00:04:20.549> it<00:04:20.700> would<00:04:20.789> be<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> little<00:04:21.870> thinner

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
thought it would be a little thinner

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.050 
thought it would be a little thinner
knowing<00:04:22.530> that<00:04:22.740> you're<00:04:23.039> getting<00:04:23.160> longer<00:04:23.490> hero

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
knowing that you're getting longer hero

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.800 
knowing that you're getting longer hero
thinner<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:25.169> this<00:04:25.790> it's<00:04:26.790> pretty<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.630> a

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
thinner but this it's pretty it's a

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.340 
thinner but this it's pretty it's a
pretty<00:04:27.990> good<00:04:28.169> amount<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.860> 22<00:04:29.550> inch<00:04:30.350> and

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
pretty good amount for a 22 inch and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.270 
pretty good amount for a 22 inch and
then<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:31.590> 18<00:04:32.070> inch<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:33.330> like<00:04:34.110> this<00:04:34.530> same

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
then the 18 inch it's like this same

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.580 
then the 18 inch it's like this same
exact<00:04:35.880> curl<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:37.610> it's<00:04:38.610> about<00:04:38.910> here<00:04:39.300> and<00:04:39.960> you

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
exact curl and it's about here and you

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.170 
exact curl and it's about here and you
know<00:04:40.680> it's<00:04:40.889> curly<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.580> it's<00:04:41.760> going<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.060> look

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
know it's curly so it's going to look

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.990 
know it's curly so it's going to look
shorter<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:42.870> I<00:04:43.110> have<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> lot<00:04:44.100> of<00:04:44.130> hair<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.730> this

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
shorter but I have a lot of hair in this

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.340 
shorter but I have a lot of hair in this
left<00:04:46.730> it's<00:04:47.730> probably<00:04:48.150> like<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.800> just<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:51.350> little

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
left it's probably like a just a little

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.590 
left it's probably like a just a little
more<00:04:52.500> than<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.460> little<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.850> lot<00:04:54.030> more<00:04:54.270> than

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
more than not a little a lot more than
