the bottom cover and take out the the
fans<00:00:33.050> cooling<00:00:33.680> fans<00:00:33.920> and<00:00:34.730> there's<00:00:35.030> a<00:00:35.090> coarse

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
fans cooling fans and there's a coarse

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.880 
fans cooling fans and there's a coarse
electrical<00:00:35.840> connection<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.470> bottom<00:00:36.800> that

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
electrical connection on the bottom that

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.860 
electrical connection on the bottom that
you<00:00:37.010> have<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.220> disconnect<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:38.300> there's<00:00:38.690> four

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
you have to disconnect and there's four

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.860 
you have to disconnect and there's four
bolts<00:00:39.050> that<00:00:39.230> hold<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.590> on<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.610> then<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:41.540> fan

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
bolts that hold it on so then that fan

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.470 
bolts that hold it on so then that fan
assembly<00:00:42.680> will<00:00:43.010> drop<00:00:43.220> on<00:00:43.400> out<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.360> you

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
assembly will drop on out and if you

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.780 
assembly will drop on out and if you
remove<00:00:45.079> that<00:00:45.140> cover<00:00:45.860> from<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.309> bottom<00:00:46.670> it

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
remove that cover from the bottom it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.190 
remove that cover from the bottom it
will<00:00:46.820> actually<00:00:47.180> drop<00:00:47.480> off<00:00:47.719> from<00:00:47.899> the<00:00:47.960> bottom

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
will actually drop off from the bottom

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.400 
will actually drop off from the bottom
which<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.710> pretty<00:00:49.070> straightforward

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410

your<00:02:10.300> your<00:02:11.300> your<00:02:11.930> throttle<00:02:12.349> body<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:13.280> at

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
your your your throttle body here for at

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.699 
your your your throttle body here for at
hook<00:02:14.450> sign<00:02:14.660> up<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.349> will<00:02:15.440> keep<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
hook sign up so that will keep it

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.839 
hook sign up so that will keep it
clearance<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.220> be<00:02:16.310> able<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.580> pull<00:02:16.730> the

clearance to be able to pull the

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:18.110 
clearance to be able to pull the
alternator<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:17.390> out

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
alternator on out

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.610 
alternator on out
I've<00:02:19.120> disconnected<00:02:19.510> there's<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.319> one

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
I've disconnected there's a one

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.080 
I've disconnected there's a one
connection<00:02:20.950> right<00:02:21.189> here<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.580> alternator

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
connection right here on the alternator

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.720 
connection right here on the alternator
so<00:02:23.019> that's<00:02:23.230> that's<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:24.010> new<00:02:24.939> and<00:02:25.720> there's<00:02:26.319> a

so that's that's a new and there's a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.229 
so that's that's a new and there's a
terminal<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.390> that's<00:02:28.659> for<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
terminal right there that's for the the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.569 
terminal right there that's for the the
voltage<00:02:31.239> out<00:02:31.510> for<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> alternator<00:02:33.010> there's

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
voltage out for the alternator there's

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.280 
voltage out for the alternator there's
one<00:02:33.760> little<00:02:34.030> screw<00:02:34.269> on<00:02:34.299> there<00:02:34.599> it's<00:02:34.959> no<00:02:35.110> big

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
one little screw on there it's no big

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.789 
one little screw on there it's no big
deal<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.500> can<00:02:35.739> get<00:02:35.950> at<00:02:36.069> it<00:02:36.099> without<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.459> problem

deal you can get at it without a problem
next<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:39.579> know<00:02:39.700> there's<00:02:39.940> a<00:02:40.000> lot<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.299> stuff<00:02:40.480> out

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
next you know there's a lot of stuff out

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.550 
next you know there's a lot of stuff out
here<00:02:41.010> I've<00:02:42.209> listed<00:02:43.209> up<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.750> air<00:02:43.930> conditioner

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
here I've listed up the air conditioner

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.890 
here I've listed up the air conditioner
a<00:02:44.879> compressor<00:02:45.879> there's<00:02:46.150> only<00:02:46.269> three<00:02:46.569> bolts

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
a compressor there's only three bolts

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.119 
a compressor there's only three bolts
that<00:02:46.959> hold<00:02:47.109> it<00:02:47.319> on<00:02:47.379> and<00:02:47.769> there's<00:02:47.890> one

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
that hold it on and there's one

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.890 
that hold it on and there's one
electrical<00:02:48.670> connector<00:02:49.030> what<00:02:49.359> does<00:02:49.540> Nick<00:02:49.689> what

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
electrical connector what does Nick what

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.360 
electrical connector what does Nick what
does<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.019> do<00:02:50.260> well<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.500> allows<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.280> to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
does that do well that allows you to

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.030 
does that do well that allows you to
move<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.730> hose<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.299> the<00:02:52.420> back<00:02:53.040> because

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
move this hose to the back because

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.619 
move this hose to the back because
you're<00:02:54.190> going<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.370> try<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.549> squeeze<00:02:54.879> it<00:02:55.180> on<00:02:55.269> in

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
you're going to try to squeeze it on in

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.780 
you're going to try to squeeze it on in
through<00:02:56.049> between<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.709> radiator<00:02:57.159> and<00:02:57.519> that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
through between the radiator and that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.229 
through between the radiator and that
air<00:02:57.940> compressor<00:02:58.150> hose<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.950> you<00:02:59.980> need<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.579> allow

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
air compressor hose so you need to allow

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.520 
air compressor hose so you need to allow
this<00:03:01.450> thing<00:03:01.659> to<00:03:01.780> get<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.139> little<00:03:02.319> bit<00:03:02.440> of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
this thing to get a little bit of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.479 
this thing to get a little bit of
movement<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.370> do<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:04.030> then<00:03:04.930> lastly<00:03:05.409> I've<00:03:06.159> got

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
movement to do that then lastly I've got

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.199 
movement to do that then lastly I've got
this<00:03:06.730> stuff<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.230> piece<00:03:08.409> of<00:03:08.440> cardboard

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
this stuff this is a piece of cardboard

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.160 
this stuff this is a piece of cardboard
sandwiched<00:03:10.209> right<00:03:10.329> out<00:03:10.599> in<00:03:10.720> front<00:03:10.780> of<00:03:11.049> there

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
sandwiched right out in front of there

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.770 
sandwiched right out in front of there
to<00:03:12.129> protect<00:03:12.519> between<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.120> alternator<00:03:13.659> and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
to protect between the alternator and

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.339 
to protect between the alternator and
the<00:03:14.170> radiator<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:16.500> an<00:03:17.500> intercooler<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:19.349> that

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
the radiator and an intercooler so that

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.650 
the radiator and an intercooler so that
I<00:03:20.950> think<00:03:21.760> pretty<00:03:22.000> much<00:03:22.090> covers<00:03:22.569> everything

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
I think pretty much covers everything

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.210 
I think pretty much covers everything
I'm<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.049> going<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.470> go<00:03:23.560> ahead<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:23.980> slide

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
I'm just going to go ahead and slide

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.379 
I'm just going to go ahead and slide
that<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.910> alternator<00:03:25.449> on<00:03:25.599> out<00:03:25.780> now<00:03:27.209> this<00:03:28.209> is

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
that to alternator on out now this is

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.150 
that to alternator on out now this is
definitely<00:03:28.569> something<00:03:28.810> if<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.440> suspect<00:03:30.010> any

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
definitely something if you suspect any

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.740 
definitely something if you suspect any

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
sure that it's it's going to last a long

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.960 
sure that it's it's going to last a long
time<00:03:53.160> because<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.430> don't<00:03:54.579> want<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.819> have<00:03:54.940> a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
time because you don't want to have a

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.140 
time because you don't want to have a
sort<00:03:55.329> of<00:03:55.389> problem<00:03:55.720> on<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.870> road<00:03:56.849> lets<00:03:57.849> out<00:03:58.030> of

sort of problem on the road lets out of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.509 
sort of problem on the road lets out of
that<00:03:58.269> I<00:03:58.299> think<00:03:58.480> that's<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:59.129> I'm<00:04:00.129> just<00:04:00.280> going<00:04:00.459> to

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
that I think that's it I'm just going to

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.819 
that I think that's it I'm just going to
slide<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:00.909> on<00:04:01.090> out<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.569> by<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.349> way<00:04:02.440> it'll

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
slide this on out and by the way it'll

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.220 
slide this on out and by the way it'll
take<00:04:03.069> like<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.340> little<00:04:03.459> pry<00:04:03.760> bar<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.299> kind<00:04:05.079> of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
take like a little pry bar to kind of

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.740 
take like a little pry bar to kind of
you<00:04:06.069> can<00:04:06.220> even<00:04:06.310> see<00:04:06.609> that<00:04:06.639> to<00:04:06.940> kind<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.239> get<00:04:07.480> a

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you can even see that to kind of get a

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.349 
you can even see that to kind of get a
move<00:04:08.560> this<00:04:08.769> thing<00:04:09.010> between<00:04:09.519> here<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.030> here

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
move this thing between here and here

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.300 
move this thing between here and here
because<00:04:10.599> it's<00:04:10.780> that<00:04:11.260> alternator<00:04:11.739> is<00:04:11.889> stuck<00:04:12.129> in

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
because it's that alternator is stuck in

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.399 
because it's that alternator is stuck in
there<00:04:12.430> pretty<00:04:12.489> tight<00:04:12.989> better<00:04:13.989> comes<00:04:14.229> out

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
there pretty tight better comes out

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.649 
there pretty tight better comes out
pretty<00:04:14.500> easy<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.280> so<00:04:16.060> I<00:04:16.090> think<00:04:16.209> that's<00:04:16.479> pretty

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659 
pretty easy so so I think that's pretty

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.599 
pretty easy so so I think that's pretty
much<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.900> for<00:04:17.079> now<00:04:17.349> good<00:04:18.039> yourself<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.489> good

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
much it for now good yourself a good

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.279 
much it for now good yourself a good
alternator<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.479> don't<00:04:19.840> want<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.049> go<00:04:20.109> through

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
alternator you don't want to go through

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.640 
alternator you don't want to go through
this<00:04:20.440> on<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.739> road<00:04:20.889> that's<00:04:21.669> it<00:04:21.849> I<00:04:22.289> just<00:04:23.289> want

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
this on the road that's it I just want

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.529 
this on the road that's it I just want
to<00:04:23.710> take<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.889> quick<00:04:24.190> finished<00:04:24.760> video<00:04:25.090> here<00:04:25.510> I

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
to take a quick finished video here I

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.010 
to take a quick finished video here I
took<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.960> on<00:04:26.050> out<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:27.510> everything<00:04:28.510> came<00:04:28.870> out

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
took it on out and everything came out

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.770 
took it on out and everything came out
okay<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:30.610> only<00:04:30.849> additional<00:04:31.210> reliant

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
okay the only additional reliant

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.300 
okay the only additional reliant
how<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:31.870> take<00:04:32.080> off<00:04:32.260> is<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.560> little<00:04:32.889> pose

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
how to take off is that little pose

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.060 
how to take off is that little pose
right<00:04:33.670> there<00:04:33.730> that's<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.300> coolant<00:04:34.690> hose<00:04:35.070> so

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
right there that's the coolant hose so

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.400 
right there that's the coolant hose so
I've<00:04:36.400> got<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:37.000> little<00:04:37.300> bag<00:04:37.510> tie<00:04:37.990> wrap<00:04:38.230> down

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
I've got a little bag tie wrap down

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.960 
I've got a little bag tie wrap down
there<00:04:38.650> to<00:04:38.740> keep<00:04:38.920> the<00:04:39.070> coolant<00:04:39.430> for<00:04:39.580> coming<00:04:39.880> on

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
there to keep the coolant for coming on

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.310 
there to keep the coolant for coming on
out

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
out

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.400 
out
and<00:04:41.980> of<00:04:42.580> course<00:04:42.850> you<00:04:43.060> let's<00:04:43.540> just<00:04:44.050> get<00:04:44.260> have<00:04:44.350> to

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
and of course you let's just get have to

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.140 
and of course you let's just get have to
be<00:04:44.590> real<00:04:44.800> patient<00:04:44.980> and<00:04:45.400> careful<00:04:45.610> with<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:45.970> you

don't<00:04:46.240> have<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.450> brute-force<00:04:46.720> it<00:04:47.200> if<00:04:47.440> you

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
don't have to brute-force it if you

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.860 
don't have to brute-force it if you
o'clock<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.100> often<00:04:48.460> here<00:04:48.639> and<00:04:48.790> right<00:04:49.000> it

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
o'clock that often here and right it

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.830 
o'clock that often here and right it
won't<00:04:50.110> come<00:04:50.290> out<00:04:50.440> there<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.600> again<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.720> need

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
won't come out there and again you need

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.100 
won't come out there and again you need
to<00:04:52.900> be<00:04:53.080> able<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.260> push<00:04:53.530> these<00:04:54.210> up<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.389> AC<00:04:55.630> line

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
to be able to push these up to AC line

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.879 
to be able to push these up to AC line
right<00:04:56.350> here<00:04:56.590> back<00:04:57.900> behind<00:04:58.900> there<00:04:59.380> because

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
right here back behind there because

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.159 
right here back behind there because
with<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.430> AC<00:05:00.760> line<00:05:01.150> in<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.450> way<00:05:01.570> it's<00:05:01.900> going

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
with that AC line in the way it's going

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.960 
with that AC line in the way it's going
to<00:05:02.230> be<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.410> good<00:05:02.980> challenge<00:05:03.250> getting<00:05:03.700> that<00:05:03.820> on

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
to be a good challenge getting that on

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.570 
to be a good challenge getting that on
out<00:05:04.120> of<00:05:04.150> there<00:05:04.620> again<00:05:05.620> you<00:05:05.800> want<00:05:05.980> to<00:05:06.070> protect

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
out of there again you want to protect

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.530 
out of there again you want to protect
yura<00:05:06.820> yura<00:05:08.190> your<00:05:09.190> radiator<00:05:09.790> here<00:05:10.030> with<00:05:10.330> that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
yura yura your radiator here with that

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.240 
yura yura your radiator here with that
piece<00:05:10.750> of<00:05:10.780> cardboard<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.470> keep<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.980> from

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
piece of cardboard and keep that from

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.300 
piece of cardboard and keep that from
getting<00:05:12.760> damaged<00:05:13.230> so<00:05:14.230> I<00:05:14.260> think<00:05:14.950> that's<00:05:15.190> that

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
getting damaged so I think that's that

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.280 
getting damaged so I think that's that
