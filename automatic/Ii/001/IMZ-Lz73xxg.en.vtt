00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
blemishes here little blemishes here

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.719 
blemishes here little blemishes here
yeah<00:02:08.060> pretty<00:02:08.630> much<00:02:08.750> that's<00:02:09.619> about<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.130> so

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
yeah pretty much that's about it so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.270 
yeah pretty much that's about it so
let's<00:02:10.910> go<00:02:11.060> ahead<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.360> see<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.780> has<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.470> doe

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
let's go ahead and see this has a doe

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520 
let's go ahead and see this has a doe
foot<00:02:13.550> applicator<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.630> looks<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:15.080> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
foot applicator so it looks like that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.740 
foot applicator so it looks like that
and<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.940> think<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.330> gonna<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.570> way<00:02:17.720> too

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
and I think this is gonna be way too

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.510 
and I think this is gonna be way too
dark<00:02:18.110> for<00:02:18.170> me<00:02:18.380> but<00:02:18.590> let's<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.040> ahead<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.340> just

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
dark for me but let's go ahead and just

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.300 
dark for me but let's go ahead and just
dab<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.990> actually<00:02:21.110> looks<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:21.620> my<00:02:21.950> skin

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
dab it on it actually looks like my skin

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.660 
dab it on it actually looks like my skin
color<00:02:22.520> which<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.880> actually<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.660> nice<00:02:23.930> so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
color which is actually really nice so

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.310 
color which is actually really nice so
typically<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.820> go<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.090> light<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.750> concealers

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
typically I go to light with concealers

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.780 
typically I go to light with concealers
and<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> can't<00:02:27.860> use<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.190> my<00:02:28.250> face<00:02:28.280> so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and then I can't use it on my face so

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.670 
and then I can't use it on my face so
I've<00:02:29.330> just<00:02:29.390> dabbed<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.930> on<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.260> part<00:02:30.470> where<00:02:30.650> I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
I've just dabbed it on the part where I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.020 
I've just dabbed it on the part where I
want<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.130> conceal<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.640> I'm<00:02:31.700> gonna<00:02:31.790> try

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
want to conceal it and I'm gonna try

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:42.750 
want to conceal it and I'm gonna try
using<00:02:32.180> my<00:02:32.420> Beauty<00:02:32.630> Blender

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 

okay<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.569> I<00:02:43.690> think<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.930> did<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.110> really<00:02:44.379> good<00:02:44.590> job

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
okay so I think I did a really good job

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.890 
okay so I think I did a really good job
covering<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.909> is<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.180> same<00:02:46.390> color<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.720> my

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
covering and it is the same color of my

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.500 
covering and it is the same color of my
skin<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.610> I'll<00:02:48.610> give<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.239> what<00:02:49.360> did

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
skin so I'll give it that it what did

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.000 
skin so I'll give it that it what did
work<00:02:49.690> good<00:02:49.840> let's<00:02:50.049> see<00:02:50.170> my<00:02:50.319> under-eye<00:02:50.620> circles

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
work good let's see my under-eye circles

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.860 
work good let's see my under-eye circles
I<00:02:51.720> would<00:02:52.720> probably<00:02:52.989> use<00:02:53.260> a<00:02:53.440> lighter<00:02:53.769> concealer

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
I would probably use a lighter concealer

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.509 
I would probably use a lighter concealer
it's<00:02:55.870> quite<00:02:56.140> thick<00:02:56.530> I'll<00:02:57.010> tell<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.340> who<00:02:57.489> that

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
it's quite thick I'll tell you who that

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.210 
it's quite thick I'll tell you who that
look<00:02:58.420> at<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.720> baby<00:02:58.989> let's<00:02:59.709> go<00:02:59.830> ahead<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.099> try

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
look at that baby let's go ahead and try

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:12.970 
look at that baby let's go ahead and try
maybe<00:03:00.370> people<00:03:00.580> under<00:03:00.849> again

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.420 

okay

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.160 

so<00:03:17.939> I<00:03:18.000> would<00:03:18.150> typically<00:03:18.450> say<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> would<00:03:18.989> use<00:03:19.140> a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
so I would typically say I would use a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.080 
so I would typically say I would use a
lighter<00:03:19.530> shadow<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.189> I<00:03:20.579> mean<00:03:20.730> a<00:03:20.760> lighter

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
lighter shadow but I mean a lighter

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.380 
lighter shadow but I mean a lighter
shade<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:21.689> it<00:03:21.720> did<00:03:22.129> cover<00:03:23.129> a<00:03:23.489> little<00:03:24.030> bit<00:03:24.120> up<00:03:24.269> I

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
shade but it did cover a little bit up I

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.690 
shade but it did cover a little bit up I
think<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.689> did<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.079> let's<00:03:25.799> go<00:03:25.920> ahead<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.400> try

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
think it did so let's go ahead and try

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.280 
think it did so let's go ahead and try
it's<00:03:27.329> kind<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.540> hard<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.049> first

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
it's kind of hard to do a first

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.710 
it's kind of hard to do a first
impression<00:03:28.739> of<00:03:28.799> a<00:03:28.890> concealer<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:29.720> it's

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
impression of a concealer but it's

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.949 
impression of a concealer but it's
buttoned<00:03:31.049> a<00:03:31.170> bit<00:03:31.409> around<00:03:31.620> my<00:03:31.819> nose<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:32.959> try

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
buttoned a bit around my nose and try

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.020 
buttoned a bit around my nose and try
the<00:03:34.019> p80<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:37.890> did<00:03:38.069> blend<00:03:38.310> really<00:03:38.489> well<00:03:38.670> with<00:03:38.909> my

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
the p80 it did blend really well with my

sometimes it'll look perfect in person
and<00:04:59.100> then<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.310> camera<00:04:59.580> people<00:04:59.790> are<00:04:59.880> like<00:04:59.970> what

little<00:05:21.720> bit<00:05:21.810> of<00:05:21.840> powder<00:05:22.110> instead<00:05:22.590> of<00:05:22.740> wearing

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
little bit of powder instead of wearing

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.310 
little bit of powder instead of wearing
like<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.430> full-fledged<00:05:24.090> foundation<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.080> see

can<00:05:27.420> actually<00:05:27.600> just<00:05:28.260> cover<00:05:28.560> up<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.860> spots

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
can actually just cover up the spots

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.620 
can actually just cover up the spots
that<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.310> want<00:05:29.520> but<00:05:29.730> keep<00:05:29.910> my<00:05:30.030> skin<00:05:30.390> and

that I want but keep my skin and

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.510 
that I want but keep my skin and
typically<00:05:31.230> I<00:05:31.350> can't<00:05:31.680> do<00:05:31.950> that<00:05:32.070> typically<00:05:32.400> I

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
typically I can't do that typically I

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.100 
typically I can't do that typically I
just<00:05:32.790> have<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:32.970> put<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.120> sheer<00:05:33.390> layer<00:05:33.570> all<00:05:33.840> over

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
just have to put a sheer layer all over

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.840 
just have to put a sheer layer all over
my<00:05:34.230> face<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.680> just<00:05:35.190> like<00:05:35.280> a<00:05:35.310> foundation<00:05:35.790> or

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
something because I when I spot conceal

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.030 
something because I when I spot conceal
it<00:05:38.790> just<00:05:39.000> doesn't<00:05:39.570> blend<00:05:40.200> into<00:05:40.530> my<00:05:40.590> skin<00:05:40.890> or

it just doesn't blend into my skin or

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.450
