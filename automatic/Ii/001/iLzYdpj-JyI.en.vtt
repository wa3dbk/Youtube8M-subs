00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
rail gun train and minecraft and I think

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.950

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
train from episode 3 I think it was also

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.800 
train from episode 3 I think it was also
like<00:00:19.140> an<00:00:19.260> end<00:00:19.470> near<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.770> end<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.100> episode<00:00:20.490> 2

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
like an end near the end of episode 2

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.920 
like an end near the end of episode 2
but<00:00:21.810> yes<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.949> have<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.220> jump<00:00:23.580> on<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.200 

you<00:00:29.560> can<00:00:29.680> see<00:00:29.830> that<00:00:29.949> moving<00:00:30.310> on<00:00:30.430> we<00:00:30.970> have<00:00:31.119> to

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
you can see that moving on we have to

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.660 
you can see that moving on we have to
jump<00:00:31.390> on<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.630> train<00:00:31.900> and<00:00:32.110> I'd<00:00:32.710> steal<00:00:33.250> it<00:00:33.430> so

is and it's one of my favorite chapters
one<00:00:46.300> of<00:00:46.390> my<00:00:46.449> favorite<00:00:46.750> levels<00:00:47.050> from<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.199> game

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
one of my favorite levels from the game

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.020 
one of my favorite levels from the game
even<00:00:47.650> though<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:47.769> lot<00:00:48.250> of<00:00:48.460> people<00:00:48.640> don't<00:00:48.910> really

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
even though a lot of people don't really

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.650 
even though a lot of people don't really
like<00:00:49.150> like<00:00:50.019> it<00:00:50.199> a<00:00:50.260> lot<00:00:50.410> but<00:00:50.769> I<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:52.329> know<00:00:52.390> just

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
like like it a lot but I don't know just

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.420 
like like it a lot but I don't know just
I<00:00:52.750> think<00:00:53.050> so<00:00:53.379> some<00:00:53.620> people<00:00:53.980> just<00:00:54.129> don't<00:00:54.309> really

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
I think so some people just don't really

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.270 
I think so some people just don't really
like<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:54.940> but<00:00:55.180> I<00:00:55.449> think<00:00:56.409> it<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:56.769> one<00:00:57.070> of<00:00:57.100> the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
like it but I think it is one of the

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.509 
like it but I think it is one of the
better<00:00:57.640> levels<00:00:58.829> although<00:00:59.829> before<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> patch

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
better levels although before the patch

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.430 
better levels although before the patch
where<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:01.059> could<00:01:01.239> respawn<00:01:01.600> after<00:01:01.839> you<00:01:02.049> die<00:01:02.199> at

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
where you could respawn after you die at

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.950 
where you could respawn after you die at
a<00:01:02.470> boss<00:01:02.909> before<00:01:03.909> that<00:01:04.089> it<00:01:04.299> was<00:01:04.420> kind<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.780> thee

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
a boss before that it was kind of thee

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.460 
a boss before that it was kind of thee

but now but they fixed that now after
you<00:01:08.710> die<00:01:08.830> at<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.070> boss<00:01:09.310> she<00:01:09.520> was<00:01:09.670> born<00:01:09.880> at<00:01:10.060> the
