00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that was have to be done the dash itself

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
that was have to be done the dash itself
is<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.630> pretty<00:01:42.930> decent<00:01:43.140> shape<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.829> know

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
is in pretty decent shape I don't know

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.420 
is in pretty decent shape I don't know
if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.280> actually<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.430> so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
if you can actually see that but so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.580 
if you can actually see that but so
they're<00:01:48.390> looking<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.899> -<00:01:49.079> there's<00:01:49.380> one

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
they're looking at the - there's one

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.139 
they're looking at the - there's one
crack<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:55.149 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.849 

may<00:01:55.719> be<00:01:55.780> able<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.049> see<00:01:56.259> another<00:01:56.350> crack<00:01:56.859> there

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
may be able to see another crack there

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.730 
may be able to see another crack there
so<00:01:59.859> that's<00:02:00.579> for<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.149> most<00:02:01.390> part<00:02:01.630> on<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.840> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
so that's for the most part on that the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.330 
so that's for the most part on that the
front<00:02:03.369> chrome<00:02:03.750> could<00:02:04.750> use<00:02:05.020> some<00:02:05.350> refreshing<00:02:06.159> I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
front chrome could use some refreshing I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.580 
front chrome could use some refreshing I
would<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.719> car<00:02:07.960> was<00:02:08.170> painted

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
would do that the car was painted

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.699 
would do that the car was painted
probably<00:02:09.190> about<00:02:09.399> four<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.849> five<00:02:09.879> years<00:02:10.330> ago

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
probably about four to five years ago

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.710 
probably about four to five years ago
here's<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.519> chrome<00:02:12.910> piece<00:02:13.209> that's<00:02:13.510> missing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
here's that chrome piece that's missing

go back and forth as you can see here by

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.409 
go back and forth as you can see here by
listening<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:54.639> can<00:03:54.700> actually<00:03:55.180> hear<00:03:55.389> the

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
listening you can actually hear the

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.000 
listening you can actually hear the
motor<00:03:55.780> turning<00:03:56.530> they're<00:03:57.419> up<00:03:58.419> and<00:03:58.690> down<00:03:59.010> but

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
motor turning they're up and down but

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.729 
motor turning they're up and down but
the<00:04:00.220> but<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:00.790> actually<00:04:00.970> doesn't<00:04:01.389> move<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.079> at

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
the but it actually doesn't move so at

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.559 
the but it actually doesn't move so at
this<00:04:02.829> point<00:04:03.069> I'll<00:04:03.700> go<00:04:03.760> ahead<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.269> crank<00:04:04.420> the

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
this point I'll go ahead and crank the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.330 
this point I'll go ahead and crank the
car<00:04:04.780> up<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.200> maybe<00:04:05.409> we'll<00:04:05.590> let<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.890> top<00:04:06.099> down

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
car up and maybe we'll let the top down

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.010 
car up and maybe we'll let the top down
and<00:04:07.200> go<00:04:08.200> from<00:04:08.319> there

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.270 

so<00:04:14.020> as<00:04:14.080> you<00:04:14.200> can<00:04:14.350> see<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.590> car<00:04:14.800> cranks<00:04:15.070> up

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280

replaced<00:04:35.890> it<00:04:36.070> with<00:04:36.100> a<00:04:36.250> CD<00:04:36.850> player<00:04:36.910> instead<00:04:37.390> of

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
replaced it with a CD player instead of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.010 
replaced it with a CD player instead of
a<00:04:37.630> tape<00:04:37.810> player<00:04:39.270> let's<00:04:40.270> go<00:04:40.390> ahead<00:04:40.480> and<00:04:40.720> let<00:04:40.870> the

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
a tape player let's go ahead and let the

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.070 
a tape player let's go ahead and let the
top<00:04:41.230> down<00:04:41.470> so<00:04:41.770> there's<00:04:42.580> the<00:04:43.210> top<00:04:43.450> button<00:04:43.870> there

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
top down so there's the top button there

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:57.540 
top down so there's the top button there
so<00:04:46.650> here's<00:04:47.650> two<00:04:48.930> levels<00:04:49.930> here<00:04:50.140> too

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.010 

we'll<00:04:58.090> take<00:04:58.330> these<00:04:58.569> out<00:05:00.630> give<00:05:01.630> me<00:05:01.660> a<00:05:01.810> little

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
we'll take these out give me a little

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.010 
we'll take these out give me a little
tough<00:05:02.229> to<00:05:02.259> get<00:05:02.500> out<00:05:02.650> sometime<00:05:03.130> time<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:04.630> I'll

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
tough to get out sometime time so I'll

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.440 
tough to get out sometime time so I'll
go<00:05:05.139> ahead<00:05:05.169> and<00:05:05.380> let<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.530> top<00:05:05.740> down

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.860 

so<00:05:13.050> minute<00:05:13.380> waves<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:13.860> see<00:05:13.890> here<00:05:14.570> tough<00:05:15.570> going

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
so minute waves you see here tough going

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.469 
so minute waves you see here tough going
back<00:05:16.170> in<00:05:16.380> pretty<00:05:16.920> good<00:05:17.040> shape

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.920 

okay<00:05:22.219> all<00:05:23.219> of<00:05:23.279> the<00:05:23.550> windows<00:05:23.879> are<00:05:24.210> electric<00:05:24.749> and

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
okay all of the windows are electric and

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.030 
okay all of the windows are electric and
they<00:05:24.990> all<00:05:25.139> work

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:38.370 

see<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.760> from<00:05:29.970> here<00:05:31.490> shows<00:05:32.490> here

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.650 

and<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.830> course<00:05:39.040> the<00:05:39.160> last<00:05:39.420> let's<00:05:40.420> go<00:05:40.600> ahead

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
and of course the last let's go ahead

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:53.890 
and of course the last let's go ahead
and<00:05:40.870> pop<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.170> hood

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.050 

so<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.650> engine<00:05:54.950> runs<00:05:55.220> pretty<00:05:55.460> good<00:05:55.610> actually

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
so the engine runs pretty good actually

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.420 
so the engine runs pretty good actually
and<00:05:56.990> had<00:05:57.320> any<00:05:57.530> problems<00:05:57.980> out<00:05:58.160> of<00:05:58.190> it

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
and had any problems out of it

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.580 
and had any problems out of it
whatsoever<00:05:58.760> it's<00:05:59.690> never<00:05:59.930> been<00:06:00.110> overhauled

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
whatsoever it's never been overhauled

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.670 
whatsoever it's never been overhauled
still<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.460> original<00:06:02.210> engine<00:06:02.680> patent

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
still it original engine patent

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.260 
still it original engine patent
transmission<00:06:04.310> rebuild<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.790> few<00:06:04.970> years<00:06:05.180> ago<00:06:07.270> you

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
transmission rebuild a few years ago you

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.750 
transmission rebuild a few years ago you
can<00:06:08.420> see<00:06:08.540> here<00:06:08.720> so<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:08.960> got<00:06:09.170> a<00:06:09.580> pretty<00:06:10.580> big

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
can see here so you got a pretty big

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.080 
can see here so you got a pretty big
powerful<00:06:11.030> 455<00:06:11.990> so<00:06:12.290> has<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:12.650> ring

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.920 

iran's<00:06:17.960> pretty<00:06:18.320> good

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.960 

so<00:06:24.590> some<00:06:25.070> of<00:06:25.100> the<00:06:25.280> things<00:06:25.460> that<00:06:25.820> would

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:25.970 
so some of the things that would

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.370 
so some of the things that would
definitely<00:06:26.120> have<00:06:26.419> to<00:06:26.479> be<00:06:26.690> repaired<00:06:27.050> on<00:06:27.259> this

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
definitely have to be repaired on this

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.890 
definitely have to be repaired on this
car<00:06:27.620> since<00:06:27.860> usual<00:06:28.280> you<00:06:28.759> seen<00:06:29.000> pretty<00:06:29.509> much<00:06:29.600> all

car since usual you seen pretty much all
of<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.110> good<00:06:30.290> stuff<00:06:31.750> all<00:06:32.750> of<00:06:32.990> the<00:06:33.080> floor<00:06:33.530> pans

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
of the good stuff all of the floor pans

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.550 
of the good stuff all of the floor pans
in<00:06:34.160> good<00:06:34.340> shape<00:06:34.580> except<00:06:35.090> this<00:06:35.270> one<00:06:35.690> particular

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
in good shape except this one particular

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.170 
in good shape except this one particular
one<00:06:37.190> here<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:38.169> was<00:06:39.169> gonna<00:06:39.289> have<00:06:39.470> a<00:06:39.710> guy<00:06:39.970> do<00:06:40.970> some

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:41.180 
one here I was gonna have a guy do some

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.310 
one here I was gonna have a guy do some
welding<00:06:41.389> for<00:06:41.870> me<00:06:42.759> essentially<00:06:43.759> he<00:06:43.850> told<00:06:44.090> me

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
welding for me essentially he told me

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.100 
welding for me essentially he told me
roughly<00:06:45.320> about<00:06:45.470> 300<00:06:46.130> dollars<00:06:46.190> and<00:06:46.550> he<00:06:46.639> could

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.110 
roughly about 300 dollars and he could

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.409 
roughly about 300 dollars and he could
repair<00:06:48.110> this<00:06:48.320> here<00:06:48.650> so<00:06:49.610> that<00:06:49.789> would<00:06:50.030> have<00:06:50.270> to

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
repair this here so that would have to

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:54.010 
repair this here so that would have to
be<00:06:50.539> repaired<00:06:52.030> but<00:06:53.030> the<00:06:53.090> rest<00:06:53.389> of<00:06:53.509> the<00:06:53.570> pans<00:06:53.810> are

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
be repaired but the rest of the pans are

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.350 
be repaired but the rest of the pans are
all<00:06:54.139> solid<00:06:55.389> very<00:06:56.389> little<00:06:56.780> rust<00:06:56.930> in<00:06:57.169> this<00:06:57.320> car

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 
all solid very little rust in this car

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.270 
all solid very little rust in this car
the<00:06:59.360> original<00:07:00.169> Georgia<00:07:00.470> car<00:07:00.710> that<00:07:00.949> this<00:07:01.100> car

all your lights work the interior lights

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.040 
all your lights work the interior lights
actually<00:07:14.440> need<00:07:15.440> some<00:07:15.710> work<00:07:15.979> but<00:07:17.050> exterior

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
actually need some work but exterior

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:32.330 
actually need some work but exterior
lights<00:07:18.289> all<00:07:18.789> all<00:07:19.789> good<00:07:20.060> as<00:07:20.300> you<00:07:20.449> can<00:07:20.539> see

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.520 

so<00:07:32.910> that<00:07:33.060> all<00:07:33.180> works<00:07:34.070> so<00:07:35.070> again<00:07:35.340> this<00:07:35.490> is<00:07:35.670> the
