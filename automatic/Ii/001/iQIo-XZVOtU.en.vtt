00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.310 

more<00:01:52.580> typical<00:01:52.940> thing<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.210> people<00:01:53.480> the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
more typical thing that people the

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.110 
more typical thing that people the
biggest<00:01:55.130> challenge<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.580> have<00:01:55.730> is<00:01:55.820> trying<00:01:56.030> to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
biggest challenge you have is trying to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.400 
biggest challenge you have is trying to
get<00:01:56.180> the<00:01:56.300> car<00:01:56.450> rolling<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:56.930> balancing<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
get the car rolling and balancing the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.440 
get the car rolling and balancing the
throttle<00:01:57.830> and<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:57.950> clutch<00:01:58.190> together<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:59.330> the

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
throttle and the clutch together so the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.480 
throttle and the clutch together so the
trick<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.660> to<00:01:59.810> take<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.800> person's<00:02:01.130> right<00:02:01.310> foot

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
trick is to take the person's right foot

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.070 
trick is to take the person's right foot
and<00:02:01.610> put<00:02:01.760> it<00:02:01.850> under<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.090> seat<00:02:02.300> don't<00:02:02.840> touch

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
and put it under the seat don't touch

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.420 
and put it under the seat don't touch
the<00:02:03.290> throttle<00:02:03.470> put<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.860> car<00:02:04.010> in<00:02:04.070> first<00:02:04.250> gear

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
the throttle put the car in first gear

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.130 
the throttle put the car in first gear
clutch<00:02:04.730> down<00:02:04.970> car<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:05.480> first<00:02:05.660> gear<00:02:05.840> engine

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
clutch down car in first gear engine

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.720 
clutch down car in first gear engine
running<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.410> slowly<00:02:07.070> let<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.310> clutch<00:02:07.550> out

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
running and slowly let the clutch out

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.920 
running and slowly let the clutch out
and<00:02:07.940> chances<00:02:08.150> are<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:08.510> probably<00:02:08.540> going<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
and chances are you probably going to

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.020 
and chances are you probably going to
stall<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.260> first<00:02:09.470> time<00:02:09.530> but<00:02:09.890> when<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:10.820> car

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
stall it the first time but when the car

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.490 
stall it the first time but when the car
starts<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.510> move<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:11.990> let<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> clutch<00:02:12.230> out

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
starts to move just let the clutch out

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.680 
starts to move just let the clutch out
slower<00:02:12.770> next<00:02:12.980> time<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.490> all<00:02:13.640> cars<00:02:14.450> do<00:02:14.600> they

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
slower next time and all cars do they

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:15.940 
slower next time and all cars do they
have<00:02:14.810> enough<00:02:14.930> torque<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.320> get<00:02:15.530> rolling<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
have enough torque to get rolling you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.810 
have enough torque to get rolling you
have<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.160> make<00:02:16.280> sure<00:02:16.400> you're<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.610> flat

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
have to make sure you're on a flat

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.500 
have to make sure you're on a flat
surface<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:17.300> course<00:02:21.550> I'm<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.880> nervous<00:02:23.120> because

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
surface of course I'm so nervous because

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.240 
surface of course I'm so nervous because
now<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:24.110> really<00:02:24.290> look<00:02:24.440> like<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.590> solidity<00:02:24.980> if<00:02:25.130> I
