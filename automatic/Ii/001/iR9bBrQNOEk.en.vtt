of wood what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna
take<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> cut<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.220> in<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.310> half<00:00:28.730> if<00:00:29.730> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
take it and cut it in about half if I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.930 
take it and cut it in about half if I
can

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.760

and I'm going to show you a little trick

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.660 
and I'm going to show you a little trick
that<00:00:38.630> I<00:00:38.900> do<00:00:39.760> with<00:00:40.760> these<00:00:40.970> pulleys<00:00:42.310> are<00:00:43.310> these

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
that I do with these pulleys are these

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.210 
that I do with these pulleys are these
Springs<00:00:44.330> on<00:00:44.870> these<00:00:45.140> pulleys<00:00:45.470> because<00:00:46.040> these

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
Springs on these pulleys because these

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.640 
Springs on these pulleys because these
Springs<00:00:46.640> if<00:00:47.270> you<00:00:47.390> notice<00:00:47.720> they're<00:00:47.930> metal<00:00:48.470> to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
Springs if you notice they're metal to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.650 
Springs if you notice they're metal to
metal<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:50.770> this<00:00:51.770> spring<00:00:52.220> will<00:00:52.940> pull<00:00:53.300> through

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
metal and this spring will pull through

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.650 
metal and this spring will pull through
this<00:00:53.900> metal<00:00:54.460> over<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.490> period<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.910> time<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:56.510> will

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
this metal over a period of time it will

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.960 
this metal over a period of time it will
actually<00:00:57.110> wear<00:00:57.830> itself<00:00:58.190> all<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.460> way<00:00:58.610> through

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
actually wear itself all the way through

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.320 
actually wear itself all the way through
it

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:10.500 
it
so<00:00:59.690> what<00:00:59.900> I'm<00:01:00.020> going<00:01:00.200> to<00:01:00.260> do<00:01:03.339> is<00:01:04.339> I'm<00:01:04.580> going<00:01:04.610> to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.440 

take<00:01:11.510> that<00:01:11.690> spring<00:01:12.110> off<00:01:12.820> just<00:01:13.820> for<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.270> second

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
take that spring off just for a second

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.760 
take that spring off just for a second
and<00:01:17.450> I'm<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:17.869> put<00:01:18.080> a<00:01:18.110> little<00:01:18.290> piece<00:01:18.590> of

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
and I'm going to put a little piece of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.870 
and I'm going to put a little piece of
wood<00:01:18.950> here

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.360 

if<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.390> can<00:01:26.570> see<00:01:26.900> this<00:01:27.140> trying<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:27.979> get<00:01:28.100> a<00:01:28.159> word

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
if you can see this trying to get a word

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.530 
if you can see this trying to get a word
the<00:01:28.640> camera<00:01:29.000> can<00:01:29.150> see<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:30.880> get<00:01:31.880> good<00:01:32.060> picture

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
the camera can see it get good picture

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:41.380 
the camera can see it get good picture
but<00:01:34.270> all<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.300> want<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.750> do

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:54.760 

take<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.510> wood<00:01:42.690> chip<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.760> put<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.510> place

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.730 

the<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.160> does<00:01:56.750> my<00:01:57.750> spring<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.410> you<00:01:58.440> see

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
the one that does my spring if you see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.249 
the one that does my spring if you see
you<00:01:59.130> still<00:01:59.430> see<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> metal<00:02:00.119> piece<00:02:00.330> coming

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
you still see the metal piece coming

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 
you still see the metal piece coming
through<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:01.650> it's<00:02:01.830> still<00:02:02.040> hooked<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:03.420> won't<00:02:03.630> go

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
through so it's still hooked it won't go

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
through so it's still hooked it won't go
anywhere<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.619> tighten<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.100> up<00:02:05.190> just<00:02:05.430> an

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
anywhere you tighten it up just an

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.889 
anywhere you tighten it up just an
itty-bitty<00:02:06.000> bit<00:02:07.280> but<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.520> instead<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.390> metal

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
itty-bitty bit but now instead of metal

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.460 
itty-bitty bit but now instead of metal
against<00:02:10.350> metal<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:10.950> metal<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.670> wood<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:13.260> will

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
against metal it's metal to wood it will

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.300 
against metal it's metal to wood it will
last<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:14.190> lot<00:02:14.459> longer<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:16.769> just<00:02:17.040> let<00:02:17.190> them

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
last a lot longer and I just let them

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.530 
last a lot longer and I just let them
keep<00:02:17.489> wearing<00:02:17.880> through<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> little<00:02:18.330> pieces

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
keep wearing through the little pieces

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.400 
keep wearing through the little pieces
of<00:02:18.690> wood<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:20.570> as<00:02:21.570> I've<00:02:21.810> replaced<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
of wood and as I've replaced this

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.800 
of wood and as I've replaced this
already<00:02:22.890> now<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.340> one's<00:02:23.580> probably<00:02:23.730> got<00:02:24.030> 1500

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
already now this one's probably got 1500

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.740 
already now this one's probably got 1500
hours<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.190> first<00:02:26.489> one<00:02:26.760> wore<00:02:27.000> out<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.450> a

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
hours on it the first one wore out in a

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.420 
hours on it the first one wore out in a
very<00:02:27.930> short<00:02:28.260> period<00:02:28.470> of<00:02:28.590> time<00:02:28.680> becomes<00:02:29.220> these

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
very short period of time becomes these

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.150 
very short period of time becomes these
springs<00:02:29.820> wore<00:02:30.150> through<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:34.010> what<00:02:35.010> you

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
springs wore through it so what you

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.100 
springs wore through it so what you
would<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.610> do<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.330> let<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.720> springs

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
would have to do if you let the springs

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.569 
would have to do if you let the springs
wear<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.690> normally<00:02:39.739> was<00:02:40.739> either<00:02:41.040> replace

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
wear on it normally was either replace

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:47.330 
wear on it normally was either replace
this<00:02:41.880> piece<00:02:42.680> or<00:02:44.780> go<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.140> shop<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.980> have<00:02:47.160> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
this piece or go to the shop and have it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.949 
this piece or go to the shop and have it
welded<00:02:47.760> back<00:02:47.940> together<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.660 

it's<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.439> lot<00:02:52.590> easier<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:53.040> just<00:02:53.129> put<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.519> little

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
it's a lot easier to just put a little

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.660 
it's a lot easier to just put a little
piece<00:02:53.879> of<00:02:54.030> wood<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.390> there<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:56.010> wood<00:02:56.250> works

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
piece of wood in there the wood works

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.880 
piece of wood in there the wood works
well<00:02:57.060> so<00:02:58.370> if<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.549> got<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.790> situation<00:03:00.709> it's<00:03:01.709> just

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
well so if you got a situation it's just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.289 
well so if you got a situation it's just
a<00:03:02.010> little<00:03:02.189> trick<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.909> come<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.329> with<00:03:05.299> you

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
a little trick that I come up with you
