you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.449> I've<00:01:03.570> done<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.199> put

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you can see that I've done here to put

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.700 
you can see that I've done here to put
the<00:01:04.589> paint<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.900> using<00:01:06.930> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the paint into and we do that using the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.649 
the paint into and we do that using the
model<00:01:08.070> plate<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.460> pretty<00:01:11.670> hard<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.420> have

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
model plate so it's pretty hard you have

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
model plate so it's pretty hard you have
to<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.560> kind<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> mold<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> heat<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> up

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
to really kind of mold it and heat it up

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
to really kind of mold it and heat it up
for<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> while<00:01:17.000> once<00:01:18.000> you've<00:01:18.210> kneaded<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.009> fimo

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
for a while once you've kneaded the fimo

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.429 
for a while once you've kneaded the fimo
enough<00:01:20.369> until<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.850> soft<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.020> start

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
enough until it's soft you can start

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.319 
enough until it's soft you can start
making<00:01:22.710> little<00:01:23.490> barriers<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.240> tin

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
making little barriers in your tin

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.840 
making little barriers in your tin
you<00:01:27.329> would<00:01:28.259> turn<00:01:28.790> your<00:01:29.790> head<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.659> other<00:01:30.689> way

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
you would turn your head the other way

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.319 
you would turn your head the other way
so<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.880> won't<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.350> listen<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:36.299> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
so you won't have to listen to what I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.460 
so you won't have to listen to what I
had<00:01:36.899> to<00:01:37.229> say<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:40.229> so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
had to say you are so

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.620 
had to say you are so
I need<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.070> didn't<00:01:45.670> realize<00:01:46.600> that

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
I need you but you didn't realize that

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.110 
I need you but you didn't realize that
it's<00:01:47.440> not<00:01:47.590> perfect<00:01:48.100> but<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.490> think<00:01:48.550> it'll<00:01:48.910> do

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
it's not perfect but I think it'll do

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.690 
it's not perfect but I think it'll do
the<00:01:49.240> job<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:50.320> once<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.830> finish<00:01:51.040> putting<00:01:51.430> all

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
the job so once you finish putting all

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.760 
the job so once you finish putting all
your<00:01:51.730> little<00:01:52.030> BMO<00:01:52.750> barriers<00:01:53.260> into<00:01:53.470> place

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
your little BMO barriers into place

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.710 
your little BMO barriers into place
you're<00:01:54.460> actually<00:01:54.700> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.910> bake<00:01:55.150> this<00:01:55.450> whole

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
you're actually going to bake this whole

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.700 
you're actually going to bake this whole
thing<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.790> 230<00:01:57.790> degrees<00:01:58.150> Fahrenheit<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:59.020> 30

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
thing on 230 degrees Fahrenheit for 30

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.130 
thing on 230 degrees Fahrenheit for 30
minutes

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
minutes

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.630 
minutes
once<00:02:02.140> you've<00:02:02.320> baked<00:02:02.530> your<00:02:02.740> tin<00:02:03.010> comes<00:02:03.430> the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
once you've baked your tin comes the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:29.240 
once you've baked your tin comes the
really<00:02:04.030> hard<00:02:04.240> part<00:02:05.340> choosing<00:02:06.340> your<00:02:06.460> colors

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
and that's how it's done so you just let

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.240 
and that's how it's done so you just let
these<00:02:47.290> dry<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.870> then<00:02:49.870> you've<00:02:50.800> got<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.100> own

as well
I<00:02:58.209> used<00:02:59.110> a<00:02:59.350> pencil<00:02:59.890> box<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.720> stuck<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.959> Windsor

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
I used a pencil box and stuck in Windsor

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.180 
I used a pencil box and stuck in Windsor
and<00:03:02.830> Newton<00:03:03.180> pans<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.590> way<00:03:05.770> you<00:03:05.830> can

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
and Newton pans so this way you can

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.580 
and Newton pans so this way you can
change<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.209> colors<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.930> can<00:03:08.140> choose<00:03:08.380> which
