of<00:03:40.110> my<00:03:40.230> animation<00:03:40.680> horror<00:03:40.890> videos<00:03:41.360> as<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
of my animation horror videos as the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.960 
of my animation horror videos as the
scariest<00:03:43.470> scene<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.220> animation<00:03:44.519> history

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.520 
which I don't agree with exactly but
it's<00:03:47.700> definitely<00:03:47.940> worth<00:03:48.269> worth<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.079> look<00:03:49.260> so

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
