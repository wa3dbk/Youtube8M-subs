00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.850 
potions is they have a timer of 30
seconds<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.900> better<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.409> buy<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
seconds so it's better if you just buy a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.160 
seconds so it's better if you just buy a
dispenser<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> place<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.360> your<00:01:09.420> base<00:01:09.840> and

then put the EXP potion inside of the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
then put the EXP potion inside of the
dispenser<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.439> just<00:01:13.470> span<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> and
