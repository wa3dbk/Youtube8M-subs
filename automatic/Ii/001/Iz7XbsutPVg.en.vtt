00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 supra mixer 200 watts from 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.740
 the company is 220 watts from the company 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.730
 supra 7 speeds the company has 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 5 speeds 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.020
 supra has no turbo mode 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.859
 Scarlett's campaigns 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.960
 there is a turbo mode good afternoon ladies and 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 gentlemen my name is Andrei want 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.410
 present to your attention a brief 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.109
 video review and comparative 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 characteristic of 2 mixers namely 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:36.600
 mixer from soup company model m x 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:49.010
 with 200 this way it looks like it 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:54.320
 Scarlett company mixer box 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.320
 model s 710 41 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.760
 steam quality boxes 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.560
 I would say that the company is old 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.640
 Arab 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.120
 Somewhat more serious looks that is 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.860
 it is more of cardboard made 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.600
 And so they are basically in size 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:20.810
 almost the same and since bent 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.230
 their characteristics mean mu power 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.100
 data models from supra 200 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:31.840
 watts from star company years 220 watts then 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.560
 there is a more powerful 2 characteristic 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.490
 supra for a 7 speed mixer 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.890
 lined with 5 speeds I do not know whether 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.800
 as many speeds as 7 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.850
 or 5 is enough for your choice 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:53.450
 who like more in the company 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.580
 become present turbo mode that is 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.180
 at any speed you can click on 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.410
 button and mixer will be more powerful and faster 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.289
 work that is so called turbo 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.890
 supra mixer mode 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.300
 there is no redhead and the most important thing is probably 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.970
 vaccine that is there from the company star for years 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.910
 This mixer costs 850 rubles from 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.000
 company supra 380 rubles that is so 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.060
 let's say that sous germinates twice 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.100
 less, that is, for one you can say 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.220
 buy two mixers 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.830
 supra whether you need to overpay or not 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
 everyone needs to decide this now 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.819
 Let's see how these mixers look. 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.190
 and live here looks like a mixer from 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.980
 supra 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.670
 that is, very smooth edges such 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.270
 nice touch glossy plastic 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.310
 there is no backlash all made very high quality 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.000
 the top is a gearshift 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.390
 and the same lever performs the function 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.430
 throwing out the rims or hooks when 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:05.150
 pressed forward then there are some 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.890
 additional more control system 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 there are no buttons or levers 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:19.020
 there is nothing from the company star yo mixer 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.150
 looks like that gave color then 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.819
 there is blue with white 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.450
 white glossy plastic but I said so 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.470
 that he light is not very white but such 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.140
 some newspaper have a feeling that 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.420
 this one in the mix compared to the mixer from 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.069
 supra has long been in 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.739
 although it also works 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.480
 supra new that is on plastic 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.230
 he is not so white that pusu 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.260
 blue plastic project is it 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.340
 translucent and so matt rough 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.110
 that is, the handle below can be very rough 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:01.230
 convenient so that it does not fall off your hands 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:06.060
 top of it unlike supra 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.860
 there are two buttons and a lever switches 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:18.780
 passions 1 top button is ejection 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:23.580
 beaters and hooks also switch 5 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.910
 speeds and the turbo button oc mode when 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.990
 pressing that is increases the power of 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:35.640
 Scarlett's company clear switching 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:39.090
 speeds that is enough such 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.610
 confident step at the company 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.050
 supra didnâ€™t like that much 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:49.020
 that's what switching is so very 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.430
 soft and fuzzy that is when strong 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:56.010
 you can switch 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:58.550
 not on one 1 2 5 on 3 speeds at once but 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.080
 in appearance , I certainly would probably 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.350
 design preference given to the company 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.630
 supra because somewhat like 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.360
 original more so smoothed then 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:14.910
 there is more such modern design by 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:18.599
 gravity about the same but i 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.880
 said that from the company Scarlett can 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:26.120
 be a little bit he 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:29.330
 harder but it doesn't matter the same in 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.230
 set the company put the company 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:37.300
 supra 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:37.300
 there are hooks with corolla 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:47.150
 hooks of company data they are practically 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.630
 same thing i can 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.360
 note that the company starlet they like 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.210
 would be thicker then there is pain more out 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.940
 thick steel are made but in principle 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.100
 appearance they are about 11 and here 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.710
 with halos 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.900
 somewhat different story firstly 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.710
 companies put then they are also made of 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.480
 thicker material ie steel 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.140
 thicker maybe more 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.930
 high-quality and design appearance 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.300
 they are somewhat different, that is, if 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.860
 supra 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.720
 corollas are made just as if in the form 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.720
 such a steel wire 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:46.550
 then the Scarlett companies they are made of 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:48.410
 such plates that is wider 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.040
 working surface I don't know what it is 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.650
 affects 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.690
 better or worse or none 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.810
 there is no fundamental value but 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:59.510
 the only thing to note is that the material on 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.520
 the thickness and quality of the company 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:05.000
 Scarlett you somewhat better corolla 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.190
 hooks than the supra company meaning they 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.010
 as if more subtle and in comparison they 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.010
 look somewhat cheaper let's say 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:18.910
 once again summarizing I want to say that 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:22.400
 supra 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:25.940
 200 watt mixer from the company is 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:28.220
 220 watts from supra 7 speeds 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.310
 the company is 5 speeds 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.480
 supra is missing from here closer to 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.200
 Scarlett companies 

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.270
 there is a turbo mode that is basic 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.410
 characteristics and of course when choosing 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:45.169
 any thing is important price 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:48.290
 mixer company supra costs 380 rubles 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:51.710
 mixer from the company mourns worth 850 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:54.590
 rubles, respectively, you choose 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:57.620
 buy cheaper or more expensive which brand 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.250
 supra or will be all good to you 

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.570
 new meetings 

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.570
 good luck everyone all bye
