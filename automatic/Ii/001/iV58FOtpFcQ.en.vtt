boot<00:00:31.380> design<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> traditional<00:00:33.450> sole<00:00:33.780> on

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
boot design with a traditional sole on

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.360 
boot design with a traditional sole on
here<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:36.630> main<00:00:37.079> body<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> boot<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.219> going

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
here the main body of the boot is going

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360 
here the main body of the boot is going
to<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.790> cowhide<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.350> attach<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
to be cowhide and when they attach that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.350 
to be cowhide and when they attach that
cowhide<00:00:42.059> boot<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.620> sole<00:00:44.160> yes<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:44.969> glue

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
cowhide boot to the sole yes they glue

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.840 
cowhide boot to the sole yes they glue
it<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:46.140> they<00:00:46.260> also<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> black<00:00:47.640> on

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it but they also and it's a black on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
it but they also and it's a black on
black<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.480> looks<00:00:48.629> quite<00:00:48.870> subtle<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:50.100> main

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
black so it looks quite subtle the main

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.549 
black so it looks quite subtle the main
stitching<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> boot<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> panels<00:00:52.289> are

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
stitching on the boot and the panels are

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
stitching on the boot and the panels are
done<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> white<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.730> contrast<00:00:53.969> but

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
done in white I like that contrast but

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.049 
done in white I like that contrast but
that<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.170> very<00:00:55.770> very<00:00:56.010> subtle<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.640> it's

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
that is very very subtle and it's

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
that is very very subtle and it's
stitched<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> sole<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.160> glued

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
stitched to the sole as well as glued

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
stitched to the sole as well as glued
because<00:01:00.239> when<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.809> use<00:01:01.020> cowhide<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
because when they use cowhide it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.520 
because when they use cowhide it
actually<00:01:02.219> bites<00:01:02.579> better<00:01:03.000> into<00:01:03.870> cowhide<00:01:04.229> when

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
actually bites better into cowhide when

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.399 
actually bites better into cowhide when
you<00:01:04.650> stitch<00:01:04.890> through<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> sole<00:01:05.810> again<00:01:06.810> double

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you stitch through a sole again double

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.100 
you stitch through a sole again double
stitched<00:01:07.619> all<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:07.920> around<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
stitched all the way around and all the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.899 
stitched all the way around and all the
plastic<00:01:10.490> reinforcements<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> way

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
plastic reinforcements all the way

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.780 
plastic reinforcements all the way
around<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> boot<00:01:12.500> everything<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.790> double

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
around the boot everything is double

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.700 
around the boot everything is double
stitched<00:01:16.280> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.460> good<00:01:17.670> stuff<00:01:17.909> good<00:01:18.479> stuff

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
stitched this is good stuff good stuff

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
plastic reinforcements you bet sure why

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
plastic reinforcements you bet sure why
damage<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> leather<00:01:27.020> scuff<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> plastic

damage the leather scuff up the plastic

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
damage the leather scuff up the plastic
it's<00:01:28.860> easier<00:01:29.130> double<00:01:29.909> stitched<00:01:30.150> metal<00:01:30.840> toe

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it's easier double stitched metal toe

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's easier double stitched metal toe
cap<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.950> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> mentality<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.909> hey

I'm gonna ride in the steel toe boots
now<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:35.070> not<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:35.430> idea<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.270> then

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
now that's not a good idea because then

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.870 
now that's not a good idea because then
what<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.140> doing<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.670> that's<00:01:38.670> they'll

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
if you actually get trapped let's say

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.310 
if you actually get trapped let's say
between<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.850> rock<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.450> machine<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
between a rock and the machine and the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
between a rock and the machine and the
machine<00:01:43.350> comes<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> boot<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:44.880> what

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
machine comes down on the boot now what

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
little piggies so you put the metal of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:54.950 
little piggies so you put the metal of
me<00:01:54.420> outside

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
me outside

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.600 
me outside
and<00:01:55.200> again<00:01:55.619> that's<00:01:55.770> totally<00:01:56.159> replaceable

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and again that's totally replaceable
