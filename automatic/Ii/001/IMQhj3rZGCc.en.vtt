00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:44.180 

that's<00:06:32.680> pretty<00:06:32.949> simple

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.400 

so<00:06:45.190> again<00:06:45.700> you<00:06:46.000> can<00:06:46.120> just<00:06:46.330> do<00:06:46.450> seeing<00:06:46.900> instead

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
so again you can just do seeing instead

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:55.060 
so again you can just do seeing instead
of<00:06:47.680> that<00:06:47.970> tendon

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.070 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.290 

and<00:06:56.070> even<00:06:56.400> there<00:06:56.580> you<00:06:56.700> don't<00:06:56.790> have<00:06:56.970> to<00:06:57.060> do<00:06:57.180> the

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
and even there you don't have to do the

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:03.629 
and even there you don't have to do the
tenth<00:06:57.570> year<00:06:57.660> you<00:06:57.930> can<00:06:58.080> just<00:06:58.230> do<00:06:58.440> just<00:06:58.680> a<00:06:58.860> two

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:23.370
