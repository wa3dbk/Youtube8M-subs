hearts we only put a little bit of food

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.420

coloring<00:03:23.810> in<00:03:24.260> with<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:24.530> because<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.340> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
coloring in with this because of the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.280 
coloring in with this because of the
icing<00:03:25.760> we<00:03:25.880> were<00:03:25.970> using<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.390> buttercream<00:03:26.960> and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
icing we were using is buttercream and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.690 
icing we were using is buttercream and
it<00:03:27.800> has<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> little<00:03:28.190> bit<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.400> an<00:03:28.520> off-white

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.490 
it has a little bit of an off-white
color<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:29.720> really<00:03:29.990> aren't<00:03:30.140> getting<00:03:30.350> that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
color so we really aren't getting that
