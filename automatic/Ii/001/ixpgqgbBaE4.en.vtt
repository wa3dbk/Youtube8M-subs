00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.450
 I am an export filmer and 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.390
 documentary filmmaker and me again new 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.300
 Panasonic camcorder x1000 for a week 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.800
 given 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.230
 what makes this camcorder at all 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.660
 and that's primarily natural that's one 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.179
 all in one tools that means you have everything 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.900
 wild catches in the in the parent to the 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.670
 goes on over 20 optical 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.160
 image stabilizer optical and natural 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.489
 the new feature 4k with up to 60 frames 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.780
 per second 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.850
 The strength of the camera are on everyone 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.020
 If you do not want the beauty shot, you have to 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.280
 could be suspected in the sensor 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.930
 the simplest is too small 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.780
 However, the big advantage is the feature of the 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.760
 hockey 4 clearly enable one in particular 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.690
 if you later spend two on the one 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.980
 then later in the picture knows and above all 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.989
 also that you can stabilize 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.480
 in production the infrared feature 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.800
 allows you to see the things 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.560
 sensor painter wise would not see 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.870
 just knows to double and gladbecker 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.500
 Hoss and uhu was the great option 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.890
 because we have through this through the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.480
 laser on her book things seen the 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 we might not otherwise capture 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.750
 can 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.390
 twice excel investigators got to 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.550
 for example, a radio link and parallel 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.530
 for example shotgun mike on one 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.800
 save channel 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:39.710
 Trikes are also the focus of the search 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.980
 and dazzle so with one has reached 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.670
 In addition, you have feature with two sd 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.890
 cards 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.070
 which can record in parallel that is 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.180
 you do not need to record and then 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.010
 careful gardens that there is no 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.200
 you have to have a hard disk as well 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.120
 no one has a laptop with you 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.850
 just take a double let down 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.050
 Two respect and he can with eric 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.510
 Schouten forever if you cede or 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.580
 artist with a camera and pretty 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.330
 wants to turn quickly and, above all, too 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.120
 do not want to miss 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.320
 then have such devices as such synonymous 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.240
 this kempter in the advantage 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.250
 this is not a built-in one 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.080
 at the moment you have to miss it 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.080
 alone can be perfect 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.280
 Panasonic 1000 is the vereins 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.540
 be really easy motto no matter if at 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.340
 embedded board of travel tv production 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.790
 you get every shot in that one 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.790
 never spent 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.790
 by no means
