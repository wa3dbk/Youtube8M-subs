 domestic device that you do not need

 discs that has also patented nintendo

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.040
 nintendo with these patents set in 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.920

 publishes the web page my nintendo news

 the system will be able to store 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.440
 feats with controls share 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.800
 images and comments on social networks 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.600
 like for example the house my bears 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.280
 many companies are doing 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.749
 emphasis on the social part of the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.059
 Game experience of your products 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.620
 as a way of loyalty and at the same 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.300
 time extend the life of the games to 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.670
 today the system of achievements of 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.699
 nintendo is a registered patent that 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.409
 has not yet seen use beyond its 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.109
 record so good we will be 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.139
 pending at the moment with all those 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.280
 expectations that are rising 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.650
 regarding the next console of the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.680
 nintendo company 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.990
 you know is that console that could be 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 the protagonist of precisely this 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.910
 patent that would use that patent 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.620
 of that system of achievements we will be 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.540
 pending more information I think that 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.140
 It's also no wonder I think that 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.000
 sincerely to today's achievements is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.730
 something that is very established in the world 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.010
 of video games and practically in 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.600
 all the platforms and the truth is that 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.520
 it's something that the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.350
 users I think that nintendo already 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.820
 I was missing this even though 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.680
 there are nintendo games that have a 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.229
 kind of achievement system without going over 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.729
 away mario party in the last installment 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.369
 de mario party paraguay has a 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.770
 kind of achievement system but good 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.920
 is not exactly the one who would speak is 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.140
 patent a patent that I repeat is associated 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.570
 directly by many means 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.670
 to nintendo nx and I sincerely think 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.670
 also what is nintendo in x
