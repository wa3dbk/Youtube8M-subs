00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.479 
compound but link right now I'm runnin
like<00:00:55.010> 600<00:00:56.010> horsepower<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:57.260> our<00:00:58.260> s<00:00:58.710> 3<00:00:59.010> s<00:00:59.070> &amp;<00:00:59.340> 2

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
like 600 horsepower with our s 3 s &amp; 2

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.049 
like 600 horsepower with our s 3 s &amp; 2
45's<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> rear<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.260> 215<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> front<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
45's on the rear and 215 in the front I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.690 
45's on the rear and 215 in the front I
think<00:01:03.750> I'll<00:01:03.840> that's<00:01:03.989> right<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.549> weighs

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
think I'll that's right and it weighs

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.570 
think I'll that's right and it weighs
like<00:01:06.439> 2777<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.310> there<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> go

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
like 2777 I think so there you go

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
like 2777 I think so there you go
there's<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.030> car<00:01:09.210> setup<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.159> I<00:01:11.270> guess<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.450> like

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
there's the car setup and I guess I like

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.179 
there's the car setup and I guess I like

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
one snap here was it this one I think

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.770 
one snap here was it this one I think
was<00:03:57.710> one<00:03:57.920> after<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.250> front<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.490> me<00:03:58.550> snappy<00:03:58.790> and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
was one after the front of me snappy and

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.920 
was one after the front of me snappy and
I'm<00:03:59.900> was<00:04:00.110> pretty<00:04:00.320> snappy<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:01.630> kind<00:04:02.630> of

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
I'm was pretty snappy I kind of

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.270 
I'm was pretty snappy I kind of
it<00:04:03.050> up<00:04:03.110> there<00:04:03.260> like<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:03.800> said<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.010> guys<00:04:04.070> havin

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
it up there like I said you guys havin

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.960 
it up there like I said you guys havin
drifted<00:04:04.520> in<00:04:04.610> like<00:04:04.700> two<00:04:04.850> weeks<00:04:04.880> I<00:04:09.880> think<00:04:10.880> it's

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
drifted in like two weeks I think it's

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.000 
drifted in like two weeks I think it's
break<00:04:11.090> out<00:04:11.180> that<00:04:11.300> wall<00:04:11.480> tab<00:04:11.750> yep<00:04:12.140> got<00:04:12.890> the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
break out that wall tab yep got the

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.870 
break out that wall tab yep got the
walls<00:04:13.220> out<00:04:13.400> there<00:04:16.160> up<00:04:16.280> afterwards<00:04:16.730> so

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
walls out there up afterwards so

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.210 
walls out there up afterwards so
it<00:04:16.940> doesn't<00:04:17.120> really<00:04:17.209> matter<00:04:17.660> but<00:04:18.070> she<00:04:19.070> was

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
it doesn't really matter but she was

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.910 
it doesn't really matter but she was
this<00:04:19.370> one<00:04:19.580> this<00:04:19.940> one<00:04:20.120> was<00:04:20.239> not<00:04:20.480> snapping<00:04:20.920> this

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
this one this one was not snapping this

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.160 
this one this one was not snapping this
one<00:04:22.130> kinda<00:04:22.490> was<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.420> was<00:04:23.450> pretty<00:04:23.750> snappy<00:04:24.020> I

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
one kinda was and I was pretty snappy I

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.270
