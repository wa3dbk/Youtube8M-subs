00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.120
 I'm fine I feel 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.530
 to be like a first that happens 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.790
 embodies while it's still 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.989
 years that I know this festival well 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.690
 but here I do it with others 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 assignments with unifrance so that's it 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.400

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.890

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.690
 whole world there y france is very simple 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.250
 it is the organization that deals with the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.320
 promotion of French cinema so we 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.299
 share with a banner with lots of 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.129
 girls but with lots of big 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.540
 directors and actors and 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.879
 French actresses and we see in the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.350

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.970
 promotion ie trying to do 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.560
 radiate French cinema it is also 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.640
 a business side trying to promote 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.440

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.399
 always French talents that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.259
 are with us so there is the side 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.939
 glamorous and the business side so that's 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.000
 very nice me I take a lot of 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.000
 pleasure 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.580
 the international is really a role 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.210

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.220

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.200
 the aliens are very intrigued they 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.909
 are both fascinated by our cinema 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.080
 it's the diversity of French cinema 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.150
 which interests them 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.560
 and then are fascinated we still 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.490

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.550
 ambassadors and that's the I would like to 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.500
 still not exaggerate to say that the 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.990
 whole world is watching us the big 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 cinema it's still American cinema but 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.000
 still, there is a lot of interest 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.789
 no 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.050
 I counted it's been 25 years I was there in 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.610
 1989 with a little young man who was 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.379
 extraordinary name was jean luc 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.349
 delarue is not well known at the time 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.420
 and animated TV of my festival 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 friend we got here we knew 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.540
 we did not put our hands in the grease 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.920
 and we ran shows every 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.269
 others the day she goes she loves 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.830
 talk about movie month you can put 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.300
 there on the Croisette alone I see 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.860
 your movie to everyone what 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.599
 go on ben street now instead 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.450
 to do it on TV I'm doing it that's it 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.769
 I talk to New York in Tokyo and as soon as 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.299
 I travel tries to talk about cinema 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.380
 French but possible to try to 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.970
 to make sure that people buy and 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.810
 watch french movies so here 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.940
 it's a small one anyway 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.530
 it's a communication job it's 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.390
 a little bit the same thing an idea on which 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.310
 movie basically what French movie 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.380
 hold early it's a bit early for the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.780
 to say I believe the abderrahmane film 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.250
 sissako was unanimous so it's 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.450
 true that we talk about him as the 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.000
 Golden Palm is a little early anyway 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.200
 to make a prognosis but I find 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.030
 that there really is a co-production 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.709
 it's a French producer we have 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.690
 chances we are very lucky too 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.220
 my opinion with gaspard ulliel who 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.690
 really 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.140
 extraordinary in clean 200 the world 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.140
 here 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.450
 thank you very much the sea interview 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.390

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.590
