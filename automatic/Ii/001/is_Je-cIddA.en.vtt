00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello I 'm the fan of possible 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.240
 I want you a knife today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.870
 it is that huntsman 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.990
 This is about victorinox 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.840
 a knife has the knife 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.720
 It has the following features here 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.720
 one straight at net blade in it 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.270
 a small clique to fine 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:38.989
 carving work 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:43.309
 then we have a can opener 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.309
 with the small screwdriver on it 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:52.110
 we have a bottle opener right 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 with a big screw on what 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.620
 we also still have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.020
 is a scissors important in this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.750
 scissors is that you pay attention to that 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.400
 this little feather did not kick out 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 the leadership snaps but one 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.900
 it always stays on pressure 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.000
 work 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.560
 that has the gerber knife and the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.410
 multitool the tool which tool pack 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.970
 somehow better done with the scissors 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:29.160
 then we have a corkscrew 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.350
 also nice if you happen to be one 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.330
 bottle of wine bottle is in the middle of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:39.119
 Forest 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:40.979
 I think we also have a saw the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.840
 is effective I am going to do that now 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.140
 seat on which I do not sit through 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 demonstrate 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:55.080
 besides, we still have a difficult hook 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.789
 with the hook one day hook so can 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.660
 for example, now as everyday 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:02.459
 application the old paper bundle better 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.990
 wearing it more comfortably you know that 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.289
 cuts terribly 1 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.920
 that 's comfortable and we have 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:15.739
 of course, a one all who came to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.739
 use drill or to drill 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:24.270
 Moreover, we still have a tweezer if 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.250
 once the tick bites the last medium 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.349
 you could still use the publishers 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.800
 or unnatural little wood later too 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.530
 pull 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.090
 and if you have too many cellar mess 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.290
 one eagerly wants to have one 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.300
 use toothpicks around the legs and 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.629
 student and kid in parts between the 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.550
 to get teeth out 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.420
 the hansmann of victorinox for 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.290
