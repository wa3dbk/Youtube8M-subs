snake<00:00:39.620> outside<00:00:40.760> step<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.539> pull<00:00:42.870> don't<00:00:43.769> pull

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
snake outside step then pull don't pull

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
snake outside step then pull don't pull
and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:44.640> step<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.269> your<00:00:45.480> off<00:00:45.600> balance<00:00:46.109> okay

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
and then step is your off balance okay

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.209 
and then step is your off balance okay
so<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.269> going<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.019> is<00:00:49.199> go<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.829> two

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so you're going to do now is go one two

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.900 
so you're going to do now is go one two
three<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.179> three<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.320> two<00:00:52.500> three<00:00:53.219> then

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
three one two three one two three then

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:03.439 
three one two three one two three then
on<00:00:54.120> third<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.839> one<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.620> three<00:00:56.280> step<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:02.449> do

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
on third time one two three step then do

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.490 
on third time one two three step then do
1<00:01:03.690> 2<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.940> going<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.360> be<00:01:06.480> the<00:01:06.720> same<00:01:06.990> principle

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
1 2 is going to be the same principle

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.130 
1 2 is going to be the same principle
watch<00:01:10.500> from<00:01:11.340> 1<00:01:12.170> 2<00:01:13.430> down<00:01:14.430> back<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:15.060> him<00:01:15.480> then

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
watch from 1 2 down back into him then

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.300 
watch from 1 2 down back into him then
step<00:01:16.560> back<00:01:16.850> look

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.080 

so<00:01:22.310> do<00:01:23.030> mug<00:01:23.330> two<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.590> inside<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.670> first

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
so do mug two is the inside the first

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.609 
so do mug two is the inside the first
one<00:01:26.420> we<00:01:26.570> did<00:01:26.600> do<00:01:27.380> my<00:01:27.560> one<00:01:28.299> is<00:01:29.299> I'm<00:01:30.049> grabbing

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
one we did do my one is I'm grabbing

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.920 
one we did do my one is I'm grabbing
from<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.950> outside<00:01:31.430> align<00:01:31.790> pull<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.180> okay

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
from the outside align pull it okay

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.370 
from the outside align pull it okay
Dumont<00:01:33.830> -<00:01:34.220> now<00:01:34.790> I<00:01:35.090> want<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.570> be<00:01:35.689> able<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.080> get<00:01:36.229> it

Dumont - now I want to be able to get it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.850 
Dumont - now I want to be able to get it
on<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.979> inside<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:38.420> first<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.930> block<00:01:39.170> then

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
on the inside so first the block then

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.190 
on the inside so first the block then
the<00:01:39.890> transition<00:01:40.520> then<00:01:41.299> there's<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:41.690> pull<00:01:41.990> and

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the transition then there's the pull and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.090 
the transition then there's the pull and
return<00:01:43.070> back<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.610> him<00:01:43.789> is<00:01:43.970> important<00:01:44.710> but<00:01:45.710> then

you do this one tune you know pull from

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.570 
you do this one tune you know pull from
here<00:01:55.179> one<00:01:56.179> two<00:01:56.509> back<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.409> him<00:01:57.619> if<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.460> had<00:01:58.550> a

know still want to get marked onyx and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.910 
know still want to get marked onyx and
missus<00:02:06.020> will<00:02:06.170> ask<00:02:06.319> questions

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
missus will ask questions

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.759 
missus will ask questions
he<00:02:07.819> can't<00:02:08.090> move<00:02:08.420> or<00:02:08.720> thrust<00:02:09.049> anything<00:02:09.530> from

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
he can't move or thrust anything from

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.160 
he can't move or thrust anything from
here<00:02:10.009> his<00:02:10.340> body<00:02:10.670> posture<00:02:11.000> now<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.540> disrupted

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
here his body posture now is disrupted

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.530 
here his body posture now is disrupted
shoulders<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.980> hips<00:02:13.160> behind<00:02:13.700> knees<00:02:14.299> in<00:02:14.510> front

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
shoulders the hips behind knees in front

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.680 
shoulders the hips behind knees in front
so<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:15.019> all<00:02:15.170> zigzag<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:16.250> off<00:02:16.489> balance<00:02:17.000> in

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
so it's all zigzag is off balance in

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.309 
so it's all zigzag is off balance in
this<00:02:17.900> exercise<00:02:18.350> we're<00:02:18.890> stepping<00:02:19.489> back<00:02:20.319> but

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
this exercise we're stepping back but

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.140 
this exercise we're stepping back but
it's<00:02:21.500> also<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.890> template<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.610> say<00:02:22.760> once<00:02:23.000> I've

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
it's also a template to say once I've

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.150 
it's also a template to say once I've
checked<00:02:23.390> him<00:02:23.569> down<00:02:23.780> here<00:02:24.200> what<00:02:24.650> if<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.890> step

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
checked him down here what if I step

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.520 
checked him down here what if I step
forward<00:02:25.430> it's<00:02:26.060> still<00:02:26.299> give<00:02:26.540> because<00:02:26.959> he's<00:02:27.380> all

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
forward it's still give because he's all

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.890 
forward it's still give because he's all
off-center<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.489> looking<00:02:29.060> at<00:02:29.180> those<00:02:29.299> balancing

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
off-center so looking at those balancing

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.970 
off-center so looking at those balancing
point<00:02:30.109> so<00:02:30.859> make<00:02:31.010> sure<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.579> two<00:02:32.540> down<00:02:33.440> back<00:02:33.769> to

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
point so make sure one two down back to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.949 
point so make sure one two down back to
him<00:02:34.269> then<00:02:36.850> same<00:02:37.850> with<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.090> do<00:02:38.239> my<00:02:38.420> one<00:02:38.720> I'm

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
him then same with the do my one I'm

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.940 
him then same with the do my one I'm
doing<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.500> pass<00:02:39.769> through<00:02:41.230> when<00:02:42.230> I've<00:02:42.380> stepped

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
doing the pass through when I've stepped

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.120 
doing the pass through when I've stepped
but<00:02:43.940> then<00:02:44.239> I<00:02:44.540> pull<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.170> catch<00:02:45.410> up<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.859> get<00:02:45.980> my

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
but then I pull to catch up to get my

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.259 
but then I pull to catch up to get my
balance<00:02:46.310> I'm<00:02:46.940> not<00:02:47.359> pulling<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.880> then<00:02:49.880> party's

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
balance I'm not pulling and then party's

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.740 
balance I'm not pulling and then party's
falling<00:02:50.630> wall<00:02:50.780> on<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.019> me<00:02:51.200> yeah<00:02:52.750> it's

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
falling wall on to me yeah it's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.630
