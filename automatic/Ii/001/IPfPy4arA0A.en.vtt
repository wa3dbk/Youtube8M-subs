pretty<00:02:39.050> much<00:02:39.290> just<00:02:39.500> my<00:02:39.650> opinion<00:02:40.010> about<00:02:40.100> dating

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520

is<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> nerd<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.300> general<00:02:41.780> which<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.410> guess<00:02:42.560> I

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
is a nerd in general which I guess I

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.990 
is a nerd in general which I guess I
didn't<00:02:42.920> really<00:02:43.100> even<00:02:43.370> need<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.700> talk<00:02:43.850> about

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
didn't really even need to talk about

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.400 
didn't really even need to talk about
since<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.450> already<00:02:44.570> made<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> whole<00:02:44.960> video<00:02:45.080> about

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
since I already made a whole video about

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.830 
since I already made a whole video about
it<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:45.800> whatever<00:02:46.100> it's<00:02:46.580> done<00:02:46.850> now<00:02:47.420> let's<00:02:47.690> move

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
it but whatever it's done now let's move

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.900 
it but whatever it's done now let's move
on<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.140> talking<00:02:48.200> specifically<00:02:49.160> about<00:02:49.280> dating

at anime conventions first of all and I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.650 
at anime conventions first of all and I
think<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.460> is<00:02:52.520> most<00:02:52.820> important<00:02:53.360> i<00:02:53.420> really

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
think this is most important i really

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.140 
think this is most important i really
want<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.870> point<00:02:54.050> out<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.830> cannot<00:02:55.280> control<00:02:55.610> or

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
want to point out you cannot control or

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.060 
want to point out you cannot control or
predict<00:02:56.600> where<00:02:57.230> you're<00:02:57.440> gonna<00:02:57.530> meet<00:02:57.740> the

person you're going to spend forever

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.850 
person you're going to spend forever
with<00:02:59.300> it's<00:02:59.720> pretty<00:02:59.930> much<00:03:00.080> impossible<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.710> plan

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
with it's pretty much impossible to plan

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.469 
conventions his expectation was that i
would<00:06:09.280> hang<00:06:09.490> on<00:06:09.640> his<00:06:09.789> arm<00:06:09.970> the<00:06:10.030> whole<00:06:10.150> time

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
would hang on his arm the whole time

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.420 
would hang on his arm the whole time
watch<00:06:11.169> him<00:06:11.440> play<00:06:11.560> video<00:06:11.890> games<00:06:12.130> and<00:06:12.370> do

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
watch him play video games and do

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.800 
watch him play video games and do
whatever<00:06:12.580> he<00:06:12.760> wanted<00:06:13.090> to<00:06:13.150> do<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.419> because<00:06:13.780> of

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
whatever he wanted to do and because of

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.020 
whatever he wanted to do and because of
that<00:06:13.930> we<00:06:14.050> fought<00:06:14.620> at<00:06:14.950> literally<00:06:15.760> every

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
that we fought at literally every

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.279 
that we fought at literally every
convention<00:06:16.270> we<00:06:16.510> went<00:06:16.660> to<00:06:16.750> and<00:06:16.900> i<00:06:16.930> think<00:06:17.169> we

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
convention we went to and i think we

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:18.510 
convention we went to and i think we
went<00:06:17.440> to<00:06:17.560> like<00:06:17.710> four<00:06:17.950> or<00:06:18.100> five<00:06:18.160> conventions

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
went to like four or five conventions

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.659 
went to like four or five conventions
together<00:06:19.030> the<00:06:19.360> point<00:06:19.660> is<00:06:19.870> to<00:06:20.350> have<00:06:20.560> as<00:06:20.919> much

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
together the point is to have as much

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.460 
together the point is to have as much
drama<00:06:22.150> free<00:06:22.479> fun<00:06:22.750> at<00:06:22.900> the<00:06:22.960> convention<00:06:23.080> as

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
drama free fun at the convention as

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.170 
drama free fun at the convention as
possible<00:06:24.100> so<00:06:24.400> i<00:06:24.430> really<00:06:24.729> think<00:06:25.090> that<00:06:25.390> having

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
possible so i really think that having

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.909 
possible so i really think that having
a little<00:06:26.509> discussion<00:06:26.900> before<00:06:27.229> you<00:06:27.500> even<00:06:27.680> go

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
a little discussion before you even go

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:29.770 
a little discussion before you even go
to<00:06:27.979> the<00:06:28.100> convention<00:06:28.370> can<00:06:28.789> potentially<00:06:29.419> save

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
to the convention can potentially save

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.810 
to the convention can potentially save
you<00:06:30.050> a<00:06:30.080> lot<00:06:30.320> of<00:06:30.380> drama<00:06:30.770> at<00:06:31.039> the<00:06:31.280> convention

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
you a lot of drama at the convention

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.510 
you a lot of drama at the convention
communication<00:06:32.660> is<00:06:32.870> totally<00:06:33.590> key<00:06:33.800> if<00:06:34.070> you're

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
communication is totally key if you're

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.189 
communication is totally key if you're
at<00:06:34.669> a<00:06:34.699> convention<00:06:35.060> and<00:06:35.419> you<00:06:35.509> start<00:06:36.020> having

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
at a convention and you start having

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.279 
at a convention and you start having
drama<00:06:36.620> talk<00:06:37.460> about<00:06:38.030> it<00:06:38.270> don't<00:06:38.539> just<00:06:38.720> storm<00:06:39.110> off

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.289 
drama talk about it don't just storm off

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:40.659 
drama talk about it don't just storm off
to<00:06:39.530> other<00:06:39.650> ends<00:06:39.949> of<00:06:40.009> the<00:06:40.100> convention<00:06:40.520> to<00:06:40.580> be

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
to other ends of the convention to be

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.760 
to other ends of the convention to be
angry<00:06:40.880> each<00:06:41.300> other<00:06:41.479> not<00:06:41.870> talking<00:06:42.410> about<00:06:42.530> the

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
angry each other not talking about the

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.520 
angry each other not talking about the
problem<00:06:43.160> is<00:06:43.370> never<00:06:43.910> a<00:06:44.030> good<00:06:44.389> solution<00:06:44.720> just
