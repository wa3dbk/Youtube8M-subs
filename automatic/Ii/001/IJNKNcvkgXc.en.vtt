 Hi, people help themselves to the ball book and today. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.299

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.639

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.420

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.670
 each one speaks quickly about this. 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 The first book I read in October was 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.869
 shadows that is the second book of the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.670
 harry lennix korea funk series 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.529
 this book is the continuation of a 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.410
 hearing was launched by the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.449
 the following publisher I loved the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.970
 stone in this series we'll meet 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.099
 different beings in the mirror world do not 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.660
 going into too much detail in one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.010
 in Spanish, right? 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 for those who have not yet read the first book 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.070
 but this book is now going to focus 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.989
 totally at Jacob Zuma older and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.610

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.180
 JacuÃ­ and I will not go into more 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.090
 details but I really liked his fan 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 from this series found leaf writing that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.600
 extremely engaging is somewhat 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.370
 poetic I really really like 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.680
 The second book that I'm not here 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.750
 borrowed for my mother is the black rose 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.580
 which is from the trilogy of the daughter-in-law's colors 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.290
 the first free of the lesion in black rose 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.009
 the main character who owns rep 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.420
 Casa, Lar 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.670
 in the first half we went 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.619
 presented to this house we know 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.619
 that in this house your mansion 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.409
 there is a ghost they call 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.390
 bride raptors and when the wake that is the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.549
 protagonist of the first book arrives 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.439
 In this house with her children this 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.119
 ghost looks like it becomes more 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.850
 intense and it begins to appear 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.070
 there in the second book is the protagonist she 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.439
 The owner of the house is going to happen. 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.350
 various things and in the third book 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.390
 I already read it, but today I 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.090
 red the protagonist the net 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.520
 I'm completely in love with 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.790
 this trilogy will also serve to make a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.649
 video talking about the three books 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.549
 to tell a little more about each of the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.950
 books 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.670
 In this video I'm going to have some spoilers. 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.950
 but I'll leave it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.820
 I recommend you very very very much 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.989
 very 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.150
 has action has romance and has a little pin 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.120
 supernatural that ends up being focus of 23 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.250
 11 books linking the three books and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.900
 It's very very very cool and it was the book. 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.550
 I ended up enjoying all the 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.800
 characters have no character to talk 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.590
 this character xata I imagined by 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.370
 all characters including 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.110
 ghost 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.170
 so it 's very cool, you comment too much on 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.269
 you is the third book that he was the 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.660
 paper city of john cutrim 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.640
 is this book I made in buildings neither by 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.910
 I'll write then, I'll tell you a lot. 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 I liked it, I just did not expect more from the story. 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.480
 so I got frustrated a little bit because 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.160
 I have high expectations 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.750
 because I really liked the guilt of the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.220
 stars that has become one of my 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.170
 favorite books that are also from the young 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.440
 I should take into account the expectations 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.540
 because every book is a book but I 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.549
 I just associate one thing or another with 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.830
 It was exactly what I expected but I 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.200
 I recommend yes to those who like john 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.299
 green and the cool story the fourth book 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.400
 that I read this month was the hiding place 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.799
 macworld perfect 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.090
 this is the third book in the series 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.010
 disappeared, we also reviewed blog 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.120
 these books tell the story of the chess 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.640
 the Jessica in fact and the first book 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.590
 it is struck by a first ray 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.940
 book calls when it falls a distance and from 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.000
 the moment she is struck by this 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.070
 he starts to meet people 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.810
 disappeared as this happens 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.269
 she sees a picture of a child one 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.140
 person is the sleeping one when she 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.299
 wake up she knows exactly the location 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.370
 This person 's book is really cool and I 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.010
 I love this series who is a fan of the juvenile 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.480
 no blacks but light but I like 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.519
 very very much and also like 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.420
 all the characters and together with the 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.950
 mediator is one of my 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.930
 the favorites of america and the uncle 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.810
 recommended for those who like the style of 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.140
 writing and I finished the month of 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.569
 October with City of Lost Souls 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.400

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.860
 series the mortal instruments 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.959
 I started reading this book in the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.630
 end of September not a bit 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.600
 Then I stopped, I do not remember. 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.120
 exactly because I stopped it several 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.950
 other books up front then I came back 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.959
 to read this book the beginning I found a 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.639
 little dragged that a little irritated 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.350
 with the characters what is normal in the 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.990
 song books I always annoyed with 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.510
 some character but from the middle forward 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.310
 the book is very good 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.620
 so if you like the books 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.290
 reaching if you follow this series 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.150
 please do not rely on the movie that 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.970
 was made from the city of bones to 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.860
 to start or not the law the series does not 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.930
 Based on a movie, please. 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.150
 The movie I found on the way is a movie. 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.729
 what can you watch, there's nothing 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.710
 to see yes with the grandeur of the 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.780
 books and this is the fifth book you
