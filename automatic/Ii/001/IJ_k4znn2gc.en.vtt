00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
hook I come back in about the second

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.830 
hook I come back in about the second
batter<00:03:05.980> about<00:03:06.519> ten<00:03:06.880> millimeters<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.569> from<00:03:07.750> the

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
end centimeter feed it in and as I said

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.360 
end centimeter feed it in and as I said
before<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:14.350> lot<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.739> would<00:03:14.859> fish<00:03:15.100> with<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
before a lot of you would fish with it

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.569 
before a lot of you would fish with it
like<00:03:15.549> this<00:03:16.079> what<00:03:17.079> I<00:03:17.109> do<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.829> I<00:03:17.980> push<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.370> right

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
like this what I do is I push it right

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.990 
like this what I do is I push it right
through<00:03:19.319> push<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.470> hook<00:03:20.590> point<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.850> hook

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
through push the hook point so the hook

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.599 
through push the hook point so the hook
points<00:03:22.359> out<00:03:22.799> don't<00:03:23.799> worry<00:03:23.980> about<00:03:24.100> coming<00:03:24.400> into

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
points out don't worry about coming into

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.069 
points out don't worry about coming into
the<00:03:24.790> head<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:26.739> then<00:03:27.100> I<00:03:27.400> do<00:03:27.850> not<00:03:28.209> one<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:28.959> I'd

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
the head and then I do not one but I'd

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.490 
the head and then I do not one but I'd
do<00:03:29.230> two<00:03:29.500> half<00:03:29.739> hitches<00:03:30.840> around<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:31.959> back<00:03:32.200> end

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
do two half hitches around the back end

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.300 
do two half hitches around the back end
and<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.060> tile<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.810> then<00:03:35.769> sometimes<00:03:36.190> I

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
and then the tile and then sometimes I

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.750 
and then the tile and then sometimes I
might<00:03:36.459> even<00:03:36.609> drop<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:36.940> third<00:03:37.239> one<00:03:37.480> in<00:03:37.660> there<00:03:38.760> and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
might even drop a third one in there and

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.050 
might even drop a third one in there and
that's<00:03:40.030> how<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.450> would<00:03:40.630> fish<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.850> whole

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
that's how I would fish for the whole

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.840 
that's how I would fish for the whole
prawn<00:03:43.389> with<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.720> shell<00:03:43.930> on<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:45.250> feed<00:03:45.670> had

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
if that half hitch comes off right I've

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.520 
if that half hitch comes off right I've
still<00:04:13.879> got<00:04:14.030> two<00:04:14.269> more<00:04:14.480> half<00:04:14.719> inches<00:04:15.109> on<00:04:15.140> there

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
still got two more half inches on there

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.180 
still got two more half inches on there
and<00:04:16.160> if<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.400> head<00:04:16.549> comes<00:04:16.880> off<00:04:17.859> right<00:04:18.859> like<00:04:19.070> I'm

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
and if the head comes off right like I'm

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.340 
and if the head comes off right like I'm
just<00:04:19.400> pulling<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:19.820> off<00:04:19.940> here<00:04:20.150> now<00:04:20.359> see<00:04:21.139> how<00:04:21.289> the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
just pulling it off here now see how the

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.460 
just pulling it off here now see how the
prawns<00:04:21.680> stayed<00:04:22.070> straight

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
prawns stayed straight

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.830 
prawns stayed straight
all<00:04:24.470> right<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.800> hook<00:04:24.949> point<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:25.400> still<00:04:25.639> out

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
all right the hook point is still out

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.270 
all right the hook point is still out
but<00:04:26.840> with<00:04:26.990> those<00:04:27.110> half<00:04:27.380> hitches<00:04:27.620> here<00:04:27.979> it's

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
but with those half hitches here it's

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.600 
but with those half hitches here it's
hung<00:04:28.639> it<00:04:28.789> all<00:04:28.910> together<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:30.800> that's<00:04:31.190> how<00:04:31.340> I'd

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
hung it all together and that's how I'd

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.129

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
good enough which sometimes I play him I

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.080 
good enough which sometimes I play him I
get<00:04:40.039> it<00:04:40.130> out<00:04:40.160> there<00:04:40.370> like<00:04:40.490> at<00:04:40.729> some<00:04:40.910> live

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
position and that's it that's how I'd

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.860 
position and that's it that's how I'd
fish<00:04:50.599> with<00:04:50.810> them<00:04:50.960> live
