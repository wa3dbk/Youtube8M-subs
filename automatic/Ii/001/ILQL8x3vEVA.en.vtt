right<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> need<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.610> make

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
right here what you need to do is make

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.219 
right here what you need to do is make
sure<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.390> not<00:01:24.540> cracked<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
sure that it's not cracked and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.890 
sure that it's not cracked and
deteriorated<00:01:26.159> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.880> outside<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.659> hard

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
go for winter alright now that we've

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.410 
go for winter alright now that we've
talked<00:02:25.829> about<00:02:26.069> basically<00:02:26.310> how<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> disc<00:02:27.150> brake

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
talked about basically how a disc brake

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.479 
talked about basically how a disc brake
system<00:02:27.870> works<00:02:28.110> let's<00:02:28.829> go<00:02:28.980> ahead<00:02:29.099> and<00:02:29.190> put<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
system works let's go ahead and put the

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.130 
system works let's go ahead and put the
car<00:02:29.670> down<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.269> ground<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.750> we<00:02:30.870> can<00:02:30.989> get

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
car down on the ground so we can get

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.839 
car down on the ground so we can get
into<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.530> engine<00:02:31.860> Department<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.489> see<00:02:32.640> that

that go along with the brake system

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.030 
that go along with the brake system
right<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:39.870> you'll<00:02:40.230> find<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.560> master

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
right here you'll find the master

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.589 
right here you'll find the master
cylinder<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.879> about<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.390> same

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
cylinder and it's about in the same

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.470 
cylinder and it's about in the same
place<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:43.079> most<00:02:43.349> cars<00:02:43.650> today<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:45.209> going<00:02:45.420> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
place on most cars today it's going to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.259 
place on most cars today it's going to
be<00:02:45.599> filled<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:46.019> brake<00:02:46.620> fluid<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.340> hydraulic

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
be filled with brake fluid a hydraulic

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.030 
be filled with brake fluid a hydraulic
fluid<00:02:48.690> that's<00:02:48.900> going<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.260> operate<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.859> brake

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
fluid that's going to operate the brake

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.069 
fluid that's going to operate the brake
system<00:02:50.489> there's<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.359> couple<00:02:51.480> things<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.959> you

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
system there's a couple things that you

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.460 
system there's a couple things that you
can<00:02:52.230> tell<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.829> spot<00:02:53.389> first<00:02:54.389> most<00:02:55.290> of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
can tell from this spot first most of

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.910 
can tell from this spot first most of
the<00:02:55.590> newer<00:02:55.739> cars<00:02:56.129> it's<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:56.730> see-through

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
the newer cars it's a see-through

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.440 
the newer cars it's a see-through
reservoir<00:02:58.920> so<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.489> be<00:02:59.639> able<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.909> tell<00:03:00.209> what

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
reservoir so you be able to tell what

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.710 
reservoir so you be able to tell what
the<00:03:00.629> level<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.909> couple<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.359> things<00:03:03.389> that

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
the level is now a couple of things that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.809 
the level is now a couple of things that
you<00:03:03.750> can<00:03:03.900> determine<00:03:04.560> from<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.609> level

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
you can determine from just the level

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.710 
you can determine from just the level
that's<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.750> car<00:03:07.319> as<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:09.150> front<00:03:09.420> brakes

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that's in the car as the front brakes

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.920 
that's in the car as the front brakes
where<00:03:10.139> the<00:03:10.680> calipers<00:03:11.220> are<00:03:11.430> going<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:12.090> push<00:03:12.599> be

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
where the calipers are going to push be

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.229 
where the calipers are going to push be
pushed<00:03:13.230> out<00:03:13.440> because<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.579> brake<00:03:14.760> pad<00:03:15.060> has

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
pushed out because the brake pad has

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.720 
pushed out because the brake pad has
been<00:03:15.420> worn<00:03:15.690> away<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.260> then<00:03:17.160> that's<00:03:17.370> going<00:03:17.579> to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
been worn away and then that's going to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.879 
been worn away and then that's going to
cause<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.180> take<00:03:18.510> more<00:03:18.810> brake<00:03:19.169> fluid<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
cause it to take more brake fluid to

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.750 
cause it to take more brake fluid to
fill<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:21.030> backside<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.750> caliper<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.160> this

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
fill the backside of the caliper so this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.229 
fill the backside of the caliper so this
level<00:03:24.209> here<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.569> going<00:03:24.989> to<00:03:25.169> drop<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:26.609> being

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
level here is going to drop so being

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.479 
level here is going to drop so being
able<00:03:27.419> to<00:03:27.690> see<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.019> there<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.470> drop<00:03:29.129> in<00:03:29.370> the

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
able to see that there is a drop in the

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.220 
able to see that there is a drop in the
fluid<00:03:29.730> here<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.239> going<00:03:30.449> to<00:03:30.540> tell<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.959> that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
fluid here is going to tell you that

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.220 
fluid here is going to tell you that
there<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.500> where<00:03:31.889> on<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.250> front<00:03:32.489> brake<00:03:32.639> pads

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
there is where on the front brake pads

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.720 
there is where on the front brake pads
depending<00:03:34.230> how<00:03:34.440> much<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.859> drops<00:03:35.129> here<00:03:35.459> can

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
depending how much it drops here can

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.699 
depending how much it drops here can
give<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> little<00:03:36.540> bit<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.780> an<00:03:36.870> idea<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.379> how

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
give you a little bit of an idea of how

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.349 
give you a little bit of an idea of how
much<00:03:37.919> where<00:03:38.190> there<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.579> on<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.879> front<00:03:39.060> brakes

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
much where there is on the front brakes

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.710 
much where there is on the front brakes
and<00:03:39.889> when<00:03:40.889> you're<00:03:41.040> filling<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.639> back<00:03:41.910> up<00:03:42.239> one

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
and when you're filling this back up one

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.839 
and when you're filling this back up one
of<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.959> things<00:03:43.260> that's<00:03:43.560> very<00:03:43.769> important<00:03:44.699> is

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
of the things that's very important is

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.159 
of the things that's very important is
to<00:03:44.879> make<00:03:45.120> sure<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.449> you<00:03:45.599> clear<00:03:45.870> away<00:03:45.989> any
