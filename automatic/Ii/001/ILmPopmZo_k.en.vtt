the Empire run despite their presence so

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.560 
the Empire run despite their presence so
it's<00:01:26.740> hard<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.100> encapsulate<00:01:27.430> star<00:01:28.090> wars<00:01:28.360> in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
it's hard to encapsulate star wars in

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's hard to encapsulate star wars in
one<00:01:29.230> book<00:01:30.040> we<00:01:31.030> couldn't<00:01:31.360> do<00:01:31.420> it<00:01:31.540> justice<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:32.500> we

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
one book we couldn't do it justice so we

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.440 
one book we couldn't do it justice so we
decided<00:01:33.040> to<00:01:33.250> take<00:01:33.400> what<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:33.790> felt<00:01:34.090> were<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
decided to take what we felt were the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.500 
decided to take what we felt were the
three<00:01:34.750> core<00:01:35.410> experiences<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.940> three<00:01:37.240> things

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
three core experiences the three things

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.070 
three core experiences the three things
that<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:38.140> our<00:01:39.210> experience<00:01:40.210> with<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.600> license

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
that in our experience with the license

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.030 
that in our experience with the license
people<00:01:41.560> wanted<00:01:42.550> out<00:01:42.730> of<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:43.240> game<00:01:43.480> and<00:01:44.040> devoted

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
people wanted out of a game and devoted

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.120 
people wanted out of a game and devoted
a<00:01:45.220> single<00:01:45.880> role-playing<00:01:46.300> game<00:01:46.510> to<00:01:46.660> each<00:01:46.750> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
a single role-playing game to each one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.080 
a single role-playing game to each one
but<00:01:48.130> they're<00:01:48.280> all<00:01:48.460> going<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.730> be<00:01:48.850> cross

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
but they're all going to be cross

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.540 
but they're all going to be cross
compatible<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.500> think<00:01:50.740> that's<00:01:50.890> quite<00:01:51.400> an

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
compatible and I think that's quite an

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.510 
compatible and I think that's quite an
achievement<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:53.110> get<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.380> explore<00:01:53.830> those

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
achievement so we get to explore those

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.430 
achievement so we get to explore those
fringes<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.030> society<00:01:55.300> that<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.960> see<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.260> a<00:01:56.320> lot

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
fringes of society that you see in a lot

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.110 
fringes of society that you see in a lot
of<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.680> movies<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.430> I<00:01:57.520> think<00:01:57.700> players<00:01:57.910> are

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
of the movies and I think players are

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.260 
of the movies and I think players are
really<00:01:58.300> good<00:01:58.600> enjoy<00:01:59.310> seeing<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.610> part<00:02:01.030> of

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
really good enjoy seeing that part of

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.600 
really good enjoy seeing that part of
