based<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.100> our<00:01:11.220> previous<00:01:11.750> history<00:01:12.750> with

based on our previous history with

based on our previous history with
cinematics<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> wouldn't<00:01:13.979> hold<00:01:14.100> my<00:01:14.220> breath

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
cinematics but I wouldn't hold my breath

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.149 
cinematics but I wouldn't hold my breath
for<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:15.140> frankly<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> visual<00:01:16.560> fidelity<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
for that frankly the visual fidelity of

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
for that frankly the visual fidelity of
our<00:01:17.340> ps3<00:01:17.700> cinematics<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.750> pretty<00:01:19.140> fantastic

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
our ps3 cinematics was pretty fantastic

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.429 
our ps3 cinematics was pretty fantastic
I<00:01:20.070> love<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.299> gang<00:01:21.479> push<00:01:21.810> beyond<00:01:22.170> that

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
I love to see the gang push beyond that

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.609 
I love to see the gang push beyond that
but<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> high<00:01:23.310> bar<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> start<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.630> we

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
but it's a high bar to start from as we

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.380 
but it's a high bar to start from as we
get<00:01:25.740> closer<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.340> lease<00:01:26.460> etc<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:27.240> can

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
get closer to the lease etc we can

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.170 
get closer to the lease etc we can
probably<00:01:27.600> shed<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.259> light<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.680> this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
probably shed some more light on this

sticky<00:03:18.660> because<00:03:19.170> on<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.980> ps3<00:03:20.250> version<00:03:20.520> it

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
sticky because on the ps3 version it

sticky because on the ps3 version it
looks<00:03:21.660> gorgeous<00:03:22.020> especially<00:03:22.650> for<00:03:23.610> like<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
looks gorgeous especially for like a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.510 
looks gorgeous especially for like a
previous<00:03:24.390> generation<00:03:24.870> game<00:03:25.220> no<00:03:26.220> one<00:03:26.370> could

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
previous generation game no one could

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.490 
previous generation game no one could
debate<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.420> i'm<00:03:27.660> someone<00:03:28.110> that's

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
debate that and i'm someone that's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.560 
debate that and i'm someone that's
really<00:03:28.920> individuals<00:03:29.580> there<00:03:30.180> were<00:03:30.300> some

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
really individuals there were some

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.090 
really individuals there were some
issues<00:03:30.690> regarding<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.709> level<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.040> detail

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
issues regarding that level of detail

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.170 
issues regarding that level of detail
for<00:03:32.910> example<00:03:33.420> if<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.590> all<00:03:34.770> add<00:03:35.180> certain

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
for example if you all add certain

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
for example if you all add certain
points<00:03:36.600> in<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> game<00:03:37.340> primarily<00:03:38.340> if<00:03:38.550> you've

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
points in the game primarily if you've

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.810 
points in the game primarily if you've
got<00:03:38.880> a<00:03:38.910> sniper<00:03:39.300> rifle<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:40.200> you<00:03:41.190> zoom<00:03:41.490> in

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
got a sniper rifle and you zoom in

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.030 
got a sniper rifle and you zoom in
you'll<00:03:42.330> notice<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.780> some<00:03:43.500> time<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.860> game

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
you'll notice that some time the game

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.460 
you'll notice that some time the game
engine<00:03:44.520> doesn't<00:03:44.730> actually<00:03:45.440> increase<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
engine doesn't actually increase the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.290 
engine doesn't actually increase the
level<00:03:46.860> of<00:03:46.920> detail<00:03:46.980> despite<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> fact<00:03:48.209> that

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
level of detail despite the fact that

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.230 
level of detail despite the fact that
you're<00:03:48.510> zooming<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:50.010> for<00:03:50.310> example<00:03:50.340> let's

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
you're zooming in so for example let's

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.720 
you're zooming in so for example let's
just<00:03:51.720> assume<00:03:52.080> you're<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:53.010> like<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.220> precipice

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
just assume you're on like a precipice

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.480 
just assume you're on like a precipice
and<00:03:54.120> you're<00:03:54.240> looking<00:03:54.390> down<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.200> town<00:03:55.490> the

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
and you're looking down at the town the

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.160 
and you're looking down at the town the
game<00:03:56.730> generally<00:03:57.270> speaking<00:03:57.540> will<00:03:57.750> have<00:03:57.959> at

game generally speaking will have at

game generally speaking will have at
several<00:03:58.850> levels<00:03:59.850> of<00:04:00.180> detail<00:04:00.720> end<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.020> words

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
several levels of detail end of words

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.740 
several levels of detail end of words
there<00:04:01.530> is<00:04:01.770> texture<00:04:02.310> resolutions<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.090> polygon

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
there is texture resolutions and polygon

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.380 
there is texture resolutions and polygon

is that the closer you are the higher

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.830 
is that the closer you are the higher
the<00:04:11.190> resolution<00:04:11.310> texture<00:04:12.180> that<00:04:12.540> will<00:04:12.720> be

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the resolution texture that will be

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.860 
the resolution texture that will be
applied<00:04:13.100> so<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.489> detail<00:04:15.180> matches<00:04:15.720> now

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
applied so the detail matches now

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.240 
applied so the detail matches now
obviously<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.530> game<00:04:16.709> has<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.040> do<00:04:17.130> an

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
obviously the game has to do an

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.240 
obviously the game has to do an
algorithm<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.140> based<00:04:19.140> upon<00:04:19.290> your<00:04:19.770> proximity

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
algorithm and based upon your proximity

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.520 
algorithm and based upon your proximity
it<00:04:20.760> will<00:04:20.880> then<00:04:21.000> swap<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.750> velvet<00:04:21.900> texture

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
it will then swap in the velvet texture

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.100 
it will then swap in the velvet texture
but<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.190> noticed<00:04:23.729> sometimes<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.570> this<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.930> just

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
but I noticed sometimes and this is just

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.100 
but I noticed sometimes and this is just
one<00:04:25.200> example<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:26.070> this

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
one example of this

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.170 
one example of this
you're<00:04:27.199> using<00:04:27.409> a<00:04:27.650> sniper<00:04:27.919> rifle<00:04:28.069> or<00:04:28.610> kind<00:04:29.060> of

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
you're using a sniper rifle or kind of

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.390 
you're using a sniper rifle or kind of
looking<00:04:29.629> at<00:04:29.780> things<00:04:29.990> with<00:04:30.379> it<00:04:30.919> you<00:04:31.189> should

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
looking at things with it you should

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.409 
looking at things with it you should
really<00:04:31.580> do<00:04:31.789> it<00:04:31.939> doesn't<00:04:32.509> really<00:04:33.879> do<00:04:34.879> what<00:04:35.060> some

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
really do it doesn't really do what some

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.439 
really do it doesn't really do what some
games<00:04:35.689> do<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.110> swap<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.800> detail<00:04:37.219> in<00:04:37.520> so<00:04:38.270> for

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
games do and swap the detail in so for

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.409 
games do and swap the detail in so for
example<00:04:38.569> as<00:04:39.050> you're<00:04:39.490> zooming<00:04:40.490> in<00:04:40.729> for

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
example as you're zooming in for

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.290 
example as you're zooming in for
something<00:04:41.569> like<00:04:42.580> crisis<00:04:43.580> if<00:04:43.909> you're<00:04:44.120> using

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
something like crisis if you're using

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.209 
something like crisis if you're using
the<00:04:44.449> binoculars<00:04:44.659> you'll<00:04:45.560> notice<00:04:45.919> there's<00:04:46.129> a

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219 
the binoculars you'll notice there's a

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.309 
the binoculars you'll notice there's a
slight<00:04:46.580> lace<00:04:46.969> sometimes<00:04:47.509> on<00:04:47.719> the<00:04:47.810> binoculars

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
slight lace sometimes on the binoculars

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.080 
slight lace sometimes on the binoculars
particularly<00:04:48.889> on<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.069> first<00:04:49.310> game<00:04:49.639> and

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
particularly on the first game and

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.459 
particularly on the first game and
that's<00:04:50.210> generally<00:04:50.719> big<00:04:50.930> especially<00:04:51.409> if

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
that's generally big especially if

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.140 
that's generally big especially if
you're<00:04:51.590> zooming<00:04:51.979> in<00:04:52.159> like<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.699> a<00:04:52.729> new<00:04:52.909> area

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
you're zooming in like to a new area

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.730 
you're zooming in like to a new area
because<00:04:53.599> the<00:04:53.629> game's<00:04:53.900> basicly<00:04:54.319> loading

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
because the game's basicly loading

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.100 
because the game's basicly loading
assets<00:04:55.189> pretty<00:04:55.580> much<00:04:55.789> but<00:04:56.719> for<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
assets pretty much but for the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.050 
assets pretty much but for the
PlayStation<00:04:57.680> freeze<00:04:58.099> the<00:04:58.340> last<00:04:58.580> of<00:04:58.819> us<00:04:58.909> it

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
PlayStation freeze the last of us it

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.260 
PlayStation freeze the last of us it
doesn't<00:04:59.180> do<00:04:59.599> that<00:05:00.039> it's<00:05:01.039> very<00:05:01.279> smooth<00:05:01.849> but

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
doesn't do that it's very smooth but

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.760 
doesn't do that it's very smooth but
you'll<00:05:02.449> notice<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.779> sometimes<00:05:03.379> you<00:05:03.620> can

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
you'll notice that sometimes you can

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.580 
you'll notice that sometimes you can
kind<00:05:04.159> of<00:05:04.219> see<00:05:04.400> some<00:05:04.550> ugly<00:05:04.909> textures<00:05:05.590> and

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
kind of see some ugly textures and

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.899 
kind of see some ugly textures and
that's<00:05:06.740> just<00:05:06.919> one<00:05:07.129> example<00:05:07.159> i've<00:05:07.729> mentioned

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
that's just one example i've mentioned

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.839 
that's just one example i've mentioned
combat<00:05:08.569> issues<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:08.960> few<00:05:09.259> times<00:05:09.580> primarily<00:05:10.580> when

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:10.849 
combat issues a few times primarily when

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:12.580 
combat issues a few times primarily when
there's<00:05:11.060> a<00:05:11.120> lot<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.330> particles<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.020> screen

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
there's a lot of particles and screen

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.779 
there's a lot of particles and screen
that<00:05:13.580> type<00:05:13.819> of<00:05:13.849> thing<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.590> if<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:16.310> frame<00:05:16.550> rate

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
that type of thing and if the frame rate

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.659 
that type of thing and if the frame rate
thanks<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.599> you<00:05:17.930> know<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.349> low<00:05:18.500> 20s<00:05:19.099> it's<00:05:19.400> not

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
thanks to you know the low 20s it's not

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.209 
thanks to you know the low 20s it's not
exactly<00:05:20.569> conducive<00:05:20.870> because<00:05:21.620> then<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:21.919> start

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
exactly conducive because then you start

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:24.760 
exactly conducive because then you start
to<00:05:22.340> get<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.490> lot<00:05:22.729> of<00:05:22.759> input<00:05:23.029> latency<00:05:23.419> which<00:05:24.080> is

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
to get a lot of input latency which is

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.670 
to get a lot of input latency which is
not<00:05:24.979> exactly<00:05:25.819> ideal<00:05:26.439> conditions<00:05:27.439> for<00:05:29.680> action

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
not exactly ideal conditions for action

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.279 
not exactly ideal conditions for action
now<00:05:31.279> regarding<00:05:32.589> the<00:05:33.589> cinema<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.539> you<00:05:36.169> know

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
now regarding the cinema and you know

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:38.920 
now regarding the cinema and you know
general<00:05:36.620> cutscenes<00:05:37.250> I'm<00:05:37.490> not<00:05:37.699> I<00:05:38.029> don't<00:05:38.719> really

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
general cutscenes I'm not I don't really

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.930 
general cutscenes I'm not I don't really
mind<00:05:39.050> so<00:05:39.680> much<00:05:39.710> as<00:05:40.069> long<00:05:40.310> as<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.610> not<00:05:40.729> too

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
mind so much as long as it's not too

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.600 
mind so much as long as it's not too
jarring<00:05:41.300> so<00:05:42.289> sometimes<00:05:42.740> if<00:05:43.009> you<00:05:43.129> go<00:05:43.279> from<00:05:43.460> like

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
jarring so sometimes if you go from like

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.379 
jarring so sometimes if you go from like
6230<00:05:44.479> I<00:05:45.009> think<00:05:46.009> it<00:05:46.129> can<00:05:46.370> be<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.580> bit<00:05:46.729> jarring<00:05:47.029> but

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
6230 I think it can be a bit jarring but

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.969 
6230 I think it can be a bit jarring but
obviously<00:05:47.779> that<00:05:47.990> means<00:05:48.020> in<00:05:48.469> theory<00:05:48.770> they

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
obviously that means in theory they

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:50.709 
obviously that means in theory they
would<00:05:49.190> be<00:05:49.339> able<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.520> add<00:05:49.729> a<00:05:49.759> lot<00:05:50.120> more<00:05:50.360> effects

00:05:50.709 --> 00:05:50.719 
would be able to add a lot more effects

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.089 
would be able to add a lot more effects
into<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.379> because<00:05:51.589> obviously<00:05:52.539> well<00:05:53.589> the<00:05:54.589> GPU

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
into that because obviously well the GPU

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.890 
into that because obviously well the GPU
simply<00:05:55.580> wouldn't<00:05:55.819> have<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.240> help<00:05:56.360> put<00:05:56.599> so<00:05:56.779> many

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
simply wouldn't have to help put so many

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.459 
simply wouldn't have to help put so many
frames<00:05:58.089> so<00:05:59.089> I<00:05:59.120> guess<00:05:59.479> it's<00:05:59.509> kind<00:05:59.870> of<00:05:59.930> a<00:06:00.020> toss-up

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:00.469 
frames so I guess it's kind of a toss-up

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.170 
frames so I guess it's kind of a toss-up
I<00:06:00.650> guess<00:06:00.860> it's<00:06:01.069> whatever<00:06:01.250> they<00:06:01.550> can<00:06:01.610> do<00:06:01.969> and

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
I guess it's whatever they can do and

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.510 
I guess it's whatever they can do and
whatever<00:06:02.389> looks<00:06:02.870> best<00:06:02.960> anyway<00:06:03.919> hopefully<00:06:04.339> you

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
whatever looks best anyway hopefully you

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.519 
whatever looks best anyway hopefully you
enjoyed<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.909> video<00:06:05.060> I'll<00:06:05.599> see<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:05.930> soon<00:06:06.139> take

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:06.529 
enjoyed the video I'll see you soon take

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:27.439
