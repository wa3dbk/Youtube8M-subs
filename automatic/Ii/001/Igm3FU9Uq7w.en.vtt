today I'm highlighting the results of a
few<00:00:02.700> important<00:00:03.149> studies<00:00:03.510> that<00:00:03.629> have<00:00:03.780> helped

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
few important studies that have helped

few important studies that have helped
to<00:00:04.080> pave<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.560> way<00:00:04.589> for<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.069> sport<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.430> cinema

the<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:31.979> studies<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.940> more<00:01:33.149> it

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the more studies we look at the more it

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.029 
the more studies we look at the more it
becomes<00:01:33.450> clear<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.929> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.289> want<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.800> swim

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
becomes clear that if you want to swim

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.010 
becomes clear that if you want to swim
faster<00:01:35.460> than<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.850> yardage<00:01:36.300> is<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
faster than more yardage is not the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.550 
faster than more yardage is not the
answer

to<00:01:38.280> find<00:01:38.550> the<00:01:38.729> answer<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.300> swimming<00:01:39.659> faster<00:01:40.080> we

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
to find the answer to swimming faster we

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.219 
to find the answer to swimming faster we
need<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.800> look<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.100> another<00:01:41.340> set<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.729> studies

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229

out<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.000> study<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.930> same<00:02:01.140> thing

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
out in this study was the same thing

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.010 
out in this study was the same thing
they<00:02:01.350> found<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.829> prior<00:02:02.159> study<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
they found out in prior study was that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.660 
they found out in prior study was that
volume<00:02:04.020> had<00:02:04.200> no<00:02:04.380> effect<00:02:04.710> on<00:02:04.860> performance<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
volume had no effect on performance but

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.940 
volume had no effect on performance but
they<00:02:05.850> also<00:02:06.060> made<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:07.409> important

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
they also made a really important

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.889 
they also made a really important
discovery<00:02:08.369> they<00:02:09.149> discovered<00:02:09.570> that<00:02:09.690> at<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
discovery they discovered that at the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.630 
discovery they discovered that at the
end<00:02:10.079> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.350> season<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.890> swimmers<00:02:11.220> who<00:02:11.370> made

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
end of the season the swimmers who made

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
end of the season the swimmers who made
the<00:02:11.970> biggest<00:02:12.209> improvements<00:02:13.079> with<00:02:13.500> those<00:02:13.680> who

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the biggest improvements with those who

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.850 
the biggest improvements with those who
perform<00:02:14.130> most<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.269> their<00:02:15.390> training<00:02:15.690> at<00:02:15.989> higher

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
perform most of their training at higher

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.449 
perform most of their training at higher
paces<00:02:17.519> at<00:02:17.760> race<00:02:18.450> basis<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.890> now<00:02:20.070> we're<00:02:20.220> getting

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
paces at race basis so now we're getting

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.020 
paces at race basis so now we're getting
to<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.609> good<00:02:20.640> stuff

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
to the good stuff

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.870 
to the good stuff
why<00:02:21.600> would<00:02:22.019> swimmers<00:02:22.709> training<00:02:23.519> at<00:02:23.640> higher

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
why would swimmers training at higher

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.449 
why would swimmers training at higher
speeds<00:02:24.440> perform<00:02:25.440> significantly<00:02:25.680> better<00:02:26.310> than

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
speeds perform significantly better than

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.599 
speeds perform significantly better than
swimmers<00:02:27.090> training<00:02:27.420> at<00:02:27.510> lower<00:02:27.720> speeds

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:28.609 
swimmers training at lower speeds

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.050 
swimmers training at lower speeds

transfer to come from practice over to
the<00:02:59.310> race<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.409> it's<00:03:01.409> not<00:03:01.560> realistic<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.849> train

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
the race and it's not realistic to train

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.330 
the race and it's not realistic to train
at<00:03:03.269> low<00:03:03.420> speeds<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.959> expect<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.859> transfer

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
at low speeds and expect that transfer

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.069 
at low speeds and expect that transfer
to<00:03:05.430> come<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.849> your<00:03:05.969> racing<00:03:06.390> speeds<00:03:06.659> because

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
to come to your racing speeds because

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.289 
to come to your racing speeds because
your<00:03:07.230> brain<00:03:07.470> treats<00:03:07.829> slow<00:03:08.220> swimming<00:03:08.609> and<00:03:08.760> fast

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
your brain treats slow swimming and fast

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:10.940 
your brain treats slow swimming and fast
swimming<00:03:09.659> as<00:03:09.870> two<00:03:10.200> completely<00:03:10.530> different

swimming as two completely different

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.399 
swimming as two completely different
activities<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.180> if<00:03:12.450> you<00:03:12.599> really<00:03:12.989> want<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
performance then you have to properly

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.240 
performance then you have to properly

they train with these short intervals

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.789 
they train with these short intervals
there<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.150> no<00:03:51.299> lactate<00:03:51.750> build-up<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.349> the

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
there was no lactate build-up and the

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.670 
there was no lactate build-up and the
glycogen<00:03:53.310> levels<00:03:53.370> remained<00:03:54.150> really<00:03:54.389> high<00:03:54.689> so

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
glycogen levels remained really high so

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.750 
glycogen levels remained really high so
they<00:03:55.829> essentially<00:03:56.190> avoided<00:03:56.819> fatigue<00:03:57.379> any

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
they essentially avoided fatigue any

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.129 
they essentially avoided fatigue any
training<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.879> uses<00:04:00.299> these<00:04:00.419> intervals<00:04:00.870> is

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
training that uses these intervals is

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.559 
training that uses these intervals is
referred<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.500> as<00:04:01.829> ultra<00:04:02.250> short<00:04:02.400> training<00:04:02.699> so

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
referred to as ultra short training so

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.449 
referred to as ultra short training so
what<00:04:03.810> we're<00:04:03.959> seeing<00:04:04.109> is<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.500> there's<00:04:05.250> no

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
what we're seeing is that there's no

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.460 
what we're seeing is that there's no
evidence<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.000> suggest<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.540> more<00:04:06.810> yardage<00:04:07.290> is

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
evidence to suggest that more yardage is

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.379 
evidence to suggest that more yardage is
better<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.979> research<00:04:08.400> indicates<00:04:08.879> that<00:04:09.060> it's

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
better and research indicates that it's

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.689 
better and research indicates that it's
at<00:04:09.569> best<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.959> waste<00:04:10.169> of<00:04:10.319> time<00:04:10.530> what<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.519> should

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
at best a waste of time what you should

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.520 
at best a waste of time what you should
really<00:04:11.879> be<00:04:12.060> doing<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.540> training<00:04:12.780> at<00:04:13.049> race<00:04:13.319> pace

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
really be doing is training at race pace

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.219 
really be doing is training at race pace
but<00:04:14.220> in<00:04:14.310> order<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.609> train<00:04:14.940> at<00:04:15.180> race<00:04:15.750> pace<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
but in order to train at race pace the

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.439 
but in order to train at race pace the
only<00:04:16.440> way<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.859> maintain<00:04:17.159> that<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.820> by

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
only way you can maintain that is by

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.170 
only way you can maintain that is by
using<00:04:18.870> ultra<00:04:19.320> short<00:04:19.620> race<00:04:20.310> intervals<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.060> I

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
using ultra short race intervals and I

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.399 
using ultra short race intervals and I
think<00:04:21.359> it's<00:04:21.510> really<00:04:21.630> important<00:04:22.079> for<00:04:22.109> people

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
think it's really important for people

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.950 
think it's really important for people
to<00:04:22.440> realize<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.949> usrpt<00:04:23.909> is<00:04:24.270> not<00:04:24.510> just<00:04:24.840> an

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
to realize that usrpt is not just an

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.770 
to realize that usrpt is not just an
excuse<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.740> swim<00:04:26.159> 25s<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:26.909> 50s<00:04:27.300> all<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.599> time

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
excuse to swim 25s and 50s all the time

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.350 
excuse to swim 25s and 50s all the time
it's<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.650> response<00:04:29.099> to<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.460> evidence<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
it's a response to the evidence and the

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.020 
it's a response to the evidence and the
evidence<00:04:30.750> clearly<00:04:30.960> says<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.800> more<00:04:32.490> yardage

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
evidence clearly says that more yardage

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.480 
evidence clearly says that more yardage
is<00:04:33.330> not<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.870> answer

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
is not the answer

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.060 
is not the answer
race<00:04:35.490> pace<00:04:35.760> training<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.449> answer

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
race pace training is the answer

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.200 
race pace training is the answer
evidence-based<00:04:38.070> coaching<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:38.880> answer

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
evidence-based coaching is the answer

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.089 
evidence-based coaching is the answer
now<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:40.050> take<00:04:40.169> my<00:04:40.349> word<00:04:40.530> for<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.800> or<00:04:40.979> you

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
now you can take my word for it or you

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.500 
now you can take my word for it or you
can<00:04:41.280> go<00:04:41.400> ahead<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.880> investigate<00:04:42.240> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
can go ahead and investigate the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.450 
can go ahead and investigate the
evidence<00:04:42.900> for<00:04:43.020> yourself<00:04:43.169> but<00:04:44.130> once<00:04:44.310> you
