00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
focusing and doubling down on what our

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
focusing and doubling down on what our
core<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.570> designing<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.320> best

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
core was you know designing the best

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.649 
core was you know designing the best

characters and guns and environments we

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.800 
characters and guns and environments we
could<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.259> make<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> loop<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.060> loop<00:01:18.600> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
could to make the the loop the loop is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.899 
could to make the the loop the loop is
you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.290> interesting<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.860> possible<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you know interesting as possible the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.660 
you know interesting as possible the
guns<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.360> time<00:01:21.420> around<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.400> better

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
guns this time around or so much better

from<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> visual<00:01:24.240> design<00:01:24.689> stay<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.229> from

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
from a visual design stay you know from

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.870 
from a visual design stay you know from
an<00:01:25.530> injury<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:26.159> look<00:01:26.369> different<00:01:26.520> they

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
an injury like they look different they

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.200 
an injury like they look different they
do<00:01:26.939> different<00:01:27.330> things<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:30.060> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
do different things and you know just I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.050 
do different things and you know just I
think<00:01:30.450> we've<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.130> part<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.820> loot

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
think we've I think that part the loot

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.969 
think we've I think that part the loot
there's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> lot<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:33.930> gear<00:01:34.409> that's<00:01:34.619> dropped

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
there's a lot more gear that's dropped

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.190 
there's a lot more gear that's dropped

from class mazda shields the grenades
you<00:01:37.979> know<00:01:38.100> those<00:01:38.280> things<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.640> made<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
you know those things that made the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600 
you know those things that made the
first<00:01:39.030> game<00:01:39.420> good<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:41.040> know<00:01:41.159> i<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.310> in

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
first game good but you know i think in

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
first game good but you know i think in
the<00:01:41.729> end<00:01:41.759> they<00:01:42.420> started<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.960> feel<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> little

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the end they started to feel a little

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.319 
the end they started to feel a little
more<00:01:43.470> like<00:01:43.680> granular<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.520> know<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.939> was<00:01:45.149> like

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
more like granular you know it was like

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
more like granular you know it was like
a<00:01:45.390> small<00:01:45.899> gradient<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.979> we're<00:01:47.159> really

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
a small gradient up and we're really

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.149 
a small gradient up and we're really
trying<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.850> create<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:49.649> just<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
trying to create you know not just in

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
trying to create you know not just in
that<00:01:50.369> gear<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.659> things<00:01:51.869> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
that gear but also in the things that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.120 
that gear but also in the things that
your<00:01:52.140> fight<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.590> know<00:01:52.710> we're<00:01:52.829> just<00:01:52.860> really

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
you know diversity is a really strong

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
you know diversity is a really strong
word<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.990> we're<00:01:55.110> using<00:01:55.229> around<00:01:55.530> here<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.979> we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
word that we're using around here and we

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
word that we're using around here and we
really<00:01:56.549> took<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.880> heart<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.570> we

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
had some criticism of you know the maybe

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
had some criticism of you know the maybe
it<00:02:01.409> was<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.890> repetitive<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
it was a little repetitive and just

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.520 
it was a little repetitive and just
really<00:02:03.060> taken<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> heart<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.990> not<00:02:04.140> only

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
really taken at the heart and not only

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.560 
really taken at the heart and not only
you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.829> just<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.610> characters<00:02:06.149> with<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you know just the characters with the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.819 
you know just the characters with the
gear<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.229> creatures<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
gear and the creatures in the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:08.770

and<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.110> know<00:02:09.229> we're<00:02:09.560> not<00:02:09.679> messing<00:02:09.890> with<00:02:10.160> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
and you know we're not messing with the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.830 
and you know we're not messing with the
formula<00:02:10.550> of<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.819> game<00:02:11.030> dramatically<00:02:11.569> you

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
formula of the game dramatically you

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.750 
formula of the game dramatically you
know<00:02:11.930> it's<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.260> game<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.920> was<00:02:13.130> really<00:02:13.520> fun

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
know it's that game that was really fun

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.300 
know it's that game that was really fun
that<00:02:14.690> that<00:02:15.110> loop<00:02:15.380> is<00:02:15.620> still<00:02:15.830> there<00:02:16.069> it's

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that that loop is still there it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.880 
that that loop is still there it's
better<00:02:16.580> than<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:16.940> ever<00:02:17.030> been<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.890> hopefully
