00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
like right there in person but there's a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.100 
like right there in person but there's a
whole<00:01:35.729> bunch<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.090> people<00:01:36.450> talking<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:37.020> it

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
whole bunch of people talking about it

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.800 
whole bunch of people talking about it
now<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.500> too<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> coincidence<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
now this is too much of a coincidence I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
now this is too much of a coincidence I
believe<00:01:40.110> because<00:01:40.439> um<00:01:40.890> Floyd<00:01:41.820> was<00:01:42.030> scheduled

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
believe because um Floyd was scheduled

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.380 
believe because um Floyd was scheduled
to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.780> Australia<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to be in Australia this I think now but

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.889 
to be in Australia this I think now but
it<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.720> postponed<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.710> week<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.899> now

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it was postponed for one week and now

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:49.760 
it was postponed for one week and now
they<00:01:49.110> met<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.380> person

they met in person

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.109 
they met in person
I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.759> either<00:01:51.829> either<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:53.820> planned

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
I think either either this was planned

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.330 
I think either either this was planned
by<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.869> them<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.290> they<00:01:55.829> did<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.250> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
by one of them and they did this on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.649 
by one of them and they did this on
purpose<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:56.969> meet<00:01:57.119> each<00:01:57.240> other<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
purpose so they can meet each other and

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.020 
purpose so they can meet each other and
then<00:01:57.869> they<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.140> continue<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:59.030> negotiations

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
then they can continue on negotiations

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.330 
then they can continue on negotiations

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
nothing that's ridiculous being being

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.580 
nothing that's ridiculous being being
that<00:02:32.420> both<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.570> them<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.870> boxers<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.410> two

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590
