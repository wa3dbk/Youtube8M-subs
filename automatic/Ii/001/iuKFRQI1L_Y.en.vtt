came<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.410> me<00:00:35.530> with<00:00:35.680> the<00:00:35.800> idea<00:00:35.829> of<00:00:36.220> doing<00:00:36.880> this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
came to me with the idea of doing this

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.030 
came to me with the idea of doing this
without<00:00:37.420> me<00:00:37.660> but<00:00:37.840> initially<00:00:38.380> of<00:00:38.650> course<00:00:38.680> there

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
without me but initially of course there

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.580 
without me but initially of course there
was<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.220> trepidation<00:00:39.550> there<00:00:40.060> was<00:00:40.180> a<00:00:40.329> fear<00:00:40.720> but

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
was the trepidation there was a fear but

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.740 
was the trepidation there was a fear but
I<00:00:41.650> think<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.040> way<00:00:42.190> he<00:00:42.220> projected<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:43.000> and<00:00:43.210> put

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
I think the way he projected it and put

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.780 
I think the way he projected it and put
it<00:00:43.780> out<00:00:44.020> the<00:00:44.350> way<00:00:44.470> he<00:00:44.650> was<00:00:44.770> going<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:44.980> adapt<00:00:45.550> it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
it out the way he was going to adapt it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
we could do this again because it's a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.480 
we could do this again because it's a
film<00:00:58.060> he<00:00:58.180> was<00:00:58.300> tremendously<00:00:58.810> proud<00:00:59.050> of<00:00:59.490> but

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
film he was tremendously proud of but

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.030 
film he was tremendously proud of but
when<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.700> heard<00:01:01.030> currents<00:01:01.780> adaptation<00:01:02.590> km's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
when I heard currents adaptation km's

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.999 
when I heard currents adaptation km's
adaptation<00:01:03.820> I<00:01:03.970> knew<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:05.080> this<00:01:05.409> would<00:01:05.619> really

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
adaptation I knew that this would really

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.980 
adaptation I knew that this would really
hit<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.460> bullseye<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:07.030> felt<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.509> could<00:01:07.720> hit<00:01:07.869> the

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
hit the bullseye I felt it could hit the

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.690 
hit the bullseye I felt it could hit the
bullseye<00:01:08.320> with<00:01:08.500> with<00:01:08.740> my<00:01:08.860> understanding<00:01:09.520> of

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
bullseye with with my understanding of

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700 
bullseye with with my understanding of
commas<00:01:10.150> and<00:01:10.270> also<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.049> felt<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.560> was<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
commas and also I felt that it was a

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.219 
commas and also I felt that it was a
totally<00:01:12.220> new<00:01:12.430> way<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.700> looking<00:01:13.000> at<00:01:13.360> agni<00:01:14.049> pot

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
totally new way of looking at agni pot

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.679 
totally new way of looking at agni pot
so<00:01:14.439> I<00:01:14.680> was<00:01:15.009> immediately<00:01:15.549> excited<00:01:16.329> by<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.509> way

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
so I was immediately excited by the way

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.499 
so I was immediately excited by the way
he<00:01:16.930> had<00:01:17.020> conceptualized<00:01:17.680> it<00:01:17.920> Oh<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:19.240> far<00:01:19.479> as

my<00:02:15.650> head<00:02:15.799> that<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:17.000> know<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.360> should<00:02:17.810> not<00:02:17.959> go

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
my head that you know I should not go

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.580
