house which of course she loved to chew
the<00:01:32.220> sisal<00:01:32.670> rope<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> fell<00:01:33.960> from<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
thought I would just try it out give her

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.289 
thought I would just try it out give her
something<00:02:20.430> different<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:20.970> she<00:02:21.150> absolutely

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
something different and she absolutely

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.750 
something different and she absolutely
loves<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:22.440> far<00:02:22.680> she's<00:02:23.340> had<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.580> for<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
loves it so far she's had it for a

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.759 
loves it so far she's had it for a
couple<00:02:23.879> weeks<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.480> she<00:02:24.750> runs<00:02:24.989> like<00:02:25.170> crazy<00:02:25.560> on

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
couple weeks and she runs like crazy on

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.680 
couple weeks and she runs like crazy on
it<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.340> did<00:02:26.849> put<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.090> in<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.239> middle<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.629> time

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
it I did put it in the middle this time

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.899 
it I did put it in the middle this time
because<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.319> was<00:02:28.470> in<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.860> corner<00:02:29.159> beforehand

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
because it was in the corner beforehand

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.850 
because it was in the corner beforehand
and<00:02:30.450> she<00:02:30.629> does<00:02:30.780> get<00:02:30.989> it<00:02:31.079> off<00:02:31.200> balance<00:02:31.620> pretty

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
and she does get it off balance pretty

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.860 
and she does get it off balance pretty
easy<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.370> then<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.519> bangs<00:02:32.760> into<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.239> cage

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
easy and then it bangs into the cage

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.509 
easy and then it bangs into the cage
so<00:02:34.260> hopefully<00:02:34.470> being<00:02:34.829> in<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.069> middle<00:02:35.280> might

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
so hopefully being in the middle might

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.640 
so hopefully being in the middle might
work<00:02:35.730> out<00:02:35.879> a<00:02:35.940> little<00:02:36.239> better<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.810> her<00:02:36.989> back<00:02:37.500> in

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
work out a little better for her back in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.830 
work out a little better for her back in
the<00:02:37.709> back<00:02:37.860> she<00:02:38.129> has<00:02:38.340> her<00:02:38.700> Easter<00:02:39.180> kabob<00:02:39.540> too

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.180 
the back she has her Easter kabob too

little bit of the ball on the bottom and

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.890

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
this is just an activity bridge that I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.050 
this is just an activity bridge that I
actually<00:02:48.390> made<00:02:48.980> myself<00:02:49.980> some<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.549> UK<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
actually made myself some in the UK that

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.400 
actually made myself some in the UK that
were<00:02:51.150> kind<00:02:51.359> of<00:02:51.450> similar<00:02:51.810> but<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.049> couldn't<00:02:52.319> find

any here so I decided to just make one
it<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.170> has<00:02:55.470> two<00:02:55.769> levels<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.370> some<00:02:56.549> chain<00:02:56.849> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
