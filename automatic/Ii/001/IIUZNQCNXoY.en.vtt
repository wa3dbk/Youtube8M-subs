 Hello last video, I asked 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.740
 question what color dress 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.350
 showing this picture here and here it began 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.460
 srach i said the correct answer i'll say 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 in the next video 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.630
 so the correct answer to what question 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.539
 colors dress no this is the wrong answer 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.960
 sorry but there is no right answer 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.579
 just like it did not give so no i read 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 many comments that you tell me there 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 wrote and now I will answer some 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.909
 The first comment was small color of the dress 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.280
 depends on the angle of the monitor but nothing 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:48.839
 like until if you look at 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.239
 monitor from the bottom then the picture is really 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.489
 will get darker but it is not 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.890
 the reason people see the dress is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.710
 different colors second type comment by 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.289
 No, two different pictures are walking, too, nothing 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.179
 like sat with four friends and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.489
 from the same angle looked at 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.160
 the same picture two saw 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.320
 white and gold and two black and blue were 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.420
 comments like it is black and blue and therefore 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 that it is sold as black and blue 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 there is she in life is black and blue yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.590
 Indeed in life she is black and blue 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.660
 link to this dress which is sold in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.480
 online store I will leave in the description 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.060
 but I asked you not about the color of the dress 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.910
 in life I showed you a picture and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.950
 said what color is this dress I mean 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.710
 I mean paying for what I give you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.200
 showing from hopelessness was even here 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.720
 such a comment 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.810
 no guys reptiloids here and all 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.400
 the business of your eyes and your brain scientists 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.800
 they say that our visual 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.650
 system as a result of evolution has learned 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.660
 screen out the shade of incident light to 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.820
 we could see the natural 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.800
 the color of objects but different people have a brain 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.380
 can weed out different colors from someone 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.450
 blue someone yellow brain can not 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.520
 understand what really lighting is on 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.900
 this picture whether it is daylight 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.480
 whether from a lamp 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.549
 one seems one another another it and 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.950
 leads to a difference in color perception 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.590
 dress i think now you all know 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.819
