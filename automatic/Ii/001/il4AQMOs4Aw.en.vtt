speakers<00:02:43.970> came<00:02:44.180> out<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.660> well<00:02:44.870> I'm<00:02:45.350> gonna<00:02:45.530> try

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
speakers came out so well I'm gonna try

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.260 
speakers came out so well I'm gonna try
to<00:02:45.800> render<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.310> little<00:02:46.640> eye<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.090> that's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
to render a little eye and that's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.540 
to render a little eye and that's
exactly<00:02:47.870> what<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.050> did<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.530> let's<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.490> a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
exactly what I did and let's get a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.590 
exactly what I did and let's get a
little<00:02:49.610> close-up<00:02:50.180> there

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
little close-up there

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.210 
little close-up there
it's<00:02:50.810> not<00:02:51.020> bad<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.260> just<00:02:51.590> wanted<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.920> see<00:02:52.070> how

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
it's not bad I just wanted to see how

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.610 
it's not bad I just wanted to see how
the<00:02:52.280> color<00:02:52.520> was<00:02:52.820> working<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:53.390> can<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.350> see

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the color was working right can you see

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.830 
the color was working right can you see
me<00:02:54.770> around<00:02:54.860> what<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.550> when<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:55.970> peek<00:02:56.300> around<00:02:56.630> this

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
me around what I when I peek around this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.180 
me around what I when I peek around this
thing<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.440> like<00:02:57.730> hey<00:02:58.730> man<00:02:58.970> are<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.660> there

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
are you watching the crazy pencil man

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.820 
are you watching the crazy pencil man
well<00:03:03.950> anyway<00:03:04.370> long<00:03:04.790> story<00:03:04.820> short<00:03:05.300> I<00:03:05.840> drew<00:03:06.590> this

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
well anyway long story short I drew this

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.680 
well anyway long story short I drew this
up<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.580> wanted<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:08.000> try<00:03:08.210> some<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
up and I wanted to try some of the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.570 
up and I wanted to try some of the
erasers<00:03:09.260> on<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.890> on<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.190> ends<00:03:10.430> of<00:03:10.490> these

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
erasers on that on the ends of these

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.860 
erasers on that on the ends of these
pencils<00:03:11.060> just<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.360> see<00:03:11.510> how<00:03:11.600> they<00:03:11.810> were

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
pencils just to see how they were

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.290 
pencils just to see how they were
working<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.950> it's<00:03:13.100> exactly<00:03:13.550> what<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.790> did<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.150> I

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
working so it's exactly what I did and I

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.100 
working so it's exactly what I did and I
made<00:03:14.510> some<00:03:14.750> marks<00:03:15.110> and<00:03:16.540> then<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.570> just<00:03:17.840> started

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
made some marks and then I just started

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.390 
made some marks and then I just started
erasing<00:03:18.590> them<00:03:18.709> so<00:03:18.860> that's<00:03:18.920> what<00:03:19.130> I'll<00:03:19.250> do

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
erasing them so that's what I'll do

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.020 
erasing them so that's what I'll do
right<00:03:19.610> now

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
right now

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.760 
right now
to<00:03:20.180> demonstrate<00:03:20.360> I<00:03:20.959> get<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.290> little<00:03:21.470> closer

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
to demonstrate I get a little closer

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.940 
to demonstrate I get a little closer
here<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:26.660> it's<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.959> race<00:03:27.110> in<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.350> black<00:03:27.590> there

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
here now it's a race in the black there

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.030 
here now it's a race in the black there
we'll<00:03:28.190> try<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.459> believe<00:03:31.930> try<00:03:32.930> this<00:03:33.040> white

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
we'll try the believe try this white

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.410 
we'll try the believe try this white
peach<00:03:35.950> that's<00:03:36.950> kind<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.700> hard<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.030> see<00:03:38.270> but

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
peach that's kind of hard to see but

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.080 
peach that's kind of hard to see but
they<00:03:38.570> erase<00:03:38.900> pretty<00:03:39.230> well<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.820> tried<00:03:40.820> that

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
they erase pretty well I tried that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.900 
they erase pretty well I tried that
eraser<00:03:42.050> on<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.740> sphere<00:03:43.010> here<00:03:43.340> that's<00:03:43.580> kind<00:03:43.850> of

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
eraser on the sphere here that's kind of

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.150 
eraser on the sphere here that's kind of
a<00:03:44.000> what<00:03:44.420> they<00:03:44.570> call<00:03:44.600> a<00:03:44.840> reductive<00:03:45.590> technique

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
a what they call a reductive technique

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.210 
a what they call a reductive technique
no<00:03:47.030> reductant<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.780> sort<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.110> fill<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.770> sphere

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
no reductant you sort of fill the sphere

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.120 
no reductant you sort of fill the sphere
in<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.580> then<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.180> use<00:03:50.390> an<00:03:50.540> eraser<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.860> take

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
in and then you use an eraser to take

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.440 
in and then you use an eraser to take
away<00:03:52.870> some<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.050> mark<00:03:54.430> mark<00:03:55.430> making<00:03:55.700> that

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
away some of the mark mark making that

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.030 
away some of the mark mark making that
you've<00:03:56.600> done<00:03:57.100> some<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.130> this<00:03:58.310> filler<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.450> here

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
