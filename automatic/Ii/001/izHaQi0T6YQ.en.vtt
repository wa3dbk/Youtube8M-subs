import<00:02:43.880> now<00:02:44.880> let's<00:02:45.090> look<00:02:45.300> for<00:02:45.740> wavefront<00:02:46.740> obj

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
import now let's look for wavefront obj

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.699 
import now let's look for wavefront obj
here<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.550> at<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.910> very<00:02:48.060> bottom<00:02:48.410> select<00:02:49.410> it

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
here it is at the very bottom select it

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.600 
here it is at the very bottom select it
I'm<00:02:50.280> going<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.550> go<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> My<00:02:51.000> Documents<00:02:51.560> here

I'm going to go to My Documents here

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.930 
I'm going to go to My Documents here
let's<00:02:53.610> see<00:02:53.820> make<00:02:54.240> human<00:02:54.630> my<00:02:55.440> OBJ's<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
let's see make human my OBJ's and it

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.780 
let's see make human my OBJ's and it
says<00:02:57.090> mesh<00:02:57.300> obj<00:02:57.990> click<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.350> now<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:59.220> me<00:02:59.459> it

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
says mesh obj click it now with me it

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.190 
says mesh obj click it now with me it
always<00:03:00.090> replaces<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.900> every<00:03:01.140> time<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.350> um<00:03:03.200> every

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
always replaces it every time I um every

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.890 
always replaces it every time I um every
time<00:03:04.350> I<00:03:04.380> make<00:03:04.680> an<00:03:04.980> obj<00:03:05.640> file<00:03:05.850> it<00:03:06.090> replaces<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
time I make an obj file it replaces the

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.290 
time I make an obj file it replaces the
other<00:03:06.930> one<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> don't<00:03:07.830> know<00:03:08.150> exactly<00:03:09.150> how<00:03:09.239> to

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
other one so I don't know exactly how to

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.290 
other one so I don't know exactly how to
get<00:03:09.690> more<00:03:09.989> than<00:03:10.140> one<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.850> should<00:03:11.910> be<00:03:12.150> fine

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
get more than one but it should be fine

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.640 
get more than one but it should be fine
as<00:03:12.420> long<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.570> you<00:03:12.690> save<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.959> blend<00:03:13.170> file<00:03:13.380> where

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
as long as you save the blend file where

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.280 
as long as you save the blend file where
it's<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.370> you're<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:14.610> import<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.360> press

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
it's in and you're just import and press

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.080 
it's in and you're just import and press
ok

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
make sure you press and get mesh to BJ

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.720 
make sure you press and get mesh to BJ
and<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.330> we<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:23.130> I'm<00:03:23.489> going<00:03:23.670> to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
and here we have it so I'm going to

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.520 
and here we have it so I'm going to
close<00:03:23.850> my<00:03:23.910> human<00:03:24.360> really<00:03:24.510> quick<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.350> runs

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
close my human really quick so it runs

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.500 
close my human really quick so it runs
faster<00:03:26.989> ok<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:29.580> let's<00:03:30.120> go<00:03:30.209> ahead<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.420> just

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
faster ok and let's go ahead and just

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.840 
faster ok and let's go ahead and just
scale<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:30.959> up<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.200> to<00:03:31.500> show<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.769> guys<00:03:34.850> and

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
scale this up just to show you guys and

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.670 
scale this up just to show you guys and
here<00:03:36.330> we<00:03:36.420> have<00:03:36.570> it<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:37.110> going<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.320> select<00:03:37.500> it

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
here we have it it's going to select it

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.430 
here we have it it's going to select it
in<00:03:37.800> set<00:03:38.220> smooth<00:03:38.630> we<00:03:39.630> add<00:03:39.780> in<00:03:39.989> here<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
in set smooth we add in here we have a

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.490 
in set smooth we add in here we have a
very<00:03:40.860> nice<00:03:41.300> human<00:03:42.300> model<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.900> parts<00:03:43.380> are

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
very nice human model the parts are

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.690 
very nice human model the parts are
separated<00:03:44.010> but<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.340> shouldn't<00:03:44.610> be<00:03:44.670> a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
separated but that shouldn't be a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.970 
separated but that shouldn't be a
problem<00:03:44.760> we<00:03:45.150> can<00:03:45.300> just<00:03:45.330> join<00:03:46.260> those<00:03:46.470> at<00:03:46.769> will

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
problem we can just join those at will

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.330 
problem we can just join those at will
and<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.970> very<00:03:48.269> nice<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:49.040> very<00:03:50.040> nice

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
and it's very nice with very nice

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.420 
and it's very nice with very nice
topology<00:03:51.410> should<00:03:52.410> animate<00:03:52.650> very<00:03:53.040> smoothly

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
topology should animate very smoothly

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.940 
topology should animate very smoothly
and<00:03:54.890> that's<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.690> again<00:03:58.620> if<00:03:58.800> you'd

and that's it so if you again if you'd

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.820 
and that's it so if you again if you'd
like<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.280> download<00:03:59.430> my<00:03:59.910> human<00:04:00.560> click<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> link
