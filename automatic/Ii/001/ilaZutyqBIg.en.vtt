00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
issues lie the fact that the Fallout

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.619 
issues lie the fact that the Fallout
series<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:19.980> hasn't<00:02:20.190> evolved<00:02:20.940> past<00:02:21.330> the

anything physical in a conversation
still<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.819> one<00:02:30.030> small<00:02:30.299> hiccup<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:30.810> isn't

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
still this one small hiccup really isn't

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.750 
still this one small hiccup really isn't
enough<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.379> derail<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.739> quality<00:02:32.340> at<00:02:32.549> least

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
enough to derail the quality at least

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:43.089 
enough to derail the quality at least
not<00:02:32.910> in<00:02:33.030> my<00:02:33.150> opinion

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.110 

presentation<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.280> Dead<00:02:44.430> Money<00:02:44.579> isn't<00:02:44.970> really

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
presentation and Dead Money isn't really

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.089 
presentation and Dead Money isn't really
much<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.390> talk<00:02:45.450> about<00:02:45.629> because<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.890> same

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
much to talk about because it's the same

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.119 
much to talk about because it's the same
presentation<00:02:47.549> as<00:02:48.140> Fallout<00:02:49.140> New<00:02:49.170> Vegas<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:50.010> let
