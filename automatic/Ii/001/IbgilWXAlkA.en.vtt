load space I particularly like the

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
suppose that turns to face this way at

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.189 
suppose that turns to face this way at
all<00:00:49.809> does<00:00:49.989> it<00:00:50.019> no<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.379> isn't<00:00:50.979> it's<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.429> turret

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
all does it no it isn't it's a turret

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.219 
all does it no it isn't it's a turret
yeah<00:00:53.199> it's<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.940> gear<00:00:55.149> stick<00:00:55.269> here<00:00:55.690> leaving

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
yeah it's the gear stick here leaving

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.599 
yeah it's the gear stick here leaving
all<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.559> space<00:00:56.799> there<00:00:57.129> and<00:00:57.309> this<00:00:57.370> in<00:00:57.519> the

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
all the space there and this in the

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.129 
all the space there and this in the
center<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:57.969> floor<00:00:58.179> is<00:00:58.299> a<00:00:58.329> nice<00:00:58.569> touch<00:00:58.839> as

00:00:59.129 --> 00:00:59.139 
center of the floor is a nice touch as

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.109 
center of the floor is a nice touch as
well<00:00:59.289> I<00:00:59.619> think<00:01:00.039> it<00:01:00.369> will<00:01:00.459> take<00:01:00.670> off<00:01:00.850> because

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
well I think it will take off because

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.639 
well I think it will take off because
the<00:01:01.209> seats<00:01:01.479> are<00:01:01.659> very<00:01:01.809> very<00:01:02.109> comfortable

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
the seats are very very comfortable

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:05.189 
the seats are very very comfortable
considering<00:01:03.159> 2/6<00:01:03.789> seater<00:01:04.269> car<00:01:04.390> because

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
considering 2/6 seater car because

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.810 
considering 2/6 seater car because
sometimes<00:01:05.590> if<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.860> sat<00:01:06.040> in<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.220> back<00:01:06.340> of<00:01:06.370> like

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
sometimes if you sat in the back of like

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.760 
sometimes if you sat in the back of like
my<00:01:07.000> Pirjo<00:01:07.510> saloon<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.080> there's<00:01:08.260> two<00:01:08.440> even

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
my Pirjo saloon and there's two even

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.010 
my Pirjo saloon and there's two even
yours<00:01:09.280> bunched<00:01:09.940> up<00:01:10.060> together<00:01:10.240> but<00:01:10.720> you've<00:01:10.870> got

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
yours bunched up together but you've got

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.870 
yours bunched up together but you've got
three<00:01:11.230> actual<00:01:11.620> seats<00:01:11.920> in<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.220> back<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.610> three

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
three actual seats in the back and three

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.480 
three actual seats in the back and three
in<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.150> front<00:01:13.420> so<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.020> think<00:01:14.380> it<00:01:14.530> will<00:01:14.860> take<00:01:15.190> off

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
in the front so I think it will take off

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.430 
in the front so I think it will take off
for<00:01:16.150> a<00:01:16.180> family<00:01:16.690> car
