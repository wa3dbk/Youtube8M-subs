concepts today I'm going to be

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.950 
concepts today I'm going to be
installing<00:00:12.209> a

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
installing a

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.430 
installing a
straps<00:00:13.350> for<00:00:13.890> the<00:00:13.950> glovebox<00:00:14.550> door<00:00:14.700> on<00:00:15.180> the<00:00:15.960> XP

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
straps for the glovebox door on the XP

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.870 
straps for the glovebox door on the XP
1000<00:00:17.400> well<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.450> XP<00:00:18.930> 1000<00:00:19.619> boasts<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.040> 50%

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
1000 well the XP 1000 boasts a 50%

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.710 
1000 well the XP 1000 boasts a 50%
larger<00:00:21.779> glovebox<00:00:22.619> storage<00:00:23.130> area<00:00:23.570> however<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
larger glovebox storage area however it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.900 
larger glovebox storage area however it
seems<00:00:25.020> that<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.349> door<00:00:25.950> pops<00:00:26.640> open

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
seems that the door pops open

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.910 
seems that the door pops open
unexpectedly<00:00:27.840> during<00:00:28.170> off-roading

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
unexpectedly during off-roading

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.220 
unexpectedly during off-roading
situations<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.930> to<00:00:30.989> go<00:00:31.110> ahead

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
situations so we're going to go ahead

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.830 
situations so we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:31.500> install<00:00:31.680> these<00:00:32.040> simple<00:00:32.430> straps<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.690> make

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
and install these simple straps to make

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
and install these simple straps to make
a<00:00:33.899> positive<00:00:34.140> closure<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> door<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.300> you

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
a positive closure on the door so you

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
a positive closure on the door so you
could<00:00:36.570> take<00:00:36.720> full<00:00:36.989> advantage<00:00:37.560> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> storage

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
could take full advantage of the storage

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.750 
could take full advantage of the storage
space<00:00:38.750> inside<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.960> glovebox<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:41.489> worry

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
space inside the glovebox and not worry

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.139 
space inside the glovebox and not worry
about<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> door<00:00:42.420> popping<00:00:42.870> open<00:00:43.020> unexpectedly

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
about the door popping open unexpectedly

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.130 
about the door popping open unexpectedly
so<00:00:45.149> why<00:00:45.239> don't<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.420> go<00:00:45.570> ahead<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:45.989> these

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
so why don't we go ahead and put these

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.470 
so why don't we go ahead and put these
in<00:00:46.350> real<00:00:46.559> quick<00:00:49.010> well<00:00:50.010> basically<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:51.300> two

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
in real quick well basically the two

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.939 
in real quick well basically the two
straps<00:00:51.809> are<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.230> end<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.829> edge

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
straps are going to end up at the edge

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.790 
straps are going to end up at the edge
of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> molded<00:00:53.850> box<00:00:54.089> out<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.230> dash<00:00:55.410> on
