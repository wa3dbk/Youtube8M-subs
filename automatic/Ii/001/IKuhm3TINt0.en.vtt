simply based on the fact that we looked
like<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.510> characters<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.080> think<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.410> think

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
like the characters I think I think

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
like the characters I think I think
there<00:02:46.709> has<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.069> big<00:02:47.519> thing<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.880> seeing

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
potential and whatever they saw in

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.670 
potential and whatever they saw in
daniel<00:02:51.239> roof<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.599> emma<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:51.930> was<00:02:52.290> they<00:02:52.530> hit

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
daniel roof and emma was was they hit

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.259 
daniel roof and emma was was they hit
the<00:02:52.769> girl<00:02:52.920> hit<00:02:53.340> they<00:02:53.459> hit<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> jackpot

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.089 
the girl hit they hit the jackpot
because<00:02:54.569> every<00:02:55.500> year<00:02:55.530> I've<00:02:55.829> gone<00:02:55.920> from

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
because every year I've gone from

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.620 
because every year I've gone from
strength<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.489> strength<00:02:56.579> and<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.360> think<00:02:57.390> it's

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
strength to strength and I think it's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.979 
strength to strength and I think it's
the<00:02:57.720> same<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:58.049> all<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.410> young<00:02:58.890> cast<00:02:59.810> so<00:03:00.810> yeah

the same with all the young cast so yeah

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.500 
the same with all the young cast so yeah

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
I think they got very lucky in a way

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.990 
I think they got very lucky in a way
that<00:03:03.720> they<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.709> they<00:03:04.799> did<00:03:04.980> cast<00:03:05.250> 12<00:03:05.670> people

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
that they that they did cast 12 people

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.699 
that they that they did cast 12 people
that<00:03:06.030> looked<00:03:06.360> very<00:03:06.480> similar<00:03:06.690> but<00:03:07.290> also<00:03:07.440> have

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
that looked very similar but also have

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.559 
that looked very similar but also have
kind<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:07.950> grown<00:03:08.069> up<00:03:08.370> not<00:03:09.239> speaking<00:03:09.450> about

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
