alright<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.720> this<00:01:51.409> installer<00:01:51.920> has<00:01:52.159> a

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
alright now this this installer has a

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.859 
alright now this this installer has a
like<00:01:53.450> way<00:01:53.960> late<00:01:54.290> version<00:01:54.799> like<00:01:55.210> it's<00:01:56.210> way<00:01:56.659> old

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
like way late version like it's way old

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.679 
like way late version like it's way old
so<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:57.710> don't<00:01:58.430> even<00:01:58.610> just<00:01:59.240> use<00:01:59.390> one<00:01:59.570> we

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
so you don't even just use one we

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.120 
so you don't even just use one we
already<00:01:59.960> installed<00:02:00.290> or<00:02:00.619> else<00:02:00.740> it'll<00:02:00.950> mess<00:02:01.100> up

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
already installed or else it'll mess up

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.910 
already installed or else it'll mess up
and<00:02:01.579> then<00:02:01.700> there<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:01.969> go<00:02:02.229> wait<00:02:03.229> about<00:02:03.350> 20

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
and then there you go wait about 20

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.709 
and then there you go wait about 20
seconds<00:02:04.460> or<00:02:04.549> so<00:02:04.579> maybe<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.329> little<00:02:05.540> longer

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
seconds or so maybe a little longer

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.130 
seconds or so maybe a little longer
depending<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.560> your<00:02:06.680> computer<00:02:06.860> speed<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
depending on your computer speed it's a

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.120 
depending on your computer speed it's a
quirk<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:09.800> slower

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
quirk or slower

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.960 
quirk or slower
and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.570> will<00:02:12.780> be<00:02:13.680> almost<00:02:13.970> perfectly

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and then you will be almost perfectly

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.180 
and then you will be almost perfectly
ready<00:02:15.210> all<00:02:15.480> right<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:16.890> go

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
start it up right off the bat so we can

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.320
