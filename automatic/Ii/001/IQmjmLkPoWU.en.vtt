that<00:02:02.070> old<00:02:02.399> line<00:02:02.659> struggles<00:02:03.659> mightily<00:02:03.930> which<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that old line struggles mightily which I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
that old line struggles mightily which I
think<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:04.890> will<00:02:05.100> which<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.460> why<00:02:05.579> I'm<00:02:05.729> going

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
think they will which is why I'm going

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.330

with<00:02:06.149> Iowa<00:02:06.869> State<00:02:07.079> their<00:02:07.439> success<00:02:07.920> record<00:02:08.129> is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
with Iowa State their success record is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.369 
with Iowa State their success record is
more<00:02:08.550> impressive<00:02:08.899> because<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.259> they

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
more impressive because of what they

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.620 
more impressive because of what they
were<00:02:10.440> last<00:02:10.709> year<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.250> opposed<00:02:11.910> to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
were last year as opposed to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.000 
were last year as opposed to
the<00:02:12.780> Gophers<00:02:12.960> I'm<00:02:13.260> disappointed<00:02:13.800> in<00:02:13.830> goofy

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
the Gophers I'm disappointed in goofy

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.560 
the Gophers I'm disappointed in goofy
this<00:02:14.250> year<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.850> whole<00:02:15.030> line<00:02:15.210> has<00:02:15.390> let<00:02:15.540> them

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
this year that whole line has let them

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.630 
this year that whole line has let them
down<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> plus<00:02:16.200> they<00:02:16.680> did<00:02:16.920> develop<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.430> little

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
down a plus they did develop a little

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.820 
down a plus they did develop a little
option<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:19.020> its<00:02:19.110> icon<00:02:19.410> was<00:02:19.530> walk<00:02:19.650> away

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
option so I think its icon was walk away

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.290 
option so I think its icon was walk away
with<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:19.980> Cyclones<00:02:20.550> are<00:02:20.670> five<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.150> three

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
with the Cyclones are five and three

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.390 
with the Cyclones are five and three
before<00:02:21.480> losing<00:02:21.840> theater<00:02:22.320> last<00:02:22.500> four<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.370> I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
before losing theater last four but I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280 
before losing theater last four but I
think<00:02:23.760> they'll<00:02:23.910> bounce<00:02:24.210> back<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:25.020> game

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
think they'll bounce back in this game

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.200 
think they'll bounce back in this game
and<00:02:25.640> every<00:02:27.050> year<00:02:28.050> except<00:02:28.920> four<00:02:29.250> times<00:02:29.580> either
