I am using the famous today and I've
actually<00:00:27.300> started<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.990> use<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.349> famous

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.730 
actually started to use the famous
recently<00:00:29.250> I've<00:00:29.810> found<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
recently I've found it to be one of the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
recently I've found it to be one of the
the<00:00:32.340> better<00:00:32.550> guns<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.180> game<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
the better guns in the game and if you

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.040 
the better guns in the game and if you
ever<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.950> watched<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:36.030> professional<00:00:36.719> game

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
ever have watched of professional game

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.030 
ever have watched of professional game
battles<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> main<00:00:39.149> guns<00:00:39.450> used

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
battles it's a one of the main guns used

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.110 
battles it's a one of the main guns used
probably<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> better<00:00:41.610> ones<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
probably one of the better ones in the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.920 
probably one of the better ones in the
game<00:00:42.329> I'd<00:00:42.930> say<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:44.700> probably<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:45.750> main

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
game I'd say the probably a three main

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.910 
game I'd say the probably a three main
ones<00:00:46.110> i<00:00:46.559> see<00:00:46.860> use<00:00:47.129> mostly<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.780> scar<00:00:49.200> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
ones i see use mostly is the scar the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.689 
ones i see use mostly is the scar the
famous<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.140> ACR<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
famous and the ACR and I think the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.180 
famous and the ACR and I think the
reason<00:00:53.850> for<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.690> scarf<00:00:55.050> has<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> ton

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
reason for that is the scarf has a ton

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
reason for that is the scarf has a ton
of<00:00:56.219> damage<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.910> you've<00:00:57.059> seen<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.570> you've<00:00:57.719> ever

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
of damage as you've seen if you've ever

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
of damage as you've seen if you've ever
played<00:00:58.260> hardcore<00:00:58.949> some<00:00:59.280> people<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.640> put<00:00:59.850> an

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
played hardcore some people even put an

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.790 
played hardcore some people even put an
acog<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> scar<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.320> shot<00:01:01.620> one

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.480 
slower if you miss your first shot and

for<00:02:06.810> some<00:02:06.960> reason<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.590> even<00:02:07.740> know<00:02:07.920> why

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
for some reason I don't even know why

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.040 
for some reason I don't even know why
maybe<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.910> dots<00:02:09.179> smaller<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.929> more

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
maybe just be the dots smaller and more

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.580 
maybe just be the dots smaller and more
precise<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.280> i<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:11.730> just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
precise but i think it's just

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.890 
precise but i think it's just
tional<00:02:12.769> preference<00:02:13.280> really<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:14.000> before<00:02:14.750> I

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
tional preference really and before I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.869 
tional preference really and before I
some<00:02:15.080> of<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:15.230> guys<00:02:15.349> asked<00:02:15.709> why<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:16.519> not<00:02:16.700> using

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
some of you guys asked why I'm not using

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.960 
some of you guys asked why I'm not using
the<00:02:17.090> m16<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:17.900> going<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.110> tell<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:18.849> well<00:02:19.849> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
the m16 I'm going to tell you well the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.300 
the m16 I'm going to tell you well the
m16<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.989> famous<00:02:21.319> are<00:02:21.440> both<00:02:21.650> one<00:02:22.010> shot

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
m16 and the famous are both one shot

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.820 
m16 and the famous are both one shot
kills<00:02:22.900> most<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.110> time<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.560> hit<00:02:24.709> them

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
kills most of the time if you hit them

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.390 
kills most of the time if you hit them
dead<00:02:25.040> on<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:26.890> you're<00:02:27.890> going<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.129> have<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> use

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
dead on and you're going to have to use

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.339 
dead on and you're going to have to use
stopping<00:02:28.760> power<00:02:28.910> with<00:02:29.090> both<00:02:29.269> of<00:02:29.299> them<00:02:29.599> so<00:02:30.230> the

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
stopping power with both of them so the

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.850 
stopping power with both of them so the
famous<00:02:30.799> has<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.959> little<00:02:32.959> bit<00:02:33.080> of<00:02:33.110> a<00:02:33.290> faster<00:02:33.650> fire

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
famous has a little bit of a faster fire

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.259 
famous has a little bit of a faster fire
rate<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:34.370> means<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.760> get<00:02:34.849> more<00:02:35.030> shots

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
rate that means you can get more shots

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.000 
rate that means you can get more shots
off<00:02:35.510> quickly<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.379> miss<00:02:36.560> that<00:02:36.590> first

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
off quickly so if you miss that first

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.250 
off quickly so if you miss that first
shot<00:02:37.250> then<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.420> chance<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.989> second

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
shot then I have a chance for a second

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.170 
shot then I have a chance for a second
one<00:02:39.379> so<00:02:39.530> that's<00:02:39.650> why<00:02:39.860> I'm<00:02:40.010> using<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.489> there<00:02:41.060> is

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
one so that's why I'm using it there is

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.089 
one so that's why I'm using it there is
no<00:02:41.360> real<00:02:41.569> better<00:02:41.900> one<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.470> personal

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
no real better one it's personal

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.839 
no real better one it's personal
preference<00:02:44.290> mostly<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.860> i<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.430> found<00:02:46.549> i

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
preference mostly but i just found i

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.780 
preference mostly but i just found i
like<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.390> famous<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:49.190> game<00:02:49.519> i<00:02:49.760> think

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
like the famous and this game i think

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.490 
like the famous and this game i think
most<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.329> the<00:02:50.420> game<00:02:50.569> it's<00:02:50.750> actually<00:02:51.049> three<00:02:51.349> be

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
most of the game it's actually three be

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.400 
most of the game it's actually three be
three<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:51.920> four<00:02:52.130> before<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.269> very<00:02:53.410> I

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
three and four before so it's a very I

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.270 
three and four before so it's a very I
like<00:02:55.099> this<00:02:55.370> kind<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:55.849> match<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.540> slow-moving

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
like this kind of match a slow-moving

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
like this kind of match a slow-moving
quiet<00:02:58.280> match<00:02:58.549> not<00:02:59.000> really<00:02:59.420> at<00:02:59.540> still<00:02:59.810> moving

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
quiet match not really at still moving

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.410 
quiet match not really at still moving
but<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:01.280> know<00:03:01.370> what<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.549> mean<00:03:01.670> less<00:03:01.970> people<00:03:02.299> in

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
but you know what I mean less people in

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.509 
but you know what I mean less people in
the<00:03:02.540> game<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.650> don't<00:03:03.829> have<00:03:03.920> to<00:03:04.040> think<00:03:04.280> as<00:03:04.489> much

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
the game you don't have to think as much

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.240 
the game you don't have to think as much
where<00:03:05.030> people<00:03:05.299> are<00:03:05.390> going<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.599> be<00:03:05.870> or<00:03:06.260> watch

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
where people are going to be or watch

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.759 
where people are going to be or watch
your<00:03:07.459> back<00:03:07.640> it's<00:03:07.970> it's<00:03:08.690> more<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.140> relaxed

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
your back it's it's more of a relaxed

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.390 
your back it's it's more of a relaxed
game<00:03:10.190> if<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:12.260> played<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> game<00:03:13.129> like<00:03:13.340> that

that guy right in front of me he is
running<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:54.919> slow<00:03:55.280> motion<00:03:55.579> and<00:03:56.000> I<00:03:56.480> was<00:03:56.690> even

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
running in slow motion and I was even

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
people using a running class that's

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.390 
people using a running class that's
always<00:05:43.639> fun<00:05:43.819> but<00:05:44.479> uh<00:05:44.539> what<00:05:45.469> I'd<00:05:45.589> recommend<00:05:45.949> is

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
always fun but uh what I'd recommend is

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.390 
always fun but uh what I'd recommend is
sort<00:05:46.969> of<00:05:47.089> keep<00:05:47.719> back<00:05:48.050> a<00:05:48.080> little<00:05:48.469> bit<00:05:48.710> just<00:05:49.250> so

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
sort of keep back a little bit just so

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.290 
sort of keep back a little bit just so
you<00:05:49.610> can<00:05:50.240> stay<00:05:50.569> alive<00:05:50.889> because<00:05:51.889> if<00:05:52.639> you<00:05:52.939> run<00:05:53.180> at

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
you can stay alive because if you run at

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.619 
you can stay alive because if you run at
them<00:05:53.569> you're<00:05:54.050> probably<00:05:54.379> 10<00:05:54.740> more<00:05:55.389> likely<00:05:56.389> to

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:56.629 
them you're probably 10 more likely to
