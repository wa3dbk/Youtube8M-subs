replace<00:02:12.170> them<00:02:12.380> just<00:02:12.620> for<00:02:12.769> GP<00:02:13.250> because<00:02:13.640> if<00:02:14.420> this

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
replace them just for GP because if this

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.750 
replace them just for GP because if this
is<00:02:15.049> let's<00:02:15.290> say<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.650> first<00:02:15.860> time<00:02:16.130> that's<00:02:16.519> ever

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
is let's say the first time that's ever

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.240 
is let's say the first time that's ever
been<00:02:17.060> moved<00:02:17.290> that's<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.590> explode<00:02:19.040> in

been moved that's going to explode in
your<00:02:19.370> hands<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.510> keep<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.470> note<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.840> once

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
your hands so keep a note on that once

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.900 
your hands so keep a note on that once
that's<00:02:24.079> accomplished<00:02:24.680> remove<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.519> coils

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
that's accomplished remove the coils

of<00:02:43.280> doing<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:44.030> because<00:02:44.599> if<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.290> happen<00:02:45.769> to

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
of doing that because if you happen to

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.479 
of doing that because if you happen to

scan this car and had some misfire codes

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.839 
scan this car and had some misfire codes
at<00:02:49.730> least<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.420> got<00:02:50.629> an<00:02:50.780> idea<00:02:51.549> where<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.610> start

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
at least you got an idea where to start

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.319 
at least you got an idea where to start
after<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.500> engine<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.980> back<00:02:55.190> together<00:02:55.370> so

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
after the the engine is back together so

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.289 
after the the engine is back together so
just<00:02:57.170> cover<00:02:57.379> your<00:02:57.560> six<00:02:57.829> for<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.220> now<00:02:58.909> on<00:02:59.150> the

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
just cover your six for that now on the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.900 
just cover your six for that now on the
m-52<00:02:59.780> engine<00:02:59.980> remove<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.099> carl<00:03:01.400> harness

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
m-52 engine remove the carl harness

again maintain the coil cylinder
Association<00:03:12.730> because<00:03:13.730> when<00:03:14.359> you<00:03:14.510> scan<00:03:14.780> this

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
Association because when you scan this

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.229 
Association because when you scan this
car<00:03:15.290> if<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.859> does<00:03:16.099> pull<00:03:16.370> up<00:03:16.459> misfire<00:03:16.879> codes

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
car if it does pull up misfire codes

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.539 
car if it does pull up misfire codes
it's<00:03:18.019> gonna<00:03:18.230> be<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> valuable<00:03:18.980> aid<00:03:19.370> in

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
it's gonna be a valuable aid in

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.509 
it's gonna be a valuable aid in
determining<00:03:19.780> where<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.989> issue<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.459> by<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
determining where the issue is by the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.670 
determining where the issue is by the
way<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:22.819> you<00:03:23.329> do<00:03:23.510> scan<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.049> entire<00:03:24.349> vehicle

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
way you you do scan the entire vehicle

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.000 
way you you do scan the entire vehicle
before<00:03:25.329> performing<00:03:26.329> any<00:03:26.450> kind<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.200> work<00:03:27.409> right

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
before performing any kind of work right

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.849 
before performing any kind of work right
I<00:03:28.390> hope<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:30.159> so<00:03:31.159> here's<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.760> tip<00:03:32.060> mm<00:03:32.810> 50<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:33.530> 50

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
I hope so so here's a tip mm 50 and 50

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.309 
I hope so so here's a tip mm 50 and 50
tu<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.400> coils<00:03:34.790> are<00:03:35.000> held<00:03:35.209> in<00:03:35.359> place<00:03:35.480> with<00:03:35.840> nuts

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
tu the coils are held in place with nuts

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.610 
tu the coils are held in place with nuts
on<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:37.130> m-52<00:03:37.669> engines<00:03:38.269> coils<00:03:38.750> are<00:03:38.989> held<00:03:39.500> in

on the m-52 engines coils are held in

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.210 
on the m-52 engines coils are held in
place<00:03:39.769> with<00:03:40.130> bolts<00:03:40.730> hmm<00:03:41.620> guess<00:03:42.620> what<00:03:42.889> kind<00:03:43.099> of

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
place with bolts hmm guess what kind of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.400 
place with bolts hmm guess what kind of
engine<00:03:43.669> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:46.629> so<00:03:47.629> once<00:03:47.840> all<00:03:48.049> that's<00:03:48.230> done

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
engine this is so once all that's done

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.339 
engine this is so once all that's done

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
rustle off that valve cover but ever so

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.220 
rustle off that valve cover but ever so

before<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:54.919> do<00:03:55.099> you<00:03:55.370> might<00:03:56.019> want<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.109> take<00:03:57.290> the

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
before you do you might want to take the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.069 
before you do you might want to take the
time<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.669> make<00:03:58.879> sure<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.150> all<00:03:59.540> those

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079
