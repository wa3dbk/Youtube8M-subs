00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
cannon in Mullaney I'm drawn to the idea
of<00:00:43.070> narcissism<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.059> love<00:00:46.430> this

subject<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.989> discussed

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
subject because it's not discussed

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.010 
subject because it's not discussed
enough<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.059> Lou<00:00:51.329> cannon<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.989> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
enough I think that Lou cannon is a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.670 
enough I think that Lou cannon is a
character<00:00:52.680> who<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.989> not<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.140> he's<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> bad<00:00:55.649> guy

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
character who is not that he's a bad guy

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.740 
character who is not that he's a bad guy
he<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.160> assumes<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.940> everyone<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
he just assumes that everyone in the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.799 
he just assumes that everyone in the
room<00:00:57.829> is<00:00:58.829> only<00:00:59.160> thinking<00:00:59.520> about<00:00:59.879> him<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.629> if

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
room is only thinking about him and if

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.260
