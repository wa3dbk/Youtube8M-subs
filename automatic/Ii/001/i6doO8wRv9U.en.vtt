when you're using an RPG or some other
explosive<00:04:43.130> device<00:04:43.430> get<00:04:43.940> ready<00:04:44.090> for<00:04:44.330> those<00:04:44.449> hip

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
explosive device get ready for those hip

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.020 
explosive device get ready for those hip
markers<00:04:45.050> now<00:04:45.530> on<00:04:45.770> top<00:04:46.070> of<00:04:46.130> that<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:47.000> other

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
markers now on top of that the other

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.120 
markers now on top of that the other
explosives<00:04:47.930> in<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.110> game<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.620> bouncing

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
explosives in the game like a bouncing

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.760 
explosives in the game like a bouncing
betty<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.610> all<00:04:49.699> that<00:04:49.880> jazz<00:04:50.090> they're<00:04:50.539> all

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
betty and all that jazz they're all

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.080 
betty and all that jazz they're all
revamps<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.009> bouncing<00:04:52.400> betty<00:04:52.580> feels<00:04:52.910> like

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
revamps so the bouncing betty feels like

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.640 
revamps so the bouncing betty feels like
it's<00:04:53.270> really<00:04:53.600> strong<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.139> feels<00:04:54.350> really

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
it's really strong it feels really

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.070 
it's really strong it feels really
powerful<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.639> see<00:04:55.850> tons<00:04:56.210> of<00:04:56.449> people<00:04:56.840> using

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
powerful and I see tons of people using

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.320 
powerful and I see tons of people using
it<00:04:57.289> now<00:04:57.350> in<00:04:57.770> fact<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.400> think<00:04:58.490> it<00:04:58.820> might<00:04:59.000> be<00:04:59.030> even

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
it now in fact I think it might be even

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.689 
it now in fact I think it might be even
better<00:04:59.660> than<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.080> regular<00:05:00.889> claymores<00:05:01.550> and

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
better than the regular claymores and

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.490 
better than the regular claymores and
stuff<00:05:01.880> simply<00:05:02.240> because<00:05:02.479> you<00:05:02.570> can<00:05:02.720> chuck<00:05:03.169> it<00:05:03.229> up

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
stuff simply because you can chuck it up

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.800 
stuff simply because you can chuck it up
into<00:05:04.010> like<00:05:04.310> an<00:05:04.490> objective<00:05:05.030> place<00:05:05.270> where

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
into like an objective place where

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.629 
into like an objective place where
everyone<00:05:06.229> is<00:05:06.380> sitting<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:07.039> if<00:05:07.190> anyone<00:05:07.490> moves

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
everyone is sitting and if anyone moves

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.909 
everyone is sitting and if anyone moves
they're<00:05:07.940> dead<00:05:08.180> at<00:05:08.449> all<00:05:08.930> they<00:05:09.320> can't<00:05:09.530> even<00:05:09.620> turn

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
they're dead at all they can't even turn

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.370 
they're dead at all they can't even turn
to<00:05:10.130> look<00:05:10.310> because<00:05:10.520> they're<00:05:10.850> dead<00:05:11.120> so<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:12.229> know

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
to look because they're dead so you know

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.370 
to look because they're dead so you know
the<00:05:12.979> bouncing<00:05:13.430> betty<00:05:13.610> is<00:05:13.699> a<00:05:13.789> strong<00:05:14.380> explosive

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
the bouncing betty is a strong explosive

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.250 
the bouncing betty is a strong explosive
the<00:05:15.830> RPG<00:05:16.310> not<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:16.760> much<00:05:17.000> look<00:05:17.270> to<00:05:17.389> be<00:05:17.479> a<00:05:17.510> small<00:05:18.199> i

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
the RPG not so much look to be a small i

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.680 
the RPG not so much look to be a small i
think<00:05:18.710> it<00:05:18.830> is<00:05:18.860> is<00:05:19.160> pretty<00:05:19.729> good<00:05:20.000> the<00:05:20.270> only

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
think it is is pretty good the only

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.480 
think it is is pretty good the only
thing<00:05:21.050> that<00:05:21.229> makes<00:05:21.410> it<00:05:21.590> better<00:05:21.650> than<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.010> RPG

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
thing that makes it better than the RPG

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.219 
thing that makes it better than the RPG
is<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.699> fact<00:05:22.910> that<00:05:23.000> it<00:05:23.150> shoots<00:05:23.389> straight<00:05:23.750> but

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
is the fact that it shoots straight but

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.430 
is the fact that it shoots straight but
in<00:05:24.470> general<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:25.520> rockets<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.090> stuff<00:05:26.440> not

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
in general the rockets and stuff not

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.529 
in general the rockets and stuff not
that<00:05:27.680> good<00:05:27.949> i<00:05:28.190> would<00:05:28.610> not<00:05:28.789> recommend<00:05:28.970> using

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
that good i would not recommend using

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.000 
that good i would not recommend using
