00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:42.959 
and because it has a little spiffy ring

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.169 
and because it has a little spiffy ring
around<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.920> gold<00:01:44.189> which<00:01:44.850> when<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
around it that is gold which when you

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.669 
around it that is gold which when you
put<00:01:45.389> a<00:01:45.420> scope<00:01:45.749> mount<00:01:45.959> cover<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.289> cover<00:01:46.469> it<00:01:46.619> up

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
put a scope mount cover you cover it up

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.059 
put a scope mount cover you cover it up
anyway<00:01:46.979> so<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.759> does<00:01:48.029> have<00:01:48.240> Butler<00:01:48.569> Creek

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
anyway so this does have Butler Creek

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.129 
anyway so this does have Butler Creek
covers<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.389> got<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.569> little<00:01:51.689> flip<00:01:51.959> up

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
covers so it's got the little flip up
