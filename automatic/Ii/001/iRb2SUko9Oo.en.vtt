yards just easy yards and then you could
also<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> corner<00:01:34.200> route<00:01:34.380> sometimes

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
also look at the corner route sometimes

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.340 
also look at the corner route sometimes
especially<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.299> tight<00:01:37.020> end<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
especially when the tight end in the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.490 
especially when the tight end in the
backfield<00:01:37.850> he's<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.840> sucking<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
backfield he's going to be a sucking the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.670 
backfield he's going to be a sucking the
flat<00:01:40.740> zone<00:01:41.009> down<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.840> could<00:01:42.990> easily<00:01:43.290> hit

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
flat zone down so you could easily hit

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.730 
flat zone down so you could easily hit
him<00:01:43.950> too<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:45.420> lot<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.930> times<00:01:46.229> what<00:01:46.409> you<00:01:46.560> also

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
him too and a lot of times what you also

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.060 
him too and a lot of times what you also
can<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.030> could<00:01:48.210> fade<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.320> B<00:01:49.590> receiver

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
can do is you could fade the B receiver

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.170 
can do is you could fade the B receiver
the<00:01:50.570> circle<00:01:51.570> receiver<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.759> without<00:01:53.759> what

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the circle receiver and without what

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.539
