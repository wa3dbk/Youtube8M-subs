 с.г 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.570
 hello again we disassemble the card 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.029
 premiere today we'll talk about two 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.789
 alimony on pontiff see 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.300
 on the statement of the team with some kind of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.360
 several rounds 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.970
 this is the first five years on the past straight 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.530
 set off to watch everything was simple and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 standards in this case can be noticed 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 first good other element 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.720
 which can be used in games 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.470
 here's a look at the robot replanting on 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.110
 mailboxes from this position can be excellent 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.510
 view the output of all players attack 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.140
 and to be precise, to predict in advance 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.440
 possible exit and from this position also 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.660
 you can switch the name of the brand course 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 wife help their order this transition 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.050
 die at the level of a hundred team 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.970
 emphasize that the game is injection on this map 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.370
 more than important 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.150
 players order out cheats romnat 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.370
 beams ap and in the meantime tries 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.060
 go out on the same plan see what 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.160
 it turns out 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.890
 dramatically effortless 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.230
 fold opponents spread 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.160
 imagine a space for successful rounds 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 the attack really and did not come to the Quito station 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.770
 populations you all see perfectly that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.730
 happened 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.280
 in general, we can safely say that 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.790
 In most cases, defense must 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.800
 initially hold the four of us plan 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.530
 then one player must switch to 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 such position plan b 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 after the side switching important you round there 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.650
 composition of the claim show first 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.980
 discount apartments on this map 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.530
 let's see what a grenade 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.590
 pills in response 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.939
 I will immediately say anything supernatural 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.350
 not that kind of unity that stands 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.229
 mark this pause which propiska 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.100
 weathered the carpets so the theme of the exit 3 2 3 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.240
 Stavropol Anna what do those who 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.280
 rule on carpets 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.080
 Immediately it is worth noting that the guys recline 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.090
 two grenades to raise rivals then 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.650
 Canadian fingers happened 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.200
 suggest that it is thanks to his 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.659
 miss the guy stopped at 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.270
 carpets 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.720
 and began to throw off grenades in half a year 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.840
 after a series of grenades mosquitoes come out 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.330
 on the field these actions you can 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.910
 correct and put everything in 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.530
 a great way to bring you 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
 winning round 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.339
 pieces 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:30.339
 at 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
 four 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.680
 further to September 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.750
 here, too, everyone is just plain grenades 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.219
 by texture and immediately 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.689
 out on the point in general, as they say grow 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.569
 then simple simple elements and simple 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.420
 way out later we'll see how the team 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.400
 will conduct a round on this map and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.180
 By their example we will pay attention 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.169
 on the practical part of this card 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.689
 in the next issue we will talk about 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.639
 executions on the map examples of what's on this 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.639
 everything is clear 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.069
 court
