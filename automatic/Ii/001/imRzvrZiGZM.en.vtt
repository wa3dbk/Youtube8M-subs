00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
be careful when grilling the top two

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.810 
be careful when grilling the top two
holes<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.380> you're<00:01:10.740> very<00:01:10.979> close<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> main

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820

body<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.390> iMac<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.619> hit<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
body of your iMac and you can hit it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:35.139 
body of your iMac and you can hit it
once<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> drill<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.299> goes<00:01:15.570> through<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> stem

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.370 

if<00:01:36.149> you've<00:01:36.420> never<00:01:36.570> done<00:01:36.869> this

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
if you've never done this

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.859 
if you've never done this
don't<00:01:37.649> worry<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.130> not<00:01:38.399> as<00:01:38.580> hard<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.479> basically

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
don't worry is not as hard so basically

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
don't worry is not as hard so basically
you<00:01:40.200> put<00:01:40.410> in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.619> tap<00:01:40.860> bit<00:01:41.190> into<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> tap

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you put in the tap bit into the tap

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.510 
you put in the tap bit into the tap
handle<00:01:42.539> and<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.560> place<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:44.130> perpendicular

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
handle and you place that perpendicular

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120 
handle and you place that perpendicular
into<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> hole<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.200> push<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.830> turn

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
into the hole and you push and turn

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.969 
into the hole and you push and turn
gently<00:01:47.550> so<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> thread<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.600> form<00:01:48.979> aluminum

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
gently so the thread can form aluminum

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.410 
gently so the thread can form aluminum
is<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.310> soft<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:50.789> he's<00:01:50.940> not<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.300> be

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
is really soft so he's not going to be

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.830 
is really soft so he's not going to be
hard<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.460> now<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.819> put<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> screw

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
hard at all and now I put in the screw

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.219 
hard at all and now I put in the screw
to<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.690> screw<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.929> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to see if I can actually screw it in and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.440 
to see if I can actually screw it in and
it<00:01:59.009> goes<00:01:59.220> in<00:01:59.580> as<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.330> made<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.289> hole

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.540 

if<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> drill<00:02:07.319> with<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.740> clutch<00:02:08.009> make

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
if you have a drill with the clutch make

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.460

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
sure you put that on low so you don't

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.580 
sure you put that on low so you don't
over<00:02:10.890> torque<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.489> screws<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.120> stick<00:02:12.690> planty
