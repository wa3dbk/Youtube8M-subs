00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
justified or maybe games like Grand

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
justified or maybe games like Grand
Theft<00:00:56.010> Auto<00:00:56.219> where<00:00:56.520> they<00:00:56.670> give<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.149> choice

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
you can and because this games message

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060 
you can and because this games message
is<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.400> direct<00:01:06.110> towards<00:01:07.110> violence<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.770> think
