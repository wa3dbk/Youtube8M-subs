 sales of the price of america 22 23 24 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.680
 next January the most beautiful sale 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.680
 Mixed organized in Europe 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.490
 we're just going to say she has 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.220
 worked on the stroke of 9:30 this morning 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.140
 in the fog first childbirth 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.300
 on a round track we did pretty much 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.130
 4000 meters rope on the right 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.310
 one behind the other for not too much 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.380
 to annoy her she was pretty calm and then 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.400
 then we did a little bit of 300 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.530
 meters on the foot of a 30 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.470
 so there nothing abnormal everything and everything 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.170
 was flexible first substantive work is going 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.080
 read I did 1800 meters in a 25 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.200
 26 always in a back we are king the 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.580
 one after the other without letting it 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:08.409
 did not do so much speed we did 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:09.520
 especially does a steady pace and the 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.009
 last job is to do 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 unroll each one lise one did his 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.360
 relay we did about 4 on 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.070
 3000 m she made the last relay 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 offensive enough and it seemed good to me 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.340
 well in his head 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.320
 it's okay we try to put a little bit of 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.240
 mental in the work what at each 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.770
 times have sprung up in the back and wings 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.090
 and pretty toned but just what he 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.090
 do not be too pissed off 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.379
 there is fault that asks when you 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.730
 account attack normally I'm not going 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.290
 need to attack leader if I want 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.969
 run 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.829
 the mare or a wise one this time 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.200
 there for the race so I have to 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.569
 follow at least up to 500 meters without 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 move from my place after the cars go 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.230
 arrive and we will try to follow the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.319
 Internet also wonders about your 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.980
 driv he qualifes for far too much 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.260
 offensive 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.700
 do these critics touch you 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.489
 well it touches if I ever did 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.200
 really on purpose let's say from paul see 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.549
 but I know and I know where I am 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.169
 at the beginning of the meeting with 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.099
 a mare in another way so the 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.810
 first two races and we 'll see 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.159
 I'm in the rope locked up in this 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.200
 moment there I was told 'he franck tpo 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.180
 lucky alas when I attack for 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.129
 prepare the mare franck t1 crowd so 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.540
 there are both sides I've seen all 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.069
 the faults of the mare this winter and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.069
 to try to make up for what
