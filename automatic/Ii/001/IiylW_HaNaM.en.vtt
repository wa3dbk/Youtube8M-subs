how to take off the airbag and the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.660 
how to take off the airbag and the
mechanism<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:21.150> now<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:22.380> airbag<00:00:23.160> steering

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
mechanism so now my airbag steering

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
mechanism so now my airbag steering
wheel<00:00:23.850> does<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.590> screws<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
wheel does not have screws on the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.910 
wheel does not have screws on the
backside<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:27.050> where<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> paddle<00:00:28.590> shifters

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
backside for where the paddle shifters

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.070 
backside for where the paddle shifters
would<00:00:29.070> normally<00:00:29.369> cover<00:00:29.550> mine<00:00:30.539> does<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:30.900> have

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
would normally cover mine does not have

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.430 
would normally cover mine does not have
the<00:00:31.170> dimples<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.790> top<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.079> that

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the dimples on on the top what is that

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
the dimples on on the top what is that
1<00:00:35.370> o'clock<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.730> 11<00:00:36.420> o'clock<00:00:37.020> positions<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:38.190> go

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
1 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions to go

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900 
1 o'clock and 11 o'clock positions to go
in<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.910> push<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> mechanism<00:00:40.350> now<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.730> mine

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
in to push the mechanism now what mine

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.350 
in to push the mechanism now what mine
does<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> hole<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.469> bottom<00:00:44.360> which

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
does have is a hole on the bottom which

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.229 
does have is a hole on the bottom which
I<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.809> press<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.520> okay<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.149> I'm

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
now if you press in you can kind of see

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
now if you press in you can kind of see
how<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.010> mechanism<00:00:56.610> works<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
how the mechanism works you see all the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.049 
how the mechanism works you see all the
screws<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:59.010> twists<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.090> mean<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.899> pins<00:01:01.170> move<00:01:02.059> so

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
screws it twists I mean the pins move so

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.870 
screws it twists I mean the pins move so
there's<00:01:03.239> four<00:01:03.480> positions<00:01:04.070> one<00:01:05.479> two<00:01:07.100> three<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
there's four positions one two three and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's four positions one two three and
four<00:01:11.780> if<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.990> push<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:14.000> as<00:01:15.000> soon<00:01:15.060> as<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.420> do

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.530 

one<00:01:21.939> two<00:01:23.950> three<00:01:24.950> Springs<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:25.759> it<00:01:25.939> will<00:01:26.180> fall

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
one two three Springs and it will fall

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.370 
one two three Springs and it will fall
off<00:01:26.720> very<00:01:26.960> very<00:01:27.590> easily<00:01:28.600> here<00:01:29.600> are<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.080> clips

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
off very very easily here are the clips

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.899 
off very very easily here are the clips
this<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:32.899> number<00:01:33.229> two<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:34.790> then

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
this is one this is number two and then

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.190 
this is one this is number two and then
you<00:01:34.970> can<00:01:35.180> kind<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.479> see<00:01:36.310> number<00:01:37.310> three<00:01:37.580> and

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
you can kind of see number three and

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.719 
you can kind of see number three and
number<00:01:39.200> four<00:01:39.409> those<00:01:40.130> are<00:01:40.310> those<00:01:40.399> four

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
number four those are those four

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.800 
number four those are those four
positions<00:01:41.180> where<00:01:42.880> it<00:01:43.880> goes<00:01:44.119> in<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.509> holds

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
positions where it goes in and holds

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.590 
positions where it goes in and holds
that<00:01:44.840> pin<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.130> as<00:01:46.280> soon<00:01:46.460> as<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:46.759> take<00:01:47.030> this<00:01:47.390> is

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600

that pin so as soon as you take this is
what<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.130> t20<00:01:49.420> stuck<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.689> hole<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:52.240> mine

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
what a t20 stuck it in the hole and mine

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.910 
what a t20 stuck it in the hole and mine
is<00:01:53.569> on<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.869> bottom<00:01:54.229> of<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.470> steering<00:01:54.679> wheel

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
is on the bottom of the steering wheel

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.070 
is on the bottom of the steering wheel
if<00:01:55.490> I<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.850> find<00:01:56.060> it<00:02:01.000> all<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.119> I<00:02:02.390> cannot<00:02:02.750> find

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
if I can find it all right I cannot find

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:14.320 
if I can find it all right I cannot find
that<00:02:03.490> hole<00:02:04.490> again<00:02:09.489> there<00:02:10.489> we<00:02:10.549> go<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:12.110> now<00:02:13.330> I'm

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
that hole again there we go so now I'm

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.490 
that hole again there we go so now I'm
doing<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.690> I'm<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:14.989> pushing<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:17.319> it<00:02:18.319> goes

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
doing is I'm just pushing in and it goes

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.300 
doing is I'm just pushing in and it goes
up<00:02:19.360> okay<00:02:20.360> wait

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.690 

this<00:02:26.290> moves<00:02:27.290> out<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.560> way<00:02:27.620> I'm<00:02:28.520> just

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
this moves out of the way I'm just

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.540 
this moves out of the way I'm just
pushing<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:29.260> not<00:02:30.260> too<00:02:30.440> hard<00:02:30.650> maybe<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.280> a

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
pushing up not too hard maybe like a

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.890 
pushing up not too hard maybe like a
little<00:02:32.420> bit<00:02:33.760> if<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.940> push<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.420> too<00:02:35.450> hard<00:02:35.569> you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
little bit if you push it too hard you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.390 
little bit if you push it too hard you
can<00:02:36.080> slip<00:02:36.410> off<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.770> pin<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:38.600> just<00:02:38.780> go<00:02:38.930> back<00:02:39.110> in

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
can slip off the pin you just go back in

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.790 
can slip off the pin you just go back in
reset<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.550> close<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:42.790> thanks
