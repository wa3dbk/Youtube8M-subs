kill the fools Idol right up here

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.899 
kill the fools Idol right up here
through<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> fog<00:01:27.600> gate

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.649 

and<00:01:33.909> there's<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.090> couple<00:01:34.210> things<00:01:34.360> you're<00:01:34.540> gonna

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
and there's a couple things you're gonna

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.149 
and there's a couple things you're gonna
want<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:34.900> take<00:01:35.080> note<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.290> against<00:01:35.560> this<00:01:35.710> boss<00:01:35.920> I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
want to take note of against this boss I

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.440 
want to take note of against this boss I
think<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.430> most<00:01:36.549> effective<00:01:36.970> way<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.090> attack

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
think the most effective way to attack

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.480 
think the most effective way to attack
it<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.810> with<00:01:38.049> flame<00:01:38.320> toss<00:01:38.560> as<00:01:38.770> well<00:01:39.130> we'll<00:01:39.400> be

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
it is with flame toss as well we'll be

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.950 
it is with flame toss as well we'll be
able<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.700> get<00:01:39.790> three<00:01:40.030> shots<00:01:40.060> off<00:01:40.450> four<00:01:40.810> per

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
able to get three shots off four per
