okay so the first thing we're gonna talk

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.760 
okay so the first thing we're gonna talk
about<00:00:02.580> our<00:00:02.909> cells<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.410> little<00:00:04.620> bit<00:00:04.710> of

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
about our cells this is a little bit of

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.380 
about our cells this is a little bit of
a<00:00:04.890> review<00:00:05.009> from<00:00:05.370> seventh<00:00:05.790> grade<00:00:05.879> but

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
a review from seventh grade but

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.030 
a review from seventh grade but
something's<00:00:06.839> people<00:00:07.200> tend<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> forget<00:00:07.799> about

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
something's people tend to forget about

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.209 
something's people tend to forget about
so<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:09.389> makes<00:00:09.690> up<00:00:09.929> multicellular<00:00:10.620> organisms

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
so what makes up multicellular organisms

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.280 
so what makes up multicellular organisms
like<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.700> like<00:00:12.000> me<00:00:12.210> like<00:00:12.480> your<00:00:12.690> dog<00:00:12.809> like<00:00:13.139> your

like you like me like your dog like your

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.589 
like you like me like your dog like your
plant<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.190> good<00:00:14.370> stuff<00:00:14.400> well<00:00:15.059> we're<00:00:15.480> all

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
plant all that good stuff well we're all

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.840 
plant all that good stuff well we're all
made<00:00:15.809> up<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.109> cells<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.710> cells<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.340> certain

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
made up of cells and cells have certain

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.380 
made up of cells and cells have certain
bits<00:00:18.330> all<00:00:18.630> right<00:00:18.750> let's<00:00:18.900> talk<00:00:19.080> about<00:00:19.230> them

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
bits all right let's talk about them

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.200 
bits all right let's talk about them

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
teeny tiny you can't see them they're

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.120 
teeny tiny you can't see them they're
microscopic<00:00:30.050> you<00:00:31.050> have<00:00:31.289> lots<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.769> different

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
microscopic you have lots of different

takes<00:01:21.060> care<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> activities<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.799> also

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
takes care of all the activities it also

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.160 
takes care of all the activities it also
stores<00:01:23.520> our<00:01:23.759> DNA<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> genetic

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
stores our DNA that's the genetic

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.830 
stores our DNA that's the genetic
information<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.830> makes<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.810 

mitochondria<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.350> are<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.460> energy

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
mitochondria these are the energy

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.170 
mitochondria these are the energy
factories<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.810> cell<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:35.180> chemical

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
factories of your cell they use chemical

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.170 
factories of your cell they use chemical
energy<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.229> eat<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.610> food

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
energy that you eat so you need food

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
energy that you eat so you need food
these<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.659> guys<00:01:39.840> turn<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.409> into<00:01:40.560> energy

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
these little guys turn it into energy

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.889 
these little guys turn it into energy
that<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.490> cell<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.820> use<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.299> again<00:01:42.630> that's

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that your cell can use this again that's

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.639 
that your cell can use this again that's
the<00:01:43.079> mitochondria<00:01:47.180> cytoplasm<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the mitochondria cytoplasm this is the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.830 
the mitochondria cytoplasm this is the
jelly<00:01:49.890> stuff<00:01:50.340> where<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:50.970> your<00:01:51.299> organelles

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
jelly stuff where all your organelles

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.530 
jelly stuff where all your organelles
are<00:01:52.020> floating<00:01:52.530> around<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:53.490> inside<00:01:54.180> your

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
are floating around it's inside your

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
are floating around it's inside your
cell<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.079> it's<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> jello<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
cell and it's kind of like a jello the

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.060 
cell and it's kind of like a jello the
nucleus<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.680> mitochondria<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.740> all<00:01:58.860> such

nucleus and mitochondria and all such

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.590 
nucleus and mitochondria and all such
like<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.520> kind<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.790> bouncing<00:02:00.180> around<00:02:00.270> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
like are kind of bouncing around in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.220 
like are kind of bouncing around in
there

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.750 
cell that holds water plant cells have
much<00:02:11.060> larger<00:02:11.800> vacuoles<00:02:12.800> than<00:02:13.070> animal<00:02:13.460> cells

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
much larger vacuoles than animal cells

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.690 
much larger vacuoles than animal cells
do<00:02:14.090> because<00:02:14.630> animals<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.620> stand<00:02:16.070> up<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.430> walk

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
do because animals can stand up and walk

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.120 
do because animals can stand up and walk
around<00:02:16.880> if<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:17.600> get<00:02:17.810> thirsty<00:02:18.080> we<00:02:18.530> go<00:02:18.710> over<00:02:19.010> to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
around if we get thirsty we go over to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.060 
around if we get thirsty we go over to
the<00:02:19.250> sink<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.670> we<00:02:19.910> get<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> glass<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.660> water

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
the sink and we get a glass of water

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.100 
the sink and we get a glass of water
plants<00:02:22.070> can't<00:02:22.400> do<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.570> they<00:02:23.780> have<00:02:23.990> to

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
plants can't do that and so they have to

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.930 
plants can't do that and so they have to
have<00:02:24.200> larger<00:02:24.620> vacuoles<00:02:25.100> because<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.700> might

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
have larger vacuoles because it might

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.730 
have larger vacuoles because it might
not<00:02:26.150> rain<00:02:26.420> where<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:27.020> are<00:02:27.200> for<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> really

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
not rain where they are for a really

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.470 
not rain where they are for a really
long<00:02:27.860> time<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:28.730> they're<00:02:28.880> gonna<00:02:28.970> have<00:02:29.090> to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
long time and so they're gonna have to

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.450 
long time and so they're gonna have to
need<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.200> store<00:02:30.410> more<00:02:30.590> water<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:31.280> again

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
need to store more water but again

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.570 
need to store more water but again
vacuoles<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.510> stores<00:02:32.960> your<00:02:33.200> water<00:02:36.580> now

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
vacuoles that stores your water now

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.250 
vacuoles that stores your water now
let's<00:02:37.730> talk<00:02:37.880> about<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.150> parts<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.930> only

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
let's talk about the parts that you only

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.730 
let's talk about the parts that you only
find<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:40.280> plant<00:02:40.910> cells<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.500> cell

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
find in plant cells this is the cell

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.080 
find in plant cells this is the cell
wall<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:44.450> sits<00:02:45.140> outside<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.850> cell

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
wall and it sits outside of the cell

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.680 
wall and it sits outside of the cell
membrane

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
membrane

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.210 
membrane
now<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.200> remember<00:02:48.350> we<00:02:48.590> talked<00:02:48.830> about<00:02:48.980> the

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
now you remember we talked about the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.100 
now you remember we talked about the
cell<00:02:49.430> membrane<00:02:49.850> earlier<00:02:50.300> that's<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.840> part

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
cell membrane earlier that's the part

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.590 
cell membrane earlier that's the part
that<00:02:51.170> lets<00:02:52.010> stuff<00:02:52.610> in<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.940> out<00:02:53.000> of<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.180> cell

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
that lets stuff in and out of the cell

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.780 
that lets stuff in and out of the cell
well<00:02:54.230> plant<00:02:54.500> cells<00:02:54.830> don't<00:02:55.070> have<00:02:55.190> skeletons

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
well plant cells don't have skeletons

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.480 
well plant cells don't have skeletons
and<00:02:56.470> plant<00:02:57.470> cells<00:02:57.740> plants<00:02:58.250> don't<00:02:58.370> have

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
and plant cells plants don't have

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.960 
and plant cells plants don't have
skeletons<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.270> so<00:02:59.960> the<00:03:00.530> cell<00:03:00.770> wall<00:03:01.130> kind<00:03:01.760> of

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
skeletons and so the cell wall kind of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.850 
skeletons and so the cell wall kind of
gives<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.390> little<00:03:02.510> bit<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.840> support<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.710> the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
gives a little bit of support to the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.250 
gives a little bit of support to the
cell<00:03:04.130> kind<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.790> keeps<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.240> you<00:03:05.510> know<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.990> one

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
cell kind of keeps it you know in one

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.380 
cell kind of keeps it you know in one
place

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
place

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.440 
place
plant<00:03:08.390> cells<00:03:08.690> are<00:03:09.020> not<00:03:09.980> as<00:03:10.250> squishy<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:11.030> animal

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
plant cells are not as squishy as animal

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.750 
plant cells are not as squishy as animal
cells<00:03:11.720> are<00:03:12.020> because<00:03:12.440> it's<00:03:12.709> all<00:03:12.860> long<00:03:13.130> but

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
cells are because it's all long but

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760 
cells are because it's all long but
again<00:03:13.970> you<00:03:14.120> only<00:03:14.240> find<00:03:14.630> these<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:14.990> plants<00:03:15.470> we

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
again you only find these in plants we

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.000 
again you only find these in plants we
don't<00:03:16.070> have<00:03:16.250> cell<00:03:16.550> walls<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:20.680> finally<00:03:21.680> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
don't have cell walls and finally the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.110 
don't have cell walls and finally the
chloroplasts<00:03:22.670> now<00:03:23.360> remember<00:03:24.280> chlorophyll<00:03:25.280> is

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
chloroplasts now remember chlorophyll is

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.570 
chloroplasts now remember chlorophyll is
found<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.750> plant<00:03:27.380> cells<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:28.040> that's<00:03:28.340> what

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
found in plant cells and that's what

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.490 
found in plant cells and that's what
lets<00:03:28.940> them<00:03:29.150> carry<00:03:29.450> out<00:03:29.570> photosynthesis<00:03:30.260> you

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
lets them carry out photosynthesis you

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.120 
lets them carry out photosynthesis you
know<00:03:30.620> where<00:03:30.739> they<00:03:30.830> turn<00:03:31.040> sunlight<00:03:31.850> into

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
know where they turn sunlight into

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.590 
know where they turn sunlight into
energy<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:36.260> as<00:03:36.700> animals<00:03:37.700> don't<00:03:37.970> have<00:03:38.150> these

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
energy we as animals don't have these

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.080 
energy we as animals don't have these
things<00:03:38.900> again<00:03:39.550> chloroplasts<00:03:40.550> they<00:03:40.820> have

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
things again chloroplasts they have

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.180 
things again chloroplasts they have
chlorophyll<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.930> them<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.830> they<00:03:42.950> allow

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
chlorophyll in them that they allow

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.680 
chlorophyll in them that they allow
plants<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.640> make<00:03:43.880> food<00:03:44.239> through

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
plants to make food through

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.080 
plants to make food through
photosynthesis<00:03:45.500> but<00:03:45.860> they<00:03:46.070> are<00:03:46.220> only<00:03:46.520> found

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
photosynthesis but they are only found

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.540 
photosynthesis but they are only found
in<00:03:47.540> plant<00:03:47.870> cells<00:03:48.489> little<00:03:49.489> guy<00:03:49.640> right<00:03:49.820> there

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.150 

okay<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.270> has<00:03:56.480> been<00:03:56.660> a<00:03:56.720> very<00:03:57.140> very<00:03:57.710> brief

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
okay so this has been a very very brief

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.150 
okay so this has been a very very brief
refresher<00:03:58.610> course<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.390> what<00:04:00.350> makes<00:04:00.680> up<00:04:00.920> your

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
refresher course on what makes up your

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.850 
refresher course on what makes up your
cell<00:04:01.810> if<00:04:02.810> you'd<00:04:02.990> like<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.440> might<00:04:03.680> recommend

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
cell if you'd like I might recommend

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.410 
cell if you'd like I might recommend
that<00:04:04.190> you<00:04:04.340> go<00:04:04.490> back<00:04:04.640> through<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.090> video

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
that you go back through the video

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.810 
that you go back through the video
re-watch<00:04:06.140> it<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.380> couple<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.770> times<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.520> pause

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
re-watch it a couple of times and pause

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.760 
re-watch it a couple of times and pause
whenever<00:04:08.420> you're<00:04:08.780> unclear<00:04:09.140> about<00:04:09.170> something

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
whenever you're unclear about something

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.250 
whenever you're unclear about something
and<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.280> have<00:04:10.520> a<00:04:10.550> look<00:04:10.790> again<00:04:11.690> that's<00:04:12.110> why

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
and just have a look again that's why

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.600 
and just have a look again that's why
it's<00:04:12.380> on<00:04:12.470> YouTube<00:04:12.830> because<00:04:13.040> you<00:04:13.160> can<00:04:13.310> see<00:04:13.490> it

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
it's on YouTube because you can see it

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.100 
it's on YouTube because you can see it
as<00:04:13.700> many<00:04:13.940> times<00:04:14.210> as<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.570> need<00:04:14.720> to

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
as many times as you need to

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.090 
as many times as you need to
alright<00:04:15.410> guys<00:04:15.560> peace<00:04:16.040> out<00:04:16.580> catch<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:16.970> later
