enthusiastically<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.340> just

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
enthusiastically and then I just

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
enthusiastically and then I just
accidentally<00:00:48.300> stabbed<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> cover

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
accidentally stabbed it into this cover

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400 
accidentally stabbed it into this cover
and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.820> broke<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.539> pin<00:00:51.780> off<00:00:51.930> while<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
and then it broke the pin off while I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
and then it broke the pin off while I
was<00:00:52.559> trying<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> pull<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.399> out<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.789> like

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
was trying to pull it out it was like

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.099 
was trying to pull it out it was like
stuck<00:00:54.360> inside<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> try<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.870> finger<00:00:57.870> out

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
stuck inside so when I try to finger out

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
stuck inside so when I try to finger out
it<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.800> broke<00:00:59.370> off<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> tap<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it just broke off because the tap is

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
it just broke off because the tap is
absolutely<00:01:00.809> miniscule<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.070> probably

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
absolutely miniscule as you can probably

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
absolutely miniscule as you can probably
see<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.629> one's<00:01:03.809> bent<00:01:04.049> almost<00:01:04.530> coming

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

off that one's completely come off
originally<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.070> thought<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> might<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> let

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.390 
originally I thought I might have to let
replace<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> whole<00:01:09.869> back<00:01:10.080> seat<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.680> luckily

and it just comes straight out it's
actually<00:01:57.569> pretty<00:01:57.899> easy<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.530> luckily<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.939> not

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
actually pretty easy so luckily it's not

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.230

too<00:02:00.270> difficult<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:00.899> out<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.909> fully

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
too difficult to get out so it's fully

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.839 
too difficult to get out so it's fully
