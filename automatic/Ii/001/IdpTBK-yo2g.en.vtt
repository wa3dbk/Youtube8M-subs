one that had amazing shooting and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
one that had amazing shooting and
Bergkamp<00:01:46.500> was<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.399> choose

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670

very<00:01:48.299> good<00:01:48.509> agility<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.100> 83

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
very good agility I think it was like 83

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.270 
very good agility I think it was like 83
84<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> balance<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.229> pretty<00:01:52.530> high<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.829> there

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
84 and balance is pretty high up there

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.980 
84 and balance is pretty high up there

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and it makes him feel pretty strong

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.480 
and it makes him feel pretty strong
because<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.470> his<00:01:55.740> strongest<00:01:55.950> summer<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.430> the

70s and his aggression in some way in
the<00:01:58.439> 80s<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.579> only<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.880> he<00:01:59.909> does<00:02:00.509> he<00:02:00.630> have
