00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
another galaxy now as far as the

negatives<00:05:09.610> with<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.120> thing<00:05:10.360> go<00:05:10.540> I<00:05:10.780> feel<00:05:11.260> like

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
negatives with this thing go I feel like

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.590 
negatives with this thing go I feel like
this<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:12.580> kind<00:05:13.030> of<00:05:13.090> short

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
this is kind of short

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.440 
this is kind of short
it<00:05:14.290> does<00:05:15.190> have<00:05:15.400> some<00:05:15.430> tracks<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.210> felt

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
it does have some tracks that I felt

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.730 
it does have some tracks that I felt
like<00:05:16.570> could<00:05:16.720> have<00:05:16.810> been<00:05:16.990> drawn<00:05:17.260> out<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.530> bit

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
like could have been drawn out a bit

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.350 
like could have been drawn out a bit
more<00:05:17.919> but<00:05:18.160> still<00:05:18.430> I<00:05:18.640> didn't<00:05:18.910> feel<00:05:19.000> ripped<00:05:19.240> off

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
more but still I didn't feel ripped off

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.690 
more but still I didn't feel ripped off
or<00:05:19.600> anything<00:05:19.780> like<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.770> at<00:05:21.250> this<00:05:21.400> point

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
or anything like that and at this point

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.180 
or anything like that and at this point
I<00:05:22.030> think<00:05:22.390> logos<00:05:23.080> is<00:05:23.290> still<00:05:23.590> just<00:05:23.980> a<00:05:24.160> little

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
I think logos is still just a little

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.330 
I think logos is still just a little
rough<00:05:25.180> around<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:25.720> edges<00:05:25.780> as<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.380> project<00:05:27.100> as<00:05:27.280> a

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
rough around the edges as a project as a

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.790 
rough around the edges as a project as a
collective<00:05:28.180> obviously<00:05:28.960> everyone<00:05:29.470> involved

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
collective obviously everyone involved

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.580 
collective obviously everyone involved
in<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.160> group<00:05:30.370> is<00:05:30.610> an<00:05:31.120> experienced<00:05:32.020> musician

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
in the group is an experienced musician

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.920 
in the group is an experienced musician
but<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:33.550> end<00:05:33.970> of<00:05:34.180> this<00:05:34.330> album<00:05:34.540> doesn't

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
but the end of this album doesn't

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.480 
but the end of this album doesn't
exactly<00:05:35.260> tie<00:05:35.710> together<00:05:35.919> all<00:05:36.190> that

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
exactly tie together all that

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.490 
exactly tie together all that
fantastically<00:05:37.480> and<00:05:37.660> and<00:05:38.200> there<00:05:38.290> are<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.440> few

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
fantastically and and there are a few

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.870 
fantastically and and there are a few
tracks<00:05:38.919> on<00:05:39.130> here<00:05:39.280> where<00:05:39.430> I<00:05:39.490> kind<00:05:39.790> of

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
tracks on here where I kind of

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.469 
tracks on here where I kind of
questioned<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:41.380> mixing<00:05:42.010> because<00:05:42.790> I'm

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
questioned the mixing because I'm

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.270 
questioned the mixing because I'm
hearing<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:43.990> vocals<00:05:44.380> get<00:05:44.530> drowned<00:05:44.950> in<00:05:45.130> the

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
hearing the vocals get drowned in the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.040 
hearing the vocals get drowned in the
cacophony<00:05:45.640> of<00:05:46.030> everything<00:05:46.510> just<00:05:46.720> a<00:05:46.840> little

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
cacophony of everything just a little

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.380 
cacophony of everything just a little
bit<00:05:47.200> especially<00:05:47.410> on<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.950> ninth<00:05:48.190> track<00:05:48.669> where

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
bit especially on the ninth track where

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.070 
bit especially on the ninth track where
you've<00:05:49.600> got<00:05:49.840> these<00:05:50.580> phaser<00:05:52.050> synthesizers<00:05:53.050> and

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
you've got these phaser synthesizers and

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.200 
you've got these phaser synthesizers and
this<00:05:53.410> kind<00:05:53.620> of<00:05:53.650> like<00:05:53.800> buzzing<00:05:54.400> guitar<00:05:54.850> phrase

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
this kind of like buzzing guitar phrase

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.110 
this kind of like buzzing guitar phrase
that<00:05:55.479> gets<00:05:55.570> chopped<00:05:55.990> and<00:05:56.290> looped<00:05:56.669> if<00:05:57.669> you're

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
that gets chopped and looped if you're

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.540 
that gets chopped and looped if you're
