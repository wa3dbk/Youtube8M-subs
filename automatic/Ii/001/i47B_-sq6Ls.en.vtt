00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 How will I start the day? Will I have a breakfast with a little meat? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 And what do I do for the snack? 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 No, well, a chick ... 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Umm, yummy! And at lunch? No, I think I'm going to eat again a 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 meat. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 It's like easier for afternoon, better a little meat at dinner, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 uy but meat at breakfast, at lunch, at lunch ... meat, meat, meat !!! 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Hello friends of Burning And Enjoying, with you, your friend Ingrid Macher, I give you the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 Welcome to this your house! 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And good, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Today we are going to talk about one of the most popular diets that exists in the market. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Yes, I'm talking about the protein or protein diet and how well you know the protein 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 It is an ingredient that has been totally related to weight loss. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Well, first of all before talking about the benefits of protein diet 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 or protein, I would like to tell you about these five risks that exist when 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 we make this diet. And you decide if this diet is for you, or not. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 First of all: 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 How we eat in such an unbalanced way, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 crazy, well do not think I'm crazy, but - we eat, in such a messy way. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 We only eat protein, because our body loses carbohydrates, fiber 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 the good fats. Then, it gets confused. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Second that everything: Of course, you will lose weight, but what happens? You're not only going to burn fat, but 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 that you are going to burn your muscles 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 And who wants to look like with a clothes? So, all watered down! 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 That's why you see those people out there all like that, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 all skinny, all watery. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 We do not like that, right? 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 Third: 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 Obviously, this diet can damage your organs like 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 liver, like your kidneys. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 And because? Because the protein takes a long time for the body 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 destroy it, then because you are eating what you eat, eat what you eat, 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 meat, meat 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 protein, protein ... 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 Well, what's wrong? This makes you even have a coma! 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Yes! So a lot of eye with this kind of 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 practices. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 And number four is, 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 once you start eating the regular ingredients, that if you ate 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 a platico de arroz, a platico de habichuelas, 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 with a chick on the side, a biscuit ... 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Well, what's wrong? You gain weight, and triple. These diets where you take out 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 drastically all the food, 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 have this effect, have you heard, yoyo, rebound? You are right. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 Good and last, 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 once you spend in that race, to go up, 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 download, upload, download ... 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 What happens? Your metabolism slows down, 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 and then this makes it more impossible to lose weight every day. Okay, but 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 It's not all bad news. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Because as we know 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Protein is the number one ingredient if we want to reduce it. Of course! SW, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 What can we learn from today? The lesson for today, is to include protein 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 in all our meals including snacks. And what other lesson 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 should we learn today? That we must include it in a moderate way, 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 because everything in extreme 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 It can cause damage to our health. So remember to combine your 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 carbohydrates, your proteins, your fiber, 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 your good fats. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 Stop listening to all those who say protein, protein, protein !!! 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 And better, 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
