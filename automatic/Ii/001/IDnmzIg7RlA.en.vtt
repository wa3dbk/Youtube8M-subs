 whatever you want give him batasuna up 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.340
 May it be tomorrow 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.490
 this is the rhythm so dance it dances the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.560
 rhythm for me you do not dance carmelo dances 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 brand and what's up guys like that what 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.430
 you saw and a new video and good today 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.990
 I bring a new chapter of the channel is 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.269
 it's worth not having thought 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.349
 bring it so fast the truth but but 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.730
 I've seen that you liked it a lot and 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.019
 that you are supporting the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.610
 channels that I am teaching and that has 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.050
 I liked it a lot and I've seen a lot 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.079
 people interested in leaving the series 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.690
 so I really feel super happy 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.250
 to be able to help more channels that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.350
 As you already know , I always say it to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.969
 principle of this type of videos is that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230
 your support is the fundamental thing or yes that 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.180
 have to go through every video that 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 they were either for each channel that I'm going to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
 teach in this case 4 and if you see that the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 content that goes up that channel like you or 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.590
 that I think you're going to like or 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.360
 subscribe you leave your like and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.579
 all that but as long as the channel 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
 you like it is very important 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.300
 I have four channels that I think I know 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.549
 they deserve enough to come out in this series 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 I think there are four channels that go up a 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.430
 very good content 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.680
 and that I think they deserve to increase 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.540
 a little bit your audience because I think that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.860
 they make very good videos and that they 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.509
 they deserve worth so I'm going to start with 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.729
 the first channel in this case is the channel 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.140
 de putis is a guy I know from 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 some time ago but I'm liking 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.509
 quite the videos that you are doing 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.979
 now and that's why I bring it now has a 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.140
 couple of series that I like for example 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.880
 has a series of making teams 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.039
 cheap hybrids that I think is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.049
 pretty good because there are people who do not 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.670
 he has a lot of money and what to do and what not 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.140
 he knows how to make teams very well and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.640
 Well, have a couple of series that 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.409
 you teach equipment for you cough in addition 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.580
 hybrids that we are give much more not 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.229
 combine several various leagues 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.250
 nationalities and that they are 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.630
 parasites by I think it's pretty 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.340
 well he also has several videos like that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.020
 loose quite interesting by 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.429
 example the best fault shooters 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 of gold that I think is pretty good 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.009
 for the people 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.270
 well when I signed a player have 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.830
 in mind that that player throws well 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.119
 of lack and such and such it seems to me 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.500
 quite interesting and also has 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.210
 example a video called the libraba 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.470
 data so that people who do not have the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.000
 money to buy there are groups for 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.250
 buy a player that more or less 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.420
 resemble that player is worth so I 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.250
 I really like the content that is 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.929
 going up now has very good quality 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.280
 audio video the thumbnail is fine 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.049
 it's pretty cool so good yo 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 I think we can like your channel like this 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.480
 what 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.069
 and I hope you give him some love 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.840
 it is the next channel Riddle 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.099
 gamer what will also comment the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.370
 top of remember what you are going to do now 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.650
 new and good is a boy that especially 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.360
 what stood out most about him is that he comments 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.370
 super good or you have a voice as well 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.900
 as a commentator and the truth is 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.160
 I really like that topic too 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.470
 has a very interesting series that 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.760
 like to see her a lot that is like 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.349
 most important games of the week 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 He makes with his friend called the 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.340
 opi and I think it's a series that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.980
 you can have some good laughs and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.660
 it's pretty funny they do it in 4.0 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.489
 that is with the voice camps and such and is 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.590
 pretty fun, in addition they perform 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.970
 just play from manual so also 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.510
 he's pretty cool besides also in 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.100
 three series of career mode brings videos 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.870
 of online seasons so I think that 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.940
 it is a quite varied content and that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.500
 It can cost you a lot on your channel and I 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.750
 I think it tells you the truth is that I know 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.790
 it deserves because it makes very good videos 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.040
 comments very well and I think it deserves 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.170
 more people see you because I like it 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.510
 quite like how it makes the videos worth 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.830
 the next channel is food mex which is 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.170
 a guy who I've known too 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.730
 a lot of time and I think it makes a 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.500
 very good content and it deserves that 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.900
 more people see it I think that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.360
 makes a content especially of design 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.880
 edits very well the glasses also 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.560
 he comments well enough also and I 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.430
 I really like the videos he makes 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.840
 also has a couple of series 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.610
 interesting has a life of trade or 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.650
 for example that I for example do not have 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.360
 no idea about the trade or so I think 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.280
 that may be interesting also has a couple 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.630
 of people teams reviews has 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.020
 cheap equipment so I think it's a 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.220
 channel that you may like as I say 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.770
 edit very well they have certain 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.030
 very cool miniatures comments pretty 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.410
 well so I think it 's a channel that 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.840
 may be interesting, I 'm telling you that 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.910
 this boy I've been following a lot 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.560
 time and I think he deserves it he does 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.630
 very good videos worth it's also from 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.910
 mexico so it's windless milestones there are that 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.500
 give him love he has said good is worth and the 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.420
 last channel in this case is a channel 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.330
 very special that is a little different to 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.950
 rest that is the channel that is called with z 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.840
 of football which is a channel that known 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.160
 very little truth but I have been 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.810
 liked the videos that he does a lot 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.130
 channel where from time to time yes you go 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.870
 to find some fifa video because 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.760
 he likes it a lot for fifa but above all 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.530
 you are going to find a person who 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.750
 who knows a lot about football knows 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.880
 a lot of football and uploading videos 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.020
 about real life football I'm worth 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.520
 I think that 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.930
 much also has a series that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.940
 I really like what it is like remembering 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.919
 players in this case has already done two 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.590
 chapters that remembering michel 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.690
 laudrup and remembering george weah and that 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.940
 for example george weah and laudrup leave 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.530
 in fifa in legends so I produce 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.930
 of interest also has videos in 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.389
 plan talking about fix planchette where 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.610
 fixed 15 has in plan compilations of 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.409
 moment or silly or funny goals and such 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.819
 that you can laugh at me 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.860
 known very little this channel of 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.240
 Truth has also been spoken a couple of 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.310
 times with him he is an amazing boy 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.990
 You can also talk to him a lot of 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.930
 football comments a lot on twitter 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.310
 respond both on twitter and in the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.080
 videos so I think you can 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.669
 learn a lot about soccer with him because 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.889
 knows a lot also one of the great 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.599
 things that I value about him is that he is very 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.880
 objective that is he is from the athletic of 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.860
 madrid but he is a very objective boy 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.419
 and can speak perfectly in the area 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.800
 Real Madrid regardless of 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.240
 that he is the atleti and I like that 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.680
 enough so I think you give 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.180
 a lot of love to this channel because the truth 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.909
 is that I liked it and it is also very 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.550
 well sometimes you find out about knowing 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.740
 stories and such of real soccer and 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.969
 forget a little fifa last 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.889
 privacy 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.289
 and good to know a little and know 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.089
 stories thanks to this guy that the 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.679
 truth is that he knows quite a lot about 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.029
 football is worth so nothing these are the 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:41.159
 four channels that I have taught today 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:43.169
 I want you to give him a lot of support, I think 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.759
 which are four very good channels besides 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.159
 I forgot to say for sure what 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:49.559
 football concept has started very 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.139
 very little takes three weeks so 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:53.789
 I think how good it would be good 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.319
 that we gave him a boost to his channel 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.360
 I think he's going to be very happy so 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:59.909
 good as I say are four bars very 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.259
 interesting very good to these three 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.139
 first ones that I appoint I follow from 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.449
 a long time ago it's just watching your channels and 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.369
 but but I think there are four 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.649
 channels that you can like quite like that 

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:11.969
 that I really ask you to go through your 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:13.649
 channels that you take a look because 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:16.110
 I think you may like it worth so 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:18.209
 nothing again really thank you for 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.399
 heart that you make this great gesture 

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:22.049
 because I really many people tell me 

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:24.479
 you are amazing you give this opportunity not 

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:25.829
 I really teach these channels that I 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.019
 I think they deserve it but really the 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:30.179
 effort you do that you are the
