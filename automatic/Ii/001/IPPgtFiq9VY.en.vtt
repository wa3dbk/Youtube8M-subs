00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.420
 hello we are in December and for 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.700
 we have arrived at the moment of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.860
 start to prune although the normal thing is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.260
 wait until January or even earlier 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.610
 February we started pruning 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.900
 because it is already when the tree has thrown 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.300
 totally the sheet 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.630
 and although there has not yet been the 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.759
 transfer of nutrients to the 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.190
 branches and such that all the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.510
 technicians since we started already 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.850
 prune because we have many trees that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.040
 prune and as soon as we start then 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 best 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.860
 here you have a tree that has been 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.050
 done training pruning 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.510
 as you see we have left three branches three 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.160
 main branches maybe a little long 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.640
 the normal thing is to leave in about 80 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.850
 centimeters to about 120 degrees 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.780
 you have to do the cross approximately to 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.489
 one meter or ten one meter twenty about 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.530
 everything if then you want to mechanize a 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.699
 book 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.699
 and here you have another 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.260
 and then after training pruning 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 the only thing you have to do is like 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 in this tree and cleaning the part 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 inside the tree so you have a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.460
 good ventilation and giving it the shape of 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.200
 glass so that it can contain the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 highest number of kilograms of pistachio 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.570
 possible 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.570
 here you have a pruned tree 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.740
 still in which we have not yet 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.300
 selected the three branches since 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.100
 has not grown is a graft of the year 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.170
 past 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.720
 You see here we have eliminated all the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.210
 buds that there is approximately up to a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.020
 meter five centimeters and here already 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.969
 we started to leave the buds 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.500
 and then we eliminated the law to the 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.540
 upper flames 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.490
 because these trees have a 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.150
 apical tendency very strong if you let him 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.670
 of molar upper or short yolks 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.670
 We have just for the last bud 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.440
 the yolk that would have more strength would be 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.950
 the latter and would grow practically from 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.950
 vertical shape 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.180
 and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.700
 here you see some trees in which 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 we have not done the pruning yet 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.540
 example this in this tree still not 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.040
 we have selected the three branches 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.110
 that this is the year in which 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.140
 we would have to select them we would look 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.210
 the three most appropriate branches are not always 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.040
 we have the ones we like but 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.050
 we should draw three branches that 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.870
 they were about 120 degrees to me like this 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.760
 first view, I like this one 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.909
 is 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.519
 and this one here eliminate we would do this 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.200
 is too low this one that is between 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.260
 means of the two we have chosen and 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.090
 the higher ones because as I said 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.489
 that the branches that come out in the buds 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.900
 superiors have a great tendency to 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.730
 chop and have grown very 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.920
 vertical with what we do not get 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.350
 our goal of tree shape in 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.930
 base form 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.570
 Regarding males, males do not 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.520
 they need pruning because they do not need a 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.380
 internal interior ventilation since no 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.630
 they have to ripen any fruit in 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.670
 summer then what interests us is 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.890
 that has the highest number of buds 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.500
 possible flower to open in 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.000
 spring and release your pollen and you're 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.220
 then we the only thing we do 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.570
 is to remove the lower branches that 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.060
 bother us for the work with the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.590
 tractor but all the others are 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.120
 we leave and let you grow in a 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.519
 free 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.620
 this tree that you see here is not 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.239
 trimmed 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.500
 these trees well what would that 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.989
 to do is what we have been saying no 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.030
 remove all the inner branches 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.640
 that we see that they are going to take away a 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.420
 little bit of interior ventilation even 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.599
 the best for example is 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.810
 You see that it grows deep inside, take it away 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.030
 already because if not then if we let grow 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.800
 in years in years the following years we are going 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.230
 to have to do with the chainsaw to 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.360
 can not remove them 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.830
 us these trees what we do 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.110
 for the configuration that we have in this 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.080
 plot is to let it grow more in the 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.170
 line of the droppers that are here and go 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.150
 cutting in a little on the lines 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.949
 to have the freest street in the 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.949
 working farm streets 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.870
 I'm going to show you a tree that we've already 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.280
 pruning we have cleaned the pruning 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.380
 internal but one that has not been 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.560
 wrong 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.960
 all the inner branches there are some 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.150
 that we do not get the ideal forms 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.010
 but let's eliminate the branches that 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.780
 come out wings inwards let's go 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.289
 getting eventually to give that 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.759
 cup shape 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.669
 and then what you also have to do is 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.479
 go blunting the pointing branches 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.479
 to avoid those growths 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.890
 with that apical tendency that the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.290
 tree you see like us here we have gone 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.780
 cutting all the branches and start to 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.950
 start forcing the tree to go 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.900
 branching with these toasts 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.030
 these 22 here is what we are looking for 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.440
 because in these toasts is practically 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.020
 all the flames are of flower 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.270
 each of these buds is going to be a 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.520
 pistachio enclosure for the year that 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.530
 comes and this is what we get at 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.690
 cut the branch this branch we cut it the 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.400
 last year the last yolk that was 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.210
 wood 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.880
 it gushed out and continued to grow without 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.430
 However, all the other branches that had 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.660
 that I had along all the others 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.270
 buds that he had along his branch 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.000
 Well, flower toasts have been developed 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.410
 which is what we are looking for, as I tell you 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.850
 that when the trees begin to 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.580
 grow what we do is go blunting 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.060
 them so that they go branching to us all 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:49.009
 the branches and looking for those shines of 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.630
 all these glitters this is our 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:52.390
 objective 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.040
 what is going to give us the production 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.510
 then I for example if there were to 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.730
 this something would have taken away this frog 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.670
 which, as you can see, is being a little 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.100
 down and with time you can get 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.450
 to bother especially when it comes to 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.450
 put the book
