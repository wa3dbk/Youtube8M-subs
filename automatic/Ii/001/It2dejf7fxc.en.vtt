I am sorry the night on was so big and

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
I am sorry the night on was so big and
bulky<00:02:44.910> we<00:02:45.300> could<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:46.020> fit<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.530> into<00:02:46.740> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
bulky we could just not fit it into the

bulky we could just not fit it into the
screen<00:02:47.400> here<00:02:47.700> which<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:48.990> proves<00:02:49.230> my

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
screen here which I think proves my

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.470 
screen here which I think proves my
point
