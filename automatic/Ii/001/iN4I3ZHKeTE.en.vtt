which so what we do generally you can
pass<00:03:00.840> these<00:03:01.050> around<00:03:01.230> these<00:03:01.590> are<00:03:01.769> our

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
pass these around these are our

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.960 
pass these around these are our
monitoring<00:03:02.459> boards<00:03:03.170> for<00:03:04.170> roaches<00:03:04.620> now<00:03:04.970> I'm

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
monitoring boards for roaches now I'm

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.699 
monitoring boards for roaches now I'm
just<00:03:06.150> showing<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.720> few<00:03:06.959> things<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.470> would<00:03:07.560> be

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
just showing a few things that would be

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.270 
just showing a few things that would be
used

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.630 

if<00:03:13.000> someone<00:03:13.390> were<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:14.200> apply<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.860> bait<00:03:15.190> in<00:03:15.430> this

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
if someone were to apply a bait in this

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.300 
if someone were to apply a bait in this
area<00:03:16.000> or<00:03:16.570> if<00:03:16.870> they<00:03:16.990> were<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.260> apply<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.470> residue

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
area or if they were to apply a residue

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.910 
area or if they were to apply a residue
think<00:03:19.240> about<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.750> are<00:03:20.110> they<00:03:20.380> in<00:03:20.500> contact

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
think about that are they in contact

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.790 
think about that are they in contact
with<00:03:21.010> food<00:03:21.190> services<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> shelving<00:03:22.780> unit<00:03:22.840> we

experience of understanding how Pest
Control<00:03:34.870> gets<00:03:34.900> done<00:03:35.350> so<00:03:35.980> they<00:03:36.190> can<00:03:36.370> also

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
Control gets done so they can also

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.000 
Control gets done so they can also
