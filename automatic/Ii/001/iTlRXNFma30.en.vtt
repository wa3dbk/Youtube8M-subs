in<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:00.960> short<00:00:01.199> tutorial<00:00:01.370> I'm<00:00:02.370> going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> look

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this short tutorial I'm going to look

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.120 
in this short tutorial I'm going to look
at<00:00:02.939> texturing<00:00:03.449> show<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.200> how<00:00:04.440> we<00:00:04.500> can<00:00:04.710> texture

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
at texturing show you how we can texture

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.190 
at texturing show you how we can texture
a<00:00:05.190> complete<00:00:05.640> panel<00:00:06.060> using<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.810> ball<00:00:07.020> nose

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
a complete panel using a ball nose

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.250 
a complete panel using a ball nose
cutter<00:00:07.400> and<00:00:08.400> also<00:00:08.670> how<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.110> restrict<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
cutter and also how to restrict the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.370 
cutter and also how to restrict the
texture<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:11.190> with<00:00:11.340> inside<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> boundary<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> if

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
texture to with inside a boundary so if

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.440 
texture to with inside a boundary so if
we<00:00:13.500> start<00:00:13.769> by<00:00:13.889> creating<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.490> new<00:00:14.670> rectangular

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
we start by creating a new rectangular

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.250 
we start by creating a new rectangular
panel<00:00:15.780> let's<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.740> panel<00:00:17.400> that's<00:00:17.520> 20<00:00:18.000> by<00:00:18.260> 24

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
panel let's have a panel that's 20 by 24

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.460

inch diameter ball nose cutter the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.080 
inch diameter ball nose cutter the
bigger<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> ball<00:00:55.050> knows<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.520> better<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
bigger the ball knows the better for

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
bigger the ball knows the better for
large<00:00:57.360> jobs<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.649> you're<00:00:58.890> cutting<00:00:59.219> small

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
large jobs but if you're cutting small

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.910 
large jobs but if you're cutting small
jobs<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> get<00:01:00.840> away<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.230> smaller<00:01:01.620> dams

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
jobs you can get away with smaller dams

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.960 
jobs you can get away with smaller dams
and<00:01:02.160> borer<00:01:02.309> nose<00:01:02.460> cutters<00:01:03.799> okay<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.760> run

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and borer nose cutters okay if we run

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.670 
and borer nose cutters okay if we run
down<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.270> texturing<00:01:06.689> forum<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
down the texturing forum this is the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
down the texturing forum this is the
maximum<00:01:08.189> depth<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> cutter<00:01:09.030> will<00:01:09.119> go<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
maximum depth that the cutter will go to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.480 
maximum depth that the cutter will go to
and<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.590> vary<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.100> depth<00:01:11.340> between

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and it will vary in depth between

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
and it will vary in depth between
between<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> maximum<00:01:12.659> depth<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> min<00:01:13.290> depth

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
between the maximum depth and min depth

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.420 
between the maximum depth and min depth
so<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.670> set<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> 50%<00:01:16.070> then<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> min

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
so if this was set to 50% then the min

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.560 
so if this was set to 50% then the min
depth<00:01:17.670> would<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.210> point<00:01:19.200> zero<00:01:19.470> five<00:01:19.799> an<00:01:20.070> inch

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
depth would be point zero five an inch

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.230 
depth would be point zero five an inch
let's<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.780> change<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
let's just change this so just to be a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.480 
let's just change this so just to be a
little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.570> shallower<00:01:25.580> at<00:01:26.580> 30%<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> cut

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
little bit shallower at 30% the cut

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.940 
little bit shallower at 30% the cut
length<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.720> length<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> sculpt

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
length this is the length of the sculpt

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.649 
length this is the length of the sculpt
that<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> core<00:01:32.490> will<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.060> tool<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.479> produce

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that the core will the tool will produce

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.010 
that the core will the tool will produce
and<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.220> say<00:01:35.909> six<00:01:36.240> six<00:01:36.810> inch

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and just go for say six six inch

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.830 
and just go for say six six inch
scallops<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.939> also<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.570> min

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
scallops and we can also have a min

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560 
scallops and we can also have a min
length<00:01:40.020> based<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.700> variation<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.329> well

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
length based on the variation as well

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.749 
length based on the variation as well
and<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> min<00:01:44.070> length<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> say

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
and so we have a min length and say

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.160 
and so we have a min length and say
almost<00:01:45.750> three<00:01:46.140> inches<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.460> an<00:01:47.670> overlap

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
almost three inches you have an overlap

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.630 
almost three inches you have an overlap
this<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> where<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> sculpts

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this is this is where the sculpts

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 
this is this is where the sculpts
overlap<00:01:51.090> end<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.570> end<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.439> let's<00:01:52.590> say<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.860> have

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
overlap end to end so let's say we have

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.020 
overlap end to end so let's say we have
a<00:01:53.210> overlap<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.390> around<00:01:54.689> about<00:01:54.840> 30%<00:01:56.000> variation

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
a overlap of around about 30% variation

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.319 
a overlap of around about 30% variation
random<00:01:57.750> variation<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.350> 50%<00:01:59.329> step-over

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
random variation of 50% step-over

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.209 
random variation of 50% step-over
between<00:02:00.810> passes<00:02:01.759> like<00:02:02.869> half<00:02:03.869> an<00:02:04.020> inch<00:02:04.219> let's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
between passes like half an inch let's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.160 
between passes like half an inch let's
make<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.490> slightly<00:02:05.880> bigger<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.270> 0.6<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> an

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
make that slightly bigger it's 0.6 of an

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.650 
make that slightly bigger it's 0.6 of an
inch<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.789> variation<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.910> step-over<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.509> well

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
inch and variation is step-over as well

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.060 
inch and variation is step-over as well
so<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> randomness

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
the preview preview the results see now

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.690 
the preview preview the results see now
that<00:03:09.580> we<00:03:09.670> have<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.820> very<00:03:10.120> regular<00:03:10.660> pattern

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
that we have a very regular pattern

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.980 
that we have a very regular pattern
instead<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.820> having<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.210> random<00:03:13.570> offsets

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
instead of having the random offsets

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.190 
instead of having the random offsets
between<00:03:14.410> depth<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:15.010> length<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.330> step-over

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
between depth and length and step-over

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.460 
between depth and length and step-over
etcetera<00:03:21.780> okay<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:22.840> that's<00:03:23.140> looked<00:03:23.380> at

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
etcetera okay so that's looked at

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.070 
etcetera okay so that's looked at
texturing<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.100> complete<00:03:24.490> area<00:03:24.810> let's<00:03:25.810> just

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
texturing a complete area let's just

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.100 
texturing a complete area let's just
look<00:03:26.230> at<00:03:26.550> texturing<00:03:27.550> a<00:03:27.730> selection<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.660> selected

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
look at texturing a selection a selected

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.770 
look at texturing a selection a selected
area<00:03:29.230> for<00:03:29.860> example<00:03:30.220> on<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> sign<00:03:30.670> so<00:03:31.510> it's<00:03:31.720> a

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
area for example on a sign so it's a

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.350 
area for example on a sign so it's a
file<00:03:32.080> close<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.310> file<00:03:36.550> on<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.240> the

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
file close it's a file on the in the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.830 
file close it's a file on the in the
samples<00:03:37.780> folder<00:03:37.960> called<00:03:38.320> simple<00:03:38.770> textures<00:03:39.840> so

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
samples folder called simple textures so

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.460 
samples folder called simple textures so
we<00:03:40.990> wish<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.320> texture<00:03:41.710> between<00:03:42.040> 8<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.780> the

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
we wish to texture between 8 and the

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.640 
we wish to texture between 8 and the
inner<00:03:44.770> circle<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.910> logo<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:47.320> to<00:03:47.380> do<00:03:47.620> that

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
inner circle and the logo so to do that

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.560 
inner circle and the logo so to do that
I'm<00:03:48.070> just<00:03:48.130> going<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.460> drag<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:48.910> select<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
I'm just going to drag and select the

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:59.000 
I'm just going to drag and select the
logo<00:03:52.410> select<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.530> circle<00:03:54.360> new<00:03:55.360> offset

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.300 

inwards<00:04:00.010> by<00:04:01.470> quarter<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.560> an<00:04:02.620> inch<00:04:03.390> offset

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
inwards by quarter of an inch offset

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.910 
inwards by quarter of an inch offset
this<00:04:06.310> gives<00:04:06.580> me<00:04:06.790> some<00:04:07.300> new<00:04:07.510> boundaries<00:04:07.920> and

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
this gives me some new boundaries and

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.730 
this gives me some new boundaries and
we're<00:04:09.850> going<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> texture<00:04:10.390> between<00:04:10.740> this

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
we're going to texture between this

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.720 
we're going to texture between this
boundary<00:04:13.650> shift<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.890> select<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.310> additional

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
boundary shift and select the additional

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.890 
boundary shift and select the additional
boundary<00:04:16.390> so<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.290> boundary<00:04:17.620> around<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:18.040> text

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
boundary so the boundary around the text

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.620 
boundary so the boundary around the text
we<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:19.930> group<00:04:20.410> those<00:04:20.590> together<00:04:20.890> so<00:04:21.160> group<00:04:21.700> so

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
we can group those together so group so

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.080 
we can group those together so group so
now<00:04:22.660> they<00:04:23.080> become<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.650> single<00:04:24.130> object<00:04:24.250> when

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
now they become a single object when

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.440 
now they become a single object when
selected<00:04:25.600> just<00:04:26.530> going<00:04:26.770> to<00:04:26.830> delete<00:04:27.419> some<00:04:28.419> of

interested in delete the little bits
we're<00:04:33.910> not<00:04:34.060> really<00:04:34.270> going<00:04:34.419> to<00:04:34.479> texture<00:04:34.810> inside

texture<00:04:46.500> select<00:04:47.500> the<00:04:47.620> cutter<00:04:47.860> and<00:04:49.140> here<00:04:50.140> we

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
texture select the cutter and here we

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.719 
texture select the cutter and here we
have<00:04:50.350> our<00:04:50.470> two<00:04:50.680> inch<00:04:50.860> bullnose<00:04:51.310> that's

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
have our two inch bullnose that's

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.280 
have our two inch bullnose that's
probably<00:04:52.060> a<00:04:52.120> bit<00:04:52.270> big<00:04:52.450> for<00:04:52.479> this<00:04:52.780> design<00:04:53.140> so

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
probably a bit big for this design so

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.440 
probably a bit big for this design so
I'm<00:04:53.350> going<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.530> say<00:04:53.620> edit<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.070> tool<00:04:54.450> let's

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
I'm going to say edit the tool let's

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.420 
I'm going to say edit the tool let's

click to edit the text reform and we

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.529 
click to edit the text reform and we
experiment<00:05:41.620> with<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:41.830> sliders<00:05:42.310> so<00:05:42.610> we<00:05:42.760> change

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
experiment with the sliders so we change

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.290 
experiment with the sliders so we change
the<00:05:43.660> variation<00:05:44.229> of<00:05:44.320> depth<00:05:44.910> change<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:46.090> length

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
the variation of depth change the length

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.969 
the variation of depth change the length
so<00:05:46.660> that<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.960> length<00:05:47.110> isn't<00:05:47.470> always<00:05:47.650> four

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
so that the length isn't always four

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.260 
so that the length isn't always four
inches<00:05:48.340> you'll<00:05:48.550> see<00:05:48.700> they're<00:05:48.850> all<00:05:49.000> very

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
inches you'll see they're all very

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.640 
inches you'll see they're all very
regular<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:51.450> so<00:05:52.450> we<00:05:52.570> change<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:52.900> sliders<00:05:53.470> for

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
regular and so we change the sliders for

this time we say preview Auto paths see

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.779 
this time we say preview Auto paths see
that<00:06:07.810> we<00:06:07.900> have<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.229> finished<00:06:08.770> sign<00:06:11.610> so<00:06:12.610> we've

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
that we have the finished sign so we've

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.650 
that we have the finished sign so we've
