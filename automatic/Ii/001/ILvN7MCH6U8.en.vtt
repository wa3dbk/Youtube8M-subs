 with twice you can not take 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.660
 the air from the hoses through the syringe we teach and other videos 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.740
 how to draw the air through 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.180
 is from the syringe directly into the cartridges 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.630
 There you go and use that is roast. 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.670

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.250
 colonized 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.980
 another body as well 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.869
 it's a very cheap tool 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.890
 and how it is in the midst of a great city a very important utility 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 the process is done on appeal 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.510
 because there is not much mystery 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.160
 Ok folks 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.960
 Where will I get the cartridge here? 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.250
 it's on our site you have 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.030
 the compatibility ratio 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.650
 Carthusian ld joining tokyo 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.190
 really 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.020
 it's compatible 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.560
 and then you can then 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.399
 zeel does this according to your cartridge 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.570
 I'll use it here. 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.200
 I'll get it here, you think I even pretend tokyo. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.870
 This is Syria. 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.360
 and here's your hood 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.400
 so I'll get it 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.180
 and I'll fit the cartridge 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.260
 it's very simple 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.210
 in kassel cartridge 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.640
 no getafe 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.290
 in this lower part 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.939
 It's where I'm going to put syringe 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.629
 for 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.629
 to pull 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.839
 kate referee 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.539
 of the print head 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.359
 helium fitting 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.259
 Can you tell that you have cachaÃ§a? 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.259
 the one that is a colored cartridge / p 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.499
 in which I will take the air out of the print head is worth remembering 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:35.700
 and here I have cartridge has in hand but you can do this procedure 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.519
 directly 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.629
 there on the printer by taking the print carton side cartridge 

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:46.079
 and in the matter of taking the hoses you can not do in the printer itself 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.579
 do not damage anything, just be careful not to 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.469
 to achieve no registration before the person would have a role of the end 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:54.169
 anyone 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.629
 so I'll pull the air 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.860
 had to return to active life automatically netinho 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.849
 with the beat well means you have nothing left 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.499
 the ink itself is coming out 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:08.699
 OK people 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:10.679
 so I took what he had 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:12.239
 in case of air 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.919
 now to take the ink 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:17.289
 this means that the ink was again 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.289
 however hike 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.179
 to the right places inside the cartridge 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.729
 each color 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.149
 has its passage 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.620
 is correct 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.600
 in this date 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.419
 inside the cartridge 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.909
 once you take that, you had to remove that air 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.899
 you can 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.899
 Minc stated via the syringe 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:44.069
 can see that there was no paint in the general context. 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.069
 syringe 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.029
 ae 

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.230
 I already took 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.409
 here the cartridge 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.059
 it is always important to do this process 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.439
 a piece of paper near you to come up with 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.809
 the question is with this feeling 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:06.250
 you can tell that it's a little bit, said the scientist, why? 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.259
 he in turn had 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.089
 and there got dirt 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.169
 You clean up that dirt. 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.109
 with the same toilet paper 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.719
 the pgm of this conventional paper buy customer market 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:21.659
 to remove the excess paint there because if we always leave it is time to 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:22.680
 print out 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.069
 took that access 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.099
 the exchange for being ready again square and all things perfectly 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.069
 which is personal 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.860
 if repeated here you can buy 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.090
