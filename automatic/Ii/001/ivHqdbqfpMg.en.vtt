about<00:00:19.439> ten<00:00:19.710> years<00:00:19.740> ago<00:00:20.099> when<00:00:20.429> TRS<00:00:20.849> started<00:00:21.359> our

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
about ten years ago when TRS started our

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.419 
about ten years ago when TRS started our
inventory<00:00:22.169> was<00:00:22.320> composed<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> basically

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
inventory was composed of basically

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.189 
inventory was composed of basically
nothing<00:00:23.880> more<00:00:24.089> than<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> small<00:00:24.630> variety<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
nothing more than a small variety of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.200 
nothing more than a small variety of
original<00:00:25.769> equipment<00:00:26.009> projectors<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:26.820> we've

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
original equipment projectors that we've

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.019 
original equipment projectors that we've
salvaged<00:00:27.809> from<00:00:27.840> oae<00:00:28.529> headlights<00:00:29.009> these<00:00:29.849> days

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
salvaged from oae headlights these days

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.790 
salvaged from oae headlights these days
market<00:00:30.630> has<00:00:30.719> changed<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:31.259> little<00:00:31.380> bit<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.769> that

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
market has changed a little bit in that

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.709 
market has changed a little bit in that
retrofit<00:00:32.489> errs<00:00:32.610> tend<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.000> prefer<00:00:33.149> more

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
retrofit errs tend to prefer more

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.930 
retrofit errs tend to prefer more
aftermarket<00:00:34.500> parts<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.730> kind<00:00:35.879> of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
aftermarket parts so it's kind of

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
aftermarket parts so it's kind of
interesting<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.629> how<00:00:36.989> things<00:00:37.350> have

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
interesting to see how things have

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.740 
interesting to see how things have
progressed<00:00:37.890> over<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.220> years<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:38.909> now<00:00:39.210> we

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
progressed over the years because now we

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
progressed over the years because now we
only<00:00:40.079> keep<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.409> small<00:00:40.710> variety<00:00:41.220> of<00:00:41.250> projectors

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
only keep a small variety of projectors

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
only keep a small variety of projectors
in<00:00:42.300> our<00:00:42.479> actual<00:00:42.780> projectors<00:00:43.320> category<00:00:43.860> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in our actual projectors category and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.399 
in our actual projectors category and
the<00:00:44.519> bulk<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.180> our<00:00:45.420> closeout<00:00:45.870> category

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
the bulk of it in our closeout category

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.829 
the bulk of it in our closeout category
now<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.909> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.120> wide<00:00:48.329> variety<00:00:48.510> of

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:48.839 
now because of the wide variety of

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.619 
now because of the wide variety of
projectors<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.469> exist<00:00:49.979> these<00:00:50.159> days<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:51.449> keep

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
projectors that exist these days we keep

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.210 
projectors that exist these days we keep
them<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.869> close<00:00:52.140> outs<00:00:52.409> because<00:00:52.830> it<00:00:52.979> would<00:00:53.100> be

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
them in close outs because it would be

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.789 
them in close outs because it would be
nearly<00:00:53.489> impossible<00:00:53.640> for<00:00:54.330> us<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.799> catalogue

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
nearly impossible for us to catalogue

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:58.039 
nearly impossible for us to catalogue
all<00:00:56.009> of<00:00:56.159> them<00:00:56.339> and<00:00:56.580> ensure<00:00:57.299> the<00:00:57.449> quality<00:00:57.930> of

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.049 
all of them and ensure the quality of

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:00.020 
all of them and ensure the quality of
all<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.320> them<00:00:58.470> especially<00:00:58.710> based<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.790> fact

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
all of them especially based on the fact

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.390 
all of them especially based on the fact
that<00:01:00.269> all<00:01:00.869> of<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:01.170> oay<00:01:01.439> parts<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.100> really

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:02.400 
that all of these oay parts are really

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.249 
that all of these oay parts are really
just<00:01:02.610> coming<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:03.180> headlights<00:01:03.869> that<00:01:04.019> we've

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
just coming from headlights that we've

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.929 
just coming from headlights that we've

because<00:01:21.509> we<00:01:21.659> sell<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.079> for<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.290> lot<00:01:22.470> less<00:01:22.710> than

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
because we sell it for a lot less than

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.790 
because we sell it for a lot less than
its<00:01:23.100> real<00:01:23.280> market<00:01:23.670> value<00:01:23.720> however<00:01:24.720> every<00:01:25.650> now

its real market value however every now

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.170 
its real market value however every now
and<00:01:26.010> then<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.370> might<00:01:26.520> encounter<00:01:26.790> something

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and then you might encounter something

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.170 
and then you might encounter something
that<00:01:27.330> isn't<00:01:27.930> perfect<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:29.100> useless<00:01:29.610> but<00:01:29.940> maybe

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that isn't perfect not useless but maybe

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.630 
that isn't perfect not useless but maybe
a<00:01:30.300> little<00:01:30.479> bit<00:01:30.659> less<00:01:30.780> than<00:01:30.990> perfect<00:01:31.440> but<00:01:31.650> fact

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
a little bit less than perfect but fact

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.250 
a little bit less than perfect but fact
is<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.120> we<00:01:33.240> sell<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> usually<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
is that we sell it it usually like I

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.660 
is that we sell it it usually like I
said<00:01:34.470> half<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> price<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.280> it's<00:01:35.430> really

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
said half the price that it's really

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.390 
said half the price that it's really
worth<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> closeouts<00:01:37.350> category<00:01:37.860> kind

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
worth so in the closeouts category kind

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.649 
worth so in the closeouts category kind
of<00:01:38.460> look<00:01:38.580> at<00:01:38.670> something<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.240> Murano

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
of look at something like this Murano

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.570 
of look at something like this Murano
LED<00:01:40.200> headlight<00:01:40.620> here<00:01:40.830> we'll<00:01:41.010> take<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.340> apart
