00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.889
 what fart friends are like I hope 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.360
 they are happening of the most chingón 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.129
 I am alecsandro and today 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.230
 I'm having a battle again 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.180
 with this team forgive me but it is that 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.800
 this team does not stop showing battle 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.390
 after battle so it's the last 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.370
 battle that I'm going to bring to the channel with 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.830
 this team and with nothing more to say 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.090
 we have start as in the battle a 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.350
 I'm going to start pulling my 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.850
 dragon ball to forgive the battle is 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.320
 against is cross rubén that is removing to 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.090
 my dragon ball while my opponent 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.890
 predicting this is going to start with your 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.449
 cluster this is bad because the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.399
 cloisters whenever they go out to the field 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.829
 battle is almost certain to go for a 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.989
 heartbreaker made this cycle dyster 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.149
 goes for the heartthrob of his two 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.120
 attacks the speed and drop is of the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.770
 defenses but with surprise this cluster 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.559
 it's going to turn out to be the one with the grass 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.690
 white so lendro but the defenses 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.130
 is going to be restored and well I decided 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.410
 a trap rocks because I wanted to break 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.850
 all the potential focus is here I 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.739
 I was in a very bad position because 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 if that with the ter was shown again 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.309
 I would no longer have anything else on my computer 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.229
 faster than him and probably not 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.090
 would have made a swift however the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.350
 country of entry from me will be why 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.230
 is what I think because it goes by 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.760
 stones which is neutral owner makes me 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.800
 before year but more than anything because I 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.420
 hit five times and now yes for a 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.240
 explosion because he had to get me 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.220
 to be author in clean was a sacrifice 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.690
 I do not know if it was in vain it was not in hand but 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.220
 it was a sacrifice that I had to make 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.780
 as a vehicle is he has more be 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.850
 defense and I do not do anything with the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.470
 explosion so I dragonball for 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.450
 be weakened but I'm sorry dragon 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.820
 ball but that your sacrifice is not going to be 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.040
 in vain for that reason I wish to put myself alexandro 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.750
 and see for a point that is super 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.000
 effective and I'll end up unlocking from 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.500
 a single blow to this cluster what good 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.090
 that this was created as I said was not for 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.070
 other beings more because if I had gone 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.510
 for him I was going to be faster than me 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.040
 will be everything I knew I was going to be an actor 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.600
 it would be faster since both 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.970
 we have an increased level of our 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.010
 our speed but my being fit 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.080
 has higher base speed for two area 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.580
 I want to do a lot faster now 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.650
 continues to poke his blows which is 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.480
 bad because that rope simply gets 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.220
 use to make the cane peace so 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.500
 how am I stuck in point-blank 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940
 value exists for four I am forced to 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.490
 change and now I want to get into mischa 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.720
 brontosaurus I'm surprised that she 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.700
 protection because you can not do it 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.530
 absolutely nothing and good the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.300
 speed with impulse skill yo 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.959
 I knew I was going to try whenever it brings 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.440
 unesco 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.780
 I know what 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.790
 of service with trying to increase the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.620
 speed as much as they can so 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.480
 paiporta protection and I predicting 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.740
 this I will say for a dragon dance 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.260
 so that my speed and attack me 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.580
 they are also increased to more one level and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.990
 so what goes into the battlefield to 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.310
 that place that is no longer I have the 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.470
 probability that I can be more 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.540
 quick that he is to increase another level the 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 speed thanks impulse ability and 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.050
 I was surprised that that in deciding on the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.240
 relay directly good not so much 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.920
 because if we think about it well with the trap 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.810
 rock and I broke it went to the focus band 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.270
 I'm not going to say get your team with 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.890
 the pokemon the worst pokemon to which he 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.380
 I could have spent the pull speed 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.270
 audon team that thing is very young and 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.760
 even though he multiplies his attack 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.740
 had attack on his speed by 2 follows 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.480
 being slower I do not know what so 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.970
 well I decided to attack directly with 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.010
 a header which despite the team 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.950
 Don is physically defensive and is not very 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.450
 Effective work pretty hurt and good new 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.160
 not even half of the year but it does 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.960
 Bastantito and I do not have to change 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.330
 really security by a trap 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.520
 rocks so I decide to stay and for a 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.770
 with me that this ice since super 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.600
 effective however it did not weaken him and the 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.760
 steam an earthquake which makes me tasty 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.650
 user can not stand it 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.540
 like we're not going to go in, Dad 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.700
 water be with 14 of life already know how 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.200
 are my pokemon always hold if the 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.540
 opposite pokemon is not so liked 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.220
 they always put up with life in red me 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.019
 I have nothing to lose and on the other 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.430
 with me ice so I decide because 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.440
 united ice does not want to predict anything 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.019
 I went all quiet all safe 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.849
 normal on nothing here me with this team 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.280
 gift that is enabled and now decides 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.049
 put your grapes which and shiny and good 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.299
 Luck is a little weird to see I like it 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:55.079
 see in fact I want to be a his bat is 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.459
 say doctor your bat say who 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.400
 testarazo the one that gets you a mega whore 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.140
 I'm good, gentlemen, how much damage 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.940
 sorry for saying that I did not have to 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.819
 say it I got up with to say I'm going to 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.980
 say whores oy testarazo so for 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.230
 I said that but I still got up extra 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.209
 asshole so I'll go have a single 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.280
 hit your bat is what I love about 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.289
 testarazo if you refine it is sure that you 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.910
 kill if you do not resist it is good for a 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.380
 protection which was to be expected already 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.590
 that it was not going to be much faster than me 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.060
 are you a brontosaurus I said if you want 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.530
 do in your friend well I will have very 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.389
 questions to the dragon predicting to 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.979
 protect and now I 'm sure that already 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.700
 it's not going to be much faster and apart 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.670
 many 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.830
 in the attack the sandstorm subsides 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.450
 which I do not have any problem with that 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.370
 good such is for you want to do a little 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.380
 of damage since as a table brought 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.450
 rock type users does not hurt me the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.430
 sand storm for a delicious 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.720
 fangs ice say is hits want 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.360
 be them in your drink and I'm going to 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.360
 to throw and say I was not going to fall weakened 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.259
 has cross is a very good pokemon if 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.879
 brings the Spanish elected and good to the mega 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.030
 what does not happen the mega is that its 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.220
 speed looks European dale 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.350
 its speed is less than that of gera 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.700
 normal cross so I think I already know which 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.010
 it was his strategy his strategy was 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.600
 make the graves pass all the 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.670
 changes of statistics to gera cross 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.650
 and so it was that I could be sweet or 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.480
 afternoons, pass them to the cluster 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.220
 of the two is perfect to spend and 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.200
 Uruguay for a testarazo that thanks to 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.540
 ceus I do not fail it because I have 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.760
 equipped the magnifying glass with my trump strip and that 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.500
 gives me only chance to fail by 11% 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.840
 I testarazo the to put the last 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.310
 pokemon which is a silvio that good 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.710
 go for a protex simply to 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.930
 study is I'm sorry I'm sorry 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.820
 of the pepes of my testarazo and good yet 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.040
 well it does not make much sense since I 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.890
 I put the maxwell pe to mass gushed saurio 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.570
 and has 9 testarazos so it is not 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.340
 because there is as friend have still go 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.680
 to be testarazos I will go for my 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.260
 last testarazo which is going to hit and 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.300
 I will end up screaming at this site like this 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.030
 that is brontosaurus was read asks me the 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.650
 today reduction in breasts enunciated I 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.030
 I did not want to bring more batteries with this 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.520
 team but I said is that this is a 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.650
 brontosaurus is showing off so 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.330
 way to tell them no, so this is 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.100
 today's battle I hope that you 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.420
 have liked it if so do not forget to leave 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.040
 your sensual online 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.160
 subscribe to the channel if they are not 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.810
 subscribed the time of live will be 120 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.120
 likes we are going to increase 10 likes to the 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.970
 previous goal to do 120 20 likes 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.920
 so that on Friday there will be a new battle 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.930
 another thing that I am going to comment is of 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.730
 that we are going to make a new dynamic and 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.740
 this dynamic is not just likes 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.060
 it's because people think but to many 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.740
 people have told me not to upload 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.570
 three in which I lose so this 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.910
 dynamic is called part of his mother 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.040
 alexandro which means that all 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.470
 the people who fight against me and me 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.480
 lose the battle is likely to come out 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.760
 the video in the next you dream the 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.470
 battle in the next video and good is
