00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 On July 25, 1976, NASA was probing 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.930
 Mars with the space probe Viking 1 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.440
 when it orbited by coordinates 40 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.750
 degrees 44 minutes north and 9 degrees 27 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.480
 minutes west known as the plateau of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.239
 cydonia the probe took a picture that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 puzzled the whole world about a 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.470
 rocky mass of about 3 kilometers of 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.480
 long by 15 kilometers wide it 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.129
 he had sculpted a face a face 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.120
 human that did not look like a training 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.120
 capricious of the terrain 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.400
 the mass immediately rushed to 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.680
 deny any artificial evidence 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.110
 of said face justifying its appearance 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.750
 as the result of a casual optical effect 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.310
 caused by erosion of the land in 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.010
 opposed to the shadows that 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.570
 they had drawn the first to alert 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.460
 that the training was beyond the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.850
 coincidence were the computer scientists 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.229
 vincent di pietro and gregory molinar that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.680
 they worked in the flight center 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.900
 spatial of gÃºdar 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 the researchers took a second 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.560
 photograph of the face he presented 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.510
 lighting conditions other than 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.360
 first and submitted the images to 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.950
 analysis of your computer the result 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.650
 what they came to is that the face 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.380
 he had bilateral symmetry he had eyes 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.140
 nose and mouth with lips and even 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.510
 it showed what looked like a helmet as 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.920
 surprising is that the images under 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.560
 different lighting angles 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.470
 they continued to show bilateral symmetry 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.390
 without the details disappearing 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.490
 both computer scientists published a report 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.229
 but he was quickly disqualified by 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.390
 all the scientific authorities of the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.520
 era another scientist who joined the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.550
 analysis of the face of cydonia was the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.380
 doctor marc carlotto specialized in 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.770
 satellite observation and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.420
 digital image processing in 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.000
 1996 publishes the book enigmas de marte 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.860
 where he exposes his conclusions to 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.890
 subject the face to an extraction of 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.170
 forms based on shading techniques 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.720
 the image processed by carlotto suggests 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.860
 that the face is three-dimensional and concludes 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.020
 that even the figure shows teeth 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.660
 the problem is that said face is 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.520
 added to another suspicious indication in a 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.530
 region known as the quadrangle of 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.210
 elysium had been photographed several 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.040
 pyramidal formations that either 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.040
 they had the appearance of being natural 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.560
 what has best integrated into this enigma is 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.690
 the researcher richard hoagland who 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.430
 ensures that the Martian face is only 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.560
 part of a complex city formed by 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.410
 polyhedral objects whose location 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.360
 seems to follow a rectilinear order soon 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.830
 He turned his attention to a pyramid of 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.810
 three kilometers in length and a 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.300
 kilometer high located south of the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.160
 face oakland established that it was 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.900
 of a symmetric bilateral pyramid of 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.870
 five sides and its axis of symmetry 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.390
 it pointed towards the face one of the edges 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.190
 pointed towards the city and another towards the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.920
 this on a hill unusually 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.750
 rounded to what he baptized as 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.060
 toulouse in these images we can 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.650
 check the alignments of the edges 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.650
 of the pyramid with the aforementioned points 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.950
 when the NASA sent the Vikings all the 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.659
 world what I expected is that I take 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.069
 land again in the cydonia region 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.069
 but it was not like that 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.710
 incomprehensibly and at the last minute 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.710
 they diverted the route of viking 2 to the 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.479
 utopia area plans one more place 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.009
 inaccessible and less likely that 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.880
 there was water in signs of life 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.880
 known 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:53.460
 in 1998 the nasa sends to the global 

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.860
 surveyor to Mars to photograph the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.249
 face of cydonia and that is what we 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.009
 presents the nasa as this photograph of 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.889
 a mountain and at the foot of the page a note 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.900
 it says it's not a burden a gross 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.889
 montage to demystify at once 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.889
 the whole thing 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.870
 in this way the nasa ditched the 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.760
 controversy 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.500
 arguing that the previous image 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.410
 it had been just a play of lights and 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.570
 shadows a simple optical illusion without 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.130
 However, other experts say that this 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.260
 new image has been retouched 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.540
 digitally to erase any stroke 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.760
 or original trace since the face 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.500
 recorded for some this has been another 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.790
 attempt of the space agency to 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.740
 cover up the evidence of a 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:42.020
 ancient civilization that probably 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.020
 color made mars thousands of years ago 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.290
 it is said that two out of three probes 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.490
 sent to Mars end badly or 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:10.069
 disappear 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.110
 and let's not talk about the mars observer whose 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:14.110
 communication was mysteriously lost 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.090
 although the nasa will find indications of 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.600
 life these evidences would never come to 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.600
 the public light 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.230
 the same nasa asked in 1960 to the 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.660
 institution brookings based in 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.340
 washington a report to anticipate what 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.230
 degree of impact would have a contact 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.570
 extraterrestrial in the economy the 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.790
 political religions 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.590
 the report warned the nasa that 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.930
 could find signs of life in the 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.260
 moon or mars or that there were even 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.330
 ruins or ships in there in the report 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.120
 brookings figure the whole procedure 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.940
 to hide these evidences we are 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.190
 talking about a report to foresee how 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.500
 it wobbles and on all the foundations of 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.860
 human civilization had been said 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.860
 Contact
