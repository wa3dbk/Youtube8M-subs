 are found today so for 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.210
 the last time I did you so 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 concern the match equator france 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.630
 I had predicted the victory of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.340
 france unfortunately and like a lot 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.170
 of you besides indicated on 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 youtube in particular 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.810
 I was wrong was in a no 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.939
 thought about the fact that the equator could 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.080
 hold the tie 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 so this is so this time so we 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 so your predictions on the Algerian match 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.059
 Russia 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 so before we start this video which 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.230
 I recall the concept of the video the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.629
 video that was unfolding did not have office 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.300
 of program the match that was taking place 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 made part of the game does not count 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.630
 for the prognosis what matters is 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.070
 really what I'm telling you so here 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.330
 it's not enough not it's not the score 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.770
 which will be displayed at the end of the video 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.030
 it's really what I want 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.130
 titi who matters 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.860
 little reminder also for yet this 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.240
 who in terms of my competition 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.700
 so with regard to 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.320
 members of I pick up just enough to 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.120
 let your winning prognosis 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.520
 winner 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.500
 etc etc while on youtube it is enough 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.360
 of you be two jumps to leave 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.120
 say algeria winner russia wins a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.710
 draw or so give the score 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 exact and if you have the exact score I 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.180
 will score points if you just come 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.080
 the winner you will notice a lo 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.520
 all this is small reminders so 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.340
 so what about my short so the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 side of Algeria so I'm talking to you and 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.850
 at 3.65 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.400
 the odds of the draw at 3.5 and russia 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.400
 at 2.06 Russia is not talking 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.710
 Russia therefore leaves slightly favorite 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.260
 Hyper interesting rating on this match 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.790
 for if you tend to paris etc 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.470
 the haircuts are super interesting are 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.290
 super high even the rating of Russia 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.120
 is really breeders of 2.06 know 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.120
 it's that it's leaving it downright good 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.770
 so that was it for what 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.540
 continues with regard to the coasts the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.760
 last matches of these two teams 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.650
 so for the contribution algeria so you 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.880
 know if you follow the cup of the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.430
 World so assiduously 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.920
 algeria won against south korea 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.259
 4 goals to 2 south korea that had made 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.170
 draw against Russia a dut 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.910
 all over 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 Russia has also lost so to face 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.020
 to belgium 1 goal to 0 while 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.680
 Algeria has also lost against this 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.390
 same team belgium 2 goals to 1 we go 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.580
 we will not necessarily talk about the no 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.050
 Algeria match against Belgium 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.040
 which is used for it is strictly for nothing 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.330
 Sazy very good performance of the younger 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.340
 fennecs facing south korea 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.440
 so south korea be careful it stays 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.819
 a relatively modest team is 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.400
 more is not necessarily there the korea of 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.769
 south that we had in 2002 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.500
 especially where the team had made a 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.090
 pretty incredible course in section of the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.830
 world then there had been ddt 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.120
 big arbitration mistakes there is no 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.230
 worry but he had still made a 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.520
 pretty interesting course with my 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.590
 so in italy I remember 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.790
 here it is more this team there that 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.040
 says so acquire first succeeded in 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.490
 win 4 goals at 2 two goals at the docks 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.100
 conceded bus will have to make very 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.230
 very careful defensively Russia has 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.650
 pretty interesting weapons 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.959
 front with particular corinne who writes 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.150
 that a potential some potential purpose 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.390
 same voice c1 is a real scorer 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.379
 even if it's not necessarily big 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.000
 attacker he still 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 it still has qualities it will take 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.819
 not that it will not neglect the city has 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.620
 put ten goals in his jean hamon club 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.980
 to hits in 22 games season 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.660
 past 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.610
 so here we are really going to have to do 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.660
 watch out for that dive attack that 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.810
 is quite tall and athletic 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.640
 suddenly but here is Algeria showed 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.200
 that she could go ahead cap 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.690
 had scored goals especially 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.069
 and that it could especially offer 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.290
 game we had seen a match against the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.609
 belgium was who was totally who 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.230
 was hyper defensive 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.790
 there was as I live in the cnda 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.260
 in the video he had tried to play the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.030
 tie eventually if they do not have 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.290
 successful but that's against South Korea 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.670
 they still have to go ahead he has 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.069
 still proposed things with 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.989
 especially with slimani islam who 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.489
 leave who proposed things too 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.260
 who, by the way, who was 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.510
 noticed it was very interesting 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.959
 offensively 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.709
 brahimi who took his responsibilities 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.280
 who played at the performance that we 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.740
 awaits 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.170
 it was really the team the team 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.060
 of Algeria has managed to propose a match 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.120
 interesting against south korea we 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.030
 obviously expecting from who reiterates the 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.650
 same match that said regards this 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.550
 regarding to Russia will have to 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.680
 that they propose something else 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.190
 than what they composed face to face to 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.410
 Belgium 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.380
 so they lost that a goal 1 and 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.760
 his teaser lost a goal while trying to 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.320
 play unlike the team 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.630
 from Algeria who totally try to 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.930
 close the game that said here they laughed 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.150
 are made to trap koreans on 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.970
 his very first match with an act that 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.650
 did yesterday who is hyper hyper discuss 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.910
 after after that match the pump 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.560
 it is a good goalkeeper and that we should 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.880
 to be yourself a very good guardian 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.090
 said here he had completely cracked 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.530
 on especially problem match and then is 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.140
 for Algerians fortunately since 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.590
 since 167 quai Russia would have 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:08.670
 would have won against South Korea 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:11.820
 for my prognosis between 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.700
 algeria and russia since algeria 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.510
 is still in front of the ranking they 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.210
 will do everything to 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.770
 they will do everything to shut down the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.180
 game I think also will do everything to 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.980
 close the game to just keep 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.240
 this advance 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.889
 South Korea and is already 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.139
 eliminated so 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.490
 still that donald j nonsense korea 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.659
 from the south is not eliminated at all 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.460
 South Korea is not chauvinism a 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.210
 point russia to a point and algeria 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.610
 at a point too 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.830
 so it's enough that eventually it's 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.219
 hyper open it is enough that Algeria 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.439
 lose 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.900
 it is enough that it was even that there is a 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:46.240
 draw that south korea come 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.550
 by repacking worn by three goals 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.319
 of difference it would quisera that they 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.779
 would have a goal very very everage 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.180
 favor white laurent he will organize a 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:57.159
 goal flea 1 also but 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.289
 he would have a goal advantage 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.150
 marked he will be he will be sitting goal scored 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:03.669
 and so it would be south korea which 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.840
 would happen if algeria and russia 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:07.180
 had to draw 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.840
 so so here is in any case for 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.969
 ensure in any case the victory is 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.060
 past these phases of chickens Algeria is going 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:19.990
 have to win and Algeria will win 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:23.050
 match against Russia we do not ask 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.539
 so in any case 1 2 3 010 that 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.529
 would that be more than enough it 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:28.479
 there is already an African team 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.729
 so I'm happy I like when the 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.770
 African teams finally shows in all 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:33.819
 case of interesting things in the 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.680
 cups of the world so I'm happy he 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.990
 is the team from nigeria that managed to 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.779
 to pass the phase of chickens the coast 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.820
 ivory was really at your fingertips 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.680
 to get there I was hyper frustrated of 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.290
 of the penalty really in the stops of 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.220
 game especially they were not banal so 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.470
 it would really really really 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.990
 class he's doing Algeria is also coming 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.460
 so to pass this phase of hens he 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.230
 there is also a very very very weak 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.700
 luck for the kids did nothing on 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.320
 will see what gives a performance against the 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.409
 Portugal should hope that with the 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.479
 same opportunity 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:06.989
 Germany or the United States lose 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:08.959
 our more chips earlier rather rather 

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:10.949
 the united states lose as much as to do 

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:14.959
 so that since they are the ones who have the 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.959
 turn of more the less interesting 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.220
 Germany is at +4 very brief me 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.810
 want but I have not spread out on the 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.400
 masses on the matches and next I hope 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.139
 that the ghana will succeed in any case to 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.210
 do something and especially that's it 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:29.380
 I hope you come there are not cracked 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:32.050
 and will get in any case this is it this 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.340
 second place which was so worth who is going 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.750
 the team was going to 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.850
 World Cup Round of 16 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.440
 it would be classy and in any case 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.810
 it's my prono here is for me 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.760
 I give you an appointment so 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.530
 very soon so I have not yet

 I have not set the matches yet 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.220

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:49.120

 very very modest in front of me I say to the 

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.930
