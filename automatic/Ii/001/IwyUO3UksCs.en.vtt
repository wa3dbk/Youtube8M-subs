00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.070 
basically finished product right now on
my<00:02:03.679> birch<00:02:03.830> bark<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.250> there<00:02:04.720> right<00:02:05.720> here<00:02:05.929> is<00:02:06.049> the

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
my birch bark in there right here is the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.729 
my birch bark in there right here is the
string<00:02:06.560> at<00:02:07.039> I<00:02:07.250> bone<00:02:07.460> there<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.410> did<00:02:09.410> another<00:02:09.619> one

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
string at I bone there I did another one

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.610 
string at I bone there I did another one
there<00:02:10.540> and<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.690> whole<00:02:11.810> idea<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.319> string<00:02:12.590> is

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620

there and the whole idea the string is
just<00:02:12.920> compressed<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.550> compacted<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.300> it'll

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
just compressed and compacted so it'll

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.390 
just compressed and compacted so it'll
basically<00:02:14.750> bear<00:02:15.080> long<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.069> what<00:02:16.220> I'm<00:02:16.310> going
