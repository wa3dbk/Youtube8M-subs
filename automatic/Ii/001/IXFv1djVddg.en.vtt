00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 This is without a doubt the best 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.009
 Transformers movie and that's not 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.009
 say a lot 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.969
 transformers the era of extinction 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.850
 is information or that that was the worst 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.970
 imitation of sea back they have seen in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.880
 your life but this is this transformers 4 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.150
 you can believe that they already go in 4 in 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.260
 the 4 or the u was not bad at 2 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.559
 It was terrible the 3 was also bad and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 it is already worth 4 and the ports that follow 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.030
 earning money keep earning money is 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.950
 the worst of all the best of this 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.500
 movie is frame man no place to 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.430
 doubts because he is a very good actor although 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.430
 it's late 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.450
 That's how Mark Wahlberg speaks. I do not know. I'm very 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.890
 fool I do not know 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.010
 but if that was the best thing about the movie 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.920
 love to come back but an actor can not 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.860
 save the entire film even if the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.790
 movie entertained me or entertained me 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.979
 it entertained me, it amused me to see them but 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.400
 this is very long very long 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.860
 two hours 40 minutes I think in two hours and 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.200
 average for the credits I say I do not know 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.300
 but they last two and a half hours a little longer 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.880
 I think I do not know how long the movie is 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.620
 it is too much longer than 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.060
 I should be nothing in this movie 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.590
 it makes sense nothing makes sense to them 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.440
 I'm going to tell you more or less what 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.630
 what the movie is about, humans are 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.450
 creating transformers for the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.070
 defend the transformers but the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.660
 Transformers were defending 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.030
 humans to begin with or that the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.740
 transformers were the transformers that 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.240
 defending humans but others 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.950
 who defending the transformers we 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.540
 other transformers are left until 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.200
 practically those that what are 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.170
 doing humans 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.880
 it does not make sense because they are 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.700
 doing transformers to defend against 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.429
 the transformers 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.829
 it does not make sense in one part and a magnet 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.429
 and the magnet starts to take all the 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.349
 metals to heaven but in the movie 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.730
 they discover that the transformers are not 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.489
 made of metal that are made of a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.970
 mineral I do not know extra land are 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.100
 made of a mineral 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.260
 then you want what you want to go 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.590
 the transformers are not metal they are 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.180
 a mineral then the magnet that was 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.400
 bringing all the metals to heaven not 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.590
 I should bring the transformers because 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.930
 it's because you are not made of 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.930
 sales is that it does not make sense to be 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.310
 what everyone wanted to see in this 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.950
 movie were the isabel bots online or 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.590
 bots and if they come out but I go out for 10 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.480
 minutes and the movie lasts 2 hours and 40 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.490
 minutes so for all more than 2 hours 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.690
 new truth no bots the effects are 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:00.570
 parents to some extent because bone 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.970
 but the one is wrong is wrong very badly 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.400
 but the first time you saw her this 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.829
 at least as it is said 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.750
 where we had the effects but 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.760
 now the effects we have already seen 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.220
 so much and in any movie you see 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.340
 effects of that quality that they already give are 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.349
 something x and its effects an improvement one 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.620
 it improves not very much but it improves a little 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.620
 is how michael bay directs the action 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.739
 because in the other good in the 3 there 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.450
 so much less but another like that is how it 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.010
 you see the beams as you see the battles 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.010
 of the transformers in the other 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.120
 but this is aimed a little more like this 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:24.280
 because there's a lot of slow motion in 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.640
 this movie a lot of slow motion which 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.200
 it's a good thing because then you can 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.060
 give an account of what is happening because 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.560
 the others passed everything so fast that you 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.540
 realize what is happening with the cne 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.940
 like in the one of hands uncle that that me 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.490
 he made the worst of the movie that he hates 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.310
 hands have 110 but I did not like it 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.790
 debates why because everything happens so 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.790
 Quick 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.439
 and I do not know is that he did not understand anything 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.810
 what was happening understanding 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:54.819
 historical and I understood what I did not understand 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.979
 was the action I already left the subject of 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.590
 transformers but good the point that 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.620
 the action looks better even if 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.990
 everything in slow motion a lot of it 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.689
 be in slow motion this movie is 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:12.370
 full of commercials is full and over 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:16.240
 of commercials has one of pot light 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.529
 that condemned that light voice peacoat who 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.779
 he knows how many days to get out there 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:22.000
 also the cars the cars are 

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:24.250
 aliens but they are not aliens if 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.319
 they are indigenous but they are chevrolet brand 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.199
 they are brand lamborghini are ferrari brands 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.529
 but but they are aliens and it is 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.110
 chance that we planets too 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:37.539
 have to ferrari and lamborghini and 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.510
 I do not know many car brands 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.310
 but but good 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.360
 you can go the movie at the end I 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.719
 somehow division 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:53.759
 I did have fun that I can say more 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:55.560
 and that's why I'm going to give him a 5.5 because 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.189
 amused is a is not a movie 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:03.930
 good in any way but it amused me 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:06:09.030
 so if I'm going to give you a 5.5 if that 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:11.099
 is going to give transformers 4 and then if this one 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.370
 leave it down if you want to see a review 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:17.430
 some special movie or I do not know anything 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.120
 what they want to see video and then today I go 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.120
 to see the one 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.570
 well in family the new adam comedy 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.570
 sandler 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:32.380
 so wait for the criticism of this 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.300

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.250
