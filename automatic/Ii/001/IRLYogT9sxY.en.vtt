00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.150
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.059
 this is me the space and remember i am somehow 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.179
 once did more precisely I think you remember so 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.129
 how this video was past review on my 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.589
 second case for storing parts from 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.570
 various lego minifigures and many 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.630
 wrote in the comments did a review on 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.490
 The first case since it was a review 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.690
 laid out for a long time and many already 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.330
 could forget that it is supposed to 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.090
 how is it sorted the more so 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.420
 the range is quite replenished 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.460
 and nowhere to take into account not to take into 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.300
 attention is what it is 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.750
 replenished on the clock now so much 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.170
 Here is the time on the street night but I decided for 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.649
 you surveyor do in general do not sleep 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.760
 reluctance well let's start so open 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.100
 our case and 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.110
 at first we can see just a pile 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.760
 details 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.829
 here you can immediately see 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.670
 quite a large amount of oleg 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.440
 heads, they do quite a lot 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.810
 spaces in this case 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.600
 basically different heads here 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.830
 my well kept not mine and if this 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.340
 figure of course 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.030
 and all of them you can now see on 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.390
 its screens 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.020
 there are also various heads here 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.590
 which are made more than standard 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.780
 kind of here let's say this is an ordinary chapter 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.430
 this is the usual chapter these all heads are not 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.100
 made let 's say differently departures to 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.350
 another form if these all are one form 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.189
 just painted differently then these already 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 different forms of meat here are comfortable hats for 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.900
 my swan men but slam sorts 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.740
 took here some 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.890
 some weapons are also available watch it 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.530
 orcs if this scythe is old 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.980
 but also torso torso but here also 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.960
 there is a decent enough 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.300
 thick enough here swelling thick 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.350
 so there is enough of them 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.450
 a lot of well and a third-party case in principle 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.360
 I showed in the last review but also in 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.330
 first review of this case 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.130
 here we have some minifigures 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.210
 which I just did not put in random 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.790
 decided for the noise outlined spiderman doctor 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.550
 and fur no frankenstein 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.400
 pharaoh if gafar through old harry 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.220
 potter 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.810
 squeak kind of way not squeak kind of but not 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.450
 defiled slug space police 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.240
 I restored that figure that was for 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.220
 Gummi not figure 3 series I remember exactly 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.500
 correct in the comments if something 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.200
 wrong said principle here us 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.040
 there is saarn 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.070
 Ie hand saw well and in principle 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.030
 various other non-figurines here us 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:04.050
 branch with legs and all supported 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.650
 Well good enough, and here we have department 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:13.140
 for various random random things 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.900
 just pick I donâ€™t know a sun hat 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.170
 anything you can find here and 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.480
 up to those quite diverse a lot of them 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.370
 details even here is the spider that I painted 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.709
 specially show in the dark glowed 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.350
 Well, in principle, yes, here are my ones 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.420
 various small storage cases 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.700
 parts from Lego minifigures 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.269
 Of course, these are not all my small details. 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.000
 Lego minifigures and the important ones that I 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:44.299
 I found it, but I also have it at all 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.870
 small case in which all the weapons from 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.920
 various companies of Chinese under 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.080
 name la la 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.810
 most of them are from there 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.180
 but they are very much like firearms 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.690
 maybe there are also some 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.390
 firearms weapons in principle on this case 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.580
 will be the next review in everything was food on 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.580
 good luck to everyone all bye bye
