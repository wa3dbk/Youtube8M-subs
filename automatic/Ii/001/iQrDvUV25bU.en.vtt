of a get the quest okay but while I
could<00:00:51.359> so<00:00:52.359> I<00:00:52.750> mean<00:00:52.989> everything<00:00:53.559> was<00:00:53.829> pretty

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
could so I mean everything was pretty

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.740 
could so I mean everything was pretty
much<00:00:54.129> about<00:00:54.460> all<00:00:54.670> Bible<00:00:54.879> skills<00:00:55.420> were<00:00:55.539> pretty

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
much about all Bible skills were pretty

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.299
