00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 I do not believe a few things myself 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.090
 but it is the truth 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.210
 hello together the film factory it 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.520
 crazy things happen again and again 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.870
 out there especially in the film world 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.660
 and we'll pack that together again 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 and ten times something crazy 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.689
 not to believe it is coming 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.000
 now 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.770
 Today we start with Batman Batman 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.020
 begins and there are quite a few 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.210
 crazy fact namely in all 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.739
 filming before so all the movies 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
 did not fit the role 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.030
 keys bruce wayne into the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 Latin American countries 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.899
 actually based or he puts you 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.609
 The question is my day also the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.379
 know that this is an american city 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.489
 then they should just bruce 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.769
 wayne say no 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.809
 in all other films so never 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.390
 has played it actually is 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.059
 just produce something again 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.570
 crazy from star wars carrie fisher 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.179
 The Princess Leia plays in the movie 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.129
 no underwear so no bra and 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:01.289
 is explained as well as why this is the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.659
 case is that wanted george lucas 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.659
 or clear by schlawiner claims 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.320
 namely, there is no space in space 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.689
 underwear 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.399
 I would also like to see if that 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.020
 then also at loup or what may continue 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.909
 whether she also shines all over 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.500
 but that 's up to everyone 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.930
 case in the reason why princess leia 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 no bra wears and therefore this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 cult figure from star wars the one or 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.619
 other nipple alarm when i'm also in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 film has the truman show is one 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.219
 my favorite movies with jim carrey and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.420
 I just like that so that the movie like that 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.180
 easy is loose and still 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.799
 Media criticism transported well and now 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.990
 But there is a part of the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.689
 original script and there you will find 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.070
 that the original version is a whole 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.590
 Others was that this movie 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.259
 wanted to be really dark should I 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.270
 Watch it a little bit before 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.579
 like two men armed with knives 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.590
 rape a woman without anything to do with it 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.450
 company asks you the question whether 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.820
 he twelve year old child is supposed to be there 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.670
 solve a movie ticket as well as cheat 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.020
 his wife is holding a prostitute 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 already a baby in the air and threatens 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.829
 This is on the ground between meters 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.079
 or did truman want his wife with the 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.520
 so-called waterboarding technique hello 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.630
 what's going on there 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 maybe jim carrey 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.260
 Thought no, I'm not exactly 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.460
 as I will try a man with 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.230
 to shoot a light pistol 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.240
 but that one original idea 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.860
 not necessarily at the end of the synonymous 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.300
 result must be i mean that sounds 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.660
 also very interesting if he 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.790
 completely exhausted but that seems sooner 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.520
 such a gloomy david fincher movie too 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.170
 be just as relaxed as halfway 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.790
 light mediensatire I always find 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.260
 quite interesting at the end of it 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.970
 but also wants to be honest 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.620
 I would go that other movie too 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.510
 like to see the people at xanten 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.250
 Unbelievable fun at work 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.410
 you can not help yourself otherwise 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.850
 explain that he is always so gimmicks always 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.810
 reinstall in your movie like that 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.460
 look nice pizza planet truck the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.170
 one knows from toy story that is 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.430
 really in every movie just joined 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.890
 you can not find him in the incredible 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.300
 but even with the e reader, you have yourself 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.580
 think damn it 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.050
 how can we get a pizza truck here 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.460
 install somehow if you look at that 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.070
 You just have to look at the picture again 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.720
 say people at pixar mr and mrs 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.000
 pixar i would like to give you the arm 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.130
 take and cuddle that's really cool 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.810
 and I also imagine the meeting 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.730
 they are all sitting there and say great 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.220
 script history is you see 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.920
 everything cool from furniture animated the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.870
 hammer and suddenly shortly before the meeting 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.020
 the end asks one the most important question 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.090
 the whole day how do we do it 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.040
 now actually the pizza truck there 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.280
 bring in everything and so ba ba ba ba 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.240
 ba ba ba ba and unit at this very same 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.800
 crazy idea had 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.690
 You will notice that for me too 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.800
 Crazy pictures take place in the head 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.600
 when I think about it and I believe 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.700
 exactly how it works am 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.530
 somehow at pixar people i find myself 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.950
 great if any of pixar see 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.500
 Thank you so much for being so loving 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.630
 growing like that was very interesting 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.210
 is maybe the tribute of panem 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.910
 did you notice that woody 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.310
 harrelson plays with you when you eat 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.020
 He always sees only one dessert or one 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.390
 just vegetable is just because 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.670
 that he is a vegan and therefore wants to 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.470
 he of course also that in this 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.910
 So film is not shown so what 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.610
 must eat another or respectively 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.190
 nothing else is a bit like that 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.600
 looks as if it was not vegan presents 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.609
 The question is actually something 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.980
 then really important woody harrelson 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.600
 which is important in every case and I think so 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.010
 that at least one movie fuck 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.600
 wildlife one of the coolest movies of the 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.450
 last years will take hold of yes 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.860
 shot turned so he was on everyone 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.630
 case the director and the crazy one is 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.070
 that he's watching these cars 10 like that 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.800
 captures incredibly cool 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.200
 He himself is eight times through the 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.630
 driver's license test flown through his 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.100
 driving test and that must be one 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.550
 first imitate me ask the question 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.770
 as in god's name once there 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.060
 fall through 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.200
 I think that would be the first question 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.670
 I give him an interview if that 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.650
 will surpass and I'm curious 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.570
 I will answer you then too 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.790
 but someday they will present that 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.990
 was now first knew a new fact 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.820
 you that the muppets and knight rider 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.370
 Having something in common is because it is 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.830
 actually so that the dubbing speaker 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.150
 from carmen at the same time the 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.480
 dubid hasselhoff 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.130
 one is aware that not directly world 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.680
 and the message synonymous not always so 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.090
 speaks but it makes us 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.040
 Of course not at all, but it is 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.510
 in fact the same voice and then 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.330
 You have to ask the question almost sometimes 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.590
 Doing one of your pity or David 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.290
 hasselhoff of the earth 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.990
 I finds definitely pretty funny 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.280
 because you just do not hear it but we do 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.290
 Of course , people do not see that 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.080
 You would do that but speak 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.400
 the same people would preside over what 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.900
 is really crazy is there on the 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.460
 usual suspects there are the yes 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.740
 Famous scene all lined up 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.660
 you always get suspicious like that 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.220
 and there are always moments there 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.350
 is a bit giggled and that was 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.820
 not even the plan of the director 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.770
 So in no script that is 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.080
 just remember that benicio del toro the 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.700
 knew all the time and I mean 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.190
 we are honest yes even if I always 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.600
 say the pkk vomit humor is annoying 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.520
 but assads are one of yours 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.980
 Circle of friends that I believe you can 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.350
 on 50 60 70 years old are always 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.860
 again scenes that are actually serious 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.300
 should 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.250
 he probably spends the night before 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.990
 somehow too many floor has eaten 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.580
 then you just have to laugh and there you can 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.350
 also the most professional 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.820
 Actors do not always tear together 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.440
 but it is much cooler that the director 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.330
 then said come 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.700
 that was kind of like this is there 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.460
 This scene is very special 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.380
 maybe not a human 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.730
 but maybe that would have been true too 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.380
 simply thought at some point there is 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.560
 this internet is there someday 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.870
 this youtube and sometime bachmann 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.250
 a channel at such a factor 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.960
 is really helpful then thank you 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.850
 Just let me know the team of 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.440
 the usual suspicious thank you for 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.840
 this case for many is still 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.000
 sean connery of the best james bond 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.200
 actor he was forgetting 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.580
 also like his, of course 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.500
 acting performance not now 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.750
 would somehow attack rudimentary 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.700
 but you forget that at that time 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.919
 already sean connery in each of these company 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.440
 he had to wear a wig with it 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.540
 can look like james bond just now 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.220
 Sean Connery even looked there 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.260
 no longer have most of them 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.419

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.650
 interesting from russia peter jackson 

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.600
 was not the first of the 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.190
 hobbit has filmed but also the 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.870
 Russians have been in the 80s times 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.790
 thought we could finally do that 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.160
 hobbit filming and the result is 

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.169
 but very very freaky very bizarre 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.780
 and very crazy and he me 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:24.700
 did not know before that the hobbit 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.040
 actually somewhere in times 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:29.260

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.150
