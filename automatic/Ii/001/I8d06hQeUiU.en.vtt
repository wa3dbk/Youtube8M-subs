00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.270 

66<00:01:09.690> 69<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.500> what<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.830> post<00:01:11.070> summer

66 69 I'm like what do post summer
creates<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> doesn't<00:01:11.880> make<00:01:11.970> any<00:01:12.120> sense<00:01:12.330> well

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
creates it doesn't make any sense well

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.010 
creates it doesn't make any sense well
the<00:01:13.260> reason<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.890> valve<00:01:14.730> has<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.240> done<00:01:15.510> a<00:01:15.540> color

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the reason is valve has now done a color

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.100 
the reason is valve has now done a color
scheme<00:01:16.440> with<00:01:17.130> all<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.670> their<00:01:17.910> crates<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.960> now

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
scheme with all of their crates and now

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.540 
scheme with all of their crates and now
have<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.350> color<00:01:19.680> scheme<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.130> their<00:01:20.310> crates

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
have a color scheme for all their crates

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.120 
have a color scheme for all their crates
like<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.270> black<00:01:21.600> aqua<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> yellow

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.540 

now<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:28.170> no<00:01:28.380> idea<00:01:28.680> why<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> colors<00:01:29.370> are

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
now I have no idea why the colors are

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.210 
now I have no idea why the colors are
there<00:01:29.700> maybe<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.660> they<00:01:31.290> introduce<00:01:31.710> 60

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
there maybe because they introduce 60

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.150 
there maybe because they introduce 60
