torres I go ahead and buy them he'll be
on<00:01:34.840> six<00:01:35.020> chemistry<00:01:35.439> that<00:01:35.859> means<00:01:36.099> they'll

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
on six chemistry that means they'll

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:39.239 
on six chemistry that means they'll
bring<00:01:36.399> like<00:01:36.639> some<00:01:36.849> kind<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.409> storyline<00:01:38.409> which

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
bring like some kind of storyline which

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:40.769 
bring like some kind of storyline which
means<00:01:39.549> he<00:01:39.700> gets<00:01:39.729> home<00:01:40.090> sick<00:01:40.329> or<00:01:40.450> something<00:01:40.659> cuz

means he gets home sick or something cuz
on<00:01:40.899> six<00:01:41.109> chemistry<00:01:41.499> I<00:01:41.679> mean<00:01:41.859> I<00:01:41.979> springing<00:01:42.310> more

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
on six chemistry I mean I springing more

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.489 
on six chemistry I mean I springing more
spanish<00:01:42.789> players<00:01:42.819> or<00:01:43.149> chelsea<00:01:43.479> players<00:01:43.719> to

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
spanish players or chelsea players to

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.019 
spanish players or chelsea players to
help<00:01:44.709> this<00:01:44.799> chemistry<00:01:45.159> get<00:01:45.340> boosted<00:01:45.669> so<00:01:45.819> could

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.029 
help this chemistry get boosted so could

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.569 
help this chemistry get boosted so could
turn<00:01:46.149> into<00:01:46.329> a<00:01:46.419> very<00:01:47.200> good<00:01:47.439> a<00:01:47.770> hybrid<00:01:48.310> kind<00:01:48.520> of

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
turn into a very good a hybrid kind of

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.949 
turn into a very good a hybrid kind of
thing<00:01:48.729> which<00:01:49.299> I've<00:01:49.419> really<00:01:49.630> liked<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.810> sound

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
thing which I've really liked the sound

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.989 
thing which I've really liked the sound
of<00:01:50.109> it<00:01:50.169> sinks<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.829> much<00:01:51.069> better<00:01:51.310> concept<00:01:51.669> over

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
of it sinks a much better concept over

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.510 
of it sinks a much better concept over
all<00:01:52.119> of<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.229> previous<00:01:53.469> season<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.069> guys
