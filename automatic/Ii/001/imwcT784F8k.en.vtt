you have a hair follicle and in that
follicle<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.159> hair<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.610> grown<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.210> those<00:01:54.990> are

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
follicle a hair is grown so those are

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.719 
follicle a hair is grown so those are
the<00:01:55.259> myths<00:01:55.439> some<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> truths<00:01:56.250> about<00:01:56.399> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the myths some of the truths about it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.030 
the myths some of the truths about it
are<00:01:56.939> two<00:01:57.689> thirds<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.079> men<00:01:58.290> experience<00:01:58.860> hair

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
are two thirds of men experience hair

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.679 
are two thirds of men experience hair
loss<00:01:59.070> one-third<00:01:59.729> of<00:01:59.820> women<00:02:00.060> experience<00:02:00.180> hair

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
loss one-third of women experience hair

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
loss one-third of women experience hair
loss<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:01.170> there's<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.560> huge<00:02:01.950> genetic<00:02:02.250> factor<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
loss if there's a huge genetic factor to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.440 
loss if there's a huge genetic factor to
it<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.390> most<00:02:04.350> hair<00:02:04.770> loss<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.100> misdiagnosed<00:02:05.850> so

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it and most hair loss is misdiagnosed so

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
it and most hair loss is misdiagnosed so
the<00:02:06.630> number<00:02:06.960> one<00:02:07.170> diagnosis<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.190> hair<00:02:08.550> loss

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the number one diagnosis for hair loss

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.760 
the number one diagnosis for hair loss
is<00:02:08.970> androgenic<00:02:09.929> alopecia

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
is androgenic alopecia

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.240 
is androgenic alopecia
where

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
where

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.980 
where
male-pattern<00:02:11.940> female<00:02:12.660> pattern<00:02:12.840> baldness

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
male-pattern female pattern baldness

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.750 
male-pattern female pattern baldness
okay<00:02:13.590> so<00:02:13.860> for<00:02:14.070> women<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.490> a<00:02:14.580> little

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
okay so for women it's a little

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.010 
okay so for women it's a little
different<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:15.150> more<00:02:15.270> diffused<00:02:15.720> they<00:02:15.840> kind

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
different it's more diffused they kind

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.780 
different it's more diffused they kind
of<00:02:16.110> lose<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.560> hair<00:02:16.800> all<00:02:17.070> throughout<00:02:17.580> their

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
of lose the hair all throughout their

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.090 
of lose the hair all throughout their
head<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.000> just<00:02:18.390> general<00:02:18.750> spending<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.590> men

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
head like just general spending and men

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.440 
head like just general spending and men
it's<00:02:20.340> more<00:02:20.520> they<00:02:20.670> lose<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.850> little<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.210> top

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it's more they lose a little on the top

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.790 
it's more they lose a little on the top
and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.930> they<00:02:22.050> get<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.230> little<00:02:22.350> bit<00:02:22.650> up<00:02:22.770> here

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
and then they get a little bit up here

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.620 
and then they get a little bit up here
and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.460> there<00:02:23.700> get<00:02:23.820> a<00:02:23.850> bald<00:02:24.120> spot<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.510> they

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and then there get a bald spot and they

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.360 
and then there get a bald spot and they
kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.930> join<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.770> then<00:02:25.830> they<00:02:25.890> just<00:02:26.220> get<00:02:26.340> a

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
kind of join and then they just get a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.100 
kind of join and then they just get a
little<00:02:26.400> bit<00:02:26.610> hairy<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.330> nice<00:02:27.510> comb-over

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
little bit hairy that nice comb-over

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.199 
little bit hairy that nice comb-over
that's<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:28.920> right<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.400> what<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.880> do

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
that's right that's right so what you do

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.940 
that's right that's right so what you do
about<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.660> Heidi<00:02:30.870> okay<00:02:31.080> we<00:02:31.410> hear<00:02:31.590> about<00:02:31.770> all

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
about it Heidi okay we hear about all

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.400 
about it Heidi okay we hear about all
sorts<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.430> drugs<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:33.450> take<00:02:33.780> so<00:02:34.290> the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
sorts of drugs that you can take so the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.780 
sorts of drugs that you can take so the
whole<00:02:34.620> thing<00:02:34.890> about<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.370> number<00:02:35.490> one

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
whole thing about it is number one

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.310 
whole thing about it is number one
getting<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.090> right<00:02:36.270> diagnosis<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.170> number

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
getting the right diagnosis and number

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.650 
getting the right diagnosis and number
two<00:02:37.440> understanding<00:02:37.950> what's<00:02:38.130> causing<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.580> so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
two understanding what's causing it so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.480 
two understanding what's causing it so
androgenic<00:02:39.660> alopecia<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.650> men<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.010> women<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
androgenic alopecia for men and women is

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.460 
androgenic alopecia for men and women is
the<00:02:41.640> same<00:02:41.820> thing<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.270> testosterone<00:02:43.170> being

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the same thing it's testosterone being

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.680 
the same thing it's testosterone being
converted<00:02:43.800> into<00:02:44.040> DHT<00:02:44.640> which<00:02:45.209> is

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
converted into DHT which is

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.470 
converted into DHT which is
dihydrotestosterone<00:02:46.410> it's<00:02:47.370> an<00:02:47.580> enzyme

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
dihydrotestosterone it's an enzyme

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.880 
dihydrotestosterone it's an enzyme
called<00:02:48.750> 5-alpha<00:02:48.900> reductase

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
called 5-alpha reductase

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.280 
called 5-alpha reductase
there<00:02:50.220> will<00:02:50.340> be<00:02:50.370> no<00:02:50.580> quiz<00:02:50.820> that<00:02:51.630> converts<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
there will be no quiz that converts the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.040 
there will be no quiz that converts the
testosterone<00:02:52.890> into<00:02:52.980> DHT<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:54.030> DHT<00:02:54.330> creates

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
testosterone into DHT the DHT creates

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.500 
testosterone into DHT the DHT creates
this<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.590> follicle<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.250> become<00:02:56.520> smaller<00:02:56.880> so

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this the follicle to become smaller so

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.949 
this the follicle to become smaller so
it<00:02:57.660> cannot<00:02:57.959> produce<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.560> healthy<00:02:59.130> hair<00:02:59.640> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it cannot produce a healthy hair and

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.840 
it cannot produce a healthy hair and
therefore<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.080> lose<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.739> hair<00:03:01.920> okay<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.610> if

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
therefore you lose the hair okay so if

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.699 
therefore you lose the hair okay so if
you<00:03:02.940> can<00:03:03.090> stop<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.600> conversion<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.320> is

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
you can stop the conversion so this is

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.160 
you can stop the conversion so this is
the<00:03:04.830> one<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.220> there's<00:03:05.400> no<00:03:05.970> cure<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.810> really

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the one that there's no cure but really

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.050 
the one that there's no cure but really
there's<00:03:07.410> propecia<00:03:07.890> which<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.310> take<00:03:08.520> orally

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
there's propecia which you take orally

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.960 
there's propecia which you take orally
which<00:03:09.690> does<00:03:10.050> block<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.040> conversion<00:03:11.459> of

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
which does block the conversion of

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.690 
which does block the conversion of
testosterone<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:13.050> DHT<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:14.100> allows<00:03:14.459> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
testosterone to DHT and it allows the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.780 
testosterone to DHT and it allows the
follicle<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.360> grow<00:03:15.660> bigger<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.830> stop<00:03:17.519> your

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
follicle to grow bigger that stop your

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.820 
follicle to grow bigger that stop your
hair<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.030> falling<00:03:18.570> yes<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:19.260> for<00:03:19.500> some

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
hair from falling yes and for some

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.860 
hair from falling yes and for some
people<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.340> actually<00:03:20.880> increases<00:03:21.360> hair<00:03:21.690> growth

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
people it actually increases hair growth

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.300 
people it actually increases hair growth
again<00:03:22.200> but<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.709> stay<00:03:22.890> on<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
again but you have to stay on it for the

it's a big one so you get more of this

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.200 
it's a big one so you get more of this
and<00:03:34.200> less<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.530> yeah

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210

number one there's also a Chinese herb
called<00:03:42.730> my<00:03:43.420> omen<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.950> stops<00:03:44.950> that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
called my omen that stops that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.350 
called my omen that stops that
conversion<00:03:45.550> as<00:03:45.640> well<00:03:45.670> in<00:03:45.880> there's<00:03:46.030> less<00:03:46.180> side

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
conversion as well in there's less side

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.270 
conversion as well in there's less side
effects<00:03:46.690> anyway<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.830> need<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.130> right

diagnosis<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.030> second<00:03:49.420> diagnosis<00:03:50.020> that's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
diagnosis the second diagnosis that's

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.410 
diagnosis the second diagnosis that's
the<00:03:50.650> most<00:03:50.920> common<00:03:51.550> form<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.880> hair<00:03:51.940> loss<00:03:52.090> but

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
the most common form of hair loss but

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.610 
the most common form of hair loss but
that<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.170> let<00:03:53.410> most<00:03:54.010> misdiagnosed<00:03:54.790> is<00:03:55.030> called

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
that but let most misdiagnosed is called

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.560 
that but let most misdiagnosed is called
telegenic<00:03:56.910> effluvium<00:03:57.910> which<00:03:58.120> you<00:03:58.270> don't<00:03:58.450> have

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
telegenic effluvium which you don't have

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.150 
telegenic effluvium which you don't have
to<00:03:58.660> remember<00:03:58.810> but<00:03:59.080> basically<00:03:59.440> any<00:03:59.680> major

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
to remember but basically any major

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.870 
to remember but basically any major
stressor<00:04:00.820> will<00:04:01.630> create<00:04:02.320> hair<00:04:03.310> loss<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.730> so

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
stressor will create hair loss and so

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.980 
stressor will create hair loss and so
true<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:04.270> your<00:04:04.360> hair<00:04:04.480> can<00:04:04.630> fall<00:04:04.780> out<00:04:04.810> when

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
true that your hair can fall out when

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.610 
true that your hair can fall out when
you're<00:04:05.080> stressed<00:04:05.260> out

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
you're stressed out

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.170 
you're stressed out
absolutely<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.520> has<00:04:06.700> happened<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.120> me

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
absolutely so that has happened to me

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.390 
absolutely so that has happened to me
before<00:04:07.240> so<00:04:07.660> things<00:04:08.020> like<00:04:08.230> trauma<00:04:08.620> yeah<00:04:09.100> no

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
before so things like trauma yeah no

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.310 
before so things like trauma yeah no
really<00:04:09.580> it's<00:04:09.850> it's<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.330> most<00:04:10.570> removing<00:04:11.140> cause

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
really it's it's the most removing cause

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.080 
really it's it's the most removing cause
and<00:04:11.560> it's<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:12.130> not<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.550> I'm<00:04:12.700> stressed<00:04:13.000> out

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
and it's it's not just I'm stressed out

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.700 
and it's it's not just I'm stressed out
because<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.330> have<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> deadline<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:14.050> can<00:04:14.320> be<00:04:14.560> it

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
because I have a deadline that can be it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.160 
because I have a deadline that can be it
but<00:04:14.980> any<00:04:15.220> major<00:04:15.520> stressors<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:16.239> it's<00:04:16.390> hormonal

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
but any major stressors so it's hormonal

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.100 
but any major stressors so it's hormonal
imbalance<00:04:17.770> like<00:04:17.980> lack<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.460> DHEA<00:04:19.090> or<00:04:19.480> something

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
imbalance like lack of DHEA or something

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.010 
imbalance like lack of DHEA or something

going through menopause or
hypothyroidism

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
hypothyroidism

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.010 
hypothyroidism
it's<00:04:23.790> childbirth<00:04:24.790> is<00:04:24.970> a<00:04:25.000> major<00:04:25.270> trauma<00:04:25.630> and

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
it's childbirth is a major trauma and

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.470 
it's childbirth is a major trauma and
major<00:04:26.290> infection<00:04:27.150> malnutrition<00:04:28.150> is<00:04:28.240> another

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
major infection malnutrition is another

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.960 
major infection malnutrition is another
one<00:04:28.660> so<00:04:28.900> iron<00:04:29.410> deficiency<00:04:30.040> and<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.640> looks<00:04:30.820> a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
one so iron deficiency and it looks a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.790 
one so iron deficiency and it looks a
lot<00:04:31.270> like<00:04:31.450> female<00:04:31.870> pattern<00:04:32.050> baldness<00:04:32.230> because

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
lot like female pattern baldness because

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800 
lot like female pattern baldness because
you<00:04:32.920> lose<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.490> hair<00:04:33.700> uniformly<00:04:34.420> around<00:04:34.720> the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
you lose the hair uniformly around the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.380 
you lose the hair uniformly around the
head<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:36.190> what<00:04:36.340> happens<00:04:36.640> is<00:04:36.790> your<00:04:36.940> hair<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.240> in

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390

there's<00:04:37.930> three<00:04:38.110> different<00:04:38.440> stages<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:39.010> the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
there's three different stages of the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.520 
there's three different stages of the
hair<00:04:39.370> growth<00:04:39.820> cycle<00:04:40.060> there<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.170> growing

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
hair growth cycle there is the growing

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.290 
hair growth cycle there is the growing
phase<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:42.070> resting<00:04:42.490> phase<00:04:42.670> and<00:04:42.940> the<00:04:43.030> shedding

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
phase the resting phase and the shedding

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.050 
phase the resting phase and the shedding
phase<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:43.870> at<00:04:44.380> any<00:04:44.620> point<00:04:44.710> in<00:04:45.040> time<00:04:45.070> 90%<00:04:46.000> of

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
phase and at any point in time 90% of

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.940 
phase and at any point in time 90% of
your<00:04:46.210> hair<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.690> either<00:04:46.900> resting<00:04:47.440> or<00:04:47.590> growing

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
your hair is either resting or growing

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.030 
your hair is either resting or growing
under<00:04:48.940> extreme<00:04:49.330> stress<00:04:49.690> for<00:04:50.320> whatever<00:04:50.500> reason

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
under extreme stress for whatever reason

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.220 
under extreme stress for whatever reason
and<00:04:51.160> we<00:04:51.430> don't<00:04:51.610> really<00:04:51.820> know<00:04:52.000> why<00:04:52.210> things<00:04:52.960> get

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
and we don't really know why things get

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.590 
and we don't really know why things get
shunted<00:04:53.680> into<00:04:53.770> a<00:04:53.950> high<00:04:54.340> shedding<00:04:54.940> phase<00:04:55.270> and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
shunted into a high shedding phase and

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.390 
shunted into a high shedding phase and
it<00:04:55.720> usually<00:04:55.900> happens<00:04:56.200> within<00:04:56.530> six<00:04:56.920> weeks<00:04:57.160> to

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
it usually happens within six weeks to

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.390 
it usually happens within six weeks to
three<00:04:57.730> months<00:04:57.970> after<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:58.540> event<00:04:58.810> hmm<00:04:59.620> so<00:04:59.860> what

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
three months after the event hmm so what

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.760 
three months after the event hmm so what
can<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.580> do<00:05:00.760> about<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.410> create<00:05:02.410> balance

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
can you do about it like create balance

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.440 
can you do about it like create balance
so<00:05:02.920> this<00:05:03.040> is<00:05:03.220> where<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.760> work<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.180> lot<00:05:04.420> with

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
so this is where we work a lot with

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.780 
so this is where we work a lot with
patients<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.140> treat<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:06.220> imbalance<00:05:06.640> so

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
patients to treat the imbalance so
