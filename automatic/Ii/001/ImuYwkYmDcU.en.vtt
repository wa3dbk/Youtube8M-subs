00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.189
 new black ops two tips and tricks 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.660
 video but in advance so it's about the with 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.530
 Express I will now also cards 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.199
 Guides are moderately over 90 minutes 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.500
 already it will be enough for 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.449
 the map but for now only times I make 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.600
 now at the road to diamond 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.599
 I will weapon all special weapons 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.220
 unless I have a good one without it 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 I will the whole weapon so first 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 play high and then the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.620
 challenges take up so the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.239
 challenge I will then from 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:47.340
 I will then make video for everyone 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 Now comes train first ok and there will be 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.850
 I also really good round us 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.350
 the garbage is probably then times 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.770
 the case be that my good round 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.770
 and with a crossbow I can only 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.930
 recommend again tip triple bolt 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.940
 It is also very good 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.670
 and before I get the tip video here 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.310
 I would like to briefly show that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.170
 weapons if there are still bullets in the magazine 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.850
 As you can see how the after loading then 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.320
 he still pulls the thing back and if 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.330
 also ball the magazine with that I have 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.140
 of course no more 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.689
 ok if still balls magazin are like that and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.320
 if there are no more magazines 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:27.650
 he had yet to unlock the once 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.869
 So, or at least retreat like that 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.299
 and you 're charging faster, though 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.430
 balls are in the magazine and it lasts 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.460
 longer if there is no ball magazine 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.320
 so if you just short the wheel 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 has yet to google magazine goes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.340
 more quickly 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.470
 so now we come here for now 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.930
 Express there are several ways first 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.509
 here to get on the train first 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.920
 Here you can do sports directly 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.159
 you're probably faster up there 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.009
 as if you go outside , then there is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:03.060
 a way here so yes there you have to then 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.750
 Sprint and press the jump button 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.659
 hold 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.060
 otherwise do not go the other one falls so 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.940
 including if you try so too 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.720
 you have to jump the jumping button 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.420
 keep pressed down 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.360
 So go now it was missing again and 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.390
 also sprint test about that 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.920
 then you see how that works and you have to 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.680
 Definitely the jumping cluster and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.780
 sprint has to hold there otherwise it will fall 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.210
 So you can not get down here 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.330
 over it or so take however often on xbox 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.850
 and ps3 keeps what is now on xbox I know 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.590
 I do not have to see what was 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.760
 that again club assist the car 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.230
 is it so spreng on xbox and on ps3 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.780
 and pc 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.250
 I am a pc toilet then it works 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.440
 here a way and that if you 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.660
 sprints dangerously even the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.120
 whole then you can stand on it 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.709
 and then sprint and jump 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.020
 hold down or just jump 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.630
 Keep pressed forward and so on 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.850
 high jump and then runs 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.090
 here so high so that in the way the 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.430
 we never know yet, yes man 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.959
 has to run and jump up and 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.310
 then come here also run very well 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 then you can stop in here 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.430
 for example, hop and then you have 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.720
 right here in the advantage 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.580
 does not need to go there over the ladder too 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.530
 go and so it is of course 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.860
 Also on the train you can over 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.070
 bounce and now there is still the way 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.730
 which probably will not know any 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.820
 way up here and then do not run or 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.870
 otherwise it will happen if you only 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.310
 make a step then you jump 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.170
 directly over pure or even if you so 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.739
 protrudes and if that is then you are 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.860
 right in it 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.320
 you have to run on hold 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.730
 the button or jump button and then 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.989
 hold down here again and 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.690
 then if you are already in the air 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.560
 a little bit very forward and 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.920
 then of course she gives the same 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.709
 put back and yes here too 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.390
 everything is mirrored game 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.190
 everything is mirrored exactly the same 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.950
 so exactly the same base that's all 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.150
 and yes, maybe what I know 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.870
 not that it will be useful someday 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.370
 you can you can you can here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.030
 For example, look at the entrance and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.580
 the entrance 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 but it's also very visible so you 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.580
 is seen by a few then can 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.210
 here, too , that maybe 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.070
 meaningful 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.770
 You will not be seen so easily here 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.840
 can get some kills here and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.100
 I think you can not do it on it 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.050
 can also jump back 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.440
 as you can I do not think it km 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.240
 test and you can not do that 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.180
 does not work 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.440
 then there is not okay if you are 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.090
 maybe a damaging last one 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.550
 Survivor it can be and you know 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.550
 that he is against you can go through here 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.170
 Customer through the trash can at the pc it is 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.440
 of course it can be easier on the pc 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:05:01.260
 simply lean that works if only s.pc 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:03.540
 read so favorite object otherwise so much 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.490
 there is not one on express either 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.810
 can stop between each garbage ton so 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:12.060
 by looking through the small corners like that 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:18.330
 and that's usually it's very 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.770
 helpful inso under disturbing else there 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.120
 It does not really have that much to say 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.110
 So the jumps and spot then so 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.290
 the jumps are actually 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:30.420
 obviously here you can clean it 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.740
 It can be very clear here how you want it 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.550
 otherwise come in as a rule three 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:40.770
 the ladder is still there 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:42.480
 here and then I watch there 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.400
 a way to avoid the train me 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.270
 I do not think so, just try it 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.210
 from 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.040
 no, that will not work and you can 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.790
 you can not make a dive or anything 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.790
 we avoid the train 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.520
 I think there is no way and there 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.520
 otherwise that was it already here 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.950
 the middle there's nothing that here 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:09.690
 stop here and then stop the paths for him 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:12.450
 but otherwise it works 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.940
 nothing not so much to say to the map 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.350
 but it is already 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.510
 just now I had a few 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.640
 situations here to express is already 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.560
 important to know that you are there and also 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.900
 in the middle the whole again short 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:30.990
 show that here and in the middle 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:33.990
 can be high and then that the field 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.790
 very helpful it was like this before me 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.170
 her from behind a shot here 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.310
 One would have sat in there too 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.770
 quickly not shirred I'm just like that 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.420
 and then quickly up and then was 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.370
 asked by googles am down here 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.660
 and then came out the door here and 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:52.740
 so I killed like that 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:57.000
 So that can fight easy go free 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:59.930
 you do not have to believe in eco 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.570
 not so helpful 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.460
 yes, that was easy for women here 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.430
 but missing if you in the household 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.370
 that's alright 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:19.320
 and all this too much on it 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:22.280
 express railway just like that and then up 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.280
 to the next video
