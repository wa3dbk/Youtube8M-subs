00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
so about like five to ten minutes at

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.050 
so about like five to ten minutes at
that<00:01:35.870> stage<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:36.560> can<00:01:36.740> add<00:01:36.890> in<00:01:37.040> three<00:01:37.700> around

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
that stage you can add in three around

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.120 
that stage you can add in three around
three<00:01:38.330> cups<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.810> hot<00:01:38.960> water<00:01:39.140> that's<00:01:39.500> 700

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
three cups of hot water that's 700

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.690 
three cups of hot water that's 700
milliliters<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.360> add<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.410> two<00:01:42.650> stock<00:01:43.340> cubes

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
milliliters and add in two stock cubes

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.969 
milliliters and add in two stock cubes
I'm<00:01:43.850> using<00:01:44.120> two<00:01:44.479> but<00:01:44.750> again<00:01:45.260> it<00:01:45.410> depends<00:01:45.770> on

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
I'm using two but again it depends on

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.530 
I'm using two but again it depends on
like<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.820> quality<00:01:47.030> of<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:47.450> stock<00:01:47.780> use<00:01:48.050> and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
like the quality of your stock use and

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.300 
like the quality of your stock use and
just<00:01:50.540> break<00:01:50.750> those<00:01:50.960> apart<00:01:50.990> with<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.890> wooden

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
just break those apart with your wooden

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.460 
just break those apart with your wooden
spoon<00:01:52.340> stir<00:01:53.000> them<00:01:53.210> around<00:01:53.690> a<00:01:53.869> bit<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.410> then

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
spoon stir them around a bit and then

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.280 
spoon stir them around a bit and then
just<00:01:55.160> cover<00:01:55.729> it<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.060> pen<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.660> simmer<00:01:57.050> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
just cover it the pen and simmer the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
processor remember the stew has to be

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.130 
processor remember the stew has to be
cold<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.440> just<00:02:13.220> until<00:02:13.550> nice<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.970> smooth<00:02:14.360> it's

cold and just until nice and smooth it's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.520 
cold and just until nice and smooth it's
so<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:16.570> at<00:02:17.570> this<00:02:17.720> stage<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.050> can<00:02:18.170> add<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.410> your

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
so and at this stage you can add in your

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.960 
so and at this stage you can add in your
seasoning<00:02:19.100> don't<00:02:19.489> add<00:02:19.610> too<00:02:19.790> much<00:02:19.910> salt

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
seasoning don't add too much salt

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.270 
seasoning don't add too much salt

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
because the stock cubes are fairly salty

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.270 
because the stock cubes are fairly salty
um<00:02:22.810> what<00:02:23.810> I'm<00:02:23.930> doing<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.230> I'm<00:02:24.380> adding<00:02:24.680> Tabasco

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
pepper because you can't really have

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.710 
pepper because you can't really have
soup<00:02:31.880> without<00:02:32.060> pepper
