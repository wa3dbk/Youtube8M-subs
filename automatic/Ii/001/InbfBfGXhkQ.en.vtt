since I got sick with crohn's disease i

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.960 
since I got sick with crohn's disease i
started<00:00:24.750> reading<00:00:24.900> books<00:00:25.019> i<00:00:25.380> started<00:00:25.740> getting

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
started reading books i started getting

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.140 
started reading books i started getting
really<00:00:26.970> into<00:00:27.570> life<00:00:28.560> design<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.400> behavior

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
really into life design and behavior

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
really into life design and behavior
change<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.650> change<00:00:31.890> our<00:00:32.099> habits

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
change and how do we change our habits

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.920 
change and how do we change our habits
how<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.880> change<00:00:33.090> our<00:00:33.300> behavior<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
how do we change our behavior and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.920 
how do we change our behavior and
through<00:00:34.620> my<00:00:34.770> studies<00:00:35.190> i<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.969> found<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.540> word

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
through my studies i have found one word

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.340 
through my studies i have found one word
and<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.530> concept<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.910> completely

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
and one concept that just completely

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
and one concept that just completely
made<00:00:40.350> everything<00:00:40.860> clear<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:42.030> me<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
made everything clear to me and that is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.150 
made everything clear to me and that is
myelination<00:00:45.200> it's<00:00:46.200> such<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> fun<00:00:46.739> word<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:46.980> say

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
myelination it's such a fun word to say

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.100 
myelination it's such a fun word to say
try<00:00:48.140> myelination<00:00:49.280> anyways<00:00:50.280> myelination

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
try myelination anyways myelination

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.180 
try myelination anyways myelination
there's<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.379> term<00:00:53.160> inside<00:00:53.899> neuroscience<00:00:54.899> about

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
there's a term inside neuroscience about

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.900 
there's a term inside neuroscience about
the<00:00:56.190> myelin<00:00:56.640> sheath<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:58.910> don't

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the myelin sheath and it is a I don't

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.270 
the myelin sheath and it is a I don't
know<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> exact<00:01:00.539> technical<00:01:01.170> term<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:02.100> but

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
know the exact technical term for it but

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.840 
know the exact technical term for it but
it's<00:01:03.000> basically<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.840> sheath<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.769> surrounds<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it's basically a sheath that surrounds a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.830 
it's basically a sheath that surrounds a
neuron<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.369> helps<00:01:08.369> speed<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.360> messages

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
neuron that helps speed up the messages

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.730 
neuron that helps speed up the messages
that<00:01:10.049> fire<00:01:10.729> between<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.909> neurons<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.740> this

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that fire between the neurons and this

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.700 
that fire between the neurons and this
myelin<00:01:14.340> forms<00:01:16.490> it<00:01:17.490> forms<00:01:18.090> when<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.020> perform<00:01:19.409> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
myelin forms it forms when we perform a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.760 
myelin forms it forms when we perform a
task<00:01:19.950> or<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> habit<00:01:20.729> repeatedly<00:01:21.330> over<00:01:21.450> time<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
task or a habit repeatedly over time the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.920 
task or a habit repeatedly over time the
habit<00:01:23.460> becomes<00:01:23.729> myelinated<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
habit becomes myelinated more of that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.510 
habit becomes myelinated more of that
sheath<00:01:25.259> forms<00:01:25.650> around<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> neurons<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
sheath forms around the neurons and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
sheath forms around the neurons and
whenever<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.119> fires<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.930> speeds<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
whenever it fires it just speeds up and

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.340 
whenever it fires it just speeds up and
speeds<00:01:29.130> up<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.850> why<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.780> easy<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.110> us

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
speeds up that's why it's so easy for us

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.080 
speeds up that's why it's so easy for us
to<00:01:31.380> brush<00:01:31.770> our<00:01:31.979> teeth<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.880> we<00:01:33.000> don't

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
to brush our teeth you know we don't

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
to brush our teeth you know we don't
have<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.500> it

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
have to think about it we just do it

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.289 
have to think about it we just do it
it's<00:01:34.740> myelinated<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.700> completely

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it's myelinated it's completely

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
it's myelinated it's completely
myelinated<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:39.390> example<00:01:39.869> when<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> first

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
myelinated but for example when I first

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.950 
myelinated but for example when I first

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
started this website optimistic wellness
in<00:01:43.079> 2010<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> did<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.430> have<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> habit<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
in 2010 I did not have a habit of

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.260 
in 2010 I did not have a habit of
posting<00:01:45.780> blogs<00:01:46.259> every<00:01:46.860> week<00:01:47.070> once<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.700> week<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
posting blogs every week once a week it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
posting blogs every week once a week it
was<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.810> myelinated<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:50.189> go<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.880> month

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
was not myelinated I could go one month

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
was not myelinated I could go one month
one<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.689> half<00:01:51.720> months<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.770> being<00:01:53.040> lazy

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
one and a half months just being lazy

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969 
one and a half months just being lazy
and<00:01:53.549> not<00:01:53.640> recording<00:01:54.390> blog<00:01:54.600> post<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.710> not

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
and not recording blog post it was not

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.289 
and not recording blog post it was not
myelinated<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:59.210> understanding<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
myelinated so this understanding of

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.080 
myelinated so this understanding of
myelination<00:02:00.780> has<00:02:01.140> saved<00:02:01.439> me<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.700> many<00:02:02.939> times

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
myelination has saved me so many times

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.590 
myelination has saved me so many times
in<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:03.630> life<00:02:03.659> when<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.939> feeling<00:02:05.939> resistance

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
in my life when I'm feeling resistance

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.859 
in my life when I'm feeling resistance
to<00:02:06.750> doing<00:02:07.079> something<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.729> know<00:02:09.179> uh-huh

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
to doing something I just I know uh-huh

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.990 
to doing something I just I know uh-huh
that's<00:02:10.830> not<00:02:11.160> Milan

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
that's not Milan

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.410 
that's not Milan
I<00:02:12.090> gotta<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.040> gotta<00:02:14.220> do<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.490> every

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
I gotta do it and I gotta do it every

pretty<00:04:34.050> much<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.910> myelination<00:04:36.419> will<00:04:36.720> take

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
pretty much it the myelination will take

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.690 
pretty much it the myelination will take
care<00:04:37.110> of<00:04:37.169> everything<00:04:37.320> for<00:04:37.889> you<00:04:38.010> as<00:04:38.130> long<00:04:38.669> as

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
care of everything for you as long as

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.770 
care of everything for you as long as
you<00:04:38.940> realize<00:04:39.120> that<00:04:39.419> you're<00:04:39.540> going<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.690> be

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
you realize that you're going to be

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.800 
you realize that you're going to be
facing<00:04:40.020> massive<00:04:40.830> resistance<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:42.240> first<00:04:42.480> ten

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
facing massive resistance the first ten

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.440 
facing massive resistance the first ten
days<00:04:42.840> even<00:04:43.710> month<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:44.550> habit<00:04:44.790> but<00:04:45.030> after

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
days even month of that habit but after

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.530 
days even month of that habit but after
a<00:04:45.480> month<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:46.290> should<00:04:46.650> become<00:04:47.250> easier<00:04:47.610> and<00:04:47.669> I

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
a month it should become easier and I

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.450 
a month it should become easier and I
can<00:04:48.990> leave<00:04:49.139> you<00:04:49.169> with<00:04:49.410> one<00:04:49.440> word<00:04:50.040> of<00:04:50.190> advice<00:04:50.250> is

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
this never miss a day if you miss one

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.950 
this never miss a day if you miss one
day<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:56.310> next<00:04:56.550> day<00:04:56.729> after<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.270> there<00:04:57.840> will

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
day the next day after that there will

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.100 
day the next day after that there will
be<00:04:58.139> so<00:04:58.650> much<00:04:59.010> resistance<00:04:59.610> to<00:05:00.300> doing<00:05:00.600> that<00:05:00.720> that

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
be so much resistance to doing that that

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.060 
be so much resistance to doing that that
is<00:05:01.380> just<00:05:01.620> the<00:05:01.770> myelin<00:05:02.310> acting<00:05:02.820> up<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:04.260> being

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
is just the myelin acting up so being

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.670 
is just the myelin acting up so being
short<00:05:05.400> myelination<00:05:06.120> will<00:05:06.600> and<00:05:06.870> can<00:05:07.200> change

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
short myelination will and can change

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.150 
short myelination will and can change
your<00:05:07.889> life<00:05:08.130> thank<00:05:09.120> you<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.450> much<00:05:09.660> for<00:05:09.870> watching
