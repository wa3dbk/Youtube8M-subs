now you may be asking why this one and
why<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.100> some<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.430> other<00:01:14.460> popular<00:01:15.060> risk

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
why not some of the other popular risk

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
why not some of the other popular risk
pads<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.630> there<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.409> example<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.070> gel

wrist pads there are memory foam wrist
pads<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> problem<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.060> those<00:01:21.240> wrist

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
pads but the problem with those wrist

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359
