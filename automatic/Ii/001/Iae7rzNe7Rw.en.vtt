this<00:02:06.280> you<00:02:06.640> know<00:02:06.729> we<00:02:06.850> read<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.150> defense<00:02:07.299> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
this you know we read the defense and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.699 
this you know we read the defense and
then<00:02:07.720> we<00:02:07.780> used<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.019> tight<00:02:08.200> end<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.530> side

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
then we used to tight end to the side

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.399 
then we used to tight end to the side
where<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.009> are<00:02:09.099> on<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> ball<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:11.200> we're<00:02:11.319> gonna

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:11.409 
where we are on the ball so we're gonna

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
focus on and that play is the following

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.550 
focus on and that play is the following
it<00:02:37.290> is<00:02:37.560> from<00:02:37.890> Titan<00:02:38.340> flip<00:02:38.959> but<00:02:39.959> what<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.140> focus

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
it is from Titan flip but what a focus

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.300 
it is from Titan flip but what a focus
that<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.950> call<00:02:41.340> come<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.510> be<00:02:43.310> right

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
that we call come out in would be right

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.500 
that we call come out in would be right
here<00:02:44.519> which<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.780> bronco<00:02:46.260> halfback<00:02:46.739> zone

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
here which is the bronco halfback zone

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.370 
here which is the bronco halfback zone
its<00:02:48.510> overall<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:49.380> effective<00:02:49.590> rent<00:02:49.940> and

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
its overall it's very effective rent and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.240 
its overall it's very effective rent and
what<00:02:52.380> i<00:02:52.410> want<00:02:52.560> you<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> notice<00:02:52.830> that's

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
what i want you to notice that's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.410 
what i want you to notice that's
different<00:02:53.310> about<00:02:53.580> this<00:02:53.730> formation<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.269> its

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
different about this formation is its

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.240 
different about this formation is its
titans<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> line<00:02:55.080> of<00:02:55.170> scrimmage<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:56.160> what

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
titans on the line of scrimmage so what

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.860 
titans on the line of scrimmage so what
that<00:02:56.280> means<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:56.940> motion<00:02:57.390> him<00:02:57.569> back

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
that means is you can motion him back

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.559 
that means is you can motion him back
and<00:02:58.080> forth<00:02:58.519> very<00:02:59.519> easily<00:02:59.790> it's<00:03:00.120> very<00:03:00.150> quick

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
and forth very easily it's very quick

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.240 
and forth very easily it's very quick
very<00:03:00.989> easy<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.500> read<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.739> defense<00:03:01.920> you

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
very easy so you read the defense you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.890 
very easy so you read the defense you
read<00:03:02.430> rather<00:03:02.610> weak<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.239> then<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.569> go<00:03:03.720> from

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
read rather weak and then you go from

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.309 
read rather weak and then you go from
there<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.790> about<00:03:06.720> facing<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.110> deep

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
there you know about facing this deep

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.620 
there you know about facing this deep
end<00:03:07.470> right<00:03:07.590> here<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:07.830> might<00:03:08.100> just<00:03:08.310> might<00:03:09.060> run<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
end right here I might just might run a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.210 
end right here I might just might run a
dive<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.140> might<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.530> don't<00:03:10.920> want<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.100> run<00:03:11.190> a

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
dive I might I don't want to run a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.680 
dive I might I don't want to run a
dynast<00:03:11.580> efficient<00:03:11.880> because<00:03:11.970> if<00:03:12.269> you<00:03:12.360> see<00:03:12.569> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
dynast efficient because if you see the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.720 
dynast efficient because if you see the
nose<00:03:13.170> tackle<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.769> directly<00:03:14.040> over<00:03:14.250> my<00:03:14.280> Center

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
nose tackle is directly over my Center

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520 
nose tackle is directly over my Center
so<00:03:14.910> let's<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:15.720> stick<00:03:15.900> with<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.140> off<00:03:16.230> tackle

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
so let's just stick with the off tackle

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.530 
so let's just stick with the off tackle
here<00:03:16.860> trying<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.160> get<00:03:17.250> out<00:03:17.370> wide<00:03:17.579> Willis

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
here trying to get out wide Willis

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.789 
here trying to get out wide Willis
McGahee<00:03:18.690> pick<00:03:19.109> it<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:19.260> your<00:03:19.380> arch<00:03:19.470> probably

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
McGahee pick it off your arch probably

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.890 
McGahee pick it off your arch probably
should<00:03:19.890> have<00:03:19.950> no<00:03:20.130> Sean<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.519> there<00:03:20.700> but<00:03:20.910> that's

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
should have no Sean in there but that's

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.590 
should have no Sean in there but that's
okay<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.519> I'll<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:23.670> random<00:03:24.000> defense<00:03:24.299> or<00:03:24.450> so

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
okay and I'll do random defense or so

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.050 
okay and I'll do random defense or so
it's<00:03:24.750> let<00:03:25.130> different<00:03:26.130> hole<00:03:26.250> every<00:03:26.489> time<00:03:26.700> so

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it's let different hole every time so

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.630

halfback zone random play here's again I
see<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.690> safeties<00:03:40.109> creep<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.560> up<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.829> box

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040

over<00:03:41.280> there<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.670> i<00:03:41.880> probably<00:03:42.420> don't<00:03:42.870> want<00:03:43.170> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
over there so i probably don't want to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.960 
over there so i probably don't want to
run<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.650> way<00:03:43.829> so<00:03:44.130> i'm<00:03:44.250> gonna<00:03:44.340> flip<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.790> play

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
run that way so i'm gonna flip the play

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.300 
run that way so i'm gonna flip the play
motion<00:03:45.480> my<00:03:45.780> tight<00:03:46.019> end<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.380> way<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.799> now<00:03:47.190> i'm

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
motion my tight end that way and now i'm

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.130 
motion my tight end that way and now i'm
running<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.090> opposite<00:03:48.420> side<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:48.840> i<00:03:48.930> need

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
running to the opposite side and i need

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.500 
running to the opposite side and i need
to<00:03:49.200> get<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.350> block<00:03:49.590> there<00:03:49.859> or<00:03:50.040> or<00:03:50.579> my<00:03:51.000> my<00:03:51.329> move

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
to get a block there or or my my move

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.979 
to get a block there or or my my move
needs<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:51.870> be<00:03:51.989> cut<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.260> inside<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.870> thought<00:03:54.870> my

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
needs to be cut up inside I thought my

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.110 
needs to be cut up inside I thought my
fullback<00:03:55.290> might<00:03:55.620> get<00:03:55.859> out<00:03:55.980> there<00:03:56.250> but<00:03:56.880> now<00:03:57.060> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
fullback might get out there but now the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.330 
fullback might get out there but now the
tight<00:03:57.540> end<00:03:57.720> was<00:03:58.109> blowing<00:03:58.709> off<00:03:58.859> the<00:03:58.980> block<00:03:59.160> but

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
tight end was blowing off the block but

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.770 
tight end was blowing off the block but
at<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.549> end<00:03:59.579> so<00:03:59.970> now<00:04:00.090> my<00:04:00.269> fullback<00:04:00.540> had<00:04:00.690> to

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
at the end so now my fullback had to

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.080 
at the end so now my fullback had to
pick<00:04:00.930> him<00:04:01.109> up<00:04:01.170> which<00:04:01.350> freed<00:04:01.890> him<00:04:02.069> up<00:04:02.250> so<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:03.030> was

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
pick him up which freed him up so it was

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.789 
pick him up which freed him up so it was
a<00:04:03.180> blown<00:04:03.450> block<00:04:03.690> for<00:04:03.900> my<00:04:03.989> tight<00:04:04.170> end<00:04:04.380> which

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
a blown block for my tight end which

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.680 
a blown block for my tight end which
again<00:04:05.250> I<00:04:05.489> probably<00:04:06.120> could<00:04:06.329> have<00:04:06.359> cut<00:04:06.569> up

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
again I probably could have cut up

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.680 
again I probably could have cut up
inside<00:04:07.019> there<00:04:07.319> though<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.799> see<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.100> hole

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
inside there though if you see that hole

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.910 
inside there though if you see that hole
this<00:04:09.690> time<00:04:09.930> I'm<00:04:10.079> going<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.260> I'm<00:04:10.350> going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.799> keep

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
get out wide gets the next level boom

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.000 
get out wide gets the next level boom
boom<00:04:55.860> bremer<00:04:57.140> so<00:04:58.140> you<00:04:58.260> could<00:04:58.410> work<00:04:58.560> quick<00:04:58.800> pass

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
boom bremer so you could work quick pass

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.650 
boom bremer so you could work quick pass
out<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.430> it<00:04:59.490> as<00:04:59.610> well<00:04:59.760> I<00:04:59.820> mean<00:05:00.150> there's<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.480> lot

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
out of it as well I mean there's a lot

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.750 
out of it as well I mean there's a lot
of<00:05:00.690> different<00:05:00.750> things<00:05:01.310> what's<00:05:02.310> nice<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.520> the

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
of different things what's nice is the

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
of different things what's nice is the
Titans<00:05:03.060> off<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.240> line<00:05:03.330> of<00:05:03.360> scrimmage<00:05:03.450> is

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
Titans off the line of scrimmage is

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.540 
Titans off the line of scrimmage is
actually<00:05:04.050> bang<00:05:04.380> that's<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.680> nice<00:05:04.800> very<00:05:05.310> nice

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
actually bang that's a nice very nice

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.960 
actually bang that's a nice very nice
pass<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:07.440> overall<00:05:07.710> there's<00:05:08.610> a<00:05:08.640> lot<00:05:08.760> of<00:05:08.790> things

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
pass but overall there's a lot of things

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.890 
pass but overall there's a lot of things
you<00:05:09.060> could<00:05:09.210> probably<00:05:09.390> do<00:05:09.600> from<00:05:09.810> this

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
you could probably do from this

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.000 
you could probably do from this
formation<00:05:10.140> because<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.560> tightened<00:05:10.830> up<00:05:10.890> the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
formation because that tightened up the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.670 
formation because that tightened up the
line<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.160> scrimmage<00:05:11.900> easily<00:05:12.900> it's<00:05:13.440> a<00:05:13.500> quick

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
line of scrimmage easily it's a quick

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.050 
line of scrimmage easily it's a quick
motion<00:05:14.070> that's<00:05:14.220> what<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.430> like<00:05:14.550> about<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.850> so

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
motion that's what I like about it so

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.130 
motion that's what I like about it so
the<00:05:15.090> first<00:05:15.330> thing<00:05:15.420> I<00:05:15.540> think<00:05:15.750> about<00:05:15.930> it<00:05:16.050> would

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
the first thing I think about it would

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.920 
the first thing I think about it would
be<00:05:16.230> this<00:05:16.380> right<00:05:16.590> here<00:05:16.940> put<00:05:17.940> him<00:05:18.030> on<00:05:18.090> a<00:05:18.120> drag<00:05:18.480> and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
be this right here put him on a drag and

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.960 
be this right here put him on a drag and
then<00:05:19.770> he's<00:05:19.920> on<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.070> quick<00:05:20.280> flat<00:05:20.520> route<00:05:20.730> which

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
then he's on a quick flat route which

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.630 
then he's on a quick flat route which
that<00:05:21.780> could<00:05:21.930> be<00:05:21.990> tough<00:05:22.170> to<00:05:22.320> defend<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:22.890> there's

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
that could be tough to defend so there's

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.370 
that could be tough to defend so there's
I<00:05:23.760> mean<00:05:23.790> these<00:05:24.360> are<00:05:24.540> these<00:05:24.840> are<00:05:24.900> things<00:05:25.230> i'm

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
you get caught up in at the end but you

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.090 
you get caught up in at the end but you
know<00:05:34.320> there's<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.500> lot<00:05:34.530> of<00:05:34.620> things<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.920> could

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
know there's a lot of things I could

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.130 
know there's a lot of things I could
like<00:05:35.280> to<00:05:35.580> implement<00:05:35.970> with<00:05:36.330> using<00:05:36.840> this<00:05:36.930> so

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
like to implement with using this so

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.570 
like to implement with using this so
here's<00:05:37.410> another<00:05:37.560> motion<00:05:37.830> maybe<00:05:38.220> go<00:05:38.370> off

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
here's another motion maybe go off

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.120 
here's another motion maybe go off
tackle<00:05:38.880> again<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.270> time<00:05:39.510> bang<00:05:40.200> bang<00:05:40.410> so

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
tackle again this time bang bang so

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.920 
tackle again this time bang bang so
there's<00:05:41.280> a<00:05:41.310> lot<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:41.460> can<00:05:41.610> do<00:05:41.790> I<00:05:42.000> would<00:05:42.810> use

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
there's a lot you can do I would use

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.570 
there's a lot you can do I would use
this<00:05:43.020> is<00:05:43.140> my<00:05:43.260> pal<00:05:43.410> run<00:05:43.680> mainly<00:05:44.010> because<00:05:44.160> you

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
this is my pal run mainly because you

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.400 
this is my pal run mainly because you
know<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.180> has<00:05:45.330> a<00:05:45.360> high<00:05:45.600> tide<00:05:45.840> but<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.290> reason

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
know that has a high tide but the reason

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.760 
know that has a high tide but the reason
I<00:05:46.530> would<00:05:46.590> probably<00:05:46.740> use<00:05:46.920> this<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.370> because<00:05:47.700> of

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
I would probably use this is because of

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.850 
I would probably use this is because of
its<00:05:49.770> ability<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:52.520> run<00:05:53.630> with<00:05:54.630> only<00:05:54.840> one<00:05:55.290> audible

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
its ability to run with only one audible

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.560 
its ability to run with only one audible
which<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:56.220> like<00:05:56.430> that<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.610> lot<00:05:56.700> because<00:05:57.030> because

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
which I like that a lot because because

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.030 
which I like that a lot because because
the<00:05:57.720> motion<00:05:58.050> allows<00:05:58.230> me<00:05:58.440> to<00:05:58.530> attack<00:05:58.770> both

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
the motion allows me to attack both

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.620 
the motion allows me to attack both
sides<00:05:59.310> of<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.550> feel<00:05:59.700> and<00:05:59.820> that's<00:06:00.240> what<00:06:00.390> I<00:06:00.420> like

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
sides of the feel and that's what I like

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.760 
sides of the feel and that's what I like
so<00:06:00.660> I<00:06:00.840> don't<00:06:00.990> need<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.230> have<00:06:01.320> a<00:06:01.350> count<00:06:01.650> I<00:06:01.740> don't

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
so I don't need to have a count I don't

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.740 
so I don't need to have a count I don't
need<00:06:01.950> to<00:06:02.040> have<00:06:02.130> a<00:06:02.160> toss<00:06:02.370> so<00:06:02.670> that's<00:06:03.570> what<00:06:03.690> I
