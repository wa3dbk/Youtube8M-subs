00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.959
 hi everyone today we get 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.299
 found for a video tutorial yet another 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.270
 time but this time not on 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.850
 what then today I'm going to ready you 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.230
 I'll do a tutorial on 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.630
 how to install in the most 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.340
 easily possible 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.110
 seriously it's really for those 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.840
 who do not know too much about winrar 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.059
 and is something else and all others 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 ebp software to its packages 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.359
 then you will have to download a file 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.309
 executable called magic launcher 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.719
 a launcher is when you open 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 minecraft and bah you see there is a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.909
 window that opens with I make you 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.449
 not but there is a fact that opens with 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.940
 login your and fr options and where you 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 have only two options 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.339
 while with magic magic launcher 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.789
 so here I play I wanted to open and bah 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.290
 that you it opens full of full 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.900
 other possibilities in taking it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.190
 because who opens here is me it's a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.469
 new version for now I do not 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.670
 do not download the armpit it's very 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.560
 well but when you download it on 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 internet i think it was put to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.500
 day I do not know then you will arrive 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.000
 there on a joint venture of minecraft 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.409
 here you have set-up options and login if 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.630
 you want to play directly without anything 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.789
 do that then you're going to press the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 guide but that interest you 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.149
 it's about putting modes 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.399
 so to put modes you go 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.969
 in this here you will have a page 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.219
 you see me there that I have three modes 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.509
 in the configuration called mode 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.079
 if I want to go into the configuration 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.640
 fake you see the Algerian default 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.920
 it's the camp you when you buy 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.899
 minecraft when you crack minecraft 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.310
 you have there you have the configuration 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.539
 default ie no mode 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.039
 then you will create a new one so 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.439
 you will have that default so better on 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.119
 defect you have in new here so you 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.270
 go setup put you the name 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.149
 so for example earlier 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.019
 and copy forum default ie 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.390
 it is going to begin 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.519
 without it going gonna make a copy of 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.260
 defect at the start so here I am in the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.780
 tutorial category in the configuration 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.150
 tito tuto future configuration taizou 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.930
 tutorial and I want to add a mode 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.670
 so I go in bad or download at 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.830
 above but I advise you had 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.349
 so when you click add you 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.670
 will have a fashion choice that you will 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.670
 have downloaded on the internet 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.500
 so here and download ddd mode on 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.239
 Internet 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.310
 so I advise you first of all 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.670
 fashion smell fashion smell it's fashion 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.780
 which allows that will facilitate will say 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.750
 the fashion installation to prevent that 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.489
 the modes do not there are who do not 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.620
 not compatible in fact so you 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.769
 fold twice the rare displayed so at 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.750
 Saturday zip for a rare there you have 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.950
 your first fashions him he is considered 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.260
 as the first in the list 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.340
 he will take over all 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.970
 others we will say so it's very good 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.500
 to have neither mulder borrowing you want 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.560
 add another mode so we will do 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.720
 too many ten so clicked double and that's it 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.829
 he installed it so it's really very 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.209
 very simple that you change in had 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.609
 that a simple double-click is fine 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.180
 modify your minecraft file 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.060
 penchard so here and for example when 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.590
 you will have a problem I forgot to 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.010
 download for the tutorial it's okay 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.959
 you download x raid it braids and 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.489
 to see through us I think that 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.090
 you know in power through all the 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.700
 earth and where and when will you have x ray and 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.160
 will you see here compatible note so 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.950
 when a mode is not compatible 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.500
 with another for example I know that 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.950
 I have already tested that small fine 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.889
 is not compatible with x so would 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:05.220
 here in hockey place it will make note 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.109
 compatible do not look for our 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.120
 compatible when you go to him but 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.370
 minecraft thirsty it's going to make a black screen 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.379
 so basically 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.420
 you will not be able to elysÃ©es so if 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.850
 it does that for you close the window 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.049
 you reopen the minecraft launcher so 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:24.560
 magic launcher uncheck here the mode 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.300
 which is causing you a problem and you 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.370
 can not use them both 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.780
 this is the only drawback of this two 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.349
 weeks j -cr a charter to install 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.029
 fashions 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.949
 on the contrary sometimes instead of 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:38.259
 compatible notes here there will be or and 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.050
 error where everything is rare or things 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.490
 like that bah it admits to test itself 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.259
 it does not work sometimes it works 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.939
 sometimes it does not work 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.289
 personally I prefer to go so 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.930
 the mark is ok that means it's 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.520
 long so I propose to test you on 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.120
 is going to say so the gemoze the smell is 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.860
 humanitarian 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.229
 so I'm in the tutorial configuration 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.839
 I'll hockey login here so it suits me 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.599
 connect so there is no risk 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:07.870
 of bugs way since there was marked 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:10.110
 hockey on the two goals we're going 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.110
 expect 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.019
 so here's this ship who do not know 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.749
 when there is a mojang sign that is not 

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:20.989
 you are going to open a part I 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:23.809
 believe that if any years 

00:05:20.989 --> 00:05:25.879
 frankly it's up to you to see and the 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.469
 buba when you have nothing for now 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.360

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:39.369
 fashion 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:43.629
 that's it it's 20 I want to put the 

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:48.520
