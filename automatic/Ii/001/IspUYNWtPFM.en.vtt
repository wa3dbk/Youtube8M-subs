00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
rebuilding you see here a base plate it

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.660 
rebuilding you see here a base plate it
is<00:00:44.989> coming<00:00:45.989> together<00:00:46.110> pretty<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.770> pretty

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
is coming together pretty good pretty

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.420 
is coming together pretty good pretty
clean<00:00:48.110> at<00:00:49.110> most<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.559> old<00:00:49.739> guys<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.309> off

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
clean at most of that old guys get off

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.549 
clean at most of that old guys get off
that<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:52.219> make<00:00:53.219> sure<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.399> label<00:00:53.790> the

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
that was on there make sure I label the

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
that was on there make sure I label the
basically<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:56.430> way<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.700> know<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.329> basically

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
basically the way I know which basically

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.900 
basically the way I know which basically
went<00:00:57.960> where<00:00:58.140> daughter<00:00:59.010> shafts<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.550> marked

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
went where daughter shafts are marked

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.170 
went where daughter shafts are marked
and<00:01:00.980> it<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> four<00:01:02.430> corner<00:01:02.730> idle<00:01:03.000> circuit

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
and it is a four corner idle circuit

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
really there but there's a hole on each

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.940 
really there but there's a hole on each
corner<00:01:12.540> basically<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.560> see<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.860> the

top of your screen there is a four
corner<00:01:16.770> idle<00:01:17.070> circuit<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.729> mean<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
corner idle circuit I mean and it's

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.710 
corner idle circuit I mean and it's
gonna<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> complete<00:01:19.860> rebuild<00:01:20.479> you<00:01:21.479> can
