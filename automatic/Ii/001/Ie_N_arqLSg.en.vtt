technical<00:00:19.050> analysis<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.890> mentioned<00:00:20.250> before

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
technical analysis so I mentioned before

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.480 
technical analysis so I mentioned before
the<00:00:21.539> July<00:00:21.750> 4th<00:00:22.050> holiday<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.800> price<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.220> gold

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the July 4th holiday the price of gold

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.580 
the July 4th holiday the price of gold
was<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:24.029> above<00:00:24.359> its<00:00:24.539> 50-day<00:00:24.930> moving<00:00:25.230> average

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
was now above its 50-day moving average

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.710 
was now above its 50-day moving average
and<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.580> actually<00:00:26.760> looks<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> rather

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and it actually looks like a rather

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.839 
and it actually looks like a rather
strong<00:00:28.320> move<00:00:28.650> above<00:00:28.949> its<00:00:29.160> 50-day<00:00:29.550> moving

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
strong move above its 50-day moving

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.540 
strong move above its 50-day moving
average<00:00:30.470> interestingly<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.520> 50-day<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
average interestingly the 50-day and

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.760 
average interestingly the 50-day and
20-day<00:00:33.210> are<00:00:33.390> sitting<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.079> top<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.530> each

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
20-day are sitting right on top of each

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.160 
20-day are sitting right on top of each
other<00:00:34.980> right<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.880> if<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:36.600> can<00:00:36.750> get<00:00:36.899> another

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
other right now so if we can get another

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
other right now so if we can get another
move<00:00:37.440> higher<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> gold<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.280> will<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.550> very

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
move higher and gold that will be very

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
move higher and gold that will be very
bullish<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.780> would<00:00:39.930> expect<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> see<00:00:40.739> us

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
bullish and I would expect to see us

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.790 
bullish and I would expect to see us

there's a there's a floor here at

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
there's a there's a floor here at
fifteen<00:00:57.239> forty<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.719> would<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.829> this

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
you can see it better if we do a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.570 
you can see it better if we do a
two-year<00:01:21.960> chart<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.130> downward

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
two-year chart you can see the downward

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.640 
two-year chart you can see the downward
trend<00:01:23.610> line<00:01:24.030> will<00:01:24.299> end<00:01:24.540> up<00:01:24.720> being<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:25.320> at

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
trend line will end up being right at

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.999 
trend line will end up being right at
the<00:01:26.840> 200-day<00:01:27.840> moving<00:01:27.990> average<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.710> start

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the 200-day moving average it will start

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.340 
the 200-day moving average it will start
here<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.549> it'll<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:30.000> right<00:01:30.450> through<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:31.200> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
here and it'll go right through here and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.010 
here and it'll go right through here and
probably<00:01:31.890> hit<00:01:32.130> right<00:01:32.369> at<00:01:32.520> 1650<00:01:33.509> when<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> time

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
probably hit right at 1650 when the time

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.100 
probably hit right at 1650 when the time
comes<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.299> short<00:01:36.509> term<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.049> would

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
comes so in the short term I would

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.149 
comes so in the short term I would
expect<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.040> us<00:01:38.250> move<00:01:38.640> between<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.470> 50-day

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
expect to see us move between the 50-day

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.940 
expect to see us move between the 50-day
and<00:01:41.189> 200-day<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.720> long<00:01:42.930> term<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.350> Bulls

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and 200-day in the long term the Bulls

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.520 
and 200-day in the long term the Bulls
really<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> 200-day<00:01:46.049> broken

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
really want to see this 200-day broken

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.980 
really want to see this 200-day broken
to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> upside<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.460> great<00:01:48.060> buy<00:01:48.360> point<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:48.960> be

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
to the upside a great buy point would be

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.490 
to the upside a great buy point would be
around<00:01:49.350> 1550<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.670> mean<00:01:51.060> honestly<00:01:51.390> 1600s<00:01:52.290> not
