that God like a distribution makes and I
saw<00:00:23.240> this<00:00:23.390> at<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:23.660> 2011<00:00:24.529> name<00:00:25.100> show<00:00:25.430> I<00:00:25.670> was

with my partner in crime Jonathan Hickey
and<00:00:29.000> we<00:00:29.210> both<00:00:29.390> flipped<00:00:29.869> on<00:00:30.020> it<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.350> posted<00:00:30.859> a

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
and we both flipped on it I posted a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.799 
and we both flipped on it I posted a
video<00:00:31.160> of<00:00:31.460> it<00:00:31.580> and<00:00:31.730> think<00:00:32.000> on<00:00:32.180> Facebook<00:00:32.660> or

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
something of me messing with it it was a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.729 
something of me messing with it it was a
first<00:00:35.390> version<00:00:35.629> actually<00:00:36.019> this<00:00:36.470> is<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
first version actually this is the

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.729 
first version actually this is the
second<00:00:37.130> version<00:00:37.250> but<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:38.420> just<00:00:38.720> as<00:00:38.930> insane<00:00:39.350> I

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
second version but it's just as insane I

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.560 
second version but it's just as insane I
don't<00:00:39.920> know<00:00:40.010> what<00:00:40.460> it<00:00:40.610> has<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.120> doesn't<00:00:41.420> have

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
don't know what it has and doesn't have

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.979 
don't know what it has and doesn't have
but<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.200> know<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.390> unbelievable<00:00:44.390> so

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
but I know that it is unbelievable so

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.959 
but I know that it is unbelievable so
it's<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:45.350> synth<00:00:45.620> pedal<00:00:45.980> but<00:00:46.489> it's<00:00:46.640> also<00:00:46.760> an

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
it's a synth pedal but it's also an

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.840 
it's a synth pedal but it's also an
octave<00:00:47.360> pedal<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.890> it's<00:00:49.399> also<00:00:49.550> kind<00:00:49.790> of

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
octave pedal and so it's also kind of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.510 
octave pedal and so it's also kind of
sub<00:00:50.180> pedal<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.780> when<00:00:51.770> you<00:00:51.860> hear<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.219> there's

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
sub pedal and when you hear it there's

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.310 
sub pedal and when you hear it there's
just<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:52.940> much<00:00:53.120> to<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.540> I<00:00:53.629> have<00:00:54.170> the

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
just so much to it I have the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.810 
just so much to it I have the
screwdrivers<00:00:55.010> out<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.190> don't<00:00:55.399> know<00:00:55.520> if<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:55.670> can

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
screwdrivers out I don't know if you can

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.910 
screwdrivers out I don't know if you can
see<00:00:56.059> them<00:00:56.210> but<00:00:56.450> I<00:00:56.690> brought<00:00:57.440> these<00:00:57.620> suckers

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
see them but I brought these suckers

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.459 
see them but I brought these suckers
along<00:00:58.280> because<00:00:58.489> they<00:00:58.610> have<00:00:58.850> trim<00:00:59.809> pots<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.350> the

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
along because they have trim pots on the

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.410 
along because they have trim pots on the
inside<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.489> what<00:01:01.670> this<00:01:01.850> plate<00:01:02.210> is

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
inside so this is what this plate is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.680 
inside so this is what this plate is
this<00:01:02.719> plate<00:01:03.020> right<00:01:03.230> here<00:01:03.559> is<00:01:04.270> the<00:01:05.270> plate<00:01:05.539> that

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
this plate right here is the plate that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.359 
this plate right here is the plate that
tells<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.140> what<00:01:06.320> those<00:01:06.500> different<00:01:06.860> trim<00:01:07.100> pots

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
tells you what those different trim pots

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.150 
tells you what those different trim pots
do<00:01:07.729> and<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.780> already<00:01:09.080> adjusted<00:01:09.440> it<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.920> just

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
do and I already adjusted it to just

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.940 
do and I already adjusted it to just
kind<00:01:10.429> of<00:01:10.580> make<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.090> sound<00:01:11.840> right<00:01:12.229> for<00:01:12.470> me<00:01:12.649> and

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
kind of make it sound right for me and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.309 
kind of make it sound right for me and
what<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:13.550> was<00:01:14.000> going<00:01:14.119> for<00:01:14.330> what<00:01:14.660> I<00:01:14.690> did<00:01:14.899> for<00:01:15.080> sure

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:15.319 
what I was going for what I did for sure

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:17.859 
what I was going for what I did for sure
was<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:15.619> turned<00:01:15.679> the<00:01:16.130> sit<00:01:16.429> pot<00:01:16.729> up<00:01:16.940> so<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.630> guy

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
was I turned the sit pot up so this guy

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.809 
was I turned the sit pot up so this guy
is<00:01:17.929> a<00:01:18.080> lot<00:01:18.319> louder<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.280> really

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
is a lot louder so it's really

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.279 
is a lot louder so it's really
interesting<00:01:20.119> sounding<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.869> wanted<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.170> make

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
interesting sounding I wanted to make

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.529 
interesting sounding I wanted to make
sure<00:01:21.319> it<00:01:21.530> bump<00:01:21.830> through<00:01:22.039> the<00:01:22.310> octaves<00:01:23.300> and

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
sure it bump through the octaves and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.359 
sure it bump through the octaves and
subs<00:01:23.810> in<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.229> so<00:01:24.649> let's<00:01:24.830> go<00:01:24.950> through<00:01:25.160> it<00:01:25.190> really

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
subs in it so let's go through it really

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.020 
subs in it so let's go through it really
quickly<00:01:25.959> this<00:01:26.959> is<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.170> synth<00:01:27.619> fader<00:01:27.950> this<00:01:28.849> is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
quickly this is the synth fader this is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.449 
quickly this is the synth fader this is
an<00:01:29.179> octave<00:01:29.569> up<00:01:29.750> fader<00:01:30.140> this<00:01:30.890> is<00:01:31.069> the<00:01:31.190> dry

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
an octave up fader this is the dry

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.949 
an octave up fader this is the dry
signal<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.450> basic<00:01:32.929> no<00:01:33.399> octave<00:01:34.399> down

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
signal you just basic no octave down

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:38.650 
signal you just basic no octave down
fader<00:01:35.959> and<00:01:36.289> then<00:01:36.950> this<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.789> sub<00:01:38.060> fader<00:01:38.360> and

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
fader and then this is the sub fader and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.089 
fader and then this is the sub fader and
so<00:01:39.380> this<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.750> different<00:01:41.750> types<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.649> synth

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
so this is the different types of synth

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.699 
so this is the different types of synth
waves<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:43.910> it's<00:01:44.209> sawtooth<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.170> you'll<00:01:45.530> hear

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:45.709 
waves so it's sawtooth and you'll hear

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:47.290 
waves so it's sawtooth and you'll hear
the<00:01:45.830> difference<00:01:45.979> when<00:01:46.429> I'm<00:01:46.550> flipping<00:01:47.270> through

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
the difference when I'm flipping through

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.410 
the difference when I'm flipping through
it<00:01:47.539> this<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.789> clock<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:49.819> goes<00:01:50.179> through

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it this is the clock that goes through

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.419 
it this is the clock that goes through
different<00:01:50.569> intervals<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.860> synth<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
different intervals for the synth and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.639 
different intervals for the synth and
then<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.849> one's<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.209> the<00:01:53.239> sub<00:01:53.599> and<00:01:53.899> you'll

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
then this one's for the sub and you'll

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.229 
then this one's for the sub and you'll
hear<00:01:54.890> -<00:01:55.190> it's<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:55.550> like<00:01:55.759> that's<00:01:56.000> when<00:01:56.149> you

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
hear - it's just like that's when you

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.300 
hear - it's just like that's when you
start<00:01:56.479> hearing<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:56.840> subs<00:01:57.140> fight<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
start hearing the subs fight the

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.770 
start hearing the subs fight the
different<00:01:59.000> intervals<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.479> you'll<00:01:59.630> start

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
different intervals and you'll start

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.600 
different intervals and you'll start
hearing<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.170> weird<00:02:00.440> clicky<00:02:00.979> switching<00:02:01.429> I

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
hearing this weird clicky switching I

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.940 
hearing this weird clicky switching I
love<00:02:02.179> that<00:02:02.360> stuff<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.929> boss<00:02:03.319> OC<00:02:03.739> -

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
love that stuff but the boss OC -

love that stuff but the boss OC -
doesn't<00:02:04.369> really<00:02:04.459> well<00:02:04.789> which<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.539> love<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> lot

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
doesn't really well which I love a lot

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.540 
doesn't really well which I love a lot
of<00:02:06.050> people<00:02:06.319> don't<00:02:06.440> like<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.920> element<00:02:07.369> but<00:02:07.429> I

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
evelope switch it's got an expression

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.480 
evelope switch it's got an expression
pedal<00:02:13.939> which<00:02:14.030> I'm<00:02:14.150> not

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
pedal which I'm not

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.220 
pedal which I'm not
I<00:02:14.520> only<00:02:15.060> have<00:02:15.210> so<00:02:15.270> much<00:02:15.450> time<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:15.960> first

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
I only have so much time in this first

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.260 
I only have so much time in this first
demo<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.740> this<00:02:16.830> guy<00:02:17.040> I'm<00:02:17.730> sure<00:02:18.060> I'll<00:02:18.240> show

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
demo for this guy I'm sure I'll show

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.210 
demo for this guy I'm sure I'll show
this<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.900> few<00:02:19.110> other<00:02:19.230> things<00:02:19.590> that<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.100> do

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
this in a few other things that I do

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.820 
this in a few other things that I do
because<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.700> love<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.090> pal<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.680> I'm

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
because I love this pal so much so I'm

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.200 
because I love this pal so much so I'm
going<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:22.980> loop<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.250> line<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.490> was<00:02:23.820> playing<00:02:24.090> this

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
going to loop a line I was playing this

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:37.059 
going to loop a line I was playing this
blind<00:02:24.570> earlier<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> is

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:47.160 

here<00:02:38.069> we<00:02:38.189> go<00:02:38.370> bringing<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.849> in

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.410 

so<00:02:47.860> as<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.190> see<00:02:48.370> it's<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.700> fader<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.330> it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
so as you see it's a fader so it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.730 
so as you see it's a fader so it's
literally<00:02:49.810> if<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:50.170> want<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.530> bring<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
literally if I want to just bring the

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.470 
literally if I want to just bring the
dry<00:02:51.100> signal<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.730> would<00:02:51.880> do<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:58.150> here's<00:02:58.360> the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
dry signal I would do this so here's the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.619 
dry signal I would do this so here's the
scent<00:02:58.750> again

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.690 

is<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:07.260> octave<00:03:07.650> up

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.650 

you

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.060 

so<00:03:15.660> that's<00:03:15.810> even<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.320> right<00:03:16.680> there<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.040> just

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
so that's even that right there is just

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.310 
so that's even that right there is just
trippy<00:03:17.670> Sonny<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.120> an<00:03:18.300> all<00:03:18.510> analog<00:03:18.870> pedal

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
trippy Sonny this is an all analog pedal

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.650 
trippy Sonny this is an all analog pedal
by<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> way<00:03:19.770> so<00:03:19.830> you're<00:03:20.730> not<00:03:20.850> hearing<00:03:21.150> digital

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
by the way so you're not hearing digital

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.220 
by the way so you're not hearing digital
stuff<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:22.080> analog<00:03:22.530> here's<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.280> octave

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
stuff it's analog here's the octave

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.430 
stuff it's analog here's the octave
sorry<00:03:25.230> that's<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.500> direct<00:03:25.800> here's<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.070> upper

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
sorry that's the direct here's the upper

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.850 
sorry that's the direct here's the upper
octave<00:03:28.440> down

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.100 

so<00:03:36.860> then<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.250> last<00:03:37.280> fader<00:03:37.940> here<00:03:38.360> is<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.810> sub

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
so then the last fader here is the sub

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:49.510 
so then the last fader here is the sub
and<00:03:39.440> here's<00:03:40.310> me<00:03:40.820> pulling<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.600> up<00:03:41.840> on<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:42.380> fader

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.970 

so<00:03:50.330> that's<00:03:50.480> pretty<00:03:50.750> glitched<00:03:51.140> out<00:03:51.380> that's<00:03:51.800> on

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
so that's pretty glitched out that's on

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.740 
so that's pretty glitched out that's on
that<00:03:52.100> top<00:03:52.370> interval<00:03:52.790> let<00:03:52.910> me<00:03:53.000> let<00:03:53.210> me<00:03:53.240> back

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
that top interval let me let me back

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.089 
that top interval let me let me back
that<00:03:53.990> off<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:54.440> then

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.069 

so<00:03:59.939> you<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.180> hear<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.450> different<00:04:00.780> clocks

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
so you can hear the different clocks

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:19.000 
so you can hear the different clocks
that<00:04:01.319> happen

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.319 

so<00:04:20.010> that's<00:04:20.190> super<00:04:20.400> savvy<00:04:20.790> I'm<00:04:21.000> going<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.209> keep

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
so that's super savvy I'm going to keep

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.110 
so that's super savvy I'm going to keep
it<00:04:21.449> on<00:04:21.540> my<00:04:21.630> favorite<00:04:21.989> one<00:04:22.109> which<00:04:22.230> is<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
it on my favorite one which is the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:05:05.470 
it on my favorite one which is the
second<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.330> top<00:04:24.360> one

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:15.550 

you

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.550 

so<00:05:16.280> as<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.580> can<00:05:16.700> see<00:05:17.000> there's<00:05:17.690> a<00:05:17.780> lot<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.380> this

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
so as you can see there's a lot in this

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.740 
so as you can see there's a lot in this
pedal<00:05:18.980> and<00:05:19.160> when<00:05:19.910> you<00:05:20.030> start<00:05:20.300> to<00:05:20.420> blend

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
pedal and when you start to blend

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.180 
pedal and when you start to blend
everything<00:05:21.290> because<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:21.680> have<00:05:21.890> like<00:05:22.070> this

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
everything because you have like this

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.760 
everything because you have like this
little<00:05:22.510> mixer<00:05:23.510> right<00:05:23.660> here<00:05:23.930> you<00:05:24.350> can<00:05:24.560> start

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
little mixer right here you can start

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.500 
little mixer right here you can start
bringing<00:05:25.160> things<00:05:25.310> in<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:25.850> really<00:05:26.210> get<00:05:26.330> this

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
bringing things in and really get this

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.740 
bringing things in and really get this
mashed<00:05:27.020> sound<00:05:27.830> that's<00:05:28.130> just<00:05:28.460> so<00:05:28.760> heavy<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.450> so

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
mashed sound that's just so heavy and so

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.170 
mashed sound that's just so heavy and so
thick<00:05:30.200> and<00:05:30.410> so<00:05:30.680> layered<00:05:31.040> this<00:05:31.730> setting<00:05:32.120> right

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
thick and so layered this setting right

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.210 
thick and so layered this setting right
here<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.900> my<00:05:33.110> favorite<00:05:33.140> setting<00:05:33.740> for<00:05:34.100> the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
here is my favorite setting for the

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.890 
here is my favorite setting for the
synth<00:05:34.520> because<00:05:34.790> it<00:05:34.940> has<00:05:35.150> like<00:05:35.390> a<00:05:35.450> little<00:05:35.690> bit

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
synth because it has like a little bit

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.300 
synth because it has like a little bit
of<00:05:35.990> ring<00:05:36.140> modulator<00:05:36.650> in<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:36.980> that<00:05:37.070> you'll<00:05:37.220> be

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
of ring modulator in it that you'll be

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:47.649 
of ring modulator in it that you'll be
able<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.520> hear

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:47.659 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.850 

so<00:05:48.659> let<00:05:48.810> me<00:05:48.900> bring<00:05:49.080> in<00:05:49.199> a<00:05:49.259> little<00:05:49.439> bit<00:05:49.560> of<00:05:49.740> the

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
so let me bring in a little bit of the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:06:01.330 
so let me bring in a little bit of the
octave<00:05:50.490> here

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.430 

and<00:06:02.340> then<00:06:03.000> so<00:06:03.270> what<00:06:03.450> I'm<00:06:03.570> going<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.750> do<00:06:03.900> now<00:06:04.110> is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
and then so what I'm going to do now is

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.300 
and then so what I'm going to do now is
I'm<00:06:04.560> going<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.740> start<00:06:04.890> showing<00:06:05.070> you<00:06:05.190> the

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
I'm going to start showing you the

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.980 
I'm going to start showing you the
differences<00:06:05.760> that<00:06:05.820> happen<00:06:06.300> on<00:06:06.420> the<00:06:06.450> on<00:06:06.840> this

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
differences that happen on the on this

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:39.629 
differences that happen on the on this
octave<00:06:07.980> the<00:06:08.130> first<00:06:08.340> octave<00:06:08.760> right<00:06:08.910> here

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.629 

so<00:06:40.639> as<00:06:40.699> you<00:06:40.849> can<00:06:40.999> see<00:06:41.589> this<00:06:42.589> pedal<00:06:42.979> has<00:06:43.009> so<00:06:43.429> many

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
so as you can see this pedal has so many

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.609 
so as you can see this pedal has so many
things<00:06:44.029> that<00:06:44.329> you<00:06:44.479> can<00:06:44.629> do<00:06:44.839> with<00:06:45.019> it<00:06:45.169> I<00:06:45.319> haven't

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
things that you can do with it I haven't

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.099 
things that you can do with it I haven't
really<00:06:45.859> messed<00:06:46.039> with<00:06:46.129> the<00:06:46.279> envelope<00:06:46.669> too<00:06:46.879> much

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:47.109 
really messed with the envelope too much

00:06:47.109 --> 00:06:48.969 
really messed with the envelope too much
I'm<00:06:48.109> going<00:06:48.259> to<00:06:48.319> get<00:06:48.439> into<00:06:48.649> that<00:06:48.769> more<00:06:48.919> later

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
I'm going to get into that more later

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.739 
I'm going to get into that more later
but<00:06:49.249> are<00:06:49.489> what<00:06:49.609> I<00:06:49.669> wanted<00:06:49.969> to<00:06:50.089> do<00:06:50.239> is<00:06:50.389> like<00:06:50.509> just

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:50.749 
but are what I wanted to do is like just

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:52.449 
but are what I wanted to do is like just
let<00:06:50.869> you<00:06:50.989> know<00:06:51.109> that<00:06:51.289> take<00:06:51.889> off<00:06:52.099> the<00:06:52.279> back

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:52.459 
let you know that take off the back

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:54.429 
let you know that take off the back
panel<00:06:52.969> this<00:06:53.149> one<00:06:53.359> if<00:06:53.419> you<00:06:53.509> get<00:06:53.689> this<00:06:53.839> pedal<00:06:54.259> and

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:54.439 
panel this one if you get this pedal and

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:56.139 
panel this one if you get this pedal and
you'll<00:06:54.949> be<00:06:55.099> able<00:06:55.279> to<00:06:55.369> see<00:06:55.519> the<00:06:55.609> different<00:06:55.939> trim

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149 
you'll be able to see the different trim

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.239 
you'll be able to see the different trim
paws<00:06:56.389> and<00:06:56.659> you<00:06:56.719> can<00:06:56.899> just<00:06:57.439> kind<00:06:57.679> of<00:06:57.769> tailor

00:06:58.239 --> 00:06:58.249 
paws and you can just kind of tailor

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.579 
paws and you can just kind of tailor
this<00:06:58.399> to<00:06:58.579> how<00:06:58.729> you<00:06:58.789> want<00:06:59.209> this<00:06:59.539> pedal<00:07:00.439> there

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:00.589 
this to how you want this pedal there

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:02.589 
this to how you want this pedal there
sound<00:07:00.919> and<00:07:01.219> then<00:07:01.669> really<00:07:01.999> get<00:07:02.119> into<00:07:02.449> your

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
sound and then really get into your

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:05.619 
sound and then really get into your
different<00:07:02.959> sound<00:07:03.619> ways<00:07:03.979> here<00:07:04.369> and<00:07:04.519> then<00:07:05.299> you

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:05.629 
different sound ways here and then you

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:07.659 
different sound ways here and then you
can<00:07:05.779> get<00:07:05.929> into<00:07:06.139> the<00:07:06.439> different<00:07:06.799> sub<00:07:07.159> levels

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
can get into the different sub levels

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.009 
can get into the different sub levels
here<00:07:07.849> the<00:07:08.029> different<00:07:08.329> interval<00:07:08.659> sub<00:07:08.869> of

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:09.019 
here the different interval sub of

00:07:09.019 --> 00:07:09.909 
here the different interval sub of
that's<00:07:09.289> when<00:07:09.439> you<00:07:09.499> start<00:07:09.679> getting<00:07:09.769> that

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
that's when you start getting that

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:12.309 
that's when you start getting that
fighting<00:07:10.429> happening<00:07:10.909> but<00:07:11.479> again<00:07:11.749> I<00:07:11.959> just<00:07:12.019> take

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 
fighting happening but again I just take

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:14.259 
fighting happening but again I just take
this<00:07:12.439> pedal<00:07:12.889> I'm<00:07:13.069> just<00:07:13.459> scraping<00:07:13.789> the<00:07:14.089> surface

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:14.269 
this pedal I'm just scraping the surface

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:15.939 
this pedal I'm just scraping the surface
and<00:07:14.749> I<00:07:14.809> really<00:07:15.139> think<00:07:15.289> that<00:07:15.409> it's<00:07:15.649> something

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:15.949 
and I really think that it's something

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.099 
and I really think that it's something
that<00:07:16.099> I<00:07:16.249> could<00:07:16.309> spend<00:07:16.729> 20<00:07:17.509> minutes<00:07:17.539> explaining

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:18.109 
that I could spend 20 minutes explaining

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:51.510 
that I could spend 20 minutes explaining
but<00:07:18.769> I'd<00:07:18.859> rather<00:07:19.009> just<00:07:19.339> play

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.580 

you
