00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.579 

in<00:00:00.210> this<00:00:00.599> video<00:00:00.870> we're<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.170> take<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.410> look

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.379 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:01.770> three<00:00:01.949> different<00:00:02.310> examples<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.909> how<00:00:03.090> to

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
at three different examples of how to

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.570 
at three different examples of how to
preserve<00:00:03.810> skin<00:00:04.350> tones<00:00:04.620> while<00:00:05.220> adding

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
preserve skin tones while adding

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.150 
preserve skin tones while adding
saturation<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> photo<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.680> this<00:00:07.830> first<00:00:08.010> one

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
saturation to a photo so this first one

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.850 
saturation to a photo so this first one
is<00:00:08.340> pretty<00:00:08.670> easy<00:00:08.760> because<00:00:09.530> this<00:00:10.530> girl's

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
is pretty easy because this girl's

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.339 
is pretty easy because this girl's
pretty<00:00:11.190> fair-skinned<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.360> there's<00:00:13.139> not<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
pretty fair-skinned and so there's not a

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
pretty fair-skinned and so there's not a
lot<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.590> orange<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.070> red<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.370> her<00:00:14.519> skin<00:00:14.849> so

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
lot of orange and red in her skin so

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.340 
lot of orange and red in her skin so
this<00:00:15.299> gets<00:00:15.450> more<00:00:15.660> difficult<00:00:16.139> when<00:00:16.320> people

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this gets more difficult when people

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.220 
this gets more difficult when people
have<00:00:17.130> darker<00:00:17.640> skin<00:00:17.670> or<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.539> strong<00:00:18.840> tan

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
have darker skin or have a strong tan

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
have darker skin or have a strong tan
but<00:00:19.949> let's<00:00:20.160> take<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> look<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:20.850> I'm<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.210> I'm

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
but let's take a look here I'm just I'm

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.330 
but let's take a look here I'm just I'm
gonna<00:00:21.600> bring<00:00:21.810> up<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.050> little<00:00:22.170> saturation<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
gonna bring up a little saturation and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.750 
gonna bring up a little saturation and
some<00:00:23.939> vibrance<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.189> was<00:00:26.340> trying<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
some vibrance so if I was trying to

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910 
some vibrance so if I was trying to
really<00:00:26.910> get<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.390> background<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.529> be<00:00:28.650> really

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
really get this background to be really

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.980 
really get this background to be really
strong<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:30.240> know<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> might<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.750> something

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
strong you know I might do something

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.359 
strong you know I might do something
like<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.769> we've<00:00:31.890> got<00:00:32.040> these<00:00:32.160> really

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
like that so we've got these really

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.330 
like that so we've got these really
strong<00:00:32.669> greens<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> background<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
strong greens in the background and

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.850 
strong greens in the background and
we're<00:00:35.340> starting<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> get<00:00:35.910> some<00:00:36.210> red<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.860> her

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
we're starting to get some red in her

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.010 
we're starting to get some red in her
face<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> way<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.329> take<00:00:39.629> care<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
face so the way to take care of that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.540 
face so the way to take care of that
really<00:00:40.200> quickly<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.710> go<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> hue<00:00:41.340> saturation

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
really quickly is go to hue saturation

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
really quickly is go to hue saturation
and<00:00:42.180> luminance<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:43.320> sure<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.739> on

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and luminance make sure you're on

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
and luminance make sure you're on
saturation<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.210> click<00:00:45.450> this

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
saturation here and then click this

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
saturation here and then click this
little<00:00:45.899> selector<00:00:46.590> tool<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.870> click<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.649> part

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
little selector tool and click in a part

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
little selector tool and click in a part
of<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> skin<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.149> gonna<00:00:51.270> choose<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.660> part

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
of the skin I'm gonna choose this part

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
of the skin I'm gonna choose this part
cuz<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.140> got<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> little<00:00:52.410> more<00:00:52.559> red<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.160> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
cuz it's got a little more red in it I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
cuz it's got a little more red in it I'm
just<00:00:53.969> gonna<00:00:54.120> click<00:00:54.360> there<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.570> drag<00:00:54.960> downward

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
just gonna click there and drag downward

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.560 
just gonna click there and drag downward
and<00:00:55.770> see<00:00:55.980> how<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.280> selected<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> red<00:00:57.149> slider

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and see how it's selected the red slider

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.310 
and see how it's selected the red slider
for<00:00:58.050> me<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.090> on<00:01:00.090> some<00:01:00.510> faces<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:00.960> gonna<00:01:01.109> do

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
for me and on some faces that's gonna do

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 
for me and on some faces that's gonna do
red<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.559> orange<00:01:01.949> together<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.670> may<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.059> do

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
red and orange together it may not do

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.289 
red and orange together it may not do
them<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> same<00:01:04.290> rate<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.030> see

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
them at the same rate but we can see

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.080 
them at the same rate but we can see
without<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.260> I've<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> little<00:01:08.400> more<00:01:08.549> red

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
without that I've got a little more red

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
without that I've got a little more red
in<00:01:09.240> her<00:01:09.330> face<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.869> without<00:01:10.260> we've<00:01:10.950> kind<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
in her face and without we've kind of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
in her face and without we've kind of
gone<00:01:11.369> back<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.939> how<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.869> was<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.380> begin<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.710> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
gone back to how it was to begin with so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.190 
gone back to how it was to begin with so
in<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.700> photo<00:01:14.909> I've<00:01:15.119> already<00:01:15.450> increased<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
in this photo I've already increased the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
in this photo I've already increased the
saturation<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.950> vibrance<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> see

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
saturation and vibrance and you can see

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.899 
saturation and vibrance and you can see
these<00:01:18.720> ladies<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.680> tan<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
these ladies have more of a tan and the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.570 
these ladies have more of a tan and the
skin<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.810> more<00:01:22.500> orange<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.220> over<00:01:23.400> here

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
skin here is more orange and over here

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.570 
skin here is more orange and over here
is<00:01:23.670> more<00:01:24.060> red<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.350> I'm<00:01:25.770> gonna<00:01:25.920> again<00:01:26.220> come<00:01:26.549> down

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
is more red so I'm gonna again come down

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.480 
is more red so I'm gonna again come down
to<00:01:26.820> hue<00:01:26.970> saturation<00:01:27.180> luminance<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:29.280> can

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
to hue saturation luminance and I can

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.800 
to hue saturation luminance and I can
either<00:01:29.670> grab<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.840> selector<00:01:31.500> tool<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.810> just

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
either grab the selector tool and just

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.590 
either grab the selector tool and just
drag<00:01:34.079> down<00:01:34.549> well<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:35.939> dragging<00:01:36.299> red

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
drag down well here it's dragging red

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960 
drag down well here it's dragging red
and<00:01:36.750> ours<00:01:36.869> together<00:01:37.310> equally<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> guess

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and ours together equally so I guess

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850 
and ours together equally so I guess
that<00:01:39.180> would<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.329> fine

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that would be fine

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.380 
that would be fine
if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.490> different<00:01:41.880> people<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.329> are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
if you have different people that are

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
if you have different people that are
very<00:01:42.720> different<00:01:43.020> then<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.950> may<00:01:44.100> want<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.430> do

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
very different then you may want to do

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.990 
very different then you may want to do
them<00:01:44.700> individually<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:47.640> seems

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
them individually but that's that seems

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.819 
them individually but that's that seems
to<00:01:48.119> work<00:01:48.240> pretty<00:01:48.270> well<00:01:48.540> here<00:01:48.930> as<00:01:49.110> well<00:01:49.439> here's

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
to work pretty well here as well here's

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.249 
to work pretty well here as well here's
before<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.149> after<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.049> kind<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
before and after so it just kind of

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
before and after so it just kind of
helps<00:01:52.380> tone<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.820> last

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
helps tone that down a bit this last

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.880 
helps tone that down a bit this last
example<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.020> more<00:01:55.229> difficult<00:01:55.680> we

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
example is a little more difficult we

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.969 
example is a little more difficult we
have<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.430> warm<00:01:56.880> skin<00:01:57.780> tone<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.799> there

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
have a very warm skin tone and I there

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.370 
have a very warm skin tone and I there
was<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.100> gold<00:01:59.399> reflector<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.270> her<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
was a gold reflector on her but the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.490 
was a gold reflector on her but the
background<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.950> not<00:02:02.520> very<00:02:02.820> saturated<00:02:03.259> if<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.439> do

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
background is not very saturated if I do

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
background is not very saturated if I do
the<00:02:04.710> same<00:02:04.920> thing<00:02:04.979> here<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> could<00:02:06.210> just

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the same thing here I could just

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.770 
the same thing here I could just
increase<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.310> come<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.209> again<00:02:09.569> hue

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
increase this and come down again hue

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.229 
increase this and come down again hue
saturation<00:02:09.959> luminance<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:11.039> we'll<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.819> pull

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
saturation luminance and we'll just pull

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.910 
saturation luminance and we'll just pull
that<00:02:12.420> out<00:02:13.080> and

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that out and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
that out and
that<00:02:14.640> gets<00:02:14.819> us<00:02:14.940> pretty<00:02:15.180> well<00:02:15.270> back<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.780> normal

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
that gets us pretty well back to normal

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.780 
that gets us pretty well back to normal
it's<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.950> little<00:02:17.130> different<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.520> because

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
it's a little different here because

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.580 
it's a little different here because
this<00:02:17.940> post<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> board<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> same<00:02:19.260> tone

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
this post and the board is the same tone

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.460 
this post and the board is the same tone
as<00:02:19.739> her<00:02:19.890> skin<00:02:20.250> so<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.819> hard<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.360> decide<00:02:22.290> how

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
as her skin so it's hard to decide how

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470 
as her skin so it's hard to decide how
far<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.800> go<00:02:22.830> with<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:24.120> gonna<00:02:24.239> go<00:02:24.420> ahead

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
far to go with that I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.479 
far to go with that I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:24.660> reset<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.230> there's<00:02:25.680> another<00:02:25.890> option<00:02:26.099> we

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
and reset that there's another option we

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.040 
and reset that there's another option we
could<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.690> look<00:02:30.840> at<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
could do and that is to look at the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.600 
could do and that is to look at the
image<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.380> decide<00:02:31.709> what<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.520> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
image and decide what do we want to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.430 
image and decide what do we want to
increase<00:02:33.150> rather<00:02:33.420> than<00:02:33.720> just<00:02:33.930> increasing

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
increase rather than just increasing

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.780 
increase rather than just increasing
everything<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.069> trying<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.430> tone<00:02:35.640> down

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
everything and then trying to tone down

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
everything and then trying to tone down
the<00:02:35.940> skin<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:36.450> again<00:02:36.620> hue<00:02:37.620> saturation

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
the skin so again hue saturation

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.130 
the skin so again hue saturation
luminance<00:02:38.400> I'm<00:02:38.940> gonna<00:02:39.180> increase<00:02:39.569> blue<00:02:39.900> in

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
luminance I'm gonna increase blue in

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.160 
luminance I'm gonna increase blue in
green<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:41.100> maybe<00:02:41.910> yellow<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.390> don't<00:02:42.660> think

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
green and maybe yellow I don't think

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.559 
green and maybe yellow I don't think
we've<00:02:43.319> got<00:02:43.500> yellow<00:02:43.769> in<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.190> skin<00:02:44.459> there<00:02:44.670> so

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
we've got yellow in the skin there so

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.020 
we've got yellow in the skin there so
let's<00:02:46.080> try<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:46.800> here<00:02:46.980> goes<00:02:47.130> blue<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.000> we

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
let's try that so here goes blue so we

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.490 
let's try that so here goes blue so we
get<00:02:49.010> strong<00:02:50.010> sky<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:50.910> we've<00:02:51.269> made<00:02:52.080> her<00:02:52.170> jeans

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
get strong sky and we've made her jeans

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.059 
get strong sky and we've made her jeans
stand<00:02:52.860> out<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.069> little<00:02:53.190> more<00:02:54.500> green<00:02:55.500> who<00:02:55.890> got

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
stand out a little more green who got

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.809 
stand out a little more green who got
the<00:02:56.250> grass<00:02:56.459> here's<00:02:57.030> yellow<00:02:57.500> so<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.819> that

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the grass here's yellow so that that

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.509 
the grass here's yellow so that that
adds<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.150> little<00:03:00.239> more<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:01.290> grass<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.890> now

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
adds a little more in the grass and now

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.070 
adds a little more in the grass and now
the<00:03:02.580> only<00:03:02.940> other<00:03:03.030> thing<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.450> would<00:03:03.480> do<00:03:03.720> probably

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the only other thing I would do probably

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.600 
the only other thing I would do probably
is<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.610> hue<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.650> just<00:03:07.650> tweak<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.160> target

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
is go to hue and just tweak the target

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.050 
is go to hue and just tweak the target
of<00:03:08.760> blue<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.090> little<00:03:09.780> bit<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.700> that<00:03:11.730> we've<00:03:12.030> got

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
of blue a little bit so that we've got

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.449 
of blue a little bit so that we've got
it<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.720> little<00:03:13.560> more<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.799> true<00:03:14.010> blue<00:03:14.250> there

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
it a little more of a true blue there

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.670 
it a little more of a true blue there
right<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.819> like<00:03:15.239> that<00:03:15.480> better<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.260> let's<00:03:16.500> see

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
right I like that better so let's see

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.099 
right I like that better so let's see
before<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.160> after<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.359> we<00:03:18.450> made<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> really<00:03:18.900> big

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
before and after so we made a really big

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.270 
before and after so we made a really big
difference<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.650> didn't<00:03:19.829> even<00:03:19.859> touch<00:03:20.130> her

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
difference and we didn't even touch her

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.039 
difference and we didn't even touch her
skin<00:03:20.549> at<00:03:20.670> all<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.060> case<00:03:21.299> and<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.989> only

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
skin at all in this case and the only

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.380 
skin at all in this case and the only
other<00:03:22.350> thing<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:23.250> finish<00:03:23.430> this<00:03:23.700> off<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.180> would

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
other thing to finish this off I would

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.550 
other thing to finish this off I would
probably<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.320> radial<00:03:25.829> filter<00:03:27.530> with<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
probably do a radial filter with a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
probably do a radial filter with a
negative<00:03:28.890> exposure<00:03:29.609> just<00:03:34.640> put<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.760> attention

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
negative exposure just put the attention

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.120 
negative exposure just put the attention
where<00:03:36.329> we<00:03:36.510> want<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.079> if<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.799> helped<00:03:38.070> you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
where we want it so if this helped you

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.530 
where we want it so if this helped you
out<00:03:38.190> please<00:03:38.489> let<00:03:38.700> me<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.940> by<00:03:39.090> leaving<00:03:39.329> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
out please let me know by leaving a
