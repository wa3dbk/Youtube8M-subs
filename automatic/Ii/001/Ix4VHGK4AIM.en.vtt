00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.740
 but the thing is sure you have to know you buy in the arms 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.130
 but he will have of course but we must remember the scene 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.909
 with the style of play 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
 that I do not believe him 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.029
 so why want to sell 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.229
 satisfied 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.229
 fasquelle and scholarships 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.650
 3 that proves that my point of public debate 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 because sometimes I can w 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.030
 for the past in love 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030
 we are based in the Netherlands courses 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 clever hosting 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.850
 so this can become actor of the great war 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.350
 how are we going to manage open reforms 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.400
 we will bard benchmarks 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.950
 the real problem has begun 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.490
 23 48 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 upgrade program his new goalkeeper 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.030
 and then he went up to Lille who will lose not available 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.440
 the euro area has declared 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.290
 if I went to prepare my part 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.220
 so you have the kram fair 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.420
 ahmed al-mahmoud school now he did not listen to him 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.760
 in the same order of 5% 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.940
 if it does not hurt to answer 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.940
 we understand at first 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.490
 when I invite you to do 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.850
 on the contrary 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.970
 it's difficult to analyze a height 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.469
 so you have to try to judge him 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:14.040
 if I understand that 90w jewels if I take three quarters halves and I want 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:17.329
 the Argentineans of the om 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.680
 South Korean press 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.039
 in 2010 to 90 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.349
 once she took 45 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.349
 look at 12 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.409
 I am a little between the two 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.579
 valbuena 90 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.879
 between three and four million copies of candidates 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.859
 This agreement 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.559
 line entrepreneur 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:42.969
 if we read between three carabinieri was going well 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.050
 so we will aim 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.650
 between half past three and we're still going to 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.279
 Monday 4 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.519
 that's how we tried to manage 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.539
 they opened 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.119
 and immediately we realize that it is much more difficult to 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.539
 lock 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:00.549
 the signers that way the group 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.209
 so 3 2000 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.209
 between three quarters of innocent people 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.279
 France 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.249
 toulouse receives for the occasion 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.249
 why this choice 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.179
 at arras 

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:37.569
 do our best to bring that moment 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.009
 and then see what will happen after 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.009
 the kiss tinker the costs of use 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.219
 it was really yes 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.319
 I want to be like that 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.099
 you saw we take Afghan rebels enjoin his schedules we're going 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.099
 ask on any meeting 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.559
 I just explained how the 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.679
 boutin 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.939
 2010 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.939
 aucamville 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.050
 between peoples 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.050
 you can the the riffs three-quarters 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.180
 between the boul 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.729
 that's why 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.729
 between two diageo in french-speaking Switzerland robert 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.020
 Alas 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.499
 if I see it like that 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.749
 by reasoning how ali 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.749
 Two years later 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 you do not stop a lot 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:02.949
 if you want to have fun with olivier marchal ebondo heading you stop 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.699
 these latter 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.699
 kim tried 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.629
 davis against German siemens 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.960
 for me it's a non-event 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.460
 the president of he arouses 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.629
 sunny here 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.629
 we are still learning the most valuable services 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.319
 here it would be good between them three-quarters 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.839
 full three-quarters full of life 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.839
 recreation center it is closer to us 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.029
 firefighters 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.029
 at the time the parents do not have too much 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.559
 it would not change anything 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.430
 this week in china 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.539
 I plunge my hand I saw that it 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.169
 it was full 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.169
 a little more support 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.979
 this example 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.749
 possible 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.749
 well we do not have that long 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.569
 Aalla 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:29.370
 this one got tired of life and death 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.349
 the 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:33.930
 colgate 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.490
 attention attention talent 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.490
 these images the news of typing on 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.819
 so 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.409
 stone fa 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:51.629
 taratata of interest 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.330
 by romain boselli 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.180
 from the church 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.249
 whatever happens he left a little closer to three quarters 

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:01.979
 therefore 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:04.009
 between evening 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:07.009
 exact three quarters 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:16.539
 Thursday parcels 

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:21.619
 well it's not bad of course without employment 

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:27.589
 it's a very good surprise 

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:38.979
 so here is a little bit of 

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:41.979
 and then here I am reading the ali paid heavily 

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.089
 it will first need a little grown in montreal
