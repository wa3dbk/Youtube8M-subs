00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:03.850 
all right so today I'm gonna show you

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.670 
all right so today I'm gonna show you
guys<00:00:04.000> how<00:00:04.180> to<00:00:04.540> remotely<00:00:04.900> shut<00:00:05.230> down<00:00:05.410> any

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 
guys how to remotely shut down any

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.040 
guys how to remotely shut down any
computer<00:00:06.220> on<00:00:06.249> the<00:00:06.430> planet<00:00:06.459> now<00:00:07.450> first<00:00:07.779> you

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
computer on the planet now first you

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.690 
computer on the planet now first you
need<00:00:08.200> to<00:00:08.290> establish<00:00:08.440> a<00:00:08.830> proper<00:00:09.340> hacking

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
need to establish a proper hacking

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.990 
need to establish a proper hacking
environment<00:00:10.269> so<00:00:11.019> I'm<00:00:11.170> gonna<00:00:11.320> do<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:12.730> run

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
environment so I'm gonna do this run

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.940 
environment so I'm gonna do this run
this<00:00:13.240> batch<00:00:13.570> file<00:00:13.929> here<00:00:14.349> which<00:00:14.469> is<00:00:14.679> going<00:00:14.860> to

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
this batch file here which is going to

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.980 
this batch file here which is going to
get<00:00:15.160> my<00:00:15.309> processors<00:00:15.910> juices<00:00:16.390> flowing<00:00:16.780> because

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
get my processors juices flowing because

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.660 
get my processors juices flowing because
we<00:00:17.260> need<00:00:17.410> enough<00:00:17.590> bits<00:00:17.859> flowing<00:00:18.430> from<00:00:18.550> a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
we need enough bits flowing from a

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.900 
we need enough bits flowing from a
processor<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.240> hack<00:00:20.039> now<00:00:21.039> this<00:00:21.609> is<00:00:21.730> a<00:00:21.760> very

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
processor to hack now this is a very

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.269 
processor to hack now this is a very
essential<00:00:22.420> step<00:00:22.900> if<00:00:23.500> you'd<00:00:23.710> like<00:00:23.890> to<00:00:24.039> do<00:00:24.160> it

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
essential step if you'd like to do it

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.790 
essential step if you'd like to do it
this<00:00:24.429> way<00:00:24.640> same<00:00:24.970> way<00:00:25.090> I<00:00:25.210> did<00:00:25.539> this<00:00:26.199> batch<00:00:26.500> file

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800 
this way same way I did this batch file

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.470 
this way same way I did this batch file
is<00:00:27.099> in<00:00:27.250> the<00:00:27.310> description<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.090> will<00:00:28.210> get<00:00:28.359> your

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
is in the description it will get your

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.060 
is in the description it will get your
processors<00:00:28.990> juices<00:00:29.380> flowing<00:00:29.710> if<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:29.920> can

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
processors juices flowing if you can

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.220 
processors juices flowing if you can
handle<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.670> there<00:00:31.449> you<00:00:31.660> can<00:00:31.720> also<00:00:31.900> do<00:00:32.140> it

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
handle it and there you can also do it

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.869 
handle it and there you can also do it
any<00:00:32.439> other<00:00:32.470> way<00:00:32.650> you'd<00:00:32.890> like<00:00:33.100> that<00:00:33.430> you<00:00:33.700> feel

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
any other way you'd like that you feel

necessary so now let's begin the actual

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.410 
necessary so now let's begin the actual
hacking<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:39.370> let's<00:00:39.489> do<00:00:39.579> some<00:00:39.789> preparations

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
hacking so let's do some preparations

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.770 
and this will come up now what do you do
here<00:01:02.379> well<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.370> need<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.579> IP<00:01:03.789> address<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.660> the

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
here well you need the IP address of the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.980 
here well you need the IP address of the
computer<00:01:04.870> you<00:01:05.410> want<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.680> shut<00:01:05.890> down<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.150> I'm

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
computer you want to shut down so I'm

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.320 
computer you want to shut down so I'm
going<00:01:08.410> to<00:01:08.500> do<00:01:08.620> my<00:01:08.770> vocal<00:01:09.070> IP<00:01:09.400> address<00:01:09.910> which<00:01:10.300> is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
going to do my vocal IP address which is

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.450 
going to do my vocal IP address which is
127<00:01:11.940> 0<00:01:12.940> 0<00:01:13.720> 1<00:01:14.350> which<00:01:14.590> just<00:01:14.620> loops<00:01:14.920> back<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.340> this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
127 0 0 1 which just loops back to this

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.190 
127 0 0 1 which just loops back to this
computer<00:01:15.820> that's<00:01:16.300> good<00:01:16.480> for<00:01:16.630> demonstrations

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
computer that's good for demonstrations

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.620 
computer that's good for demonstrations
so<00:01:18.100> now<00:01:18.810> let's<00:01:19.810> see<00:01:19.990> what<00:01:20.020> am<00:01:20.230> I<00:01:20.290> gonna<00:01:20.440> do

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so now let's see what am I gonna do

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.730 
so now let's see what am I gonna do
shutdown<00:01:23.070> display<00:01:24.070> 1<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:24.460> for<00:01:24.670> 120<00:01:25.420> seconds

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.060 

hacked<00:01:30.420> heart<00:01:31.420> or<00:01:31.890> make<00:01:32.890> tricks

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
hacked heart or make tricks

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.340 
hacked heart or make tricks
alright<00:01:36.070> now<00:01:36.970> normally<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.600> just<00:01:37.630> put<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.170> IP

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
alright now normally you just put the IP

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.750 
alright now normally you just put the IP
address<00:01:38.830> of<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.010> person<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:39.340> want<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.610> shut

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
address of the person you want to shut

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.120 
address of the person you want to shut
down<00:01:39.820> in<00:01:40.180> there<00:01:40.330> not<00:01:40.510> one<00:01:40.920> 27001

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
down in there not one 27001

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.790 
down in there not one 27001
but<00:01:42.760> notice<00:01:43.090> when<00:01:43.330> I<00:01:43.360> press<00:01:43.630> ok<00:01:46.440> I'm<00:01:47.440> about<00:01:47.680> to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
but notice when I press ok I'm about to

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.650 
but notice when I press ok I'm about to
be<00:01:47.890> logged<00:01:48.100> off<00:01:48.280> hacked<00:01:48.580> hardcore<00:01:49.060> matrix<00:01:49.480> now

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
be logged off hacked hardcore matrix now

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.780 
be logged off hacked hardcore matrix now
if<00:01:49.840> you<00:01:49.960> put<00:01:50.200> in<00:01:50.290> somebody<00:01:50.530> else's<00:01:50.860> IP<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.670> hit

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
if you put in somebody else's IP and hit

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.310 
if you put in somebody else's IP and hit
enter<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.480> would<00:01:52.690> come<00:01:52.870> up<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.170> their

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
enter this would come up on their

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.990 
enter this would come up on their
computer<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:53.920> their<00:01:54.220> computer<00:01:54.610> would<00:01:54.760> shut

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
computer and their computer would shut

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.260 
computer and their computer would shut
down<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.450> 120<00:01:56.200> seconds<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.670> that's<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:58.000> end<00:01:58.120> of

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
down in 120 seconds so that's the end of

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.670 
down in 120 seconds so that's the end of
