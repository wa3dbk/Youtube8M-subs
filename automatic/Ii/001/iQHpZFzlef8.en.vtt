Hello there, this is Asahi!

00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.061
Today I'm going to be doing Revlon's monthly video

00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:07.732
Today's product I'll be introducing is this~

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:16.142
It has SPF 30 and PA ++ 

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:27.718
And before I started filming this I got tweets asking whether 
 I was going to do a review on this

00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:32.515
and I thought oh wow! you guys know 
 already! So I was kind of surprised

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:40.443
It was my first time getting tweets before making a video so I'd 
 appreciate it for those who are interested to keep on watching 

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:46.966
Like I said before, this is a CC cream

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:50.014
and I think a lot of you are aware of the BB cream

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:58.127
and to briefly explain the two difference, BB 
 cream stands for Blemish Balm and 

00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:12.021
was made to cover up scars while giving enough coverage 
 and also protecting your skin from UV rays 

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:18.628
as for CC creams, depending on the company they call it 
 differently but for Revlon, it's called the Color Corrector

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:27.444
other companies call it color correcting or color control, correct 
 care, or complete correction and as you can tell

00:01:27.444 --> 00:01:33.258
they all have the initials of CC but there 
 isn't a unified named like the BB cream

00:01:33.258 --> 00:01:38.899
Main ingredient differences includes of moisturising properties, pigments in BB creams compared to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:46.270
moisturising properties, pigments and brightening properties are included in CC creams

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:51.430
Brightening properties give your skin a radiant look and  

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:58.970
tones down visual bumps and lumps with the power of 
 light and gives your skin a glow 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:07.420
I think you can tell the difference of dewy-ness from this swatch. 

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:13.300
It's sort of watery and I think it'll give a very 
 natural look and make your skin look translucent  

00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:23.280
There are 6 properties in this product and is a 
 base, concealer, foundation, UV protection, moisturiser and brightener!

00:02:23.278 --> 00:02:29.050
There are 3 different shades

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.670
And I use the Creamy white that has a pink undertone

00:02:33.668 --> 00:02:36.240
If you are a person with yellow undertone, I would recommend number 2

00:02:36.242 --> 00:02:38.430
Let's apply it!

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:43.260
I've already washed my face and applied necessary lotions 

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.670
I'll firstly apply it to half of my face

00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:53.710
How is it? It glides on like so

00:02:58.676 --> 00:03:04.110
As I said before, it brightens up your 
 face with the power of light 

00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:08.360
Can you see the difference?

00:03:08.357 --> 00:03:11.060
the right side of my face looks more dewy doesn't it

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.530
and because it's dewy, it may look oily but surprisingly 
 it isn't! it's not sticking to my hand

00:03:19.528 --> 00:03:36.760
and the scent.. is like sunscreen but it doesn't smell as strong 
 as when you take it out on your hand 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.740
so I've applied to one side of my face. How is it?

00:03:42.743 --> 00:03:50.000
It's so natural looking that it's hard to tell 
 where I've applied it and where I haven't

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:03.660
The camera may not pick it up but it has concealed my pores 

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:12.540
I wouldn't say that they are fully covered but 
 the blackness around my nostrils are covered enough

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:20.030
If you have really bad bags under your eyes like I 
 do, you'll probably have to apply concealer separately 

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:24.360
I usually only apply concealer under my eyes anyway 

00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:31.920
and I don't try to fully cover up my 
 freckless so I'm pretty happy with the coverage

00:04:31.918 --> 00:04:34.260
I'll just apply some concealer 

00:04:34.257 --> 00:04:37.510
So, now that I've applied concealer now, what do you think?

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:47.810
Because the bags under my eyes are horrible, just by concealing 
 the area, my face looks a lot brighter 

00:04:47.814 --> 00:04:57.190
and I think the finish is so natural that it's hard to 
 tell the difference between the two halves of my face

00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:06.200
I think the dewy-ness looks like straight after applying some lotion 

00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:08.450
I've applied it to the other half of my face too

00:05:08.448 --> 00:05:21.580
I think the pigments have covered up the little trouble 
 spots and the brightener has lightened up my face

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:28.120
For those of you who like this dewy-ness, I think leaving it 
 at here is fine but because I've already applied concealer,

00:05:28.117 --> 00:05:31.870
I'd like to set it with foundation

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:36.230
I'll be using "Absolute Radiance" foundation from the same line

00:05:40.107 --> 00:05:44.580
the color that I am using is 02

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.060
Yay~ I'm done!

00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:02.580
Because of the brightening properties, I think the dewy-ness 
 can still be seen after applying foundation

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.160
So, I hope you got an idea of what the product is like

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:13.280
To sum up, I think the CC cream give 
 a more natural look compared to BB creams

00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:19.710
As you can tell from the video, it's so natural that it's 
 hard to tell whether you have anything on your skin

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:26.960
So if you want to show off your natural skin or 
 prefer light coverage creams, I would recommend this product

00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:37.860
In contrary, if you would like more coverage I would recommend 
 using it as a base before applying your foundation

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:44.170
I think the dewy-ness is very natural and enhances your skin and

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:53.210
 it has SPF of 30 and PA ++ 
 so there is proper UV protection 

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:57.180
For those who are interested, please have a look in stores!

00:06:57.179 --> 00:07:00.420
Well, thank you for watching my video and 
 I'll see you in my next one!

00:07:00.425 --> 00:07:03.640
Bye Bye~!
