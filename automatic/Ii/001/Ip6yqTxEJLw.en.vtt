00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.330
 values to figure out what we could 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.690
 do as an additional item today and gamekings 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.240
 then I had something like that 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.200
 trainees have my car was able 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 but nobody agreed 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.840
 unfortunately so then we went further I think 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.730
 came out of the canvas at football and it 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.830
 is happening this moment 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 suarez natural there last night with them 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 with his weird behavior but then thought 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.650
 we like what we on the internet very often 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.329
 encounter are not videos in which 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.219
 people already with fifa world cup 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.530
 the result of the next match 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.309
 start thinking predict thinking what 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.140
 then 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.239
 of course you also have the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 female for the previous ek 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.379
 Mark Rutte does this year 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.199
 the netherlands for the dutch team but we 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.079
 thought we have here 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.239
 justin bieber or lady and gaga or loan 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.409
 and I am for no different 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.019
 again 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.460
 so the bieber lady ganga are those who 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.360
 two are just working on the bridge call 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.490
 the latter going to let us do it 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.979
 but as you see it is it is it 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.539
 aquarium really very dirty 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.009
 so it must first be cleaned 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.600
 so we are going to clean very nicely 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.890
 that you fill out a little water 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.840
 that is real 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.459
 so they are just fresh in the in 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.380
 the game must sit that they all 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.789
 simply fit over the fishes in 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.319
 the aquarium so that we can look good in it 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.649
 film and then let's just get the fish 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.420
 predict if and how 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.060
 the netherlands playing against mexico wat 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.170
 is going to be mexico is it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.280
 well we will see 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 but first product even something of it 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.840
 crazy body with a retina chip now 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.470
 be outside when you do it and then 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.470
 cheat 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.709
 beautiful plant we own we went 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.690
 do 4 billion I just got you in 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.920
 increasingly he is not looking to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.320
 storm has not completely settled yet 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.209
 that the crawling still has what's around that 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.230
 Impression that you are taking a lot 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.580
 but that's good and you also see the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.959
 flags are not the art and choose 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.030
 lead to that is indeed weird thing 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.340
 now you are going to take two things 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.600
 yes or long is the size of course we 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.470
 have 3 fish 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.830
 justin bieber de andrÃ© the camel justin 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.050
 bieber 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.030
 wild west and bears and congress beer 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.160
 but this from midget limburg 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.170
 with your beamer marie dimension somewhere 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.180
 coffee has actually eaten 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.040
 were hungry he was just there 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.050
 but somewhere between people who 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.510
 somewhere is a plant then we go 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.930
 if we throw the food then it will come 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.720
 yes and what we are going to do is so we are going 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.110
 I first flag him along I put on people 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.060
 play 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.410
 they play like we are playing at home 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.390
 by most can look he is now here 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.950
 that they must go we must say to 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 the middle lure or I think the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.470
 first ferry line that you conquer 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.570
 yes, then good that there is now throwing in 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.790
 then 5 piece of the netherlands is loud 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.890
 have to be here you started two ideas 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.040
 are you here my bieber 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.410
 do you want the two tufts in yes and then 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.750
 to the ones who go chances 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.459
 whoever wins from that is it that is with can 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.580
 do not want otherwise 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.140
 so let me say yes 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.940
 compact here also your shape and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.920
 dress ducklings because they have to 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.780
 sit a bit in the middle no it is 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.440
 it is also a film so it is not me 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.020
 that is my experience is more picking though 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.060
 look again look they are the pains 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.600
 i would do now i will do now o no o 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.670
 No 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.370
 do you know what there are no arguments 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.230
 first guitar here it is draw 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.520

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.540
 he works he doesn't do anything yet 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.060
 you now go with the company that the 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.130
 plants to say I think it is 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.990
 the same game well I think the pain hurts that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.160
 go and decide okay what to wait 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.299
 grabbed a dredge until a big stroke 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.850
 listener again 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.400
 no no keep living and go to mexico 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.710
 yes well then don't really know 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.240
 she was the first to sit this way gloomy 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.250
 yes it's so stupid 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.250

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.580
 bieber way for him no he look now 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.000
 now it's on this 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.730
 you can't go that tie either 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.650
 lifting practice anyway my right 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.700
 decisions bieber is so to speak 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.980
 types of extension 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.650
 but the arrows that little animal like 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.320
 touch and is now behind me now 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.800
 here the things in 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.180
 go see you see it is this one 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.560
 side 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.560
 I could look right shit he should 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.660
 I finish all my ideas that stays 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.870
 just on the bottom there just tastes 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.790
 that's why it still lives because now 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.560
 they nevertheless take full seriously Netherlands 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.390
 maybe it was a goal 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.320
 Zero prediction any well then there was 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:27.980
 then it was 112 and see two and half full 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:30.630
 and 6 6042 yes then I must be okay well 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.160
 that i was fingered like a lady 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:37.170
 ganga 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.400
 no no no I think it is 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.540
 clear it is now clear 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.400
 it is absolutely true that you have one again 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.400
 second half rifle in the second half 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.470
 I think that goes in my village belt again 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.490
 how nice this i hope it came true 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.050
 the can again next time 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.050
