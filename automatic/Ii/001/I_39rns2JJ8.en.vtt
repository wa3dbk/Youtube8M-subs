was going to let my wicked hood um to
make<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:20.880> look<00:00:21.000> nicer<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.720> then<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.260> about

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
make it look nicer and then I was about

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.720 
make it look nicer and then I was about
to<00:00:22.560> buy<00:00:22.650> an<00:00:22.710> elemental<00:00:23.130> talisman<00:00:23.580> because

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
to buy an elemental talisman because

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.769 
to buy an elemental talisman because
that's<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:23.939> only<00:00:24.000> thing<00:00:24.210> that's<00:00:24.420> not

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
that's the only thing that's not

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.279 
that's the only thing that's not
actually<00:00:25.050> marked<00:00:25.650> inside<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.430> figured<00:00:27.300> if<00:00:28.170> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
actually marked inside I figured if I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.110 
actually marked inside I figured if I
shove<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:30.080> won't<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:32.450> become

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
shove one in there then won't it become

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.100 
shove one in there then won't it become
when<00:00:36.120> they<00:00:36.270> get<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.540> tiny<00:00:36.840> bit<00:00:37.020> of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
when they get like tiny bit of

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.630 
when they get like tiny bit of
runecrafting<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.829> XP<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.190> I'm<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.430> why<00:00:38.610> not

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
runecrafting the XP so I'm like why not

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.660 
runecrafting the XP so I'm like why not
and<00:00:39.110> then<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> realized<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.829> these<00:00:41.129> elemental

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and then I realized that these elemental

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.319 
and then I realized that these elemental
thousands<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.500> this<00:00:43.500> much<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.850> it's<00:00:45.120> around

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
thousands are this much so it's around

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.240 
thousands are this much so it's around
one<00:00:45.539> two<00:00:45.719> three<00:00:45.989> mil<00:00:46.140> per<00:00:46.379> hour<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.010> killed

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
one two three mil per hour if you killed

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.090 
one two three mil per hour if you killed
leeches<00:00:47.789> um<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.649> good<00:00:49.770> spot

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
leeches um this is a really good spot

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
leeches um this is a really good spot
there<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.340> probably<00:00:50.579> many<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:51.000> good<00:00:51.180> spots

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
there are probably many other good spots

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
there are probably many other good spots
in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> abyss<00:00:52.079> um<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.559> don't<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> go<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in the abyss um you don't want to go to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
in the abyss um you don't want to go to
the<00:00:53.399> other<00:00:53.520> abyss<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.600> won't<00:00:54.870> tell<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the other abyss and I won't tell you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.130 
the other abyss and I won't tell you
guys<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> requirements<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.219> abyss

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
guys the requirements for this abyss

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
guys the requirements for this abyss
also<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.739> cannon<00:00:59.129> here<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.820> know

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
also you can cannon here I don't know

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
also you can cannon here I don't know
the<00:01:00.090> cash<00:01:00.420> per<00:01:00.660> hour<00:01:00.780> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> moment<00:01:01.410> with

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the cash per hour at the moment with

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
the cash per hour at the moment with
cannoning<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.370> probably<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> be

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
cannoning it's probably going to be

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.910 
cannoning it's probably going to be
faster<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.049> you'll<00:01:04.260> kill<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> them

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
faster because you'll kill all of them

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.030 
faster because you'll kill all of them
extremely<00:01:05.280> fast<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> second<00:01:06.240> they<00:01:06.330> spawn

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
extremely fast the second they spawn

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
extremely fast the second they spawn
because<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:08.729> want<00:01:08.939> won't<00:01:09.180> recommend

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
because I really want won't recommend

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
because I really want won't recommend
killing<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> walkers<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.560> right<00:01:10.710> now

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.170 
killing the walkers but right now
they're<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.189> unaggressive<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.030> because

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
they're all unaggressive to me because

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.240 
they're all unaggressive to me because
I've<00:01:12.450> been<00:01:12.659> sitting<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:13.229> rewatching<00:01:14.070> the

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
aggressive on you at high levels are the

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.650 
aggressive on you at high levels are the
walkers<00:03:50.060> because<00:03:51.060> how<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.360> find<00:03:51.570> out

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
walkers because how you find out

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.660 
walkers because how you find out
something<00:03:51.840> aggressive<00:03:52.200> as<00:03:52.470> if<00:03:53.280> something<00:03:53.550> is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
something aggressive as if something is

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.600 
something aggressive as if something is
aggressive<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.390> I'm<00:03:54.570> you<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:55.860> to<00:03:55.890> click

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
aggressive on you I'm you have to click

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.210 
aggressive on you I'm you have to click
on<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.880> level<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:01.440> have<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.770> multiply

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
on the level and you have to multiply

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.530 
on the level and you have to multiply
that<00:04:02.370> by<00:04:02.430> two<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.500> would<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.710> 1<00:04:05.220> 18<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.910> +1

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
that by two so this would be 1 18 and +1

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.140 
that by two so this would be 1 18 and +1
so<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:07.500> you're<00:04:07.620> 119<00:04:08.010> plus<00:04:08.490> combat<00:04:08.940> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
so if you're 119 plus combat the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
so if you're 119 plus combat the
Guardians<00:04:09.810> won't<00:04:10.020> be<00:04:10.140> aggressive<00:04:10.590> but<00:04:11.040> after
