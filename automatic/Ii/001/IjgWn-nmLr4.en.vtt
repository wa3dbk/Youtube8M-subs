00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 what makes a good team 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.269
 in my opinion it's the character coach 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.650
 joy and calm that you have for 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.700
 face an event because after 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.780
 when has good players you have good 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 players and bets has good players 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.770
 it is absolutely undeniable the cfl at the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.820
 natural basis of a good team that's 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 to have good players they have them 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.939
 afterwards to go to the top is the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.350
 calm that time when you're in a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 great appointment and the character you 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.170
 there is an image that is who is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.420
 important 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.630
 in my opinion that's when it said 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.740
 marc the faces of the guys the face of the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.090
 life said who has always you know he has 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.340
 always his species a little smile 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 on the face there when he notices that he 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.730
 is very he is very brave with whom 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.379
 scream these are in the arms we have 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.670
 the impression that there is a real strength to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.210
 that moment a real character that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.829
 appears 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.910
 for those who would doubt because 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.440
 finally have never seen them at this 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.629
 level and then after the rest as you 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.579
 said even defending low enough he 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.899
 was still pretty quiet 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.160
 only thing maybe it's defending 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.300
 the risk is you can commit 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.440
 a lot of mistakes that give shots 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 francs and free kicks good ben voila 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.690
 when there is no solution in the game this 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.109
 are the set pieces that are 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.579
 can help 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.350
 that's what happened at the end of the match 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.660
 I think that you think of his hand and in 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.369
 down but even on free kicks he 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.470
 was this reign anyway that's why 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.090
 that it's better to defend this time 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.210
 to happen is this way to defend 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.040
 gosh halimi had actually but they 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.900
 much more than serenity 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.820
 that is to say that now you have a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.009
 paris sg team handing daniel where we 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.000
 used to kick us them and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.340
 big french teams to jacques 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 bencik spent the quarter-finals at 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
 bravo it's exceptional you feel that I 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 told him at ibrahimovic the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.350
 goals of the big clubs it's not about 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.530
 past is to win the title 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.420
 that's the goal is won the fina la 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.070
 champion 6th his goal for these 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.509
 grain gamers it's not about being in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.909
 eighth quarterfinals you think that 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 we were waiting for that today it's 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.090
 win the champions league two 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.409
 shapes in their heads it's from elsewhere 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 this not to set limits these guys 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.780
 there when if you say there it's just 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.670
 a revolution in French football 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.829
 you are aware of his series the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.720
 parenting to gif it's a revolution 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.070
 for la baule france is the mentality of 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.570
 those now I'm not able to 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.670
 do it I'm not telling you they 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.079
 will do it now 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.240
 baba for me I said I had never 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.860
 I had an image I was saying when he 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.210
 play there 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.240
 the league 1 the paris saint-germain they 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.100
 are here at the aperitif 21 long aperitif or 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.420
 the daily bread if you prefer and the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.730
 champions league ben here they have 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 started a meal they are at the entrance he 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.440
 are in this team there guys who have 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.910
 the level to aim very high that this 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.820
 either in Paris or in other clubs 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.700
 after that will go through a big collective 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.440
 from experience maybe not from this 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.940
 year of great results maybe that 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.890
 it will be next year but the goal 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.800
 is to sit at the table with the big ones 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.870
 the goal is to get into the box 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.240
 night is to go in the vip square and 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.650
 big teams for now 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.050
 for now we do not have the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.540
 boss by his first name but they have 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.010
 they have access they blew the idea to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.010
 the nightclub of the great europe
