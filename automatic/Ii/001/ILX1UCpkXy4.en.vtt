than<00:01:07.409> my<00:01:07.650> PC<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.400> we're<00:01:09.390> gonna<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.630> ahead<00:01:09.689> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
than my PC but we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.749 
than my PC but we're gonna go ahead and
try<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> Arctic<00:01:10.469> cooling<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.340> next<00:01:11.579> step

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
try the Arctic cooling so the next step

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.950 
try the Arctic cooling so the next step
will<00:01:11.939> be<00:01:11.969> installing<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:14.539> okay<00:01:15.539> so<00:01:15.600> there's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
will be installing it okay so there's

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.770 
will be installing it okay so there's

all<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.550> memory<00:02:16.820> chips<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.300> get<00:02:17.450> hot

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
all the memory chips that get hot

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.930 
all the memory chips that get hot
they'll<00:02:18.380> have<00:02:18.590> pads<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.280> them<00:02:19.370> they<00:02:19.490> had<00:02:19.640> pads

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
they'll have pads on them they had pads

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.260 
they'll have pads on them they had pads
on<00:02:20.210> them<00:02:20.360> I'll<00:02:20.450> put<00:02:20.600> more<00:02:20.750> pads<00:02:21.020> on<00:02:21.230> them<00:02:22.270> for

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
on them I'll put more pads on them for

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.050 
on them I'll put more pads on them for
the<00:02:23.360> new<00:02:23.510> stuff<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.490> that's<00:02:25.490> about<00:02:25.640> it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
the new stuff and that's about it

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.590 
the new stuff and that's about it
so<00:02:27.460> next<00:02:28.460> step<00:02:28.670> should<00:02:29.360> be<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.580> seeing<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
so next step should be you seeing the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.160 
so next step should be you seeing the
device<00:02:33.350> on<00:02:33.590> there<00:02:33.770> I'm<00:02:34.160> gonna<00:02:34.280> use<00:02:34.460> my<00:02:34.640> trusty

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
device on there I'm gonna use my trusty

all the card pad and card thermal grease

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.370 
all the card pad and card thermal grease
and<00:02:45.440> then<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.460> will<00:02:46.880> put<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.330> new<00:02:47.450> car<00:02:47.630> cooler

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and then I will put the new car cooler

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.940 
and then I will put the new car cooler
on<00:02:48.560> some<00:02:48.950> Arctic<00:02:49.280> cooling<00:02:50.170> okay<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.710> 90

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
on some Arctic cooling okay so the 90

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.770 
on some Arctic cooling okay so the 90
proof<00:02:52.100> alcohol<00:02:52.700> wasn't<00:02:53.000> really<00:02:53.420> getting<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
proof alcohol wasn't really getting the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.380 
proof alcohol wasn't really getting the
job<00:02:54.020> done<00:02:54.050> so<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.010> went<00:02:55.130> ahead<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.310> used<00:02:55.460> Arctic

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
job done so I went ahead and used Arctic

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.950 
job done so I went ahead and used Arctic
clean<00:02:57.520> thermal<00:02:58.520> material<00:02:58.640> remover<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.510> then

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
clean thermal material remover and then

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.630 
clean thermal material remover and then
I'll<00:03:00.230> later<00:03:00.620> use<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.070> Arctic<00:03:01.490> clean<00:03:02.260> thermal

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
I'll later use the Arctic clean thermal

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
I'll later use the Arctic clean thermal
surface<00:03:04.640> purifier<00:03:05.500> before<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.560> go<00:03:06.740> ahead<00:03:06.800> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
surface purifier before I go ahead and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.560 
surface purifier before I go ahead and
proceed<00:03:07.160> with<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.580> next<00:03:07.610> step<00:03:07.850> of<00:03:08.120> attaching

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
proceed with the next step of attaching

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.520 
proceed with the next step of attaching
the<00:03:08.750> new<00:03:09.670> Arctic<00:03:10.670> cool<00:03:11.620> twin<00:03:12.620> turbo<00:03:12.980> cooler

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
these four they come in a strip like

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.740 
these four they come in a strip like
those<00:03:59.860> two<00:04:00.070> at<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> top<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.640> bottom<00:04:00.970> however

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
those two at the top and bottom however

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.870 
those two at the top and bottom however
the<00:04:02.080> strip<00:04:02.320> is<00:04:02.440> still<00:04:02.590> attached<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.280> you've

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
the strip is still attached and you've

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.530 
the strip is still attached and you've
basically<00:04:04.150> got<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:04.720> remove<00:04:05.220> both<00:04:06.330> sets<00:04:07.330> of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
basically got to remove both sets of

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.810 
basically got to remove both sets of
plastic<00:04:08.440> from<00:04:08.710> the<00:04:08.890> front<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.370> back<00:04:09.400> and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
plastic from the front and the back and

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.400 
plastic from the front and the back and
then<00:04:10.390> kind<00:04:10.630> of<00:04:10.720> separate<00:04:11.050> them<00:04:11.140> with<00:04:11.260> your

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
then kind of separate them with your

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.800 
then kind of separate them with your
fingers<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.980> put<00:04:12.160> them<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.340> place<00:04:12.610> so<00:04:13.210> the<00:04:13.630> best

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
fingers to put them in place so the best

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.030 
fingers to put them in place so the best
bet<00:04:14.020> there<00:04:14.230> would<00:04:14.410> be<00:04:14.440> to<00:04:14.620> use<00:04:14.740> something<00:04:14.920> like

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
bet there would be to use something like

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.660 
bet there would be to use something like
nitrile<00:04:15.580> gloves<00:04:16.920> next<00:04:17.920> step<00:04:18.100> is<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.400> go<00:04:18.489> ahead

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
nitrile gloves next step is to go ahead

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.170 
nitrile gloves next step is to go ahead
and<00:04:18.790> put<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.060> on<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> card<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:21.700> is<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
and put it on the card that is the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.360 
and put it on the card that is the
finished<00:04:22.480> product<00:04:22.920> it's<00:04:23.920> about<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.190> same

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
finished product it's about the same

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.710 
finished product it's about the same
weight<00:04:24.640> as<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.900> existing<00:04:27.390> heatsink<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.600> fan

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
weight as the existing heatsink and fan

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.440 
weight as the existing heatsink and fan
assembly<00:04:29.170> was<00:04:29.640> turned<00:04:30.640> over<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:31.030> still<00:04:31.240> use

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
assembly was turned over you still use

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.440 
assembly was turned over you still use
the<00:04:31.950> OEM<00:04:32.950> backing<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.820> make<00:04:34.180> sure<00:04:34.330> you're

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
the OEM backing so make sure you're

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.290

cooling that was all those pads that we

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.159 
cooling that was all those pads that we
had<00:05:23.830> to<00:05:23.890> put<00:05:24.040> on<00:05:24.160> on<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.610> front<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.120> the<00:05:25.990> ones

had to put on on the front and the ones

so there's the finished product we'll

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.640 
so there's the finished product we'll
take<00:05:30.070> it<00:05:30.190> around<00:05:30.310> and<00:05:31.260> we'll<00:05:32.260> go<00:05:32.380> ahead<00:05:32.560> and

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
take it around and we'll go ahead and

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.040 
take it around and we'll go ahead and
put<00:05:32.830> in<00:05:33.130> have<00:05:33.310> monster<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.240> the<00:05:34.330> case<00:05:34.570> which<00:05:34.870> is

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
put in have monster of the case which is

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.250 
put in have monster of the case which is
insane<00:05:35.700> but<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.760> do<00:05:37.180> like<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.750> case<00:05:37.960> for<00:05:38.200> the

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
insane but I do like the case for the

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.960 
insane but I do like the case for the
simple<00:05:38.560> fact<00:05:38.590> that<00:05:39.010> if<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.370> look<00:05:39.580> at<00:05:39.730> it<00:05:39.850> it's

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
simple fact that if you look at it it's

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.000 
simple fact that if you look at it it's
it's<00:05:40.300> pretty<00:05:40.540> clean<00:05:40.840> in<00:05:40.870> there<00:05:41.200> and<00:05:41.919> that's

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
it's pretty clean in there and that's

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.900 
it's pretty clean in there and that's
what<00:05:42.220> you<00:05:42.340> get<00:05:42.460> when<00:05:42.640> you<00:05:42.760> get<00:05:42.850> a<00:05:43.110> ATX<00:05:44.130> XL<00:05:45.130> case

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
what you get when you get a ATX XL case

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.240 
what you get when you get a ATX XL case
which<00:05:46.360> is<00:05:46.539> what<00:05:46.780> this<00:05:46.900> is

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:48.250 
which is what this is

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.040 
which is what this is
unfortunately<00:05:49.150> I<00:05:49.210> didn't<00:05:49.479> know<00:05:49.599> that<00:05:49.719> the<00:05:49.870> Big

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
unfortunately I didn't know that the Big

unfortunately I didn't know that the Big
Bang<00:05:50.080> Marshall<00:05:51.150> required<00:05:52.150> an<00:05:52.300> excel<00:05:52.659> case<00:05:52.870> but

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
Bang Marshall required an excel case but

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.520 
Bang Marshall required an excel case but
it<00:05:53.319> did<00:05:53.819> so<00:05:54.819> I<00:05:55.300> had<00:05:55.629> to<00:05:55.719> cut<00:05:55.990> head<00:05:56.169> and<00:05:56.289> get<00:05:56.439> an

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
it did so I had to cut head and get an

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.589 
it did so I had to cut head and get an
EXO<00:05:56.830> case<00:05:57.039> we'll<00:05:57.939> go<00:05:58.030> ahead<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:58.360> plug<00:05:58.569> this
