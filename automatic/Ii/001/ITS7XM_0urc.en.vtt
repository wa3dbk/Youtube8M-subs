00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 but hello to all and so in this 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.420
 video i will present you a tweet 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.490
 which is called camille thain donkament 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.950
 time is a timer so for 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 camera and video so everything 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.500
 first can program the second 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.779
 so if you want to delay your 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.590
 five-second camera before 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.590
 take the picture 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.560
 So that's where suppose if you want 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.130
 ask your device well you place 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.019
 and take the picture it is very useful 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.690
 so first of all it will have to go in 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.960
 so cydia loading the canine canine 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.300
 times and free 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.879
 she is available it seems to me on the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.100
 source of big boss so for free 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.800
 so the application is fine because 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.059
 that I did not know it existed and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.980
 frankly I find it not bad so there 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.760
 we wait do not know why my 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.879
 iphone it's nothing a little but we're going 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.879
 expect 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.270
 so here amstein so it's amd 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.820
 ime so you have it installed confirmed 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.549
 and then it's going to ask for a respring so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.189
 your device 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.750
 so after doing that you 'll have 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.759
 nothing in nice settings we will not have 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.090
 no application what will go there 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.600
 in camera and you can see 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 that down there is a kind of clock 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.829
 like that so their age or clicked 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.520
 on it then there you select some 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.180
 second 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.450
 admit did not want selected too 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.290
 long this second so is 7 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:56.520
 and then you do ok and here we can 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.820
 see a second 5 4 3 and there it is at 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.159
 take the picture 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.070
 here and after we can see that the photo 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.530
 was taken and stolen 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.110
 frankly I find that very very well 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.520
 what it is very useful sometimes we go 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.600
 to take pictures is all alone but 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.360
 arrives 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.690
 now we have plenty of time to place ourselves 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.420
 all that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.510
 so thanks for watching the video so 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.620
 you have presented range time which port 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.000
 your device so iphone ipad ipod 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.660
 touch for in itself saying you have to have 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.360
 a camera 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.360
