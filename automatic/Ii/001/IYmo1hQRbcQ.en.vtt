00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
there we go at the end the wave that the

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.999 
there we go at the end the wave that the
easy<00:01:03.320> way<00:01:06.280> so<00:01:07.280> what<00:01:07.670> is<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:07.939> this<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:09.009> 1510

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
easy way so what is this this is 1510

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.700 
easy way so what is this this is 1510
dot<00:01:10.460> 2<00:01:10.759> is<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.119> update<00:01:11.539> we're<00:01:11.719> in<00:01:11.869> as<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.560> me

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
dot 2 is the update we're in as of me

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.989 
dot 2 is the update we're in as of me
making<00:01:13.159> this<00:01:13.429> video<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.950> now<00:01:15.979> mastery<00:01:16.579> rank<00:01:16.729> 18

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
making this video so now mastery rank 18

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:21.270 
making this video so now mastery rank 18
is<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.899> defense<00:01:18.380> mission<00:01:18.829> against<00:01:19.460> the<00:01:19.609> corpus

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
is a defense mission against the corpus

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.539 
is a defense mission against the corpus
26<00:01:22.359> 25<00:01:23.359> 26<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:24.200> somewhere<00:01:24.469> between<00:01:24.530> 25<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.219> 30

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
26 25 26 so somewhere between 25 to 30

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.179 
26 25 26 so somewhere between 25 to 30
is<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.880> ranking<00:01:26.240> levels<00:01:26.569> in<00:01:27.109> terms<00:01:27.829> of<00:01:28.039> the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
is the ranking levels in terms of the

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.989 
is the ranking levels in terms of the
corpus<00:01:30.369> obviously<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.459> can<00:01:31.579> see<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.819> crop

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
corpus obviously you can see the crop

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.620 
corpus obviously you can see the crop
adds<00:01:32.270> up<00:01:32.569> in<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.789> elevated<00:01:34.789> areas<00:01:35.179> so<00:01:35.389> it's<00:01:35.569> a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
adds up in the elevated areas so it's a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.629 
adds up in the elevated areas so it's a
little<00:01:35.899> more<00:01:36.200> secure<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.950> wouldn't<00:01:37.280> say<00:01:37.459> it's

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
little more secure I wouldn't say it's

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:45.640 
little more secure I wouldn't say it's
entirely<00:01:37.999> secure<00:01:40.600> at<00:01:41.600> all

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.830 

I<00:01:46.240> wouldn't<00:01:47.240> say<00:01:47.390> that<00:01:47.420> they've<00:01:47.660> done

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
I wouldn't say that they've done

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.540 
I wouldn't say that they've done
anything<00:01:48.110> other<00:01:48.380> than<00:01:48.620> design<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.310> so<00:01:49.340> it

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
anything other than design it so it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.600 
anything other than design it so it
doesn't<00:01:49.580> fail<00:01:50.090> but<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.920> know<00:01:52.010> unless<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.460> do

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
doesn't fail but you know unless you do

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.900 
doesn't fail but you know unless you do
stupid<00:01:52.820> things<00:01:53.350> which<00:01:54.350> i'm<00:01:55.250> sure<00:01:55.310> i<00:01:55.490> can<00:01:55.670> do

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
stupid things which i'm sure i can do

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.800 
stupid things which i'm sure i can do
stupid<00:01:56.150> things<00:01:56.300> okay<00:01:57.040> wave<00:01:58.040> 2<00:01:58.250> is<00:01:58.430> completed

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.340 

this<00:02:02.810> shouldn't<00:02:03.110> be<00:02:03.170> too<00:02:03.230> horrible<00:02:05.290> now<00:02:06.290> you

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
this shouldn't be too horrible now you

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.810 
this shouldn't be too horrible now you
don't<00:02:06.530> get<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:06.770> bring<00:02:06.920> your<00:02:07.040> Sentinel<00:02:07.460> or<00:02:07.640> crew

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
don't get to bring your Sentinel or crew

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.749 
don't get to bring your Sentinel or crew
bros<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:09.110> obviously<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.800> removed<00:02:10.369> from<00:02:10.580> this

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
bros that obviously is removed from this

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.570 
bros that obviously is removed from this
so<00:02:11.030> it's<00:02:11.180> just<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.570> and<00:02:11.830> them<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:13.130> that's<00:02:13.310> all

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
so it's just you and them and that's all

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.490 
so it's just you and them and that's all
it<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:14.620> nothing<00:02:15.620> else<00:02:16.210> you<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.480> them

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500 

little<00:02:22.500> smite<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.010> fusion<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.790> not<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.390> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
little smite and fusion here not that it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.820 
little smite and fusion here not that it
matters<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.110> don't<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> teammate

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
matters because I don't have a teammate

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.820 
matters because I don't have a teammate
with<00:02:25.890> me<00:02:26.269> but<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.299> still<00:02:27.690> does<00:02:27.870> its<00:02:28.080> job<00:02:28.319> I

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.130 

actually<00:02:34.830> don't<00:02:35.129> like<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.580> angles<00:02:36.019> makes<00:02:37.019> it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
actually don't like the angles makes it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.259 
actually don't like the angles makes it
harder<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> shoot<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.890> enemies<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.090> while

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
harder to shoot the enemies so while

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.050 
harder to shoot the enemies so while
it's<00:02:42.510> better<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.959> protect<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.410> cryo<00:02:43.650> pod

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
it's better to protect the cryo pod

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.400 
it's better to protect the cryo pod
makes<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.269> harder<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.569> see<00:02:45.840> them<00:02:46.049> to<00:02:46.230> shoot

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
makes it harder to see them to shoot

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.130 
makes it harder to see them to shoot
