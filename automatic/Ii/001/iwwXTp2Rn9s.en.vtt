00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.510
 tell me that story as I conceived it 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.629
 You gave me how the recipe was born if I lived 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.059
 with my grandparents from 8 months 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.150
 of the city until they died 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.040
 that an injury I was about 12 years old and 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.240
 when my grandmother passed away I had already 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.190
 about 15 years and something 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.860
 the relationship with my grandmother was very good 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.440
 very direct 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.630
 she was a wonderful lady I always 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 I was so close to her that never 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.400
 grandma said it was always mom and a little 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.980
 she dreamed that when I studied was 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.900
 great that she was no longer me 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.000
 I could follow the principles of her I 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.920
 I learned that recipe from my grandmother looking 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.479
 what she did after she 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.150
 he gave interest and that he was always 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.250
 pegadito of her in doing what she imitates 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.410
 what she did then she started to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.620
 explain some steps of the recipe and 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:25.800
 Once I was growing up, it started 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.170
 imitate already helping for a little while 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.540
 could move a cauldron another 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.180
 At the moment I could hit some vegetables in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 that time my grandmother used to 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.570
 first he served it in the cazuelitas 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.090
 below then he was doing it too 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.490
 some higüerito 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.030
 this serves with a source and already what 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.060
 served the comment that said look that 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.280
 he did not like he was very excited 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.530
 consuming and some missed a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.899
 word how do you hear this is very good 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.240
 this resurrects woman I the possible then 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.819
 put to see being 13 years old because it was 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.039
 when I decided that I thought I was already 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.740
 ready to do it I remember from 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.220
 that first time that I felt with 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.830
 a lot of assurance that you were 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.080
 although it happens that half way 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.120
 I had later with as I progressed 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 the question of whether it would not look good or not 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.590
 I was going to look good but she told me 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.260
 that you passed the test I always kept the 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.320
 same original recipe my grandmother the cia 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.500
 in coal we did not have stove in addition to 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.380
 that she used the normal milk that is the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.650
 that was always used I changed then 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.930
 I put the evaporated milk rich that I 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.020
 I would do with this prize 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.570
 many things many things about that 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.420
 if I would buy something that fits me 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.980
 memory of that event and that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.860
 consume it in so many things that always 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.830
 does not have travel is good the truth is that 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.840
 I loved your story super interesting 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.210
 Very tender very tender multi I loved it 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.280
 but now you need to start 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.380
 teach me to see how you prepare that 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.870
 recipe and of course there is the best part that 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.870
 I try it so we go that 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.510
 we fry the onion cut in with coffee 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.410
 in olive oil until 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.410
 make itself transparent 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:30.010
 add the mashed garlic without letting it burn 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:34.349
 then the anise the malagueta 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.349
 the carrot cut in ulna 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:43.430
 wide cilantro 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:46.319
 the flame also cut in cubes 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.689
 screw 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.230
 and a quarter of pepper cut in 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.230
 contrast 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.490
 sauté for a minute and add the broth 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.860
 of chicken and salt 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.940
 i 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.280
 when it boils we lower the fire and then 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.350
 when they talk about the carrot and the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:15.710
 flame when removing from the fire and refresh 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.950
 then liquefy it strain it and bring 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.769
 new to the fire and at this step we add the 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.850
 malagueta the remaining pepper quarter 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:28.360
 cut into wine and mushrooms 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.360
 cut too 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.879
 add rich evaporated milk 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:40.010
 to readjust the salt 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.570
 lower the fire and move for several 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.570
 minutes to thicken 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.370
 optional we could put a little bit of 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.840
 parmesan and decorate with leaf of 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.900
 parsley 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.720
 I would like the tradition to continue 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.889
 of the consume in the family and I think about it 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.530
 do through niece 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.129
 the value it has for me is to keep 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.860
 that family tradition is to remember me 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:11.229
 Grandma that I loved so much, she was the one 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.999
 formed by doing it makes me feel good 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:15.420
 although sometimes I get a little 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.820
 melancholy 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.040
 then I detect consumed wonder of 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.370
 flavor with milk 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.720

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.490
 and decide if it is worthy or not of a 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.490
 put in the competition 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.540
