 stopping non-member services 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.190
 the command syntax is pretty simple 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.410
 you just need to get acquainted with it 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.100

 system used command no start 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.459
 when you run net start without

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:49.510

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.880

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:27.380
 as you can see the service has been successfully launched for 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.320
 suspending system services 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.010
 serves as a pause command for example for 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.870
 suspension of service 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:44.110
 secondary login is necessary 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:44.110
 drive a gun no pauses seek a gun years 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.770

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.440
 start a suspended service 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.050
 a cantina command is already applied 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:13.990
 let's start the service 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:13.990
 secondary login system back yo and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.440
 of the year 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.680
 the service worked successfully resumed as 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.600
 see for quick service management 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.980
 through the command line you need to know them 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.630
 abbreviated name because full 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.510
 service name consist of two or more 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.660
 his words in this case the case is necessary 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.970
 sound straight quotes this option is not 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.760
 very convenient for work 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.130
 system administrators therefore 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.340
 I suggest you write or remember 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.280
