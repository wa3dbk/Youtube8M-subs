00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.810
 Manchester City has been crowned 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.639
 England champion his hand a 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.490
 Chilean technician Manuel Pellegrini with a 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.849
 only English player among the holders 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.670
 habitual has got the second 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.279
 title in its history won well at 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.140
 west ham by 2 to 0 on a last date 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.480
 sir that had a lot at stake because the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.110
 citi had to tie or win to be 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.579
 champion but also the liverpool 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.040
 I expected a miracle that never happened in 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.690
 the etihad court well the city 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.300
 free champion pretty well I stayed 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.860
 bandes is a team that came out to propose 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.870
 to a team that one went out to look for the 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.730
 championship for me there was not a single 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.340
 team more more than the machete inside 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.740
 the field a team that knew how to maintain the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.560
 calm the patience of how to get there 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.200
 did not rush and the first play of 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.600
 Goal reached through a shot 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.150
 stationary until the 43rd minute it does not 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.920
 opened the score in the etihad the 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.160
 reality is that it was never close the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.960
 west ham but neither near the leave area 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.880
 the question is what was going on 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.680
 simultaneously in anfield with 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.340
 liverpool and no good case began 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.020
 to paddle 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.399
 the current already in the boot 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.829
 of the party manolo gave way but 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.750
 obviously about 19 minutes the 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.789
 goal against martinez cartel 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.859
 down to the liverpool team and 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.200
 obviously his slight hopes 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.579
 they are practically buried and I hope 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.679
 something that caught my attention was 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.270
 since the liverpool left to warm up 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.250
 I saw the faces of the players and 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.319
 totally disillusioned as I already 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.659
 they had lost everything and good they started 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.090
 they lost losing they went around the 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.500
 score by two free throws there are very 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.179
 good of gerard but a match 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.489
 really bad deliver porthole by 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.920
 yes the task was practically impossible 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:46.659
 I had to wait for a tie in ethics 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.310
 they would have to score 13 goals liverpool 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.079
 to approach what was the reaction of the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.209
 liverpool players and the people at 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.829
 end of the game nothing resignation the 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.560
 people evidently supporting the team 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.299
 of liverpool manolo but the face of the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.340
 tribune was also reflected in the 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.289
 court were sad and inclusive 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.049
 when they score the equalizer goal and the 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.149
 I won not even hug and they went to see the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.590
 ball and they were total that carry 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.140
 prizes that you already depend on 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.000
 result and a result that also 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.370
 I had 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.140
 that was a bit illogical but good as 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.330
 I said in football this does not end until 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.730
 that it's over there was no lack of 90 minutes 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.500
 it seems that you are also a player 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.780
 you have to be very conscious and in the end 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.640
 of accounts the tie of that incredible 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.790
 draw of a game of liverpool won 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.530
 3 to 0 and finish matching 3 to 3 in 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.690
 the last quarter of the game is not the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.370
 that ends up costing in the title because 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.860
 definitely still winning that 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.510
 I find today he liverpool was going to have 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.880
 what to expect a defeat of manchester 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.610
 city- say that liverpool loses the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 local title were phil versus chelsea 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.750
 without finishing Luis Suarez doing the 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.760
 scorer let's say on the platform 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.310
 general with 31 goals as the best 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.810
 player of the season finishes champion 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 the Manchester City from the hand of a 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.830
 technical also South American the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.570
