00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.719
 Mai together today I'll do one 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.150
 video about flavor enhancer me 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.160
 Nobody wants to explain you what 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.830
 he became so much like a flavor enhancer 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.050
 separate it and there what a man 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.300
 flavor enhancers still in a product 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.800
 may bring and yes the risks or whether 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.600
 it risks ever arrive 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.560
 There are flavor enhancers he has 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.369
 I thought I'll show you one of the times 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 best known products the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.699
 Flavor enhancers contain that for 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 Here, for example, the clear chickens per year 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.809
 we'll look at it from magic 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.250
 on the ingredients 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.409
 flavor enhancers are used 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 of course, like dynamic ones 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.909
 Strengthening taste that's how it looks 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.729
 things like potatoes and cereals 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.049
 which is then fermented and 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:59.369
 the final result is a 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.260
 flavor enhancer so will be so 

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.710
 added to the products for example 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.810
 among other things powdered are mostly 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.650
 then this powder consists of spices 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.620
 and so on and often optical things 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 and things like herbal spices and stuff 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:20.490
 further and sometimes the powder exists 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 also from almost nothing except salt and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 flavor enhancer so we end up 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.890
 actually a total useless 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.470
 eat food in 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 flavor enhancer glutamate glutamate 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.370
 in itself is also tomatoes in mushrooms and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.800
 in parmesan but new little ones 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.100
 basin and if we are tomatoes for example 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.810
 Eating or eating mushrooms that makes you 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.460
 nothing to feel that not in the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.420
 body 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.460
 it does not matter if we are ten 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.320
 or eat ten tomatoes because we 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 that in the tomato in there is not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.159
 isolated from automatic now start one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.440
 I would like to see some of them 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.450
 Best-known products briefly show how 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.060
 who have ever shown the clear 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.500
 chickens per year 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 would have nothing recognizable on it now 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.290
 that you may not be 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.350
 could taste amplifier in it 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.379
 but we still watch 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.390
 okay there we have one 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.959
 Flavor enhancer is third 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.410
 location 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.510
 and if we keep watching then it comes 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.110
 only so really relevant for that 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.810
 this life 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.510
 middle and homer vegetable fat here 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.290
 down chicken meat seasonings celery 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.830
 and the tracks in the still bed so in 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.840
 magic is mostly a flavor enhancer 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.940
 there has now magic is magic 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.810
 switched 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.850
 they do not seem to have any 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.730
 flavor enhancers in your products 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.100
 I have an old finished product from 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:50.700
 magic that here had to roast 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.190
 and a newer hungarian goulash me 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.380
 believe that food is already 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.260
 three years old but extra reserved 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.150
 to show what the difference is 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.040
 Of course, here below is without 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.400
 flavor enhancing additives 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 preservatives and dyes 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.820
 Buttery taste is our nature has ok 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.840
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.239
 it was not on the other product 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.260
 now as a newer product on the new 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.290
 We have product hungarian goulash 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.709
 up here very interesting life and 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.120
 Although here is 100 percent taste 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.640
 Quality guarantee without additional material 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.380
 flavor enhancer ok still has 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.570
 much better if that even now than 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.910
 seal on it is okay we have now 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.950
 seen that no flavor enhancer 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.820
 There's more magic in there in these 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.410
 new products and I want you 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.570
 now like to explain something and indeed 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.280
 Maybe you already have the word yeast 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.650
 times belongs definitely or maybe you have 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.040
 you know the word 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:04:01.019
 yeast extract belongs to what the yeast extract 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.730
 So asked is, so to speak, from the 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:08.370
 protein from the yeast and the value 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.950
 isolated so pulled out practically and 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.250
 then it processes to yeast extract that 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.799
 yeast extract yeast extract is accurate 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.299
 same as flavor enhancer counts 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.829
 as well as glutamate and the others 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.729
 components of the flavor enhancer 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.560
 Now I have the here again 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:29.789
 ingredient list and here and 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:33.169
 yeast extract there always though magic here 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.169
 Clearly down here 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.570
 of course without flavor enhancer 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.229
 weird or 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.040
 it can not really be that way either 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.240
 I think that's consumer disappointment 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.860
 Let's see if they are new 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.389
 have improved product 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.820
 yes me the goulash we have the 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:05.130
 list of ingredients from goulash here we have 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:08.250
 it is yeast extract again so it is 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.970
 practically nonsense here is clear 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.250
 without added flavor enhancer one 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.510
 quality guarantee 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.820
 Now I thought so let's see 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.900
 I wonder if there's anything magic about me 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.900
 say quality 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.960
 ok quality promise of magic what 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.410
 Saying it is here and there 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:36.870
 taste enhancer label we look 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:38.630
 to write again and that currently 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.370
 it is our endeavor to give them that 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:43.490
 the greatest possible enjoyment while eating 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.990
 for example , without the addition 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.289
 to offer flavor enhancers for each 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.410
 product that the seal pictured here 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:54.470
 bears we have just 1 offers you 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.979
 them one hundred percent 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.539
 Taste experience without the addition yet 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.440
 flavor enhancers more and more 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.389
 Consumers value it 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.800
 food without additives to yourself 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.720
 to take as the last thing still wants 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.520
 pretty well say what it did to 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.800
 flavor enhancer so bad 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.360
 why should not we eat that once 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.570
 we omit the flavor enhancer 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.610
 would or would naturally eat what 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.200
 Of course , that would probably happen 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.900
 Sometime after no longer taste good 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:26.010
 but it is practical 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.380
 it is virtually prevented on the 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.830
 taste has moreover 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.990
 side effect like the food 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.110
 can cause incompatibilities 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.720
 We are all healthy people 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.240
 It can lead to headaches it leads 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.020
 especially that laments for too 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.060
 deposits and 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.430
 I do not know yet how far 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.750
 100% of us feel that way 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.270
 can affect 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.129
 it is above all a dialect 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.199
 passed through 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.550
 It's especially appetizing and stimulating 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.370
 that means maybe she can do it five 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.740
 minutes of terrine from the earliest first five 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.509
 minutes of terrine and a short time 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.849
 tasted great and taste great too 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:09.629
 but now not anymore 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:12.030
 where I know that you cook fresh 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.650
 Gastes and after half an hour 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.030
 activation so you can again a 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.909
 eat that it's the effect of 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.680
 flavor enhancers pin very short 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:22.509
 the appetite but then he is 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.039
 at the same time appetite stimulating and 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:26.940
 then come the very famous ones 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:29.440
 cravings that knows each other 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:32.190
 So much for the topic 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.190
 flavor enhancers
