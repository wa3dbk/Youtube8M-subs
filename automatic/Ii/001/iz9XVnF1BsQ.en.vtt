00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 hello friends to make a good this may need for all if possible the 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.290
 right for right handed left for left-handed 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.060
 in fact exactly the same thing that for bassists we'll have lesson from 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.680
 inch just think 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.680
 I like his dead host we are all fra with the left hand 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.170
 we will have in between the rebound with the left hand 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.840
 for the 300 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.650
 basic and then we're going to have the back played with 32 3 or 4 fingers so if I 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.330
 play with everyone 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.540
 which can be a mortal offer or note 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.550
 it would be worth two fingers 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.550
 a fifth for example with three fingers late 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.470
 capa you can have fun doing this with chords of cards by 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.150
 example by harmonizing on the but on the strings the only signs 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.450
 according to me it's up to you to find combinations we attack they have 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
 taken off by hand armed with colors 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.760
 very basic soap opera with her the 4,100 points 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.660
 already nothing with the thumb and bounces could make a tiny 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.450
 turns on a note with the three are two times in a row and then on the 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 crooked who remain for example where these rebels 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.310
 but you can already show off on the beach
