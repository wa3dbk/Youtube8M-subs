00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.040
 here happens kids that as you are 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.330
 welcome to some videos of call of 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.309
 duty advance wars today I bring you what 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.140
 it's been my best game of 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.940
 almansa warfare for my personal opinion 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.470
 I 'm going to tell you later why 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.940
 and others and that is to say that directly 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.190
 I have the tildes as you can see here 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.890
 without camouflage or anything because I have 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.199
 flashes the whore supports you have already seen the 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 beginning of the video as I carry the 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.500
 requisition is the astil bait and right now 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.149
 you are going to see all the deaths that were 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.730
 what I did, that is, in total there have been 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.380
 three deaths and the latter basically 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.850
 in dead three times in the game already 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.770
 from here do not die any single 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.300
 again and I get a streak but that 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.860
 very important to say that this is my 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.260
 best match nobody in advanced work 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.880
 slowed down in terms of the number of deaths not 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.070
 in terms of the number of casualties that I 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.780
 they say it or not but in terms of mobility of 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.239
 the departure in terms of frenetism the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 heading the game itself I liked a 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.200
 lot and the streak that I have taken and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.149
 apart this rachita was in less than 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.430
 five minutes or really flip 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.619
 asicana kids is to say that I carry the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 parts without camouflage as you will have 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.890
 seen as already 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.320
 and I carry it with a holster and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.730
 looks at me red dot and those that 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.870
 denies orientates enough and I'm going to 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.960
 tell you one thing a thing enough 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.520
 quite rare is the seasonality of 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.140
 the weapons we could say because it 's a 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.570
 very rare thing is a very rare paranoia 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.280
 because I do not know if a glass or us 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.530
 passes of carmen the comments of the case 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.210
 but it happens to me that the weapons are 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.400
 times that do not work well is worth a 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.900
 determined a certain time I 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.300
 works well as in this case you were 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.550
 you byte and another certain time that I 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.620
 it works very badly or they really are 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.870
 tremendously bad and I do not know if it's something 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.030
 of the game is my thing because it's so weird 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.430
 that is the truth and what happened was that I 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.290
 I played with the hole panzer I did not have 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.090
 Rook took the blame to be silenced 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.650
 exactly as it is about that instead 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.570
 of the hilt made him bumpy 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.729
 then I was carrying that gun there was a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.860
 period in which I was well worth 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.600
 it was pretty good every game was 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.520
 tremendous or here look at these look 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.380
 you look at the laffite of this moment be 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.580
 What was commenting on the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.920
 hall manches I was going very, very, very 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.959
 well then suddenly in a week 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.700
 I started to go bad but fatal fatal fatal 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.920
 then I put on the steel bites that was 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.900
 right now that day this day that I 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.510
 I put silva 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.370
 this rachita is impressive that is me 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.230
 I put it on and suddenly I see that it bursts 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.959
 even more that under the walk it is flip 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 then the next day I put the hold 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.230
 fancher, I put it on exactly 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.180
 same as steve wright and I see what 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.950
 even more creative tool and it 's something 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.799
 awesome uncle because suddenly not 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.659
 the steel bite is going very badly I'm going super 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.280
 medium the panzer goes super low 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.530
 the panzer is doing me very well the filite 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.329
 I 'm very strange as you can see here 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.040
 certainly inexorable streak you have 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.280
 I saw the streak that they take me in this 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.230
 moment that is in a pispÃ¡s in a 0,2 that 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.090
 awesome is worth here I decide to go 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.650
 I just find that medium is 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.450
 bad that he gave me back because here 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.859
 they just almost killed me again and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.359
 my mother from the one who saved me and I say 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.579
 paper go away from here because this already 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.989
 it's scary, so I left then 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.819
 we killed this one that escaped me 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.099
 little but in the end I kill him and good 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.260
 I get something like three times 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.420
 Streaky bout here I've already been on a roll 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.159
 of implacable that is shocking was in 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.950
 less than five minutes the game already 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.829
 I say or be scary over the days 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.510
 this lady were called with a chaotic 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.190
 flume vivere I think it was and we are in 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.569
 call and I'm hurrying to 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.189
 let me out but no no 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.290
 these are andorra already waited and 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:24.700
 honestly worth it or less 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.010
 bad that I did not go to the game because I 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.079
 I was hurrying these and that is that 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.909
 come out a game really can that 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.099
 I personally consider my best 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.590
 departure in advanced worker with respect 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.530
 to what I gave with mobility frenetism 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.840
 the game the intensity of the game 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.879
 worth the short or the short time it lasts 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.560
 the game and it really is a game 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.489
 that I honestly love or that is 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.940
 I'm quite pretty 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.550
 proud of this game 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.380
 here I think it had already run of 23 24 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.520
 if I do not remember right now I kill 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.920
 one to all and I will miss the 25 streak and 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.420
 You see my enemies here - 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.580
 I meet again all together I think that 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.890
 I get sick so double low and serious that 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.180
 my mother's enemies were pretty 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.860
 good because I will have seen that 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.570
 right at the start of the game 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.910
 just when I started to get my streak 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.740
 after those three deaths you have 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.109
 seen that they were winning us and suddenly 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.910
 I arrived there in a plan of power and 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.799
 I start to burst as you can see 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.240
 here already streak of fierce vale jane los 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.160
 unstoppable and undo the unstoppable 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.720
 here the rock inviting me in chaotic 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.120
 fragmenting half getting into laughter and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.340
 my mother how can you see paper in a 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.080
 run of 32 casualties and will continue to believe that 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.640
 arrived will be a run of 35 casualties 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.770
 basically because the game is over 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.330
 by score more than anything else because if not 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.000
 I could have followed and surely I 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.860
 I could have gotten the bomb out of 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.210
 not good but it was a pity how I go 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.830
 but here the game ends and really 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.240
 impressive or is it really that has 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.710
 delighted the game I hope you guys 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.210
 you have loved to see if we can 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.950
 reach a considerable amount of 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.530
 likes for this game to see if we get 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.760
 at 75 likes at least and really I 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.770
 like to make this type of videos always 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.960
 that I take out some powerful game 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.730
 some streak that wants to bring you to the channel 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.650
 so I hope you liked the 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.760
 video or let's follow the 75 likes so
