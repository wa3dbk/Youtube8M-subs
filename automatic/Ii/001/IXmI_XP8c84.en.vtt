I<00:02:47.110> took<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.709> drill<00:02:48.010> bit<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.140> drill<00:02:50.140> out<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
I took a drill bit and drill out the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.820 
I took a drill bit and drill out the
holes<00:02:51.450> pre-drilled<00:02:52.450> no<00:02:53.170> way<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.620> went<00:02:53.709> in

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
holes pre-drilled no way and I went in

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.380 
holes pre-drilled no way and I went in
better<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.130> didn't<00:02:54.700> split<00:02:54.850> my<00:02:55.000> wood<00:02:55.180> or

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
better and didn't split my wood or

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.660 
better and didn't split my wood or
anything<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.720> built<00:02:59.140> this<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.740> guess<00:03:00.430> I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
anything so I built this I guess I

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.210 
anything so I built this I guess I
should<00:03:01.300> have<00:03:02.459> put<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.550> tubes<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:03.970> before<00:03:04.270> I

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
should have put the tubes in before I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.310 
should have put the tubes in before I
finish<00:03:06.220> off<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.520> other<00:03:06.640> end<00:03:06.880> by<00:03:07.330> doing<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.690> so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
finish off the other end by doing it so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.720 
finish off the other end by doing it so

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
I just want to dip ties I've seen a

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.119 
I just want to dip ties I've seen a
couple<00:04:43.659> videos<00:04:43.990> where<00:04:44.439> you<00:04:44.740> know<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.979> zip

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
couple videos where you know the zip

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:50.309 
couple videos where you know the zip
ties<00:04:45.280> don't<00:04:45.639> work<00:04:45.789> that<00:04:46.030> well<00:04:46.770> but<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:49.229> lot<00:04:50.229> of

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
ties don't work that well but a lot of

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:51.510 
ties don't work that well but a lot of
times<00:04:50.469> that's<00:04:50.620> what<00:04:50.740> they're<00:04:51.129> using<00:04:51.280> like

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
times that's what they're using like

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.219 
times that's what they're using like
perfect<00:04:51.909> views<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.449> quick<00:04:52.779> fuse<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.139> all

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
perfect views and quick fuse and all

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.399 
perfect views and quick fuse and all
that<00:04:53.439> I<00:04:53.710> think<00:04:54.279> it's<00:04:54.370> almost<00:04:54.490> just<00:04:54.610> too<00:04:54.879> fast

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
that I think it's almost just too fast

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.209 
that I think it's almost just too fast
you<00:04:56.409> know<00:04:56.500> when<00:04:56.620> you're<00:04:56.710> using<00:04:56.860> zip<00:04:57.129> ties<00:04:57.340> for

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
you know when you're using zip ties for

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:04.019 
you know when you're using zip ties for
film<00:05:00.219> to<00:05:00.340> ignite<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.199> shells<00:05:02.759> so<00:05:03.759> I<00:05:03.789> think

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.029 
film to ignite the shells so I think

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.809 
film to ignite the shells so I think
using<00:05:04.569> this<00:05:04.810> fiscal<00:05:05.560> fuse<00:05:05.979> that'll<00:05:06.219> be<00:05:06.279> fine

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
using this fiscal fuse that'll be fine

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.760 
using this fiscal fuse that'll be fine
I'll<00:05:07.419> give<00:05:07.569> it<00:05:07.689> plenty<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.289> time<00:05:08.409> to<00:05:08.439> ignite

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
I'll give it plenty of time to ignite

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.100 
I'll give it plenty of time to ignite
and<00:05:09.069> heat<00:05:09.460> up<00:05:09.639> to<00:05:10.180> what<00:05:10.300> it<00:05:10.360> needs<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:10.719> be<00:05:11.610> so

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
and heat up to what it needs to be so

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.790 
and heat up to what it needs to be so
basically<00:05:14.110> I'll<00:05:14.620> put<00:05:14.889> the<00:05:15.270> dimensions<00:05:16.800> again

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
basically I'll put the dimensions again

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.999 
basically I'll put the dimensions again
in<00:05:17.979> the<00:05:18.069> bottom<00:05:18.430> and<00:05:19.060> also<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:19.900> website<00:05:20.080> that

in the bottom and also the website that

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.930 
in the bottom and also the website that
I<00:05:21.039> got<00:05:21.639> these<00:05:21.789> from<00:05:22.349> again<00:05:23.349> they're<00:05:23.729> $0.99<00:05:24.729> and

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
I got these from again they're $0.99 and

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.200 
I got these from again they're $0.99 and
