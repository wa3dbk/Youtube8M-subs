00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.410
 the cell such a tiny organism and 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.770
 delicate but at the same time so sophisticated and 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.280
 complex 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:43.030
 a cell requires a lot of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.250
 mechanisms to survive and one 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.560
 of them is passive transport 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.220
 Passive transport is a mechanism 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.160
 physiological whose function consists in the 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.780
 incorporation of substances from the environment 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.690
 external through the membrane 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.629
 plasma in favor of a gradient of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:08.229
 concentration without energy expenditure 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.229
 chemistry or atp adenosine triphosphate 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.180
 passive transport of products from 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.940
 always from where there is a greater amount 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.400
 of substance to where there is less 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.790
 the physiological mechanisms that 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.650
 carried out by passive transport are three 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.790
 simple diffusion diffusion 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.980
 facilitated and osmosis in diffusion 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 simple the molecule can pass 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.999
 directly through the membrane 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.670
 the effectiveness of the diffusion is 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:42.179
 limited by the speed of diffusion of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.210
 said molecule therefore although the 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.130
 dissemination is a transport mechanism 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.619
 effective enough for certain 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.600
 molecules the cell must still 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.109
 perform other transport mechanisms 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109
 For your needs 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.270
 simple broadcasting through channels 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.299
 is done through the so-called 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.799
 channel proteins and that's how they come in 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.619
 ions such as sodium potassium calcium between 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.569
 other channel proteins are 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.120
 proteins with a hole or channel 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.750
 internal that they join a certain 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.700
 region the protein receptor of 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.500
 channel that on a transformation 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.620
 structure that induces the opening of the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.190
 channel that's how molecules come in 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.900
 lipid and some polar substances 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.819
 like oxygen and nitrogen 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.310
 atmospheric 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.040
 some polar molecules of very small 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.230
 size also go through the membrane 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.690
 by simple broadcast 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.330
 however some molecules are 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.640
 too big to spread to 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.190
 through the membrane channels and 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
 too insoluble in lipids like 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.280
 to be able to spread through the layer 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.459
 of phospholipids 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.950
 these substances however can 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.709
 traverse the plasma membrane 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.810
 through the diffusion process 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.420
 facilitated with the help of a protein 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.330
 conveyor 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.830
 to give an example in which the 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.760
 glucose is a protein 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.220
 conveyor and it changes shape 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.900
 allowing the passage of sugar and so 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.200
 soon as glucose reaches the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.780
 cytoplasm an enzyme that adds a group 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.290
 phosphate to a sugar transforms the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.690
 glucose in glucose 6 phosphate that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.880
 way glucose concentrations in 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.599
 the inside of the cell are always very 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.700
 low and the concentration gradient 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.040
 interior exterior favors diffusion 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.200
 of glucose 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.049
 the facilitated diffusion is much more 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.319
 quick that simple diffusion and depends 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.379
 of one of the degree of concentration of the 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:55.219
 substance on both sides of the membrane 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.030
 two of the number of proteins transformed 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:00.209
 existing transporters in the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.460
 membrane and three of the speed with which 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.820
 those proteins do their job 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.600
 the third physiological mechanism that 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.220
 pray for passive transport is osmosis 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.520
 which is a very special type of 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.530
 passive transport in which only 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.989
 the water molecules are transported 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.000
 through the membrane 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.220
 the movement of water is done from 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.590
 a point where there is more 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.009
 concentration still or less 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.849
 concentration to match the 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.849
 concentrations on both sides 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.650
 according to the way it is 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.220
 the cell the osmosis can vary 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:46.090
 and the function of osmosis is to maintain 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.400
 well hydrated the cell membrane this 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.180
 process does not require any expenditure of 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.520
 Energy 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.860
 said in a more scientific language the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.920
 Osmosis involves the passage of the solvent 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.770
 of a dissolution from a low zone 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.410
 concentration of absolute to a high 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.800
 concentration of solutes separated by 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.770
 a semipermeable membrane and that was 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.860
 explained in a very simple way in 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.130
 the process of passive transport 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.490
 now to say goodbye to a song we 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.490
 we see
