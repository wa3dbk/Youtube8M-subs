00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
they do almost lose this game but this

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.410 
they do almost lose this game but this
is<00:03:47.680> just<00:03:47.709> kind<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.160> an<00:03:48.310> example<00:03:48.400> some<00:03:48.910> weird

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
is just kind of an example some weird

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.979 
is just kind of an example some weird
 he<00:03:50.170> does<00:03:50.350> huh<00:03:51.340> man<00:03:52.329> gets<00:03:52.660> killed<00:03:52.810> and

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
 he does huh man gets killed and

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.349 
 he does huh man gets killed and
then<00:03:53.500> here<00:03:53.799> this<00:03:53.980> is<00:03:54.190> like<00:03:54.400> a<00:03:54.430> more<00:03:54.790> standard

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
then here this is like a more standard

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.879 
then here this is like a more standard
what<00:03:55.630> do<00:03:55.690> you<00:03:55.720> think<00:03:55.780> upon<00:03:56.230> or<00:03:56.530> when<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.739> wash

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
what do you think upon or when you wash

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:57.990 
what do you think upon or when you wash
play<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.489> think<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.760> lot<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:57.910> people

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
play and then I think a lot of people

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000 
play and then I think a lot of people
when<00:03:58.840> they<00:03:58.959> see<00:03:59.019> his<00:03:59.200> stuff<00:03:59.380> like<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.680> like

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
when they see his stuff like this like

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.440 
when they see his stuff like this like
they<00:04:00.160> pick<00:04:00.370> a<00:04:00.400> counter<00:04:00.730> pick<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.180> he<00:04:01.239> just

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
they pick a counter pick and he just

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.349 
they pick a counter pick and he just
like<00:04:01.599> starts<00:04:01.959> winning<00:04:02.829> the<00:04:03.130> lane<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:04.209> a

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
like starts winning the lane in a

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.220 
like starts winning the lane in a
standard<00:04:04.690> way<00:04:04.720> show<00:04:05.650> those<00:04:05.889> brief<00:04:06.250> examples

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
standard way show those brief examples

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.640 
standard way show those brief examples
because<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.470> think<00:04:08.910> when<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.019> describe<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.500> role

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
because I think when I describe the role

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.289 
because I think when I describe the role
upon<00:04:12.010> how<00:04:12.250> 17<00:04:12.760> people<00:04:13.120> will<00:04:13.329> tend<00:04:13.510> to<00:04:13.599> react<00:04:15.299> in

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
upon how 17 people will tend to react in

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.199 
upon how 17 people will tend to react in
a<00:04:16.450> negative<00:04:16.630> way<00:04:16.870> they<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.160> described<00:04:18.880> him<00:04:19.060> as

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
a negative way they I described him as

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.110 
a negative way they I described him as
daring<00:04:19.720> and<00:04:19.870> this<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.769> thing<00:04:21.729> right<00:04:21.940> the

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
daring and this is the thing right the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.330 
daring and this is the thing right the
mask<00:04:22.390> I'll<00:04:22.690> five<00:04:22.930> Darien<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.650> probably<00:04:24.250> the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
mask I'll five Darien is probably the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.010 
mask I'll five Darien is probably the
most<00:04:24.490> famous<00:04:24.760> example<00:04:25.390> of<00:04:25.510> what<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.780> think

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
most famous example of what I think

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.120 
most famous example of what I think

this<00:05:33.820> is<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.060> other<00:05:34.120> side<00:05:34.360> of<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.480> coin<00:05:34.660> and

this is the other side of the coin and

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.310 
this is the other side of the coin and
then<00:05:36.030> the<00:05:37.030> fourth<00:05:37.390> example<00:05:37.660> is<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:38.020> think<00:05:38.080> when

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
about he's got okay he's got the counter

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.870 
about he's got okay he's got the counter

coral all the time and his Lula start is

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.970 
coral all the time and his Lula start is
really<00:07:07.180> misleading<00:07:07.390> like<00:07:07.840> that<00:07:07.990> 50<00:07:08.200> Lulu<00:07:08.590> what

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:08.980 
really misleading like that 50 Lulu what

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.270 
really misleading like that 50 Lulu what
what<00:07:09.160> is<00:07:09.310> that<00:07:09.780> so<00:07:10.780> just<00:07:11.140> for<00:07:11.530> me<00:07:11.650> pong<00:07:11.950> isn't

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
what is that so just for me pong isn't

the<00:07:12.550> team<00:07:12.760> fighter<00:07:13.000> and<00:07:13.210> there<00:07:13.360> are<00:07:13.540> subtle

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 
the team fighter and there are subtle

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.360 
the team fighter and there are subtle
ways<00:07:13.960> where<00:07:14.200> he<00:07:14.440> will<00:07:14.620> miss<00:07:14.830> position<00:07:15.190> like

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
ways where he will miss position like

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.730 
ways where he will miss position like
him<00:07:15.520> is<00:07:15.640> positioned<00:07:16.060> in<00:07:16.390> a<00:07:16.690> mt<00:07:17.110> game<00:07:17.350> when<00:07:17.620> he

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 
him is positioned in a mt game when he

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.970 
him is positioned in a mt game when he
did<00:07:17.860> play<00:07:17.890> cookie<00:07:18.280> mid<00:07:18.460> in<00:07:19.450> a<00:07:20.410> teamfight<00:07:20.620> and

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
did play cookie mid in a teamfight and

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.950 
did play cookie mid in a teamfight and
Gansey<00:07:21.790> almost<00:07:22.390> had<00:07:22.480> to<00:07:22.570> come<00:07:22.690> back<00:07:22.720> when

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 
Gansey almost had to come back when

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.990 
Gansey almost had to come back when
doe-eyed<00:07:23.080> at<00:07:23.320> that<00:07:26.280> so<00:07:27.280> they're<00:07:27.430> just<00:07:27.580> subtle

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
doe-eyed at that so they're just subtle

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.520 
doe-eyed at that so they're just subtle
things<00:07:28.300> or<00:07:28.480> ponds<00:07:28.750> team<00:07:29.050> fighting<00:07:29.260> isn't

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
things or ponds team fighting isn't

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.900 
things or ponds team fighting isn't
quite<00:07:29.800> there<00:07:29.950> still<00:07:30.220> though<00:07:30.340> I<00:07:30.370> do<00:07:30.490> think<00:07:30.760> is

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
quite there still though I do think is

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.940 
quite there still though I do think is
he<00:07:31.030> fighting<00:07:31.180> as<00:07:31.360> Rupert<00:07:31.720> significantly<00:07:32.350> and

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:32.950 
he fighting as Rupert significantly and

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.260 
he fighting as Rupert significantly and
I<00:07:33.040> still<00:07:33.280> think<00:07:33.430> he's<00:07:33.550> a<00:07:33.580> very<00:07:33.700> very<00:07:34.090> good

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:34.270 
I still think he's a very very good

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.450 
I still think he's a very very good
milena<00:07:34.660> obviously<00:07:35.140> but<00:07:35.320> his<00:07:35.470> role<00:07:36.070> is<00:07:36.250> very

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460 
milena obviously but his role is very

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.850 
milena obviously but his role is very
huge<00:07:36.790> I<00:07:37.090> don't<00:07:37.750> think<00:07:37.810> enough<00:07:38.110> attention<00:07:38.530> is

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:38.860 
huge I don't think enough attention is

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.580 
huge I don't think enough attention is
drawn<00:07:39.070> to<00:07:39.250> the<00:07:39.340> fact<00:07:39.550> that<00:07:39.850> his<00:07:40.750> role<00:07:40.960> is<00:07:41.260> so

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:41.590 
drawn to the fact that his role is so

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.190 
drawn to the fact that his role is so
unique<00:07:42.010> and<00:07:42.310> that<00:07:43.180> he's<00:07:43.330> not<00:07:43.510> going<00:07:43.840> to<00:07:43.870> be<00:07:43.930> the

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:44.200 
unique and that he's not going to be the

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.230 
unique and that he's not going to be the
primary<00:07:44.470> carry<00:07:44.980> but<00:07:45.310> he's<00:07:45.520> going<00:07:45.760> to<00:07:45.850> be<00:07:46.000> like

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
primary carry but he's going to be like

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.090 
primary carry but he's going to be like
the<00:07:46.510> crazy<00:07:46.810> guy<00:07:47.080> who<00:07:47.470> makes<00:07:47.650> it<00:07:47.860> so<00:07:47.980> the

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:48.100 
the crazy guy who makes it so the

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.390 
the crazy guy who makes it so the
primary<00:07:48.280> carry<00:07:48.700> can't<00:07:49.090> succeed
