watch<00:01:43.290> 707<00:01:43.890> Pascal<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
watch 707 Pascal that's what this is and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.179 
watch 707 Pascal that's what this is and
that<00:01:45.750> makes<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.380> really<00:01:46.829> good<00:01:47.009> fun

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
doesn't well it's it's Pascal but but

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.749 
doesn't well it's it's Pascal but but
you've<00:01:49.439> got<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.860> physical<00:01:50.040> physical

collisions you can feel them and you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
collisions you can feel them and you
know<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:27.900> that's<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.620> some<00:02:28.800> thought<00:02:29.010> you<00:02:29.190> are

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
know so that's just some thought you are

our<00:02:29.640> objective<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.680> find<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.160> way

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
our objective is to is to find a way

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.729 
our objective is to is to find a way
with<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> new<00:02:33.330> economic<00:02:33.540> model<00:02:33.870> now<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.320> owners

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
with a new economic model now the owners

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.380 
with a new economic model now the owners
who<00:02:35.280> will<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:35.519> have<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> kind<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> pressure

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
who will not have the kind of pressure

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.270 
who will not have the kind of pressure
on<00:02:36.600> them<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.870> they<00:02:37.019> did<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.590> they<00:02:38.160> can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
on them that they did and they can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.800 
on them that they did and they can
actually<00:02:38.459> make<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.790> profit<00:02:38.910> which<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.570> where<00:02:39.750> it

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
actually make a profit which is where it

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.060 
actually make a profit which is where it
has<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:39.959> start<00:02:40.350> no<00:02:40.470> matter<00:02:40.530> how<00:02:40.769> good<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
has to start no matter how good the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.390 
has to start no matter how good the
product<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.580> and<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:43.019> we've<00:02:43.200> got<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.160> we

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
product is and now we've got that so we

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.009 
product is and now we've got that so we
can<00:02:44.519> take<00:02:44.760> our<00:02:44.910> time<00:02:44.940> now<00:02:45.330> grow<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.840> league

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
can take our time now grow the league

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.810 
can take our time now grow the league
back<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.440> where<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.680> was<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.580> meantime
