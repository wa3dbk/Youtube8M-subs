00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.569
 so today I have an appointment with the seat ibiza 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.160
 with two friends cÃ©dric friborg you know 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.319
 nicolas is similar 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:14.319
 I will introduce you and we will debate 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:18.349
 on this all black Spanish car you see there stop 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.210
 I say stop 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.249
 you are ready to debate 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.039
 this tax namely acts 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.060
 on these ape hardly arouses on my left I was told that good 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.099
 balla balla so why 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.220
 we're going to the conference table is who made europe 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.319
 the judges somewhat estimate the car 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.030
 because it's better to see a car 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.030
 when conditions 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.200
 the street 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.020
 in Paris in the 9th 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020
 amsterdam street which is undoubtedly the rigor 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.810
 so we could see this version 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.290
 there are lines 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.500
 she was won by a goal so that the edge 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 the original Belgian designer work at lamborghini 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.220
 216 goals 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.530
 so probably the market 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.890
 difficult 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.350
 competitive 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.670
 big banyan car 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.030
 karim has passed the car 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.030
 on this most versatile party segment 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.690
 both at the same time 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.710
 cityman takes space driving coffe his race 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.120
 history proves its recent awards 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.120
 so much to tell you that we are really in the heart 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.120
 of business 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.330
 Lisa is the star 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 social that puts on sale put on sale 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 but at the same time actia still suffers france a picture a little 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 reduced compared 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.120
 whether it's a young and sporty brand and beyond words 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.629
 we will debate 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.419
 on what it's worth
