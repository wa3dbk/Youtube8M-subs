00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello, welcome to one 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.410
 nine goals 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 this crafting konrad and this time goes 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.080
 it's about how to blender with two 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.299
 clips how to do it just not a mere 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 creates near luminous cubes 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.750
 different colours 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.750
 every part is a very basic tutorial 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.340
 So really for beginners and me 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.289
 we can start first 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.550
 put it on schalke, because we say yes 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.059
 to have to be called the new render engine 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 and then there are the different ones 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.300
 modes is on the edges mode is already 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.340
 changed there is the great the text 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.290
 raimund wurzer is best suited to the material 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.809
 Change your mode if the user 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:54.360
 result so everything here is like 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.890
 it is because this shy me it is 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.070

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.630

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.460
