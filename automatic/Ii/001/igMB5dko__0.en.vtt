00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 we are here in a room that you 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.600
 have recently finalized and who is the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.880
 last of the rooms you have designed 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.679
 for years their we are here 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 in a very recent room that makes 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.839
 part of the 70 that we have to our 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.119
 active and that is a real hall 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
 private cinema and not a home theater 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 such as long must be well 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.980
 understand that in a project like 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.640
 this one the study phase is the most 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.269
 important 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.609
 you really have to study design 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.480
 acoustics the general arrangement of the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.619
 piece to come up with a result 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.910
 professional 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.950
 we are here in a room 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.649
 fully acoustically treated to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.230
 using a European patent for panels 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.300
 acoustics that will both bring 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 absorption zones and zones of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 sound diffusion according to the study 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.910
 computer acoustics was conducted at the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.210
 prior in this case we have 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.010
 here an absorbing acoustic panels 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.230
 who will trap the sound that will prevent that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.039
 som bounce from wall to wall while 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.020
 that right next 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.989
 we are going to have a broadcast area 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.129
 of the much harder sound that she is going 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.409
 expand the sound field 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.750
 finally in this case we have 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.610
 created 6 1 unhooks and walls to avoid 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.830
 some quality to the piece for 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.540
 give a relief with a zone 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.280
 indirect lighting that can 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.340
 change color according to taste 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.140
 of the client then the patent used here 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.369
 is based on the principle of the box 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 in the box ie we 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.650
 have a complete decoupling of cinema 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.990
 compared to the original part gross 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.720
 that is, the panels 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.640
 acoustic mureaux does not touch the only 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 nor the best on which they are 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.810
 installs nil ceiling they are pretty much 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.810
 in levitation and that's why it's 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.390
 a patent we have here also a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.020
 suspended acoustic ceiling dress up a 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.090
 starry sky in fiber optic and a 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.619
 LED-based lighting with in addition a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.659
 feelings module that gives a side 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.640
 very natural to the stars 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.310
 the decoration that we see on them 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.900
 the walls is very special too 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.850
 we use in this room 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.160
 particularly modern design and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.770
 innovative since we have here 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.320
 aluminum panels that are 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.180
 unique pieces made to measure and 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.640
 that are translucent estac we have 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.830
 waves that you see that are in 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.410
 transparent resin by which 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.660
 behind we have a light I 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.010
 indirect say that goes through and 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.930
 who can also change color 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.610
 it's extremely innovative we're on 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.680
 rather rounded forms that gives 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.150
 a certain sweetness to the room with the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.400
 creating a front stage so under 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.280
 the dual- level screen with a 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.560
 indirect lighting and aluminum core 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.970
 hand-brushed in terms of finish and 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.890
 in the back we find a reminder 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.320
 exactly with these same shapes 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.550
 rounded this same double level this same 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.830
 aligned in big is that we find 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.470
 also at the level of the wall panels 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.790
 translucent and still this carpet 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.780
 and the little letters that go well 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 so here we have a 9.2 system of 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.430
 mark gkf who are real 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.680
 pregnant used in real movies 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.900
 who was gc at the Cannes festival or in 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.140
 very famous cinemas and we have to 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.209
 the rear speaker on the road in es4 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.730
 side and two at the back that are 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.850
 embedded in the wall and you have 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.610
 then three huge front speaker who 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.750
 are behind the trans sound screen so 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.430
 this room today a room of 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.380
 this place here we are on this 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.120
 square with orange and one two three or 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.310
 four years knowing that 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.650
 particularity is to have seats that 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.180
 are installed staggered ie 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.860
 four places behind three fronts of 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.940
 way not to be embarrassed by the head of the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.709
 person who is in front 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.900
 despite the height difference that we 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.450
 have in the room we are here in 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.310
 very high-end armchairs 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.050
 electric with two engines one 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.239
 for both what is one for the 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.700
 footrest with a double extension 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.370
 to have the foot fully supported 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.530
 and not half in the void and we 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.110
 are leather with double cushion we 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.209
 have a cushion especially 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.560
 soft for the seat and we have 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.690
 even by the way if you look good at 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.549
 the back a love site that is to say 2 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.049
 place side by side without armrests the 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.410
 armchairs are mounted on vibrator 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.549
 that is, at the moment when in the 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.190
 movie there is an explosion 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.780
 the vibrators will start on their way 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.819
 perfectly synchronized way 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.010
 with which are serious who will give 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.859
 an immersion a sensation of 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.359
 piece vibrations related to what is 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.549
 goes into the movie so the screen is a 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.840
 screen in a specialty you 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.419
 master who is the cinemascope 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.700
 here we have a screen brand screen 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.740
 excellence that the specis in europe in 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.630
 the field and who has a trans canvas at 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.730
 north the transport canvas allows so 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.830
 position to position for all 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.720
 Front speakers behind the lesson screen 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.940
 crosses the picture that is a real 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.520
 fusion between the sound the image and the 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.500
 cinemascope and our specificities it's up to 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.780
 to say that we find here exactly 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.600
 the same format as in the cinema 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.300
 of a panoramic format here the screen and 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.040
 even curved he has a curvature they 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.360
 were calculated by the manufacturer 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.610
 function the remoteness and the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.130
 dimension of the image and allows for 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.750
 find exactly the mood the type 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.700
 image without the black bands at the top 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.990
 without the black stripes down then 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.090
 we have them when we look at this on a 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.860
 9th 9th screen which as a reminder is a 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.919
 TV screen 16/9 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.320
 it's a canvas four case that has the 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.300
 feature of having a mesh 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.979
 extremely fine invisible to the naked eye 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.530
 so there is no degradation of 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.620
 the image and that is 3D compatible 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.140
 we have a last projector 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.750
 generation at a time 2d but also 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.940
 3d based on active glasses and a 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.010
 infrared emitter that bounces on 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.140
 the screen that synchronizes the 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.080
 movie about electronic glasses 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.710
 the remote obviously allows 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.340
 to have access to all 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.160
 features 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.020
 we have a complete home automation in 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.570
 this room that works in wifi from 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.280
 way to not have to lead the 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.080
 remote control to the devices that here 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.380
 are anyway in a bar at 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.479
 the back of the listening area and we 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.190
 are able to handle both well 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.930
 sure audio video devices but also 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.820
 all the light when you launch 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.950
 your movie very naturally the 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.190
 lights will go out in one order 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.320
 perfectly accurate and will give I 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.150
 would say a cinema atmosphere as soon as we 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.010
 launches the film you also need to know 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.530
 full of sitting if you do pose by 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.840
 example for just getting up 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.580
 we only go to him but some 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.960
 areas very slightly not to 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.830
 dazzle other spectators who 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.830
 stay in the room
