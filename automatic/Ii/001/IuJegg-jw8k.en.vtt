00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910 

I'm<00:00:00.269> setting<00:00:00.570> up<00:00:00.780> here<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.140> work<00:00:01.260> on<00:00:01.500> some<00:00:01.740> loop

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
I'm setting up here to work on some loop

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.230 
I'm setting up here to work on some loop
tops<00:00:02.210> and<00:00:03.210> maybe<00:00:03.510> some<00:00:03.750> sharp<00:00:04.049> tops<00:00:04.609> the<00:00:05.609> ruler

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
tops and maybe some sharp tops the ruler

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.629 
tops and maybe some sharp tops the ruler
so<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:07.290> represents<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:08.010> plane<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.490> body

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so it represents the plane of body

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.089 
so it represents the plane of body
midpoint<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.599> marked<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.500> here<00:00:10.559> at<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.860> top

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
midpoint I marked it here at the top

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.339 
midpoint I marked it here at the top
with<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.400> pencil<00:00:12.330> gripper<00:00:12.719> so<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.170> could

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
with this pencil gripper so that I could

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.560 
with this pencil gripper so that I could
get<00:00:13.530> them<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:14.490> ruler<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> way<00:00:15.240> before

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
get them the ruler out of the way before

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.849 
get them the ruler out of the way before
I<00:00:15.780> remove<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.699> notice<00:00:17.699> that<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.840> lines<00:00:19.590> on

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
I remove it notice that the lines on

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.670 
I remove it notice that the lines on
this<00:00:20.010> page<00:00:20.369> if<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.820> were<00:00:21.000> making<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.260> lateral

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
this page if I were making the lateral

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.529 
this page if I were making the lateral
strokes<00:00:23.070> like<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.340> I'd<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.699> pulling<00:00:24.359> them

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
strokes like this I'd be pulling them

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.200 
strokes like this I'd be pulling them
toward<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.320> plane<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.859> body<00:00:26.010> midpoint<00:00:26.670> set

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
toward this plane of body midpoint set

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.410 
toward this plane of body midpoint set
this<00:00:27.420> out<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> way<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.119> use

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this out of the way and I'm going to use

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.810 
this out of the way and I'm going to use
our<00:00:30.750> advanced<00:00:31.080> pupil<00:00:31.619> book<00:00:31.769> put<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.579> place

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
our advanced pupil book put it in place

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.380 
our advanced pupil book put it in place
so<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.149> I<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.540> warm<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.940> left<00:00:35.940> hand<00:00:36.270> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
so that I can warm up my left hand a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.319 
so that I can warm up my left hand a
little<00:00:36.420> bit<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:37.110> right-handed<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.090> this<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
little bit I'm right-handed so this is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
little bit I'm right-handed so this is
this<00:00:39.510> challenging<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.320> me<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.010> you
