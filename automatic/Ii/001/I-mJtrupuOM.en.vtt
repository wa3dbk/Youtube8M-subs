look<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.490> little<00:01:06.640> bit<00:01:06.820> more<00:01:06.970> neat

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.270 

I've<00:01:18.329> blended<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.679> little<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.130> more

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I've blended it out a little bit more

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.319 
I've blended it out a little bit more
and<00:01:20.429> then<00:01:20.549> applied<00:01:20.789> a<00:01:20.820> shimmery<00:01:21.179> cream

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.710 

now<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.130> liner<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.640> began<00:01:33.120> by<00:01:33.300> applying<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
now for the liner I began by applying a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.240 
now for the liner I began by applying a
line<00:01:33.900> along<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.140> upper<00:01:34.260> lash<00:01:34.680> line<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.100> while

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
line along my upper lash line and while

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
line along my upper lash line and while
I<00:01:35.280> hadn't<00:01:35.610> planned<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.940> do<00:01:36.090> range<00:01:36.300> liner<00:01:36.510> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
I hadn't planned to do range liner I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
I hadn't planned to do range liner I
just<00:01:37.230> didn't<00:01:37.470> find<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.800> it<00:01:37.920> looked<00:01:38.070> right

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just didn't find that it looked right

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.560 
just didn't find that it looked right
with<00:01:38.490> liner<00:01:38.670> only<00:01:39.000> along<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.330> upper<00:01:39.420> lash

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
with liner only along the upper lash

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.180 
with liner only along the upper lash
line<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.200> winged<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> out<00:01:40.710> following<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
line so I winged it out following the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:58.510 
line so I winged it out following the
angle<00:01:41.550> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.730> eyeshadow

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.429 

after<00:01:59.240> doing<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.570> liner<00:01:59.750> on<00:01:59.960> the<00:01:59.990> upper<00:02:00.079> lid<00:02:00.409> I

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
after doing the liner on the upper lid I

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.620 
after doing the liner on the upper lid I
lined<00:02:00.740> my<00:02:00.890> lower<00:02:01.040> waterline<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.850> added<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.509> bit

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
lined my lower waterline and added a bit

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.940 
lined my lower waterline and added a bit
along<00:02:02.810> my<00:02:02.960> lower<00:02:03.140> lash<00:02:03.259> line<00:02:05.649> then<00:02:06.649> because<00:02:06.920> I

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
along my lower lash line then because I

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.620 
along my lower lash line then because I
did<00:02:07.130> want<00:02:07.250> this<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.580> look<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.790> bit<00:02:07.820> imperfect<00:02:08.509> I

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
did want this to look a bit imperfect I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.180 
did want this to look a bit imperfect I
use<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.929> detail<00:02:09.229> brush<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.649> smudge<00:02:09.860> out<00:02:10.039> the

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
use the detail brush to smudge out the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:24.600 
use the detail brush to smudge out the
liner

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.950 

moving<00:02:25.610> on<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.760> curled<00:02:26.120> my<00:02:26.180> lashes<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.660> applied

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
moving on I curled my lashes and applied

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.040 
moving on I curled my lashes and applied
some<00:02:27.170> mascara<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:28.540> followed<00:02:29.540> up<00:02:29.600> by<00:02:29.750> putting<00:02:29.900> on

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
some mascara I followed up by putting on

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.380 
some mascara I followed up by putting on
a<00:02:30.080> pair<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.320> dramatic<00:02:30.740> false<00:02:30.980> eyelashes<00:02:31.580> when

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
a pair of dramatic false eyelashes when

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.970 
a pair of dramatic false eyelashes when
choosing<00:02:32.570> false<00:02:32.930> eyelashes<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.530> tend<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.800> match

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
choosing false eyelashes I tend to match

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.410 
choosing false eyelashes I tend to match
them<00:02:34.250> to<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.430> style<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.850> makeup<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.300> I'm

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
them to the style of makeup that I'm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.940 
them to the style of makeup that I'm
wearing<00:02:35.600> if<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:35.960> more<00:02:36.170> minimal<00:02:36.530> look<00:02:36.680> I

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
wearing if it's more minimal look I

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
wearing if it's more minimal look I
prefer<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.610> more<00:02:37.790> natural<00:02:38.210> looking<00:02:38.420> pair<00:02:38.720> and

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
prefer a more natural looking pair and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.360 
prefer a more natural looking pair and
if<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.320> more<00:02:39.530> dramatic<00:02:39.980> look

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
if it's more dramatic look

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.280 
if it's more dramatic look
I<00:02:40.400> find<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> lashes<00:02:41.390> should<00:02:41.570> be<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.810> same<00:02:42.050> I

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
I find the lashes should be the same I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.080 
I find the lashes should be the same I
just<00:02:42.770> think<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.010> makes<00:02:43.160> it<00:02:43.370> look<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.700> little<00:02:43.850> bit

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
just think it makes it look a little bit

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.480 
just think it makes it look a little bit
better<00:02:44.180> when<00:02:44.420> they<00:02:44.540> balance<00:02:44.870> out<00:02:45.340> so<00:02:46.340> that's

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
better when they balance out so that's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.860 
better when they balance out so that's
the<00:02:46.640> eye<00:02:46.670> makeup<00:02:47.030> done<00:02:47.240> now<00:02:47.450> we'll<00:02:47.570> move<00:02:47.690> on<00:02:47.840> to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
the eye makeup done now we'll move on to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.600 
the eye makeup done now we'll move on to
the<00:02:48.020> contouring<00:02:48.470> blush<00:02:48.740> lips<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.400> all<00:02:49.460> of

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
the contouring blush lips and all of

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.750 
the contouring blush lips and all of
that<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.470> began<00:02:51.710> by<00:02:51.890> setting<00:02:52.190> my<00:02:52.220> foundation

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that so I began by setting my foundation

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.370 
that so I began by setting my foundation
using<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:53.060> matte<00:02:53.210> powder<00:02:53.420> Rimmel<00:02:54.080> stay<00:02:54.260> matte

using a matte powder Rimmel stay matte
which<00:02:54.800> is<00:02:54.950> an<00:02:55.040> old<00:02:55.160> favorite<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.640> mine<00:02:55.820> now<00:02:56.750> for

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
which is an old favorite of mine now for

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.480 
which is an old favorite of mine now for
the<00:02:56.990> contouring<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.620> always<00:02:57.860> use<00:02:58.010> matte<00:02:58.250> powder

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
the contouring I always use matte powder

the contouring I always use matte powder
eye<00:02:58.640> shadow<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.150> do<00:02:59.240> this<00:02:59.360> but<00:02:59.570> lately<00:02:59.750> I've

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
eye shadow to do this but lately I've

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.900 
eye shadow to do this but lately I've
been<00:03:00.080> looking<00:03:00.380> into<00:03:00.440> cream<00:03:00.740> contouring<00:03:01.250> I've

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
been looking into cream contouring I've

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.250 
been looking into cream contouring I've
never<00:03:02.150> tried<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.480> but<00:03:02.750> I'm<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.930> little<00:03:02.960> bit

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
never tried it but I'm a little bit

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.870 
never tried it but I'm a little bit
curious<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:04.040> something<00:03:04.460> that<00:03:04.580> I'm<00:03:04.670> thinking

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
curious it's something that I'm thinking

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.390 
curious it's something that I'm thinking
of<00:03:05.150> trying<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:05.870> haven't<00:03:06.080> really<00:03:06.400> decided

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
of trying I just haven't really decided

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.570 
of trying I just haven't really decided
what<00:03:07.990> product<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.470> try<00:03:09.800> that<00:03:10.250> would<00:03:10.400> be<00:03:10.490> the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
what product to try that would be the

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:23.250 
what product to try that would be the
right<00:03:10.700> color

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.110 

once<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:24.010> was<00:03:24.159> done<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> contouring<00:03:24.819> I<00:03:24.970> did<00:03:25.090> a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
once I was done the contouring I did a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.670 
once I was done the contouring I did a
tiny<00:03:25.360> bit<00:03:25.569> of<00:03:25.659> highlighting<00:03:26.050> using<00:03:26.409> the<00:03:26.500> same

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
tiny bit of highlighting using the same

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:43.640 
tiny bit of highlighting using the same
shimmery<00:03:27.010> cream<00:03:27.190> eyeshadow<00:03:27.670> from<00:03:27.819> earlier

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.350 

I<00:03:43.709> then<00:03:44.370> applied<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.640> bit<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.879> a<00:03:44.939> deep<00:03:45.090> pink

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
I then applied a bit of a deep pink

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.119 
I then applied a bit of a deep pink
blush<00:03:45.629> but<00:03:45.870> only<00:03:45.989> very<00:03:46.200> sparingly<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.069> it

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
blush but only very sparingly so it

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.170 
blush but only very sparingly so it
didn't<00:03:47.310> come<00:03:47.430> up<00:03:47.519> too<00:03:47.670> well<00:03:47.819> on<00:03:47.939> camera

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
didn't come up too well on camera

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.509 
didn't come up too well on camera
unfortunately<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.170> followed<00:03:49.950> up<00:03:50.069> by<00:03:50.099> using<00:03:50.340> my

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
unfortunately I followed up by using my

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.009 
unfortunately I followed up by using my
powder<00:03:50.760> brush<00:03:50.879> to<00:03:51.239> blend<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.540> out<00:03:51.689> just<00:03:51.840> a
