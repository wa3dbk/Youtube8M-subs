would create incentive for buyers the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.690 
would create incentive for buyers the
problem<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> lot<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.350> these<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
problem is is a lot of these so the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.179 
problem is is a lot of these so the
winners<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.090> these<00:01:48.390> these<00:01:49.229> these<00:01:49.560> matchings

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
