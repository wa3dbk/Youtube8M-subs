I've gone through a crapload of work so

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.320 
I've gone through a crapload of work so
I<00:00:09.719> said<00:00:10.260> might<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.620> well<00:00:10.830> take<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.730> video<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.179> it

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
I said might as well take a video of it

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.970 
I said might as well take a video of it
whoever<00:00:13.320> is<00:00:14.250> deciding<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.710> DIY<00:00:16.710> for

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
whoever is deciding to do a DIY for

whoever is deciding to do a DIY for
curtain<00:00:19.980> airbags<00:00:24.410> this<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> little<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.300> guess

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
curtain airbags this is a little I guess

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.919 
curtain airbags this is a little I guess
I<00:00:27.420> give<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.869> bit<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> orientation

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
I give you a little bit of orientation

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.389 
I give you a little bit of orientation
so<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> started<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.470> by<00:00:31.650> taking<00:00:31.890> some<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so I started out by taking some of the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.500 
so I started out by taking some of the
trim<00:00:32.640> pieces<00:00:32.850> off

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
trim pieces off

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.110 
trim pieces off
for<00:00:34.410> example<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.950> there's<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.880> piece

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
for example this there's a little piece

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.819 
for example this there's a little piece
that<00:00:36.180> went<00:00:36.510> right<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.930> pretty<00:00:37.739> much

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that went right here pretty much

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.020 
that went right here pretty much
straightforward<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.460> clip<00:00:38.790> off<00:00:40.820> seems<00:00:41.820> kind

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
straightforward just clip off seems kind

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.400 
straightforward just clip off seems kind
of<00:00:42.059> empty<00:00:42.149> because<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.660> took<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.989> seat<00:00:43.200> bailout

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
of empty because I took a seat bailout

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.720 
of empty because I took a seat bailout
as<00:00:43.710> well<00:00:44.120> but<00:00:45.120> um<00:00:46.160> guess<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.280> could<00:00:47.430> start<00:00:47.670> by

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
as well but um guess you could start by

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
as well but um guess you could start by
taking<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.920> this<00:00:49.969> weather<00:00:50.969> stripping<00:00:51.260> it's

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.780 
here the handles I took those out just
to<00:02:27.170> make<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.320> easier<00:02:27.980> for<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.280> headliner<00:02:28.640> to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
to make it easier for the headliner to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.170 
to make it easier for the headliner to
come<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.400> headline<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.880> pretty<00:02:32.090> much

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
come down the headline is pretty much

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.840 
come down the headline is pretty much
clipped<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:32.840> well<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:34.040> long<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.670> you

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
clipped on as well so as long as you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.570 
clipped on as well so as long as you
take<00:02:35.060> these<00:02:35.750> little<00:02:36.110> handles<00:02:36.830> out<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.370> should

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
take these little handles out you should

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.670 
take these little handles out you should
be<00:02:37.730> good<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.180> took<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.750> one<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.080> as<00:02:39.200> well<00:02:39.410> I

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
be good I took this one out as well I

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.830 
be good I took this one out as well I
didn't<00:02:40.610> feel<00:02:40.730> like<00:02:40.850> disconnecting<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.600> just

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
didn't feel like disconnecting it just

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.290 
didn't feel like disconnecting it just
because<00:02:42.050> I'm<00:02:42.350> like<00:02:42.530> if<00:02:42.740> it<00:02:43.640> won't<00:02:43.760> do<00:02:43.970> much<00:02:44.150> of

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
because I'm like if it won't do much of

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.140 
because I'm like if it won't do much of
a<00:02:44.360> harm<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.620> just<00:02:46.280> pretty<00:02:46.610> much<00:02:46.790> took<00:02:47.000> out

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
a harm so I just pretty much took out

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.590 
a harm so I just pretty much took out
the<00:02:47.240> screws<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.750> let<00:02:48.709> her<00:02:48.800> hang<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.220> there

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
the screws and let her hang in there

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.199 
the screws and let her hang in there
just<00:02:50.600> so<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.810> could<00:02:51.550> take<00:02:52.550> out<00:02:52.730> those<00:02:52.880> clips

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
just so I could take out those clips

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.050 
just so I could take out those clips
from<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.200> headliner<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.280> give<00:02:55.580> me<00:02:55.700> some<00:02:55.880> room

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
from the headliner so give me some room

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.449 
from the headliner so give me some room
to<00:02:56.150> take<00:02:56.300> out<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.600> air<00:02:57.530> back<00:02:57.740> all<00:02:58.310> righty<00:02:58.640> so
