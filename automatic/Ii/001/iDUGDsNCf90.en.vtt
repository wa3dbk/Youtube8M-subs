black<00:00:53.449> cats<00:00:53.659> take<00:00:53.989> on<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.679> fabled<00:00:55.570> roland

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
black cats take on the fabled roland

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.219 
black cats take on the fabled roland
pedal<00:00:56.870> called<00:00:57.109> the<00:00:57.260> Biba<00:00:58.000> it's<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.269> dual<00:00:59.870> mode

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
pedal called the Biba it's a dual mode

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.349 
pedal called the Biba it's a dual mode
fuss<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:00.890> has<00:01:01.039> two<00:01:01.280> different<00:01:01.460> fuzz<00:01:01.820> sounds

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
fuss it has two different fuzz sounds

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.779 
fuss it has two different fuzz sounds
and<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.719> also<00:01:02.869> has<00:01:03.049> a<00:01:03.199> clean<00:01:03.530> boost<00:01:03.799> that<00:01:04.549> you

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
and it also has a clean boost that you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.240 
and it also has a clean boost that you
can<00:01:04.939> toggle<00:01:05.210> instead<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.380> fuzz<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.189> you

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
can toggle instead of the fuzz so you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.310 
can toggle instead of the fuzz so you
can't<00:01:07.700> have<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.149> boost<00:01:08.360> and<00:01:08.630> fuzz<00:01:08.899> on<00:01:09.080> at<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
can't have the boost and fuzz on at the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.770 
can't have the boost and fuzz on at the
same<00:01:09.500> time<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.090> shouldn't<00:01:11.360> say<00:01:11.539> clean

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
same time and I shouldn't say clean

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.850 
same time and I shouldn't say clean
boots<00:01:11.990> because<00:01:12.140> really<00:01:12.380> it's<00:01:12.560> kind<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.770> a

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
boots because really it's kind of a

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.649 
boots because really it's kind of a
colored<00:01:13.250> boost<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.700> not<00:01:13.880> adding<00:01:14.179> distortion

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
colored boost it's not adding distortion

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.260 
colored boost it's not adding distortion
but<00:01:14.810> it<00:01:14.899> definitely<00:01:15.110> adds<00:01:15.850> some<00:01:17.080> some<00:01:19.270> mid

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
but it definitely adds some some mid

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.840 
but it definitely adds some some mid
range<00:01:23.229> but<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.560> main<00:01:24.770> main<00:01:25.190> attraction<00:01:25.759> to

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
range but the main main attraction to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.270 
range but the main main attraction to
this<00:01:25.970> pedal<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.780> very<00:01:27.229> distinctive<00:01:28.009> fuzz

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
this pedal is the very distinctive fuzz

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.980 
this pedal is the very distinctive fuzz
sounds<00:01:28.700> that<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:28.940> offers<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.569> what<00:01:29.720> you<00:01:29.840> just

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
sounds that it offers and what you just

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.999 
sounds that it offers and what you just
heard<00:01:30.200> was<00:01:30.259> the<00:01:30.649> B<00:01:31.039> side<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.659> fuzz<00:01:33.170> which

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
heard was the B side of the fuzz which

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.880 
heard was the B side of the fuzz which
is<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.340> very<00:01:34.549> cutting<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.750> present<00:01:36.380> fuzz<00:01:36.649> and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
is a very cutting and present fuzz and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.600 
is a very cutting and present fuzz and
it's<00:01:37.700> particularly<00:01:38.299> useful<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.340> way<00:01:40.459> it

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
it's particularly useful for the way it

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.570 
it's particularly useful for the way it
cuts<00:01:40.850> through<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.600> live<00:01:41.990> or<00:01:42.350> recorded<00:01:42.409> mix<00:01:43.340> and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
cuts through a live or recorded mix and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.249 
cuts through a live or recorded mix and
it<00:01:44.119> preserves<00:01:44.330> enough<00:01:44.959> of<00:01:45.369> attack<00:01:46.369> transient

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
it preserves enough of attack transient

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.719 
it preserves enough of attack transient
that<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:48.409> can<00:01:48.560> use<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:48.770> for<00:01:49.039> some<00:01:49.220> percussive

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
that you can use it for some percussive

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.529 
that you can use it for some percussive
parts<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.360> even<00:01:51.050> full<00:01:51.319> chords<00:01:51.830> so<00:01:52.069> even<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.910> you

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
parts and even full chords so even a you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.660 
parts and even full chords so even a you
know<00:01:53.660> minor<00:01:53.869> 7<00:01:54.349> or<00:01:54.950> minor<00:01:55.789> 9<00:01:56.060> chord<00:01:57.129> still<00:01:58.129> kind

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
know minor 7 or minor 9 chord still kind

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.790 
know minor 7 or minor 9 chord still kind
of<00:01:58.849> has<00:01:59.209> the<00:01:59.509> necessary<00:02:02.200> string<00:02:03.200> separation

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
of has the necessary string separation

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.109 
of has the necessary string separation
to<00:02:03.890> sound<00:02:04.099> like<00:02:04.250> what<00:02:04.429> it's<00:02:04.550> supposed<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:04.879> and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
to sound like what it's supposed to and

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.969 
to sound like what it's supposed to and
that<00:02:05.599> allows<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.170> to<00:02:06.349> do<00:02:06.500> some<00:02:06.709> kind<00:02:06.860> of

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
that allows you to do some kind of

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.919 
that allows you to do some kind of
percussive<00:02:07.280> stuff<00:02:07.729> even<00:02:08.179> with<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.360> fairly<00:02:08.899> high

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
percussive stuff even with a fairly high

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.430 
percussive stuff even with a fairly high
gain<00:02:09.890> setting<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.519> have<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.510> stuff<00:02:12.080> sort<00:02:12.349> of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
gain setting and have the stuff sort of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:34.710 
gain setting and have the stuff sort of
sound<00:02:13.190> halfway<00:02:13.489> decent

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.260 

yeah<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.340> uh<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.450> that's<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.110> you<00:02:38.350> know<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
yeah so uh and that's it you know a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.570 
yeah so uh and that's it you know a
pretty<00:02:40.270> high<00:02:40.450> gain<00:02:41.110> pretty<00:02:41.530> high<00:02:41.710> what<00:02:42.460> they

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
pretty high gain pretty high what they

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.280 
pretty high gain pretty high what they
call<00:02:42.760> sustained

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.360 

with<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.129> whole<00:02:48.400> lot<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.849> with<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.599> whole<00:02:49.870> lot<00:02:50.110> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
with a whole lot of with a whole lot of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.699 
with a whole lot of with a whole lot of
sustained<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.609> it<00:02:51.760> so<00:02:51.939> if<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.540> backed<00:02:52.810> down<00:02:53.439> on

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
sustained to it so if you backed down on

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.940 
sustained to it so if you backed down on
the<00:02:53.920> sustained<00:02:54.609> setting<00:02:55.000> you'd<00:02:55.150> get<00:02:55.359> done

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the sustained setting you'd get done

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.140 
the sustained setting you'd get done
even<00:02:56.950> more<00:02:57.189> definition<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.939> string

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
even more definition and string

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.569 
even more definition and string
separation<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.409> roll<00:02:59.650> off<00:02:59.859> your<00:02:59.890> volume

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
separation if you roll off your volume

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.670 
separation if you roll off your volume
control<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.689> will<00:03:01.870> clean<00:03:02.079> up<00:03:02.109> a<00:03:02.319> little<00:03:02.500> bit

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
control it will clean up a little bit

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.140 
control it will clean up a little bit
not<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:03.040> much<00:03:03.219> as<00:03:03.280> something<00:03:03.670> like<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.819> fuzz

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
not as much as something like a fuzz

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.479 
not as much as something like a fuzz
face<00:03:04.359> but<00:03:05.290> if<00:03:05.379> we<00:03:05.470> go<00:03:05.590> down<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.890> about<00:03:05.980> half<00:03:06.250> on

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
face but if we go down to about half on

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:16.020 
face but if we go down to about half on
the<00:03:06.579> volume<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:10.480> do<00:03:10.659> get<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:14.700> more<00:03:15.700> attack

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
the volume you do get more more attack

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.420 
the volume you do get more more attack
and<00:03:16.480> more<00:03:16.959> clarity<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:17.889> even<00:03:18.129> a<00:03:18.189> little<00:03:18.340> bit

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
and more clarity and even a little bit

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.960 
and more clarity and even a little bit
of<00:03:18.579> clean<00:03:18.819> tone<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.329> there<00:03:20.040> come<00:03:21.040> up<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.430> just

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
of clean tone in there come up and just

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.640 
of clean tone in there come up and just
roll<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.420> back<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.900> little<00:03:22.930> bit<00:03:23.230> here's

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
roll it back just a little bit here's

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.699 
roll it back just a little bit here's

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
get a little bit more of a scoop down

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.319 
get a little bit more of a scoop down
and<00:03:34.689> again<00:03:34.900> more<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.859> attack<00:03:36.180> which<00:03:37.180> is

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
and again more of the attack which is

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.379 
and again more of the attack which is
nice<00:03:37.510> for<00:03:37.540> rhythm<00:03:38.049> parts<00:03:39.060> roll<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.209> back<00:03:40.329> up

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
nice for rhythm parts roll it back up

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.520 
nice for rhythm parts roll it back up
for<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.810> week<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.780> back<00:03:44.019> down<00:03:44.230> for<00:03:44.470> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
for the week and back down for the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.920 
for the week and back down for the
middle<00:03:44.799> parts<00:03:45.129> works<00:03:45.639> well<00:03:45.909> it<00:03:46.180> works<00:03:46.419> well<00:03:46.659> as

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
middle parts works well it works well as

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.649 
middle parts works well it works well as
a<00:03:46.959> as<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.980> live<00:03:48.310> pedal<00:03:48.819> where<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.150> want<00:03:49.359> to<00:03:49.450> get

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
a as a live pedal where you want to get

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.930 
a as a live pedal where you want to get
a<00:03:49.720> range<00:03:50.049> of<00:03:50.260> sounds<00:03:50.500> with<00:03:51.459> your<00:03:51.609> volume

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
a range of sounds with your volume

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.879 
a range of sounds with your volume
control<00:03:52.299> now<00:03:52.449> if<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:53.139> go<00:03:53.260> over<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.650> buzz

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
control now if we go over to the buzz

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.089 
control now if we go over to the buzz
side<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.459> pedal<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:55.120> get<00:03:55.329> a<00:03:55.359> more

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
side of the pedal we get a more

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:05.950 
side of the pedal we get a more
mid-range<00:03:57.099> II<00:03:57.549> kind<00:03:57.849> of<00:03:57.879> corpulent<00:03:58.449> fuzz<00:03:58.690> with

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.370 

it<00:04:06.680> still<00:04:07.040> has<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.310> kind<00:04:07.730> of<00:04:08.050> sort<00:04:09.050> of<00:04:09.140> upper

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
it still has that kind of sort of upper

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.020 
it still has that kind of sort of upper
mid-range<00:04:09.590> resonance<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.610> it<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:10.910> it's

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
mid-range resonance to it but it's

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.820 
mid-range resonance to it but it's
filled<00:04:11.300> out<00:04:11.480> with<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> lot<00:04:11.870> more<00:04:11.900> lower<00:04:12.560> mid

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
filled out with a lot more lower mid

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.820 
filled out with a lot more lower mid
range<00:04:13.010> now<00:04:13.280> for<00:04:13.820> some<00:04:14.000> just<00:04:14.210> spectacular<00:04:14.450> if<00:04:15.440> I

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
range now for some just spectacular if I

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:27.029 
range now for some just spectacular if I
may<00:04:16.400> say<00:04:16.640> so<00:04:16.670> Lee<00:04:17.030> tones

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.650 

and<00:04:28.039> we're<00:04:28.190> not<00:04:28.310> playing<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.820> high<00:04:29.210> volumes

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
and we're not playing it high volumes

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:37.000 
and we're not playing it high volumes
here

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.500 

and<00:04:38.010> just<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.340> same<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:39.060> know<00:04:39.180> we<00:04:39.330> get<00:04:39.480> a

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
and just the same you know we get a

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.960 
and just the same you know we get a
really<00:04:40.080> nice<00:04:40.260> decay<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.100> even<00:04:41.430> with<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.610> little

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
really nice decay and even with a little

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.620 
really nice decay and even with a little
bit<00:04:42.210> of<00:04:43.340> my<00:04:44.340> bridge<00:04:44.580> pickup<00:04:44.910> up<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.120> bet<00:04:45.389> I<00:04:45.419> can't

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
bit of my bridge pickup up a bet I can't

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.879 
bit of my bridge pickup up a bet I can't
even<00:04:45.870> get<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:45.990> little<00:04:46.199> bit<00:04:46.290> of<00:04:46.320> feedback<00:04:46.530> at

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
even get a little bit of feedback at

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:56.930 
even get a little bit of feedback at
this<00:04:47.010> point<00:04:53.630> well<00:04:54.630> maybe<00:04:54.840> not<00:04:55.370> come<00:04:56.370> up<00:04:56.520> just<00:04:56.760> a

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
this point well maybe not come up just a

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:09.350 
this point well maybe not come up just a
little<00:04:57.060> bit<00:04:57.180> more<00:05:07.910> we're<00:05:08.910> not<00:05:09.000> gonna<00:05:09.120> sit<00:05:09.330> here

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
little bit more we're not gonna sit here

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.969 
little bit more we're not gonna sit here
all<00:05:09.540> day<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.990> watch<00:05:10.110> me<00:05:10.350> try<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.590> get<00:05:10.770> feedback

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
all day and watch me try to get feedback

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.950 
all day and watch me try to get feedback
at<00:05:11.340> low<00:05:11.490> volumes<00:05:11.880> but<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.300> will<00:05:12.450> do<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.870> was

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
at low volumes but it will do it it was

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.650 
at low volumes but it will do it it was
doing<00:05:13.260> it<00:05:13.380> before<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:13.710> swear<00:05:14.190> um<00:05:15.090> but

doing it before I swear um but

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.850 
doing it before I swear um but
nevertheless<00:05:15.900> it's<00:05:16.320> it's<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.680> very<00:05:18.860> compelling

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
nevertheless it's it's a very compelling

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.090 
nevertheless it's it's a very compelling
lead<00:05:20.280> tone<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.880> that<00:05:21.180> again<00:05:21.570> is<00:05:21.780> is<00:05:22.500> quite

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
lead tone that that again is is quite

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.219 
lead tone that that again is is quite
thick<00:05:23.700> but<00:05:24.090> still<00:05:24.540> kind<00:05:24.780> of<00:05:24.840> defined

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
thick but still kind of defined

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:28.480 
thick but still kind of defined
especially<00:05:25.770> on<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:25.950> bottom

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.100

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
and sits just beautifully in a mix it

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.390 
and sits just beautifully in a mix it
doesn't<00:05:31.440> have<00:05:31.590> a<00:05:31.620> whole<00:05:31.889> lot<00:05:31.919> of<00:05:32.100> low-end

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
doesn't have a whole lot of low-end

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.379 
doesn't have a whole lot of low-end
thump<00:05:32.910> but<00:05:33.419> quite<00:05:33.660> frankly<00:05:34.100> how<00:05:35.100> often<00:05:35.610> does

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
thump but quite frankly how often does

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.820 
thump but quite frankly how often does
that<00:05:36.569> do<00:05:36.720> anything<00:05:36.750> other<00:05:37.139> than<00:05:37.380> muddy<00:05:37.620> up

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
that do anything other than muddy up

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.650 
that do anything other than muddy up
your<00:05:38.069> live<00:05:38.550> or<00:05:38.729> recorded<00:05:38.759> mix<00:05:39.360> when<00:05:39.539> it's

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
your live or recorded mix when it's

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.240 
your live or recorded mix when it's
coming<00:05:39.840> off<00:05:40.020> a<00:05:40.050> guitar<00:05:40.440> assuming<00:05:41.039> there's<00:05:41.190> a

be pushing the front end of the amp with

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
a lot more mid-range content and you're

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.619 
a lot more mid-range content and you're
going<00:07:24.159> to<00:07:24.250> get<00:07:24.340> a<00:07:24.400> kind<00:07:24.669> of<00:07:24.759> fatter<00:07:25.060> breakup

00:07:25.619 --> 00:07:25.629

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:27.330 
going to get a kind of fatter breakup
sound<00:07:25.900> so<00:07:26.139> with<00:07:26.409> a<00:07:26.440> bright<00:07:26.740> amp<00:07:26.949> I<00:07:27.069> think<00:07:27.250> it

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:27.340 
sound so with a bright amp I think it

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.459 
sound so with a bright amp I think it
would<00:07:27.460> be<00:07:27.580> really<00:07:28.090> awesome<00:07:28.360> especially<00:07:28.900> with

00:07:29.459 --> 00:07:29.469 
would be really awesome especially with

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:31.619 
would be really awesome especially with
single<00:07:29.830> coils<00:07:30.190> when<00:07:30.729> you<00:07:30.849> want<00:07:31.120> more<00:07:31.389> of<00:07:31.449> a

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:31.629 
single coils when you want more of a

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.270 
single coils when you want more of a
kind<00:07:31.840> of<00:07:31.900> humbucker<00:07:32.319> a<00:07:32.440> lead<00:07:32.710> sound<00:07:33.009> probably

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 
kind of humbucker a lead sound probably

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.909 
kind of humbucker a lead sound probably
would<00:07:33.669> stack<00:07:34.060> weight<00:07:34.419> with<00:07:35.110> the<00:07:35.319> other<00:07:35.530> pedals

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
would stack weight with the other pedals

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:37.379 
would stack weight with the other pedals
in<00:07:36.039> fact<00:07:36.280> I<00:07:36.400> don't<00:07:36.490> know<00:07:36.610> why<00:07:36.729> I<00:07:36.759> said<00:07:36.789> probably

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:37.389 
in fact I don't know why I said probably

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.689 
in fact I don't know why I said probably
because<00:07:37.629> in<00:07:37.750> fact<00:07:37.960> and<00:07:38.280> it's<00:07:39.280> been<00:07:39.490> a<00:07:39.520> couple

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:39.699 
because in fact and it's been a couple

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.850 
because in fact and it's been a couple
weeks<00:07:39.849> but<00:07:40.150> I<00:07:40.330> did<00:07:40.719> actually<00:07:40.930> use<00:07:41.440> this<00:07:41.650> on<00:07:41.830> a

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860 
weeks but I did actually use this on a

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.980 
weeks but I did actually use this on a
couple<00:07:42.219> gigs<00:07:42.460> and<00:07:42.729> I<00:07:43.060> did<00:07:43.210> stack<00:07:43.509> it<00:07:43.690> with<00:07:43.719> an<00:07:43.900> M

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:43.990 
couple gigs and I did stack it with an M

couple gigs and I did stack it with an M
Ariza<00:07:44.289> frats<00:07:44.650> it's<00:07:44.919> and<00:07:45.190> it<00:07:45.310> really<00:07:45.759> did<00:07:46.029> sound

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 
Ariza frats it's and it really did sound

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.269 
Ariza frats it's and it really did sound
fantastic<00:07:46.960> the<00:07:47.110> boost<00:07:47.319> work<00:07:47.650> really<00:07:48.039> really
