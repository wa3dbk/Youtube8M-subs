00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.490
 effort makes sense 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.529
 you have curred it with certain 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.810
 spent a pasta on equipment and what you 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.270

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.550
 super name you have made super photos 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.829
 morona you searched for a rehearsal room 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.780
 you have rehearsed a lot already you have 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.800
 your own songs you already have 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.519
 where to play and today you are going to give everything 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.519
 the stage 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:58.430
 we have to tell something where I do not 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.559
 they love 27 how beautiful everything is 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.559
 gorgeous you get on and pull to play 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:09.450
 when you see our idols so beautiful 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.180
 so perfect on the stage have 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 had to go through this or not dismounted 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.390
 what I think I loaded everything in the 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 car and taken to the concert site 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.320
 that can be seven hours away by car 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 we all go unpainted because we have not 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460
 awakened at seven in the morning to 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.350
 that everyone pays 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.799
 always good and that of having pipes that 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 you mount it all, these are not my pipes 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:46.730
 and well maybe I have to load your 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.770
 team but usually the bands and 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.300
 two beam the sound test has to 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.350
 listen well to yourself but also 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.350
 to the rest of your band 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.030
 Well, it's fine, maybe you have a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.240
 a little bit to rest somewhere with 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.420
 your mates before the concert 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.940
 or the car or some stairs makes money 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.520
 sleeping or the site that the organizer 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.160
 I want to call the more I say the dressing room 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.780
 Dressers will be lucky if in addition to 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.780
 everything puts you accommodation 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.890
 3 and finally your moment has arrived 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.580
 expectant shouts from your audience that 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.580
 chanted the name of your band 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.790
 what piece of name and you go out to the scene 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.070
 here two factors come into play what 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.960
 it depends on the band and what does not 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.350
 I broke a rope in the middle of a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.660
 song or a key or you drop it 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.930
 a stick or a key 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.850
 oak although the bass is strained with 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.250
 mistake a note or trip you can 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.820
 want to say something to someone and not 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.680
 I'll look at you but you'll always have what 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.620
 we define scenario asia 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.750
 and the rush does not 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.340
 if it was now maria maria 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.340
 yes yes I know white according 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.170
 but there are other things that do not depend on 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.550
 the band like the bassist disappears 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.980
 and smoke comes 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.710
 and it's not odorless and not what sometimes 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.980
 They put some wonderful blinding lights 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.520
 that are called like that with which you see everything 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.160
 Super good 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.230
 my god if you exist accompanies my fingers 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.910
 by the scale of fa because I do not see no 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.760
 I'm planning too much I 'm going to throw up 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.340
 throw up that vomit you remember that 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.959
 you did a sound test 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.700
 well sometimes onstage 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.700
 you end up listening to this 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.080
 nothing happens your shooter to the worst that 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.459
 can happen is that you go to light 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.459
 but that does not happen 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.709
 it's a suv 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.900
 but do not fear that we may be what 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.180
 worse sure you have an audience 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.160
 exceptional and that most of these 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.959
 failures will go unnoticed good 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.270
 the blackout and everything is worth it 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.690
 a greeting on our fan blog and it 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.170
 it works a lot in each patient 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.680
 and finally if you have done great 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.200
 people applaud 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.390
 many are the traitors 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:43.210

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.729
 pain 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.490
 good 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.720
