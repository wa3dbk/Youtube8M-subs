00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:08.429
 hello people and welcome to the first 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.610
 chapter of this first season of the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.950
 flight school I created 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.209
 in this first season is what 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.100
 let's see is going to be a little 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.100
 initiation of 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.440
 the handling of small aircraft like 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.420
 it can be this plane and in the last 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.940
 season in the third let's see the 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.930
 handling large aircraft as they can 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.670
 be 747 over 380 bus and we're going to 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.230
 get 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.600
 then chapters then chapters 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.910
 three seasons of four habit hours 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.559
 each one in this first chapter what 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:45.340
 let's see is going to be the initiation the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.340
 cabin preparation 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.940
 the ignition and the shutdown is to say a 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.470
 little of all road preparation 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.060
 We are in this oriÃ³n and is thus 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.100
 let's do the practices this first 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.870
 season 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.790
 this is the cabin of this orion and the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.380
 truth is that it is very simple that is if 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.720
 You see this one 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.850
 it looks very little compared to with airplanes 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.850
 more advanced has very little 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.000
 two screens that are essential vouchers 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.100
 this first thing we see two screens 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.600
 that are essential the first one is going to 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.760
 indicate heaven the earth 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.650
 l'aquila the height the speed that 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.170
 arrives we take it and here the course by 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.110
 where the plane follows this is like a gps 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 it are essential and these will 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.040
 configure what the pilot is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 automatic how it goes with you fast 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.280
 automatic on this aircraft with this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.759
 course height navigation buttons 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 height everything is going to be those buttons by 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.210
 this already for that reason that although there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 chosen a violent one is already a little 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.890
 more this is a bit advanced, it is already a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.570
 little bit 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.760
 with good technology bottle in this 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.220
 list we will find in the part 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.520
 top the lights that are right now 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.950
 all off we're going to say when a 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.470
 little let's put the we're going to 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.220
 find indicators that can never 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.930
 missing as here because here we are going to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.380
 repeat a bit the same thing that is going to 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.870
 give these two screens but good they will 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.550
 come here to guide us let's tell 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.989
 landing gear the quadrant 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.050
 throttle 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.290
 fraps this flaps 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.410
 and these three buttons two red one black 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.140
 that will mark what is the ignition 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
 of the aircraft that is what we're going to 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.180
 learn in this tutorial in this first 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.730
 chapter and also just above we are going to 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.990
 find an essential thing that has it 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.240
 that has this aircraft that are the 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.280
 spoilers that are the spoilers about 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.660
 small ailerons that is the one that 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.010
 found in the buttonhole on the wings of 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.860
 planes not everyone and they get up 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.150
 when they touch the ground and they stop 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.909
 the plane 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.670
 it is active we give it turn yellow 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:05.819
 and they are activated and they are removed and we are going to 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.159
 see what they are in this aircraft I'm going to 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.040
 give it to him and this time he has risen 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:15.269
 some things in red some ailerons 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:20.220
 There you go, that's good for stopping 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.409
 the plane is worth a braking system and 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.060
 it does not have it that's why this aircraft is still 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.950
 well it is quite advanced now 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.580
 very well let's proceed with the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:35.050
 ignition of the cabin so good we 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.230
 let's go to these three buttons that the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.880
 has all the planes of this 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.440
 simulator 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.730
 and the first thing we have to do is 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.740
 look at the big one that is the one of the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.300
 avionics and avionics will us 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.780
 turn on all systems or 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.940
 systems inside the aircraft 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.130
 we go to black which is the plane's 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.640
 avionics we give it and it does not turn on 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.640
 screens 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.850
 it does not turn on what the screens are 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 what I told you heaven on earth 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:09.590
 the course to we are at the airport 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:13.430
 bilbao and well then in this case here 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:16.120
 the gps represents 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.739
 and the Cantabrian Sea 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.070
 and the sea happens that does not represent your gps 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.290
 exact and now we have the first part 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.240
 turned on and now we go to the second 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.139
 part that are the two red buttons that 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.580
 they are the alternator that is 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.389
 engines entire engine system 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.180
 we give this one goes on we do not notice 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.009
 nothing but they are on 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:49.669
 let's proceed with the propeller 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:51.680
 because if the propeller is stopped as 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.119
 we see apparently we are the same but 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.169
 we are no longer the same 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:57.589
 now let's turn on the propeller 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.809
 essential as when we place in the 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.849
 quadrant accelerator in the quadrant 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:04.909
 accelerator in this case these three 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.560
 levers red blue and black the black is 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:08.360
 for speed 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.850
 so the black one now does not have to 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.330
 touch it or what you have to touch are these 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:20.710
 two levers red and blue red red 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.169
 mix tell engine off 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.840
 and let's go 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:29.009
 to remove the alternator and we will remove 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.009
 the bionic 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.580
 with 45 steps I have said is 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.250
 turn on and off is this plane and 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.930
 all that has flash and monitor x 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.599
 that easy 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.430
 it does not have any more good because I hope that you 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.430
 have liked what 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.900
 I hope you like this chapter and the 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.000
 that come in the second chapter we're going 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.100
 to talk about ya lohan let's go back to 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.430
 turn on the aircraft let's make a 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.800
 backward momentum is to say a the 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.110
 backward filming 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.870
 let's roll through the airport until 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.480
 get to track to take off thanks 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.190
 see him 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.190
 It has been a pleasure to make this video
