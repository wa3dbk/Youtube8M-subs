 hello in this video I'll show you this 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.450
 game that I did myself and I hope that you 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.610
 like 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.369
 game the normal challenge two players and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.959
 madness let's see the normal mode this 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.930
 game is very simple and it's about watching 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:23.290
 how many times can I press the button 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.930
 in 15 seconds the normal mode we are going to 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.010
 see how fast I am and I'm 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.940
 getting tired 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.940
 we'll see 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.410
 97 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.700
 that is the first mode is a bit 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.160
 fun the truth that I do like me 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.140
 the challenge mode let's see the challenge mode 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.140
 now he asks me my name is simply 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.600
 for the scores I give you start and 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.510
 Now I have to press the button that 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.750
 be activated as we can see 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.030
 let's see this is in 15 seconds 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.030
 to see how many points I can achieve 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.670
 let's see I hope you can 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.410
 install also on your devices and 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.410
 show off your highest scores 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.210
 we'll see 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.000
 61 I achieved 61 my maximum is 80 in this 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.060
 cellular now let's see the next 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.590
 So that is the world of two players 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.390
 let's see it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.900
 we put 1 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 good one 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.770
 two 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 and ready to start as we see now they have 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.340
 two buttons with which the players 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 they have to go by pressing the button as much as 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.860
 quick to see who is the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.570
 faster as you see the red button is 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.149
 looking upside down so that the other player 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 can see your points correctly 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.039
 is that here won the player 1 because 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.259
 I named well we go 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.140
 new at the beginning and now that we would stay 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.179
 the madness mode that that mode is only 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 available in the paid version but 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.519
 very soon it will be available in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.560
 free version and a new mode will be 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.420
 available in the paid version hopefully 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.370
