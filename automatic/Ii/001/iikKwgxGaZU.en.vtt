00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
this is a royal Luger off-speed mission

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
this is a royal Luger off-speed mission
or<00:00:53.160> speedrun<00:00:53.820> whatever<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.539> call<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
or speedrun whatever you want to call it

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.099 
or speedrun whatever you want to call it
um<00:00:56.059> here's<00:00:57.059> what's<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.629> down

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
um here's what's going to be going down

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.930 
um here's what's going to be going down
in<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.500> mission<00:00:58.739> basically<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in this mission basically this is a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
in this mission basically this is a
capture<00:01:00.570> mission<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> kill<00:01:02.489> him

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
capture mission and so when I kill him

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
capture mission and so when I kill him
the<00:01:02.820> quest<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.270> instantly<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
the quest it's instantly going to be a

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.789 
the quest it's instantly going to be a
failure<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.840> ending<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> be

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
failure and so the ending is going to be

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
failure and so the ending is going to be
significantly<00:01:08.070> different<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.180> these

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
significantly different from all these

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
blue smoke just know that he is taking

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.800 
blue smoke just know that he is taking
more<00:03:53.470> sleep<00:03:54.040> inducing<00:03:54.730> stuff<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.329> him<00:03:55.660> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
more sleep inducing stuff in him and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.920 
more sleep inducing stuff in him and
though<00:03:55.989> and<00:03:56.290> so<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.980> sleep<00:03:57.280> is<00:03:57.430> going<00:03:57.609> to<00:03:57.669> be

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
though and so the sleep is going to be

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.619 
though and so the sleep is going to be
brought<00:03:58.930> on<00:03:59.109> a<00:03:59.199> lot<00:03:59.440> quicker<00:03:59.739> and<00:04:00.629> hopefully

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
brought on a lot quicker and hopefully

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.839 
brought on a lot quicker and hopefully
more<00:04:01.810> often<00:04:02.290> although<00:04:03.099> it's<00:04:03.250> not<00:04:03.310> coming<00:04:03.699> in

yeah<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.700> was<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.850> Royal<00:05:24.210> ooh<00:05:24.300> drop<00:05:24.510> speed

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
yeah that was the Royal ooh drop speed

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.330 
yeah that was the Royal ooh drop speed
run<00:05:25.020> even<00:05:25.320> though<00:05:25.350> I<00:05:25.410> failed<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:26.010> was<00:05:26.160> still

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
run even though I failed it was still

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.200 
run even though I failed it was still
the<00:05:26.460> speed<00:05:26.730> run<00:05:26.940> so<00:05:27.540> yeah<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:28.790> don't<00:05:29.790> know<00:05:30.060> if

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
the speed run so yeah I don't know if

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.690 
the speed run so yeah I don't know if
that<00:05:30.360> was<00:05:30.480> longer<00:05:30.750> than<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.170> Ratheon<00:05:31.560> one<00:05:31.890> I'm

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
that was longer than the Ratheon one I'm

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.030 
that was longer than the Ratheon one I'm
really<00:05:33.450> really<00:05:33.840> hoping<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.320> it<00:05:34.620> wasn't

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
really really hoping that it wasn't

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.680 
really really hoping that it wasn't
because<00:05:35.280> that<00:05:35.640> would<00:05:35.730> be<00:05:35.850> really<00:05:36.000> sad<00:05:36.330> if<00:05:36.390> it

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
because that would be really sad if it

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.110 
because that would be really sad if it
was<00:05:36.900> but<00:05:37.200> then<00:05:37.410> again<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.740> was<00:05:38.160> relying<00:05:38.610> on<00:05:38.940> us

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
was but then again I was relying on us

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.870 
was but then again I was relying on us
method<00:05:39.600> that<00:05:39.720> takes<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:40.050> little<00:05:40.170> bit<00:05:40.320> more<00:05:40.530> time

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
method that takes a little bit more time

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.130 
method that takes a little bit more time
you<00:05:41.880> know<00:05:41.970> because<00:05:42.240> on<00:05:42.360> the<00:05:42.450> Ratheon<00:05:42.630> it<00:05:43.020> was

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
you know because on the Ratheon it was

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.410 
you know because on the Ratheon it was
just<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.500> know<00:05:43.530> smasher<00:05:44.340> freakin<00:05:44.730> brains<00:05:45.090> and

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
just you know smasher freakin brains and

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.130 
just you know smasher freakin brains and
with<00:05:45.510> a<00:05:45.540> hammer<00:05:45.840> so<00:05:46.760> yeah<00:05:47.900> anyway<00:05:48.900> that<00:05:49.110> was

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
with a hammer so yeah anyway that was

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.440 
with a hammer so yeah anyway that was
the<00:05:49.350> Royal<00:05:49.710> woot-off<00:05:49.980> speedrun<00:05:50.580> stay<00:05:51.120> tuned
