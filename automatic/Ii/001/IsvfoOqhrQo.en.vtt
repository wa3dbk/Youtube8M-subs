00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.266
 In this lesson we will teach you to change the format of the menu. 

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.266
 Our menu was like this: 

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:18.299
 see this area is with the rounded corners on top. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.000
 When we put the loose menu up here 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.466
 the button would look better 

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:27.599
 with all rounded corners or all square corners. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.366
 To do this, go to "Design Menu". 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.933
 To do this, go to "Design Menu". 

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:39.066
 For you to understand this lesson better, 

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:42.099
 let's choose a new color for all the buttons. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.566
 Click Colors. 

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.099
 Put a color on the normal button. 

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.733
 Click ok. 

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:52.699
 Now click here for songs. 

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:58.632
 See: on these buttons you can choose the size of the curve. 

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:04.033
 Below, the type of button, with curves of various shapes. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.466
 Clicking here, you take all the curves and leave the square button. 

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.766
 There, the button is square. 

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.233
 Note that the button has a very thin border around it. 

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.133
 Let's change the color of this border for you to see better. 

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.332
 We can thicken this border or place the dotted border. 

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.199
 Down here. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.166
 We can have several types of border. From one side of the other. 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.233
 We can have several types of border. From one side of the other. 

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:53.699
 Or you may also have no border. Clicking here. 

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.332
 In this tab "margins", 

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.199
 we can change the margins of the menu buttons 

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:08.433
 See: lateral margin. Vertical. And distance between items. 

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:19.966
 Another thing you can do 

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.699
 is to place shadows in the menu. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.033
 You can do this by clicking here. 

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.033
 This looks good on websites with a clear background. 

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:27.066
 Here's an example: 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.966
 Here's an example: 

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:38.699
 You have seen that there are many possibilities for 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.133
 in the menu design, 

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:43.166
 for you to customize your site, any way you want. 

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:47.066
 Let's now go back and leave no color. 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.133
 Ready! Click save. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.833
 Click "Preview" to see how your site is getting. 

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:16.566
 SitePX 

00:03:16.566 --> 00:03:18.066
 The easiest way to make a website 

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:19.532
 beautiful and functional.
