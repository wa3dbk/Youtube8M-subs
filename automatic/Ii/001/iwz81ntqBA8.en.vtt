it<00:04:35.770> doesn't<00:04:35.980> seem<00:04:36.220> to<00:04:36.250> be<00:04:36.430> much<00:04:36.460> else<00:04:36.850> is<00:04:37.000> there

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
it doesn't seem to be much else is there

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.000 
it doesn't seem to be much else is there
a<00:04:37.150> chain<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.510> get<00:04:37.630> out<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:37.840> outsid<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:38.920> I'm

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
a chain to get out this outsid that I'm

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.780 
a chain to get out this outsid that I'm
just<00:04:39.220> not<00:04:39.340> seeing<00:04:39.610> there<00:04:39.940> we<00:04:40.060> go<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:42.490> place

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
just not seeing there we go this place

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.480 
just not seeing there we go this place
keeps<00:04:43.030> going<00:04:43.360> still<00:04:43.570> let's<00:04:43.720> keep<00:04:43.930> moving<00:04:44.490> I'm

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
keeps going still let's keep moving I'm

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.130 
keeps going still let's keep moving I'm
pretty<00:04:45.820> sure<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.150> will<00:04:46.300> probably<00:04:46.630> lead<00:04:46.930> out

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
pretty sure this will probably lead out

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.470 
pretty sure this will probably lead out
soon<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.650> do<00:04:47.710> seem<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.130> be<00:04:48.310> on<00:04:48.460> deeper<00:04:48.940> so<00:04:49.180> I

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
soon but I do seem to be on deeper so I

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.900 
soon but I do seem to be on deeper so I
can't<00:04:50.050> see<00:04:50.200> how<00:04:50.350> that'll<00:04:50.620> happen<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:51.130> think

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
can't see how that'll happen I think

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.160 
can't see how that'll happen I think
once<00:04:52.060> i<00:04:52.180> drop<00:04:52.360> off<00:04:52.450> here<00:04:52.660> that's<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:52.960> i<00:04:53.080> won't

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
once i drop off here that's it i won't

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.560 
once i drop off here that's it i won't
be<00:04:53.320> able<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.710> back<00:04:53.830> up<00:04:53.890> so<00:04:54.340> let's<00:04:55.180> do<00:04:55.420> it

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
be able to get back up so let's do it

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.760 
be able to get back up so let's do it
let's<00:04:55.780> keep<00:04:55.930> going<00:04:56.170> hopefully<00:04:56.590> there's

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
let's keep going hopefully there's

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.050 
let's keep going hopefully there's
nothing<00:04:57.040> too<00:04:57.160> dangerous<00:04:57.370> down<00:04:57.820> here<00:04:57.880> but

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
nothing too dangerous down here but

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.730 
nothing too dangerous down here but
it'll<00:04:58.240> be<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.360> perfect<00:04:58.630> trap<00:04:59.050> to<00:04:59.170> put<00:04:59.320> some<00:04:59.500> sort

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
it'll be a perfect trap to put some sort

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.590 
it'll be a perfect trap to put some sort
of<00:04:59.800> a<00:04:59.920> a<00:05:00.100> beast<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.850> some<00:05:01.090> sort<00:05:01.330> hang<00:05:01.480> on

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
of a a beast of some sort hang on

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.530 
of a a beast of some sort hang on
there's<00:05:02.260> dead<00:05:02.470> bodies

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.570 

this<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.260> probably<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.620> bad<00:05:06.800> situation<00:05:07.130> that

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
this is probably a bad situation that

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.190 
this is probably a bad situation that
I'm<00:05:07.700> in<00:05:07.730> right<00:05:07.850> now<00:05:09.580> unless<00:05:10.580> I<00:05:10.990> wonder<00:05:11.990> if<00:05:12.080> this

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
I'm in right now unless I wonder if this

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.630 
I'm in right now unless I wonder if this
is<00:05:12.320> where<00:05:12.470> I<00:05:12.500> was<00:05:12.740> before<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:13.130> it's<00:05:13.310> just<00:05:13.520> led

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
is where I was before and it's just led

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.030 
is where I was before and it's just led
me<00:05:13.760> back<00:05:13.910> around<00:05:14.270> yes<00:05:15.260> it<00:05:15.440> is<00:05:15.470> this<00:05:15.710> is<00:05:15.860> where<00:05:15.980> I

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
me back around yes it is this is where I

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.590 
me back around yes it is this is where I
had<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.280> big<00:05:16.460> fight<00:05:16.670> before<00:05:16.850> so<00:05:17.180> we<00:05:17.300> should<00:05:17.510> be

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
had the big fight before so we should be

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.720 
had the big fight before so we should be
in<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.810> clearness<00:05:20.800> so<00:05:21.800> looks<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:22.520> we've

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
in the clearness so looks like we've

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.250 
in the clearness so looks like we've
cleared<00:05:23.000> out<00:05:23.120> this<00:05:23.270> little<00:05:23.450> Gorge<00:05:23.780> wasn't<00:05:24.140> too
