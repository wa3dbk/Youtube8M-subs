00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
now going so we've now got the sparking

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.380 
now going so we've now got the sparking
start<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.590> happen<00:00:41.710> yes<00:00:42.579> it<00:00:42.730> is<00:00:42.850> there<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.150> is

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
start to happen yes it is there it is

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.479 
start to happen yes it is there it is
so<00:00:43.780> I<00:00:43.840> start<00:00:44.079> to<00:00:44.110> happen<00:00:44.320> so<00:00:44.860> I<00:00:44.890> can<00:00:45.070> then<00:00:45.160> put

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
so I start to happen so I can then put

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
so I start to happen so I can then put
this<00:00:45.579> in<00:00:45.760> this<00:00:45.850> bowl<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.510> bowl<00:00:46.570> we<00:00:46.780> sell

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.870 

there<00:00:50.260> goes<00:00:50.470> now<00:00:50.980> it's<00:00:51.550> going<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.730> take

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
there goes now it's going to take

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.270 
there goes now it's going to take
probably<00:00:52.290> we<00:00:53.290> timed<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:53.620> at<00:00:53.710> about<00:00:53.800> seven

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
probably we timed it at about seven

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.799 
probably we timed it at about seven
minutes<00:00:54.579> before<00:00:54.700> it<00:00:55.000> really<00:00:55.180> gets<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.570> point

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
minutes before it really gets to a point

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.960 
minutes before it really gets to a point
where<00:00:56.079> you<00:00:56.200> can<00:00:56.380> start<00:00:56.559> to<00:00:56.680> use<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:56.890> this<00:00:57.790> one

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
where you can start to use it this one

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.270 
where you can start to use it this one
here<00:00:58.420> has<00:00:59.320> actually<00:00:59.649> been<00:00:59.710> going<00:00:59.800> for<00:01:00.100> 10

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
here has actually been going for 10

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.790 
here has actually been going for 10
minutes<00:01:00.610> so<00:01:01.450> it's<00:01:01.630> really<00:01:01.899> really<00:01:02.200> I'll<00:01:02.649> see

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
minutes so it's really really I'll see

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.480 
minutes so it's really really I'll see
if<00:01:02.920> I<00:01:02.950> can<00:01:03.070> pick<00:01:03.190> it<00:01:03.250> up<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.850> might<00:01:04.059> crumble<00:01:04.299> but

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
if I can pick it up it might crumble but

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.000 
if I can pick it up it might crumble but
yeah<00:01:06.490> they<00:01:06.790> go<00:01:06.969> it's<00:01:07.149> actually<00:01:07.590> gray<00:01:08.590> across

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
yeah they go it's actually gray across

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.719 
yeah they go it's actually gray across
the<00:01:09.159> whole<00:01:09.370> top<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.530> then<00:01:12.400> we<00:01:12.490> get<00:01:12.640> the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
the whole top so then we get the

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.710 
the whole top so then we get the
frankincense<00:01:13.180> here<00:01:13.690> and<00:01:14.400> pop<00:01:15.400> on<00:01:15.549> on<00:01:15.820> them<00:01:16.120> on
