00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.810
 Our people today I woke up like 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.870
 scowls looks giant slightly swollen 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.340
 but I will say that I never woke up and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.480
 was faced with a situation similar to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.700
 my ne 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.920
 So today I teach how to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.080
 hide and soften the dark circles 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.029
 accompany them closely that they are well 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 look at my first tip is with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 hide dark circles using 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 colorful corrective 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.099
 many of you already know but other 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.640
 people are still not several tips 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.980
 note there we have collective green 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.040
 I do not know whether to give identified in the video 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.129
 last kiss and neutralizes the ears to the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.629
 red 'of the little bones then 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.989
 you see on your skin a redness 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.390
 tento collective plus a collective of the 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.969
 color of their skin on top and you will see 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.300
 that this reddish color will disappear 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.850
 If you have purplish circles, you have a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 corrective yellow do not know that one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.079
 Yellow kiss, I do not know if you can. 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.629
 see also and then you come up 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.650
 with corrective of your color preference 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.180
 of your skin 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.090
 so you will see that you have the pockets 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.060
 that swelling will take on the color 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.549
 Call is going to leave quickly and now I 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.860
 teach a very different technique than 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.290
 inverted good triangle from near me 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.900
 I'm going to take my black visor and I'm going 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.939
 to draw an imaginary triangle you 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.009
 They do not need to win at home, I'm just going. 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.580
 show you how it 's true 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580
 application 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.240
 We always have our collective 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.240
 shift your skin lighter then not 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.900
 be exaggerated and we apply from the 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.750
 inner corner until the half of the look and 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 There we are going to strike our hands in fear. 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.740
 best way to pass corrective 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.210
 continues to be careful because 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.149
 he is always better because he is who 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.869
 had skin temperature so high giving 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.670
 beats and this deceptive optical disguise 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.600
 your eyes will look like you have less 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.340
 ear 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.860
 I'm going to remove this mark and you're going 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.440
 see how it is already applied collective 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.110
 in my dark circles and now a good 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.369
 your bizarre already put things 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.340
 I really hope you liked it. 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.340
 give the tips a kiss and see you around
