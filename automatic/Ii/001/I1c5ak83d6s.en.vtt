00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.770
 some paper down here inside the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.540
 forest can not find another side I found 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 no paper here so I got one 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.710
 story book of my son and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.960
 You will see where you want to put it. 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.659
 this drawing of you at what time I 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.700
 I left more or less a space of five 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.759
 them on this side here because I 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.220
 I want the drawing 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.920
 I want to trade here and we 'll go 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.939
 to put the carbon paper up here 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.170
 booklet and let's put our 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.530
 here on top of the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.799
 book too now we are very 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 simple you will only get around this 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.900
 that the drawing is just go there 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.620
 underneath it does not get out it's got it 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.840
 at one time use a colored pen 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.540
 not knowing where you outline and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.950
 only to remove the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.409
 cláudio drawing here does not take to the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.530
 cardboard or free to put 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:53.349
 underneath for power is not closed booked 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.420
 which is at that time that stain the drawing 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.000
 So I chose this drawing that is 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.030
 very easy to do either way because 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.459
 né amuneke see my son draws a 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.639
 very simple fan and now I'll get the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:27.639
 penny cash back up has and will ride 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:29.799
 or not you already did in the mold the doll 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.949
 there are six but I want to put the 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.169
 kids in it to be cute and me 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:38.739
 do the hairs here too that in the 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.209
 same mold does not have here continues a 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.459
 line has to make a line here 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.810
 I can take it or pillow like here 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.560

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:52.810
 Sweetheart, I'm going to do it here. 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:04:02.949
 little heart that the little heart do 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:05.169
 red and stay like that now I'm going 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.030
 put the bed for you to see how it is 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.459
 which is the second option and I bought 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.310
 a sheet of foil mdf carefully 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.199
