00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.009
 hi girls, I hope everyone is very 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.229
 well today we are going to bring you 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.410
 five ideas of outfits for any 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.180
 occasion this first idea is more for 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.130
 warm earth and I'm using a 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.380
 break white down I'm going to leave you the 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.180
 link where you can get it and in 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.039
 the waist I put a small belt 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.749
 black ass forever 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.669
 As you can tell, it brings a 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.320
 zipper on the back part and 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.730
 this style peplum so that it does not end 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.730
 the waist much smaller 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.090
 It is an excellent option for all 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.310
 that we like to be comfortable because it brings 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.320
 incorporated shorts and skirts and you can 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.320
 use with sandals or with heels 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.330
 for that second out you can use a 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.070
 basic black blouse wang Chinese and 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.900
 I put a small white belt on the 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.150
 waist to remark what's new 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.010
 the attention of this look goes in its 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.900
 Tribal design shorts that give you a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.250
 very chic touch to the doctrine and I 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.500
 like to use neutral colors 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.260
 then all this look is based on 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.180
 black and white the truth is that this 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.710
 belt came with the short but I did not 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.320
 I liked how it was then I decided 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.240
 put it here and this look is very elegant 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.950
 but the same time is casual and comfortable 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.320
 then they can take it to school 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.320
 the university and always very very nice 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.540
 for this third look is also very very 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.880
 comfortable and we can use it both in 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.799
 cold land as in land quality for 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.080
 cold earth we are going to use this blazer 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.090
 establish this stradivarius and it is one of 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.039
 the basics that is super good with 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.899
 all the outfits on the bottom 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.240
 I'm using these pants like this 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.750
 like snake skin and they are style 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.299
 harem 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.870
 what does it mean that they are as loose the 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.060
 shot is long and they are super super comfortable 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.070
 like the pattern this pants calls 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.900
 a lot of attention I'm going to complement 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 with basic pieces like this shirt 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.820
 white is of varis and a brown portfolio 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.140
 we call this so much attention 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.730
 which is perfect for every day 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.740
 because we are fixed but we walk 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.810
 super comfortable because the pants are 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.480
 quite loose and we can use them 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.980
 with black dishes although if you want 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.530
 see a little more stylized too 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.980
 You can use black heels that 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 be thin in the heel 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.550
 and if you are on land quality you can 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.159
 opt for sandals to make it 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.590
 much more fresh and calm all this 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.180
 place girls I'm really sorry editing the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.280
 video I noticed that the floor is 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.799
 dirty I did not realize sorry forgiveness 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.959
 sorry now for this room this is going to 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.760
 start with a print shirt from 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.650
 leopard that comes super strong for 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.209
 this fall and then put on a 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.390
 jean jacket to make the look 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.640
 much more casual 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.350
 in the city you did not see it is very cold 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.630
 therefore to use a scarf 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
 circular in the dark blue color and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.440
 I will also use the same portfolio 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.430
 that I used before that is very 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.379
 tranquilita and basic 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.180
 for the bottom part chosen ones 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.739
 Sara leggings that bring as a 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.260
 design on the side part brings 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.510
 like another type of fabric and for the feet 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.950
 I chose flags in color news to not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.540
 get a lot of attention this is a look 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.579
 of which I would normally use 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.319
 to go to college in which I have 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.329
 a piece that catches the attention that in 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.099
 this case would be the blouse and then what 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:24.900
 I combine with very basic clothes and 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:26.939
 casual as for every day the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.769
 approach of this fifth and last outfit 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.200
 is this military green jacket 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.239
 with fake leather sleeves 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.280
 I like that he brings a cord in the part 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.560
 from the waist so we can mark it 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.790
 and have the female figure because this 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.280
 jacket makes us see a little 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.290
 rectangular and as I decided I decided 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.239
 combine it with black garments and heels 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.180
 black so that the approach of the actress 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.040
 be the jacket this jacket is also 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.260
 would look great with the same white or a 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.410
 gray blouse just keep the accessories 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.940
 quite pretty basic because this 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.069
 leather sleeves can make us see 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.900
 a little overloaded then try to 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.900
 keep it very very basic 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.440
 decided to use heels to use 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.080
 much more the figure since I am high then 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.459
 I like how to take advantage of that and this 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.410
 jacket is very versatile you can 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.160
 use to go to work to go from 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.290
 purchases 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.060
 Paris actually is according to the 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.400
 accessories and the clothes that you put 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.400
 you can do much more elegant or 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.690
 much more casual and clever girls this has 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.100
 been everything for today I hope you have 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.560
 liked a lot and do not forget 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.540
