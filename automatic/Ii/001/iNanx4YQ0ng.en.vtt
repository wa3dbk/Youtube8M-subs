00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hello, how are I going to teach you? 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.900
 use our new system of 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 Semi permanent enamel with our the 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.430
 single moment color that is of the brand 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.580
 the mercenaries is a semi enamel 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.940
 permanent all in one we no longer need 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.090
 base or tocoa we have what is base 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.539
 Tocoa color in one product we 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.539
 lets start 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.430
 first what we have to do is 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.320
 remove the shine of our natural nail 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.140
 let's use our sponge line 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.629
 on the side plus the thicker grain that 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.739
 let's have our lime and we're going to 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.739
 remove our brightness 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.880
 very gently without mistreating the nail 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.480
 we are doing this in real time 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.530
 to see that is fast and effective is 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.440
 use this color system 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.690
 and because this is also a new 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.560
 opportunity to increase your profits 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.440
 in your business we are going to withdraw the excess 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.170
 of dust with a brush always 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.000
 brushing down 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.500
 to ensure that the dust does not stay 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.510
 stuck in what is our area of 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.090
 cuticle and the sides 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.140
 we are going to use a graph and our 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.140
 antiseptic solution 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.020
 to finish completely cleaning the 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.020
 natural nail 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.280
 and thus guarantee 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.090
 that is perfectly clean our 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090
 surface 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.090
 Here we have our nail ready 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.520
 our fingers are going to occupy our 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.760
 first to crivoi or shadow and see free 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.990
 acid and we're going to place a capita 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.990
 in each of our nails 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.010
 although our first one is free of acid 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.980
 should remember that all 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.800
 products that we apply on the nails what 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.300
 let's do only in these and not in 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.300
 our skin or new fingers 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.240
 and we already apply our 1st 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.400
 let's proceed to glaze 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.470
 as I was saying this enamel is 3 in 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.260
 1 is a semi permanent hard enamel 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.720
 approximately 21 days without it 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.110
 download is pee pee or post headquarters and 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.100
 and we will take our brochita and 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.470
 clean it on one side nothing more 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.530
 leaving enamel on the other side of the 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.630
 brush and in three steps supporting us with 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.050
 our little finger we are going to dismantle 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:04.350
 the nail first in the center and then a 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.420
 lateral and then the other and we're going to 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.360
 try to leave well sealed what is 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.660
 our tip to avoid some kind 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.640
 of rising 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.560
 we should also try to avoid 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.350
 all coast what is our area of the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.180
 cuticle 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.320
 we will always respect 1 or 2 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.320
 millimeters from the edge 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.980
 and seal perfectly well remember the 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.980
 tip 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.870
 here we get to spend a little bit of 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.400
 gel or enamel in what is 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.409
 the finger or the skin 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.799
 what we are going to do before putting the 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.799
 lamp 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.360
 and eliminate those excesses by taking 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.110
 again our kitten with a little bit of 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.110
 antiseptic solution 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.390
 and cleaning that area where we are 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.390
 it was a little bit of enamel 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.800
 it is important that we do it before 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.480
 put in the lamp otherwise the 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.880
 gel is going to harden and we're not going to 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.850
 can withdraw 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.920
 once we clean our finger 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.320
 let's put 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.320
 for 30 seconds to our lamp read 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:38.080
 we will do it in real time 

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:40.900
 so that you check 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.419
 same if you have your lamp 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.150
 normal in this case our lamp 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.280
 ms nice is 12 watts so can 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.229
 leave here if you use the enamel in a 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.879
 traditional lamp that simply goes 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.220
 to be longer in this case we're going to 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.680
 leave 3 to 4 minutes 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.389
 I already know with our is king key 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.550
 this time we are doing it with 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.500
 our great for a vÃ©lez that is a 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.020
 system so much faster for these 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.090
 enamels 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.810
 once our 30's passed 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.500
 seconds 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.320
 let's corroborate that effectively 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:17.720
 our gel dry perfectly 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.450
 we do not need to clean with our 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.150
 finish gel cleaner this is no longer 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.040
 necessary this glaze has the advantage 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.410
 that once the lamp comes out 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.270
 stays with a shine and is already sealed 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.120
 we no longer need even gel 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.610
 finished here the only thing we're going to 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.790
 to do is to give hydration to our 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.120
 nails to our fingers with a little bit of 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.699
 cuticle oil 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.860
 and this is because my model I did 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.400
 previously a manicure 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.139
 so that its particles do not dry up 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.139
 let's apply cuticle oil 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.170
 and ready here previously 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.130
 the other hand was already enameled 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.680
 I will also apply our oil 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.680
 cuticle 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.350
 and so we terminate our 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.780
 Semi permanent enameling service 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.640
 how can you tell with this gel 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.500
 we save more than double the time 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.500
 than with other traditional gels 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.220
 watch the brightness 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.220
 and the finish you have on your hands 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.539
 well girls, that's all I hope 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.449
 you liked it and that you try our 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:59.149
 semester gel color single moment 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.770
 and so that they can increase more 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.770
 earnings we assume thanks
