over<00:01:36.320> here<00:01:36.940> knock<00:01:37.940> off<00:01:38.150> the<00:01:38.300> excess<00:01:38.740> tends<00:01:39.740> to

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
over here knock off the excess tends to

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.680 
over here knock off the excess tends to
build<00:01:40.010> up<00:01:40.220> in<00:01:40.370> there<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.740> now<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
build up in there and it's now the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.490 
build up in there and it's now the
non-pressurized<00:01:44.690> portafilter

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
non-pressurized portafilter

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.130 
non-pressurized portafilter
that<00:01:46.100> they<00:01:46.250> offer<00:01:46.480> on<00:01:48.070> Seattle<00:01:49.070> coffee<00:01:49.220> Barry

that they offer on Seattle coffee Barry

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.640 
that they offer on Seattle coffee Barry
I<00:01:52.300> guess<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.480> newer<00:01:53.660> machine<00:01:54.110> from<00:01:54.320> Breville

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
I guess the newer machine from Breville

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.350 
I guess the newer machine from Breville
actually<00:01:54.950> comes<00:01:55.250> with<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.610> pressurized<00:01:56.150> and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
actually comes with a pressurized and

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.320 
actually comes with a pressurized and
unpressurized<00:01:57.280> but<00:01:58.280> when<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.520> bought<00:01:58.790> mine<00:01:59.060> it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
unpressurized but when I bought mine it

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.650 
unpressurized but when I bought mine it
only<00:01:59.570> had<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.580> pressurized<00:02:01.580> version<00:02:02.060> which

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
only had the pressurized version which

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.330 
only had the pressurized version which
has<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.870> single<00:02:03.320> little<00:02:03.590> hole<00:02:03.770> in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.040> bottom

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
has a single little hole in the bottom

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.740 
has a single little hole in the bottom
the<00:02:04.430> tends<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.730> get<00:02:04.880> clogged<00:02:05.150> up<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.570> lot<00:02:05.720> of

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
the tends to get clogged up a lot of

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.160 
the tends to get clogged up a lot of
people<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.140> don't<00:02:06.920> like<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.990> that

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
people that don't like that so that

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.750 
people that don't like that so that
being<00:02:09.380> said<00:02:10.780> me<00:02:11.780> finally<00:02:12.080> shot<00:02:12.470> glasses<00:02:12.740> here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.680 

alright<00:02:19.760> then<00:02:20.080> so<00:02:21.820> it<00:02:22.820> doesn't<00:02:23.180> pre-infusion

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
alright then so it doesn't pre-infusion

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.000 
alright then so it doesn't pre-infusion
which<00:02:24.050> is<00:02:24.170> pretty<00:02:24.350> nice<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.770> it's<00:02:24.890> actually

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
which is pretty nice so it's actually

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.100 
which is pretty nice so it's actually
going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.510> pressurize<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.100> coffee<00:02:28.100> grinds

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
going to pressurize the coffee grinds

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.710 
going to pressurize the coffee grinds
and<00:02:30.220> then<00:02:31.220> warm<00:02:31.820> them<00:02:32.030> up<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:32.570> it's

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
and then warm them up and then it's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:44.900

mine<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.940> get<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.180> just<00:03:03.300> right

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
mine to get it just right

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.340 
mine to get it just right

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
but I found nine to be the best and not

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
really play with it too much it's just a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.730 
really play with it too much it's just a
nice<00:03:11.790> firm<00:03:12.150> tamp<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> grounds<00:03:13.200> itself

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.330 

there<00:03:19.740> you<00:03:19.890> go

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340

I'll bring a camera over here second

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.230 
I'll bring a camera over here second
ever<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:22.920> look<00:03:23.160> at<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.580> crema<00:03:23.880> on<00:03:24.120> those<00:03:26.240> but

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
ever I look at the crema on those but

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.460 
ever I look at the crema on those but
all<00:03:27.390> in<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.690> think<00:03:27.870> that's<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.290> pretty

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
all in all I think that's a pretty

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.070 
all in all I think that's a pretty
decent<00:03:28.710> shot<00:03:28.950> right<00:03:29.370> there<00:03:29.630> they<00:03:30.630> taste<00:03:30.870> good

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
decent shot right there they taste good

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.360 
decent shot right there they taste good
and<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.650> guess<00:03:31.710> that's<00:03:31.950> what's<00:03:32.220> really

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and I guess that's what's really

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.860 
and I guess that's what's really
important<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:34.250> again<00:03:35.250> we<00:03:35.370> got<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:35.870> broad
