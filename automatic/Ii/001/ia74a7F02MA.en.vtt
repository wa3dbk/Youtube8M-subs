00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
use a touch for work but I mean it's got

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040 
use a touch for work but I mean it's got
everything<00:00:35.540> it's<00:00:36.540> got

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
everything it's got

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.580 
everything it's got
pokémon<00:00:37.559> called<00:00:38.460> curio<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.690> particular

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
pokémon called curio in this particular

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.799 
pokémon called curio in this particular
case<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.100> trainers<00:00:41.550> called<00:00:42.120> Evo<00:00:42.600> kurz

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
case it's got trainers called Evo kurz

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.709 
case it's got trainers called Evo kurz
hence<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> name<00:00:43.739> evoke<00:00:44.280> Rio<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> synthesis

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
hence the name evoke Rio as a synthesis

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.500 
hence the name evoke Rio as a synthesis
of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> two<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.340> rival<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
rocket as this little thing called the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
rocket as this little thing called the
shadow<00:00:59.309> hive<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.289> for<00:01:01.289> all<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
shadow hive now for all of the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470 
shadow hive now for all of the
similarities<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.059> draw<00:01:03.270> there

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
similarities that you can draw there

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
similarities that you can draw there
some<00:01:03.750> things<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.110> definitely<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.920> a

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
some things that definitely make it a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
some things that definitely make it a
little<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.700> distinct<00:01:06.360> for<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.320> actually

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
little bit distinct for one it actually

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.250 
little bit distinct for one it actually
has<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.030> all<00:01:09.240> these<00:01:09.600> various<00:01:09.960> moves

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
has you know all these various moves

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.810 
has you know all these various moves
that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.100> for<00:01:11.250> example<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
that you can do so for example this is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.530 
that you can do so for example this is
my<00:01:12.119> main<00:01:12.869> creo<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
my main creo and it has and it has a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
my main creo and it has and it has a
bunch<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> moves<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.799> also<00:01:16.920> kind<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
bunch of moves but I can also kind of

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.929 
bunch of moves but I can also kind of
swap<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.180> moves<00:01:18.720> between<00:01:19.049> battle<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
swap out moves between battle now it you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.679 
swap out moves between battle now it you
can't<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.420> hot<00:01:22.049> swap<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.759> moves<00:01:24.450> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
can't really hot swap the the moves in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.210 
can't really hot swap the the moves in
the<00:01:24.720> middle<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> battle<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the middle of battle but you can do it

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
the middle of battle but you can do it
just<00:01:26.850> outside<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.240> battle<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.960> know

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
just outside of battle so if you know

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.690 
just outside of battle so if you know
that<00:01:28.200> you're<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.590> need<00:01:28.860> oh<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.310> don't

that you're going to need oh I don't

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
that you're going to need oh I don't
know<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:30.090> fire<00:01:30.299> moves<00:01:30.570> coming<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:31.079> swap<00:01:31.619> in

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
know some fire moves coming up swap in

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.080 
know some fire moves coming up swap in
the<00:01:31.799> fire<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.610> you're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the fire if you know you're going to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.149 
the fire if you know you're going to
need<00:01:33.210> some<00:01:33.479> electric<00:01:33.960> moves<00:01:34.140> swap<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
need some electric moves swap in the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.100 
need some electric moves swap in the
electric<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.790> another<00:01:36.540> interesting<00:01:37.079> thing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
electric and another interesting thing

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.800 
electric and another interesting thing
is<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.670> actually<00:01:39.390> wait<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
is that you have to actually wait for a

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
is that you have to actually wait for a
cool-down<00:01:40.110> period<00:01:40.320> between<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> your

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
cool-down period between some of your

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
cool-down period between some of your
moves<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.600> makes<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.960> huge<00:01:43.259> difference<00:01:43.320> in

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
moves that makes a huge difference in

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.700 
moves that makes a huge difference in
the<00:01:43.950> way<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> approach<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.149> battle<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.500> lot

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the way you approach a battle in a lot

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.240 
the way you approach a battle in a lot
of<00:01:46.740> ways<00:01:47.040> these<00:01:47.509> these<00:01:48.509> creo<00:01:49.049> are<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.740> bit<00:01:50.009> more

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
of ways these these creo are a bit more

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.609 
of ways these these creo are a bit more
like<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.790> Pokemon<00:01:51.240> Eevee<00:01:51.750> than<00:01:52.170> otherwise

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
like the Pokemon Eevee than otherwise
