00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you the same stuff because it won't what

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.780 
you the same stuff because it won't what
will<00:01:43.320> happen<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> will<00:01:44.070> delete<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.640> your

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
will happen is it will delete all your

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.050 
will happen is it will delete all your
files<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.600> save<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.140> old

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
operating system as a Windows dot old so

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.929 
operating system as a Windows dot old so
basically<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.560> could<00:01:52.740> open<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.579> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
hard drive anything that has enough

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:37.559 
hard drive anything that has enough
space<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.209> a<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.920> hold<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:34.660> right<00:02:35.349> here<00:02:36.569> like

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
space to a to hold this right here like

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.690 
space to a to hold this right here like
so<00:02:37.870> basically<00:02:38.260> however<00:02:38.980> much<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.549> you

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
so basically however much that is you

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.920 
so basically however much that is you
could<00:02:39.819> need<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.299> be<00:02:40.450> able<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.690> hold<00:02:40.810> that

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
could need to have be able to hold that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.820 
could need to have be able to hold that
at<00:02:41.379> least<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.970> I<00:02:43.000> try<00:02:43.599> to<00:02:43.660> do<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:44.080> with<00:02:44.319> these

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
at least now I try to do that with these

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.479 
at least now I try to do that with these
these<00:02:45.430> disks<00:02:45.880> which<00:02:46.090> were<00:02:46.349> not<00:02:47.349> right<00:02:47.680> as<00:02:48.400> you

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
these disks which were not right as you

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.580 
these disks which were not right as you
can<00:02:48.610> see<00:02:50.880> see<00:02:51.880> it's<00:02:52.060> not<00:02:52.329> supported<00:02:52.900> because<00:02:53.079> I

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
can see see it's not supported because I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.030 
can see see it's not supported because I
have<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.599> DVD<00:02:55.599> plus<00:02:55.959> R<00:02:56.260> which<00:02:56.560> is<00:02:57.150> not<00:02:58.150> right<00:02:59.040> now

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
have a DVD plus R which is not right now

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.860 
have a DVD plus R which is not right now
you<00:03:00.129> can<00:03:00.400> go<00:03:00.489> back<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.819> now<00:03:00.970> alright<00:03:01.599> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you can go back in now alright so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.009 
you can go back in now alright so
basically<00:03:02.860> I<00:03:03.489> can't<00:03:04.120> do<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.450> with<00:03:04.629> my<00:03:04.780> discs

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
basically I can't do that with my discs

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.130 
basically I can't do that with my discs
so<00:03:05.319> I'm<00:03:05.560> having<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.370> format<00:03:06.760> now<00:03:07.140> formatting

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
so I'm having a format now formatting

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.970 
so I'm having a format now formatting
your<00:03:08.260> computer<00:03:08.739> will<00:03:09.420> most<00:03:10.420> likely<00:03:10.769> get<00:03:11.769> rid

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
your computer will most likely get rid

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.940 
your computer will most likely get rid
of<00:03:12.040> all<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:12.670> your<00:03:12.819> viruses<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:13.870> or<00:03:14.440> problems

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
of all of your viruses and or problems

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.229 
of all of your viruses and or problems
with<00:03:14.980> your<00:03:15.220> computer<00:03:15.700> because<00:03:15.849> basically

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
with your computer because basically

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.259 
with your computer because basically
it's<00:03:17.019> erasing<00:03:17.889> everything<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:18.910> putting

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
it's erasing everything and just putting

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.849 
it's erasing everything and just putting
it<00:03:19.389> all<00:03:19.630> back<00:03:19.870> together<00:03:20.170> from<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.829> very

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
it all back together from the very

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.449 
it all back together from the very
beginning<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.680> erase<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.430> and

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
beginning that so if you erase it and

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.550 
beginning that so if you erase it and
just<00:03:25.120> completely<00:03:25.569> wipe<00:03:25.870> everything<00:03:26.260> and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
just completely wipe everything and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.039 
just completely wipe everything and
don't<00:03:26.739> even<00:03:26.829> save<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.130> windows<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.670> old<00:03:28.049> it's

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
don't even save a windows that old it's

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.770 
don't even save a windows that old it's
it's<00:03:29.319> going<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.680> as<00:03:29.829> good<00:03:30.040> as<00:03:30.190> new

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
it's going to be as good as new

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.229 
it's going to be as good as new
now<00:03:32.130> whenever<00:03:33.130> you<00:03:33.370> do<00:03:33.519> that<00:03:33.730> all<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.000> your

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239

now whenever you do that all of your
updates<00:03:35.609> that<00:03:36.609> you<00:03:36.730> get<00:03:36.940> right<00:03:37.450> right<00:03:38.109> off

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
updates that you get right right off

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.569 
updates that you get right right off
here<00:03:39.420> they<00:03:40.420> will<00:03:40.630> able<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.590> try<00:03:41.920> to<00:03:41.980> and

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
here they will able to try to and

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.970 
here they will able to try to and
