00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
different they are and how much they've

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.219 
different they are and how much they've
set<00:02:06.000> aside<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.570> fact<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.869> they're<00:02:07.079> made

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
set aside and the fact that they're made

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.070

mind one of the baying things it's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.790 
mind one of the baying things it's
really<00:02:33.220> nice<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:33.790> put<00:02:34.060> on<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:35.020> their

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
import the platinum series which are

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.290 
import the platinum series which are
wide<00:02:38.080> as<00:02:38.290> hell<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.770> they're<00:02:38.860> accurate<00:02:39.070> my<00:02:39.940> god

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
wide as hell and they're accurate my god

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.199 
wide as hell and they're accurate my god
very<00:02:40.570> accurate<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.850> flip<00:02:43.060> over

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
very accurate and so if you flip over

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.910 
very accurate and so if you flip over
the<00:02:43.360> v2<00:02:43.780> there's<00:02:44.050> a<00:02:44.110> little<00:02:44.230> notch<00:02:44.530> where<00:02:44.860> you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
the v2 there's a little notch where you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.320 
the v2 there's a little notch where you
could<00:02:45.040> stick<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> flathead<00:02:45.520> screwdriver<00:02:45.670> and

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
could stick a flathead screwdriver and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.610 
could stick a flathead screwdriver and
pull<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.870> inner<00:02:47.050> reversal<00:02:47.500> latch

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
pull down on the inner reversal latch

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.670 
pull down on the inner reversal latch
which<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.010> genius<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.720> was<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.900> first<00:02:49.930> v2

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
which is genius that was the first v2

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.320 
which is genius that was the first v2
I've<00:02:50.830> ever<00:02:51.040> worked<00:02:51.190> on<00:02:51.370> where<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.640> saw<00:02:51.880> that<00:02:52.090> and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
I've ever worked on where I saw that and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.820 
I've ever worked on where I saw that and
that's<00:02:52.780> why<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.989> liked<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.410> and<00:02:53.560> the

that's why I liked it and the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.740 
that's why I liked it and the
disassembly<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.520> their<00:02:54.820> imports<00:02:55.330> weren't<00:02:55.600> too

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
disassembly of their imports weren't too

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.699 
disassembly of their imports weren't too
different<00:02:56.380> from<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.890> regular<00:02:57.040> ones<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:59.410> i

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
different from the regular ones but i

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.240 
different from the regular ones but i
prefer<00:03:00.550> vfc<00:03:01.060> s<00:03:01.120> over<00:03:01.690> pretty<00:03:01.900> much<00:03:02.140> any<00:03:02.470> gun<00:03:02.950> on

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
prefer vfc s over pretty much any gun on

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.240 
prefer vfc s over pretty much any gun on
the<00:03:03.580> planet<00:03:03.970> because<00:03:04.770> for<00:03:05.770> one<00:03:05.890> they<00:03:06.070> have<00:03:06.190> an

seven millimeter which isn't bad either
I<00:03:20.430> prefer<00:03:21.430> eight<00:03:21.730> because<00:03:22.799> it's<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:24.190> better

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080

that's a whole different video the next
thing<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:30.989> so<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.290> gearbox<00:03:32.799> quality<00:03:33.280> yes<00:03:33.519> they

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790

thing is so the gearbox quality yes they
did<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.750> case<00:03:35.049> came<00:03:35.320> with<00:03:35.470> plastic

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
did the a case came with plastic

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.060 
did the a case came with plastic

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:24.319 
internally they're not that fantastic

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:26.499 
internally they're not that fantastic
but<00:04:25.190> other<00:04:25.370> than<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.610> I've<00:04:25.940> had<00:04:26.180> no<00:04:26.479> problems

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:26.509 
but other than that I've had no problems

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:29.649 
but other than that I've had no problems
with<00:04:27.110> them<00:04:27.319> at<00:04:27.440> all<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:28.009> I<00:04:28.250> mean<00:04:29.030> that's<00:04:29.210> why<00:04:29.629> I

00:04:29.649 --> 00:04:29.659 
with them at all so I mean that's why I

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.450 
with them at all so I mean that's why I
like<00:04:29.810> them<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.530> main<00:04:30.710> reason<00:04:31.069> I<00:04:31.159> really

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
like them is the main reason I really

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.980 
like them is the main reason I really
like<00:04:31.699> them<00:04:31.879> is<00:04:31.970> because<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.330> disassembly

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
like them is because the disassembly

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.050 
like them is because the disassembly
because<00:04:33.650> if<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:33.889> can't<00:04:34.129> disassemble<00:04:34.460> a<00:04:34.849> gun

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
because if you can't disassemble a gun

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.939 
because if you can't disassemble a gun
very<00:04:35.449> easily<00:04:35.750> or<00:04:36.229> if<00:04:36.349> it's<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.590> pain<00:04:36.800> in<00:04:36.919> the

very easily or if it's a pain in the
butt<00:04:37.129> it's<00:04:37.580> not<00:04:37.789> something<00:04:38.120> that's<00:04:38.150> going<00:04:38.360> to

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.029 
think of anything else they're really
just<00:05:52.580> they're<00:05:53.120> a<00:05:53.180> great<00:05:53.539> base<00:05:53.960> gun<00:05:54.319> and<00:05:54.590> that's

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
just they're a great base gun and that's

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:57.189 
just they're a great base gun and that's
why<00:05:55.219> I<00:05:55.250> like<00:05:55.370> them<00:05:55.789> and<00:05:56.000> their<00:05:56.330> gear<00:05:56.539> boxes<00:05:57.020> are

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
why I like them and their gear boxes are

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.719 
why I like them and their gear boxes are
completely<00:05:57.770> upgradeable<00:05:58.340> that's<00:05:58.490> another

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
completely upgradeable that's another

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.760 
completely upgradeable that's another
reason<00:05:58.969> I<00:05:59.300> just<00:05:59.599> like<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.080> overall<00:06:00.199> design

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
reason I just like the overall design

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.559 
reason I just like the overall design
and<00:06:00.800> I<00:06:01.099> feel<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:01.520> they<00:06:01.639> are<00:06:01.669> an<00:06:01.849> easy<00:06:02.090> gun<00:06:02.419> to

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
and I feel that they are an easy gun to

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.689 
and I feel that they are an easy gun to
work<00:06:02.719> with<00:06:02.960> and<00:06:03.169> it<00:06:03.560> was<00:06:03.710> realistically<00:06:04.400> made

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:04.699 
work with and it was realistically made

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.219 
work with and it was realistically made
with<00:06:04.909> the<00:06:05.029> technician<00:06:05.569> in<00:06:05.659> mind<00:06:05.900> and<00:06:06.110> that's

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
with the technician in mind and that's

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.159 
with the technician in mind and that's
why<00:06:06.469> I<00:06:06.500> really<00:06:07.130> liked<00:06:07.340> it<00:06:07.599> for<00:06:08.599> their<00:06:08.719> there<00:06:09.139> a

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
why I really liked it for their there a

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.930 
why I really liked it for their there a
case<00:06:09.590> and<00:06:09.740> enforces<00:06:10.190> what<00:06:10.370> really<00:06:10.639> did<00:06:10.789> it<00:06:10.819> for

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
case and enforces what really did it for

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.779 
case and enforces what really did it for
me<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.389> mean<00:06:11.690> hell<00:06:12.020> I'd<00:06:12.319> even<00:06:12.349> own<00:06:12.770> an<00:06:12.949> m4<00:06:13.340> so<00:06:13.729> I

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
me I mean hell I'd even own an m4 so I

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.249 
me I mean hell I'd even own an m4 so I
thought<00:06:13.969> if<00:06:14.180> I<00:06:14.300> wanted<00:06:14.539> in<00:06:14.690> for<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.080> first
