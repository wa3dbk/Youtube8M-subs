00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
I'm driving around my town I look into

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.500 
I'm driving around my town I look into
people's<00:01:47.100> cars<00:01:47.370> who<00:01:47.580> have<00:01:47.670> babies<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.090> most

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
people's cars who have babies and most

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.360 
people's cars who have babies and most
of<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.750> time<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.140> see<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.890> they<00:01:50.010> leave<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
of the time I see that they leave the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.250 
of the time I see that they leave the
handle<00:01:50.760> up<00:01:50.910> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> probably<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.110> biggest

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
handle up this is probably the biggest

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.350 
handle up this is probably the biggest
thing<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.620> we're<00:01:52.890> doing<00:01:52.920> wrong<00:01:53.400> lots<00:01:54.210> of

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
thing that we're doing wrong lots of

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.540 
thing that we're doing wrong lots of
moms<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.840> dads<00:01:55.020> hang<00:01:55.380> toys<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:56.070> hang<00:01:56.310> things

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
moms and dads hang toys they hang things

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.880 
moms and dads hang toys they hang things
on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> handle<00:01:57.510> so<00:01:57.870> that<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> baby<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.500> look

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
on the handle so that the baby can look

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.110 
on the handle so that the baby can look
at<00:01:59.010> them<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.340> play<00:01:59.550> with<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.850> while<00:01:59.970> they're

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
at them or play with it while they're

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.570 
at them or play with it while they're
driving<00:02:00.360> that's<00:02:01.050> nice<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.250> safe

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
driving that's nice but that's not safe

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.790 
driving that's nice but that's not safe
so<00:02:03.180> open<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.780> instruction<00:02:04.290> manual<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
so open up your instruction manual and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.980 
so open up your instruction manual and
if<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.040> says<00:02:05.280> please<00:02:05.520> lower<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.240> handle<00:02:06.870> when

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
if it says please lower the handle when

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690 
if it says please lower the handle when
they're<00:02:07.170> driving<00:02:07.590> there's<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.250> reason<00:02:08.519> for

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
they're driving there's a reason for

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.239 
they're driving there's a reason for
that<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.269> you're<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.080> an<00:02:10.170> accident<00:02:10.319> if<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:11.249 
that if you're in an accident if the

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:12.309 
that if you're in an accident if the
baby's<00:02:11.549> behind

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
baby's behind

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.229 
baby's behind
eat<00:02:12.409> if<00:02:12.590> you're<00:02:13.219> in<00:02:13.340> an<00:02:13.430> accident<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.999> seats

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
eat if you're in an accident the seats

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.660 
eat if you're in an accident the seats
going<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.569> hit<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.170> car<00:02:15.379> seat<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:16.159> handle

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
going to hit the car seat that handle

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.000 
going to hit the car seat that handle
actually<00:02:17.180> acts<00:02:17.359> as<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.659> buffer<00:02:17.989> for<00:02:18.379> your<00:02:18.769> baby

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
actually acts as a buffer for your baby

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.399 
actually acts as a buffer for your baby
so<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.670> first<00:02:19.909> line<00:02:20.299> of<00:02:20.329> impact<00:02:20.599> would<00:02:21.170> be<00:02:21.290> the

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
so the first line of impact would be the

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.559 
so the first line of impact would be the
handle<00:02:21.829> if<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.459> leave<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.909> handle<00:02:23.389> up

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
handle if you leave the handle up

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.479 
handle if you leave the handle up
because<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.469> want<00:02:24.650> your<00:02:24.709> baby<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.069> play<00:02:25.340> with

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
because you want your baby to play with

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.830 
because you want your baby to play with
toys<00:02:25.730> or<00:02:25.999> whatever<00:02:26.239> you've<00:02:26.389> got<00:02:26.420> hanging

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
toys or whatever you've got hanging

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.289 
toys or whatever you've got hanging
there<00:02:27.019> now<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.950> would<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.639> first<00:02:28.670> impact

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
there now this would be the first impact

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.809 
there now this would be the first impact
for<00:02:29.629> your<00:02:29.719> baby<00:02:30.099> obviously<00:02:31.099> if<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.519> baby<00:02:31.670> is

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
for your baby obviously if the baby is

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.459 
for your baby obviously if the baby is
tall<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.420> could<00:02:32.569> have<00:02:32.689> a<00:02:32.719> physical<00:02:33.230> problem

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
tall you could have a physical problem

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.789 
tall you could have a physical problem
so<00:02:33.739> most<00:02:34.700> important<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.329> lower<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.079> handle<00:02:36.560> if

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
so most important is lower the handle if

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:37.990 
so most important is lower the handle if
that's<00:02:37.099> what<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.370> instruction<00:02:37.819> booklet

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
that's what the instruction booklet

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.659 
that's what the instruction booklet
tells<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:38.480> to
