00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the vw polo a small more than 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.210
 many others for high 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.010
 fitness for everyday use is therefore worried 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.750
 the ever new version and save the 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.769
 little wolfsburgers in most 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.679
 only conditionally for 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 adrenaline rushes at this one sees 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.400
 but a little bit 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.230
 different from vw won with this dare 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.230
 2013 and 14 the world rally championship 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.500
 This is not the polo wrc 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.530
 but everyone should not be so much 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 slower the new polo gti new 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.450
 sports suspension new steering more ps more 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.950
 newtonmeter bigger engine just more 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.630
 gti than ever before 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.250
 but how close does one get as a otto 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.500
 normal consumers actually to the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.110
 double rally-world champion ran we want 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 know how much motorsport genes are 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.120
 really in the new polo gti 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.040
 for that we traveled to valencia around 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.210
 from the new gti on a race track 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.470
 to get everything out of the way 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 He faces his rally brother 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.520
 Although gti is inconspicuous anyway 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.500
 the optically quite as currently 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.140
 fastest and strongest series polo 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.030
 expelled 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.100
 from headlight to headlight over 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.260
 the grill is the typical gti 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.420
 stripes through the front are optional 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.830
 it for the first time fully led 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.630
 Of course, the classic ones are missing 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.479
 colors do not care at the tail a small 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.930
 Demolition edge for enough downforce everything 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.940
 very discreet as well as the gti logos them 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.330
 may of course the legendary karo 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.320
 Patterns on the sports seats are not missing 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.080
 and he has that under his 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.080
 inconspicuous hood a 1.8 liter turbo 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.760
 unfortunately not very impressive 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.400
 he still has it in him 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.530
 12 hp more power and 78 newton meters 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.820
 more torque to the predecessor will tell 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.820
 it's right if you step in here 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.890
 lively and already a fast 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.259
 stark difference to the old double 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.869
 charged 1 4-liter one so one 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.750
 a little as hard in memory 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.340
 finally got away from the eternal 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.030
 downsizing 192 ps from the 1200 72 kilo 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.270
 dwarf 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.250
 only 28 less than the r wrc that 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.300
 maximum torque is 320 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.810
 newton meters 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.769
 the top speed is 236 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.420
 km / h from zero to 100 g 10 67 seconds 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.590
 the rally world champion is by the way 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.940
 just 0 3 seconds faster 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.840
 For the first time you can polo gti again 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.670
 hand turn on 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.590
 six-speed manual comes in the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.690
 basic version who opt for the optional 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.870
 siebengang dsg decides to abstain 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.590
 on the 70 newton meters more 250 gets 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.299
 one in the automatic version polo gti 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.769
 Surprised is that he does not like that 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.750
 a low priority there anyway 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.790
 relatively tired on the road lies itself 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.680
 he behaves in tight curves 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.540
 surprisingly unagitated that it 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.640
 really well done the new 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.459
 sports suspension is thanks to more traction 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.410
 more stability 15 mm lower is the 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.410
 gti opposite the normal poland 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.570
 bsc on board is the portrait as standard 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.970
 Formans kit including select color 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.680
 on the other hand costs extra if you the 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.110
 he will already press sports button anyway 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.640
 punishment polo will be even harder 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.170
 Influence on steering the sound 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.450
 Gas intake and switching the dsg 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.420
 which also surprised me positively 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.730
 285 euros to beat the beech for the 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.560
 sport performance kit that includes 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.720
 also the sport select colored and 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.660
 That's even the case for Hamburg 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.970
 not so expensive the front-wheel drive 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.190
 gti also convinces by an agile and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.989
 Precise steering is the first time 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.330
 electromechanical steering in the polo 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.340
 spent me a little closer 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.769
 the seats are the top look 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.390
 eye with the typical gti and offer 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.370
 at the first reinsetzen really great 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.410
 seated but a two round on the 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.090
 race track and then you realize it is missing 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.530
 a bit of the last consistent 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:00.239
 Seitenhalt which can already a bit 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:03.750
 tighter grab 22 1275 euro costs the 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.769
 base with manual transmission 225 euros less 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.989
 as the predecessor 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.440
 However, the standard dsg on board 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.569
 had the time currently again 1475 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.180
 Euro Extra if that's a 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.650
 World Rally champion feeling is too much 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.250
 perhaps that is recommended 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.650
 original 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.239
 because cards for this show there are 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.239
 certainly also in the double-digit range
