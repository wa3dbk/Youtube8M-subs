00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.280
 but molto welcome you and in this 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.510
 review we will tell you in one of the most 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.380
 new and mom lpg 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.380
 guild wars 2 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.170
 the plot does not shine with originality was 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.360
 five times who could not share the sand 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.060
 sandbox but then came gopnik form 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.710
 dragons and took all the sand on this 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.690
 once the theme developers are racial 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.790
 discrimination is lowered here in 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.559
 unite in a huge coalition and go 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.600
 to cheer up very evil and unfriendly 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.600
 dragons that's all cheap and angry 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.850
 guild wars 2 is a paid game of them 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.800
 much regret publisher they 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 pleased us free or temporary 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.520
 account so go to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.380
 the game must first download the client 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 official website and buy a key 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.600
 the approximate cost of which varies 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 from 60 to 80 American rubles and then 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 all according to the standard create an account 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.960
 register purchased key and rushed 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.410
 when entering the game, we choose as usual 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.140
 the race 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.259
 there are only five of them people are norn sylvari 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.210
 asuras and charms each time has its own 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.160
 a little story for us it doesn't have 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.600
 of particular importance so go deep into 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:26.670
 their study we will not after choice 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.860
 race profession character we fall into 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.869
 the game world is not going to bother this time 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 about graphics texture shadows ourselves 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.400
 well see that everything is on top 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.260
 level the first thing we want to highlight is 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.960
 whatever you do in guild wars 2 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.000
 whether farm pvp battles or just 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.939
 craft the same blacksmiths you anyway 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.260
 you will get experience points it means 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.090
 that you can swing your 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.090
 character without even leaving the city 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.100
 the developers decided that the players already 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.260
 become boring topic with classes and they did 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.300
 knight's move seeing multi profession system 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.980
 you can be a warrior but at the same time 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.110
 from a distance use the skill of the bow and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.030
 heals his allies or vice versa 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.750
 can choose rangers fucking in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.100
 melee 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:18.709
 you are not limited by the combat system 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.320
 here is more than dynamic and even ordinary 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.900
 farm seemed a bit of a battlefield from 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.980
 every blow has to dodge 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.640
 use blocking skills and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.640
 counterattack 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
 you 2 1 2 present system 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.020
 aiming but missing system 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.630
 guidance yes yes exactly the same one but he 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.610
 target if you attack with weapon 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.920
 ranged bow or magical 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.140
 spells moving enemy arrow or 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880
 fireball fly into the void worth only 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.310
 victims change their trajectory 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.170
 so not everything is so easy yet pleased 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.120
 lack of mana finally we do not 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:03:00.500
 will have more network for half an hour in place 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.540
 regenerate your power source skill 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.850
 also u worthy of special attention their 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.710
 only 10 no need to be surprised and everything is so 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.690
 sad as it seems the developers have invested 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.360
 these 10 skills make much more sense 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:15.650
 than 30 or 50 skills in the same length h2 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.080
 The first five skills on your panel 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.090
 depends on the equipped weapon first 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.400
 three from the weapon in the right hand and the last 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.590
 two from the weapon in the left and all five skill 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.990
 change if you take the two-handed 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.520
 weapons moreover every profession has 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.680
 unique skill set for 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.810
 a certain type of weapon ie ranger 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.630
 with a bow will have a completely different set 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.820
 of skills 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.400
 my servant at the same time wars served no 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.800
 will give in and ranger second 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.660
 half skills the remaining five pieces you 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.240
 can choose independently and share 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.120
 they are so first treating themselves or others 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.680
 you decide then three ordinary and last 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.330
 less elite also you can 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.550
 switch between two sets 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.020
 weapon that allows you to change your 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.020
 fighting style right in the middle of the battle 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.640
 in guild wars 2 there is another interesting 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.950
 surprise 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.110
 such interaction skills that is 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.880
 for example uterus give a wall of fire into it 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.859
 runs in with a two-handed ax and 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.760
 starts spinning causing damage to all 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.410
 around yourself 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.090
 but besides this there will be more from him 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.350
 fireballs scatter 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.350
 additional fire damage 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.480
 pvp 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.180
 This is generally a separate story guild wars 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.979
 2 there are two pvp modes first this 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.080
 competitive pvp in which they can 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:38.130
 participate a group of players about the battle 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.990
 will be held on relatively 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.240
 small maps when entering in 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.889
 Competitive mode pvp players immediately 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.500
 will get the maximum level and 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.350
 necessary equipment managed 2 pvp 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.570
 the regime is called wolf versus paul world 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.490
 against the world although it is worth adding it still 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.979
 one versus you because this 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.990
 the greatest battlefield between attention 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.060
 three servers without restrictions 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.419
 number of people impressive is not true 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.419
 whether 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.570
 there are a couple of interesting innovations 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.940
 guild wars 2 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.520
 the first is the individual storyline 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.200
 sense you ask in direct everyone 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.190
 player will own story quest 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.720
 yes just like in single player rpb 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.640
 in this storyline quest and you will 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.740
 make lots of choices to go out 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.540
 the hardest situations as yours 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.880
 the story will change more and more and 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.600
 stronger to such an extent that is similar to 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.430
 your story 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.430
 no one just may not be and 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.140
 second innovation in guild wars 2 no 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.120
 secondary quests true complete 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.010
 no enpis with question marks 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.170
 head over instead of them in the game will 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.690
 dynamic events are events that 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.730
 arises in the world regardless of the player then 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.010
 there is not even a location there is nobody there 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:57.080
 will still happen to the player depends 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.420
 only the outcome of events if the players 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.550
 will gather forces will succeed then get 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.590
 reward the threat will pass by and all be 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.750
 same happy if the players fail 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.400
 events for example centaur raid 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.590
 Unlike the simple quest of the centaur 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:15.620
 seize the city reception will disappear merchants 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:17.090
 the interior will change completely well then 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.070
 impressive lie 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.090
 I assure you this is not all the charm of the game 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.830
 guild wars 2 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.290
 and less impressive but equally 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.790
 pleasant surprises we keep silent 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.010
 you can feel all the charms 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.250
 this wonderful game all good luck and 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.250
 until
