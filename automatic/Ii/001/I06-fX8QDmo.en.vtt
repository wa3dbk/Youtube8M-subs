 the presence of such a heroine as a nevian one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.790
 of the merits 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.210

 memory of people and is able nilin not

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.210
 their 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.520
 In addition, she is an excellent martial 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.979
 art and easily overcomes 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.039
 any obstacles due to agility and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.450
 agility 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.549
 imagine if in place nilin was 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.799
 to the male protagonist and yet according 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.170
 genre maxim morisa creative 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.420
 director of the dontnod developer studio 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.789
 this is what many modern people want 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.350
 publishers they think that games with the main 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.729
 hero women will not use 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.039
 sought after by gamers 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.229
 but we do not think so with you 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.389
 it's good that the developers are also not so 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.889
 found it all done the main 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:36.829
 heroine girl out of discrimination 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:38.880
 gender and race 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.459
 woman-hater and racist hi 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.740
 the creators selected nilin making it 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.630
 In addition, the mulatto would declare that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.579
 not only white can save the world 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.499
 men 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.209
 everything else the heroine deliberately not 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.219
 began to do too beautiful and 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.619
 Attractive focus in the game is made 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.340
 exactly on the abilities in girls and her 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.709
 personality 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.499
 she analyzes her actions and 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:04.289
 they provoked events between the heads 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.840
 nilin walk their thoughts reasons 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.400
 doubts she doesn't just silently follow 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.230
 indicating the edge reacts sharply to them 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:18.240
 by state he went secure fork 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.630
 the foundation of the explosion open and where is english 5 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.570
 the class 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.610
 foot flick focus for such reflective 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.770
 girls of course bounce that 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.750
 utopian idea of memory intervention 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.520
 which is expected to spill evil 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.990
 the consequences of her childish whim 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.480
 Nilin's biography is revealed before us 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.120
 in reverse order first we have nothing 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.190
 know about her is what she herself is 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.160
 pretty template but the girl doesn't remember 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.140
 nothing but your name then find out 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.420
 that she and roar st to the hunter 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.670
 memories gradually not ren 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.560
 remembers fighting movements and skills 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.270
 who made her one of the leading 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.600
 memory hunters 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.200
 and at the end it reveals the details of her 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.390
 childhood nilin daughter of influential parents 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.570
 Scylla and charles map and velsoft they 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.880
 precisely those people who are headed 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.740
 childhood morales corporations nilin 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.530
 apparently there was little sociable 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.180
 child and quite enough games with a toy 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.219
 robot victims and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.680
 the price I am a daughter in the family she is like this often 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.750
 happens to be moody obstinately precisely because 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.299
 the caprice of a five year old girl occurred 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.040
 the accident in which her mother lost whole 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.629
 a leg 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.700
 Of course, you can blame the mate that she was 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.250
 too strict but you just look 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.609
 on how this little beast behaved 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.609
 in car 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:46.280
 son prince llane and live by 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.300
 of course she needed to be brought up and not 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.370
 indulge in whims 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.120
 and to suffer hours without toys she 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.130
 certainly could Ni'lin was itself 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.900
 indirect reason why what 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.300
 fought becoming the first object 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.130
 corrections memories father 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.890
 corrected the memory of the girl after 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.320
 accidents but after 20 years she surpassed 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.180
 his teacher and to show the whole 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.850
 horror intervention in another's memory 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:21.970
 corrected his memories that he 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:21.970
 corrected her memories bitcoins communities 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.380
 similar to the new nilin zone will have to 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.900
 answer for the sins of fathers 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.720
 I see many parallels between games 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.210
 Her Rome you in general and heroin 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.610
 particular both in childhood became victims 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.669
 Experiment parents and now live in 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.740
 the world of the future and are looking for the truth about yourself 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.230
 one heroine with whom you want to compare 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.630
 Nilin is a running faith is mirror's edge 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.880
 and she doesn't have to quickly 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.040
 move around rooftops and others 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.560
 surfaces as well as resist 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.930
 power and regime for me it remained 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.419
 riddle what happened to the girl 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.280
 after the accident the memory is corrected 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.950
 nilin was pretty famous 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.380
 radio operator her name and photo showed everywhere 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.900
 where it can be strange that such smart 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.270
 powerful people like her parents don't 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.540
 folded two plus two and allowed to 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.400
 daughter put in a bastille and erased memory 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.680
 be that as it may with whole charms with were 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.080
 surprised to see her but to everyone before 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.270
 meeting she corrected memories so 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.550
 that how did they treat melinda meeting 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.950
 we can only guess to become 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.110
 repairs one of the few species where 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.840
 can see the main character's parents in 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.550
 good health family idyll which 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 seem so lacked nilin in childhood 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.970
 I finish the issue I will note one more 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.400
 interesting observation the name of the heroine 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.890
 reads the same in both directions 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.050
 I do not know whether to invest in this special 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.060
 meaning can this just beautiful 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.340
 coincidence the developers themselves 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.710
 they just laugh well 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.350
 before you come up with it but on 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.620
 note the name of the studio developer 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.080
 dontnod 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.620
 also palindrome maybe these guys 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.729
 just likes to play with words and letters 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.370
 I have everything on it 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.470
 and such a heroine as nilin we think 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.789
 remember for a long time even without too much 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.789
 interventions in our memory 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:15.970
