00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.090
 You will also know them by their deeds 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.340
 matter what you tell me what are the 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.830
 sexes am and explain me because the American 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.830
 give you a car if you gave him results 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.750
 I am respectful of the decisions of the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.390
 directive in my personal opinion to me not 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.780
 I like I do not like as a person as 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.030
 technical director I did not have any 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.040
 difficulty dismissing him at the time 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.650
 I had all the football elements 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.270
 and extra soccer that made 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.629
 a contract of one million pesos per year 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.940
 a month a million pesos a month that was 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.100
 the salary that mohamed earned could 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.930
 cancel overnight and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.280
 footballily he did not work more than 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.280
 to 70 60 percent 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.129
 normally when you analyze the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.770
 hiring a technical director you 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.890
 you want it for the short medium and the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.530
 long term I do not know what difficulties 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.780
 they had in the negotiation and what doubts 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.270
 they have to not make a contract 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.670
 because normally not when your contract 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.190
 is a technical director and jessica this 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.190
 because you make a long- term contract 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.649
 that is the truth to me I do not play pig 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.810
 in the mouth of the sight are the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.030
 results to me what you tell me 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.560
 that the heart is vibrating me 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.159
 the hill the chair 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.159
 that is not true 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.250
 etcetera and painted them yellow and 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.530
 Red and blue 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.190
 which is a professional football team 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.940
 it's not a clown club 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.940
 and he understood 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.840
 it was an open secret and there were elements 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.970
 that 14 years ago we are going to see 14 years ago 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.290
 years or in that sense I do not have 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.240
 right now the elements to say hey 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
 here are these papers here are the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.110
 photographs here are the ones 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.630
 testimonies at that time I was 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.120
 so it's so that as I tell you I do not know 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.560
 I said that it made absolutely nothing 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.560
 cancel the contract mutually 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.660
 they could owe salaries to others 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.660
 players but mohamed we do not go back to 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.580
 to say to mohamed was half of all 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.430
 the salaries of the players of the 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.140
 monterrey since jett in half was in 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.569
 some account treatment of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.090
 equivalent to say hey 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.810
 here is Britney Spears and all the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.660
 the rest 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.450
 mohamed is not to blame as mohamed does not 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.690
 is guilty because I eat like someone 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.300
 I said you get to where they leave you and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.220
 if the directive since he hears put off 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.860
 and they had deprived and I can go three 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.930
 Argentine times a year and let me 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.959
 can also take me to the cooks of 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430
 here for my restaurant and hey by the way 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.989
 all the parties of the striped the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.769
 let's do the goddess that is my 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.769
 discotheque 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.040
 if the man negotiated very well the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.599
 directive crouches and says yes yes well and 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.370
 whatever you want your problems the 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.370
 directive is not a problem should spears 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.470
 It's been 14 years now, so much has happened 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.780
 jessica time and also from my part of 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.020
 greetings to mohamed as a person with 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.450
 this with all its defects and virtues and 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.940
 to 14 years away the truth 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.560
 Jessica I have to say that I believe 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.550
 in the possibility that people change 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.550
 that is reconverted
