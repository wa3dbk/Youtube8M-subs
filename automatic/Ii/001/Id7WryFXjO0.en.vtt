00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.760 
wood veneer company and I'm not sure I'm
going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.450> build<00:00:06.720> with<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:06.960> yet<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.470> I'm<00:00:07.560> just

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
going to build with it yet so I'm just

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.129 
going to build with it yet so I'm just
going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> unbox<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.360> know<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.870> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
going to unbox it I know one of the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.740 
going to unbox it I know one of the
species<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.950> zebra<00:00:11.370> wood<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.450> not<00:00:12.599> sure

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
species is zebra wood and I'm not sure

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.390 
species is zebra wood and I'm not sure
what<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.019> other<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.440> let<00:00:13.530> me<00:00:13.590> go<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
what the other so let me go get that and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:27.439 
what the other so let me go get that and
then<00:00:14.549> we'll<00:00:14.730> take<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> look<00:00:26.029> it's<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
then we'll take a look it's not going to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:38.869 
then we'll take a look it's not going to
be<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> easy<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.410> box<00:00:37.879> well

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
be that easy to get out of this box well

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.520 
be that easy to get out of this box well
I'm<00:00:38.969> glad<00:00:39.090> I'm<00:00:39.450> not<00:00:39.660> ready<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> build<00:00:40.230> anything

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
I'm glad I'm not ready to build anything

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.100 
I'm glad I'm not ready to build anything
yet<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.640> looks<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
yet because it looks like it would be a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.700 
yet because it looks like it would be a
good<00:00:43.320> idea<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.100> let<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.329> here<00:00:45.539> roll<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
good idea to let them in here roll it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
good idea to let them in here roll it
out<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.309> weight<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.270> let<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
out and then weight it down and let it

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.529 
out and then weight it down and let it
lose<00:00:48.840> some<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.379> curl<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> has

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
lose some of this curl that it has

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.850 
lose some of this curl that it has
there's<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.809> guess<00:00:52.110> there's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> couple<00:00:52.800> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
there's I guess there's a couple of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.740 
there's I guess there's a couple of
things<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.219> learn<00:00:53.399> about<00:00:53.579> vignerons<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
things to learn about vignerons out I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
things to learn about vignerons out I
think<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.530> my<00:00:55.620> last<00:00:55.829> video<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> said<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.550> am<00:00:56.879> no

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
think in my last video I said I am no

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
think in my last video I said I am no
expert<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.719> veneer<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.680> getting

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
expert on veneer and I'm just getting

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340 
expert on veneer and I'm just getting
into<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.300> possibilities<00:01:01.050> for

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
into it but it's the possibilities for

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
into it but it's the possibilities for
design<00:01:01.739> are<00:01:02.160> limitless<00:01:02.699> because<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.390> don't

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
design are limitless because you don't

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
design are limitless because you don't
have<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> worry<00:01:04.080> about<00:01:04.199> expansion<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
have to worry about expansion and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.370 
have to worry about expansion and
contraction<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:06.090> way<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:06.840> solid

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
contraction the way you do with solid

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.859 
contraction the way you do with solid
wood<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.250> am<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> try<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.270> roll<00:01:09.659> these

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
wood so I am going to try to roll these

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
wood so I am going to try to roll these
out<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.530> better<00:01:10.710> look<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.220> them

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
out so we can get a better look at them

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.359 
out so we can get a better look at them
and<00:01:11.810> just<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.680> think<00:01:13.799> I'm<00:01:13.979> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and just I think I'm going to have to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:36.260 
and just I think I'm going to have to
get<00:01:14.520> some<00:01:14.610> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> weight

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270 

well<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.359> saw<00:01:37.539> that<00:01:37.689> I<00:01:37.810> bet<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.500> five<00:01:38.979> pound

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
well you saw that I bet the five pound

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.999 
well you saw that I bet the five pound
weights<00:01:39.520> with<00:01:39.880> some<00:01:40.560> bubble<00:01:41.560> wrap<00:01:41.709> with<00:01:41.920> the

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
weights with some bubble wrap with the

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.590 
weights with some bubble wrap with the
craft<00:01:42.280> paper<00:01:42.490> on<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.850> one<00:01:42.969> side<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.390> works

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
craft paper on the one side that works

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.410 
craft paper on the one side that works
great<00:01:43.959> as<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.649> weight<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.130> hold<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.609> veneer

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
great as a weight to hold the veneer

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.760 
great as a weight to hold the veneer
down<00:01:46.719> this<00:01:47.200> is<00:01:47.729> white<00:01:48.729> ash<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:50.500> is

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
down this is white ash and this is

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.260 
down this is white ash and this is
Italian<00:01:52.439> zebra<00:01:53.459> it's<00:01:54.459> really<00:01:54.789> beautiful

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
Italian zebra it's really beautiful

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.899 
Italian zebra it's really beautiful
stuff<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.439> be<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> little<00:01:56.799> daunting<00:01:57.159> you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
stuff it can be a little daunting you

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.910 
stuff it can be a little daunting you
because<00:01:58.299> when<00:01:58.959> you<00:01:58.989> work<00:01:59.229> with<00:01:59.409> material

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
because when you work with material

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.800 
because when you work with material
that's<00:02:00.099> beautiful<00:02:00.549> you<00:02:00.670> don't<00:02:00.789> want<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.270> make

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
that's beautiful you don't want to make

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.389 
that's beautiful you don't want to make
a<00:02:01.869> mistake<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.379> it's<00:02:02.770> one<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.009> those<00:02:03.129> simple

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
a mistake so it's one of those simple

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.010 
a mistake so it's one of those simple
you<00:02:03.520> really<00:02:03.700> want<00:02:03.849> to<00:02:03.909> think<00:02:04.119> about<00:02:04.209> it<00:02:04.569> right

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
you really want to think about it right

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.899 
you really want to think about it right
now<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.319> planning<00:02:05.709> to<00:02:05.739> use<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.429> zebra<00:02:06.759> wood

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
now I'm planning to use the zebra wood

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.119 
now I'm planning to use the zebra wood
and<00:02:07.239> the<00:02:07.420> white<00:02:07.750> ash<00:02:07.959> on<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.259> same<00:02:08.530> project<00:02:09.069> so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
and the white ash on the same project so

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.550 
and the white ash on the same project so
I've<00:02:09.220> dampened<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.759> rag<00:02:09.970> a<00:02:10.000> little<00:02:10.360> bit<00:02:10.539> just<00:02:11.379> to

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
I've dampened a rag a little bit just to

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.729 
I've dampened a rag a little bit just to
see<00:02:12.360> how<00:02:13.360> big<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.750> contrast<00:02:14.379> that's<00:02:14.590> going

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
see how big of a contrast that's going

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.020 
see how big of a contrast that's going
to<00:02:14.799> be<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> think<00:02:15.129> it's<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.579> look<00:02:15.700> really

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
to be I think it's going to look really

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.970 
to be I think it's going to look really
nice<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.569> mean<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.930> guess<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.290> depends<00:02:17.620> on<00:02:17.769> the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
nice I mean I guess it depends on the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.400 
nice I mean I guess it depends on the
design<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.329> is<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.569> first<00:02:19.840> step<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.230> just

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
design but this is the first step I just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.410 
design but this is the first step I just
wanted<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.709> take<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> look<00:02:21.190> at<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.730> now

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
wanted to take a look at this and now

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.150 
wanted to take a look at this and now
start<00:02:22.720> thinking<00:02:22.900> about<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:25.590> okay<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.650> that's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
start thinking about it okay so that's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.940 
start thinking about it okay so that's
really<00:02:27.790> pretty<00:02:28.150> much<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.140> think<00:02:29.410> if<00:02:29.650> we

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
really pretty much it I think if we

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.580 
really pretty much it I think if we
learned<00:02:30.190> anything<00:02:30.489> here<00:02:30.819> it's<00:02:31.720> good<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.319> have

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
learned anything here it's good to have

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
learned anything here it's good to have
some<00:02:32.950> weights<00:02:33.400> on<00:02:33.670> hand<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.049> reason<00:02:35.349> why

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
some weights on hand and the reason why

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.250 
some weights on hand and the reason why
I<00:02:35.500> wrap<00:02:35.769> them<00:02:35.980> up<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.970> bubble<00:02:37.690> wrap<00:02:37.840> craft

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
I wrap them up in the bubble wrap craft

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.440 
I wrap them up in the bubble wrap craft
paper<00:02:38.590> was<00:02:38.889> I<00:02:39.130> didn't<00:02:39.459> want<00:02:39.609> to<00:02:39.700> scratch<00:02:40.060> or

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
paper was I didn't want to scratch or

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.170 
paper was I didn't want to scratch or
get<00:02:41.019> any<00:02:41.139> stains<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.739> might<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.069> only<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.609> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
get any stains that might be only on the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.300 
get any stains that might be only on the
weights<00:02:43.419> on<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.260> veneer<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:44.859> that's<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.190> good

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
weights on the veneer so that's a good

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.440 
weights on the veneer so that's a good
thing<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.579> have<00:02:45.700> around<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.180> you're<00:02:46.269> going<00:02:46.389> to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
thing to have around it you're going to

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.470 
thing to have around it you're going to
order<00:02:46.690> them<00:02:46.870> here<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.730> oak<00:02:48.730> wood<00:02:48.970> veneers<00:02:49.299> not

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
order them here and oak wood veneers not

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.479 
order them here and oak wood veneers not

first video and if you're interested in

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.210 
first video and if you're interested in
veneering<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:05.169> can<00:03:05.319> just<00:03:05.500> go<00:03:05.680> down<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:06.040> line

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
veneering you can just go down the line

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.460 
veneering you can just go down the line
and<00:03:06.489> that's<00:03:06.609> what<00:03:06.849> I've<00:03:06.970> been<00:03:07.000> doing<00:03:07.470> there's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
and that's what I've been doing there's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.490 
and that's what I've been doing there's
a<00:03:08.530> couple<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:08.980> things<00:03:09.190> that<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.400> did<00:03:09.579> wrong<00:03:09.819> on

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
a couple of things that I did wrong on

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.440 
a couple of things that I did wrong on
the<00:03:11.500> last<00:03:11.769> project<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.549> did<00:03:12.700> veneer<00:03:13.269> the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
the last project that I did veneer the

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.979 
the last project that I did veneer the
end<00:03:13.780> table<00:03:14.200> or<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.739> nightstand<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.810> one<00:03:16.810> was

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
end table or the nightstand and one was

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.809 
end table or the nightstand and one was
pointed<00:03:17.349> out<00:03:17.470> in<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.620> comments<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.459> was

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
pointed out in the comments and that was

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.379 
pointed out in the comments and that was
for<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.510> Woodfill<00:03:20.849> apparently<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:22.000> right

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
for the Woodfill apparently the right

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.440 
for the Woodfill apparently the right
thing<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.720> use<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.200> bondo<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:24.010> guess<00:03:24.370> auto<00:03:24.669> auto

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
thing to use is bondo I guess auto auto

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.210 
thing to use is bondo I guess auto auto
body<00:03:25.870> bondo<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.590> have<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.859> look

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
body bondo I have to look

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.300 
body bondo I have to look
to<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.460> little<00:03:27.670> bit<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.740> other<00:03:29.920> thing

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
to that a little bit and the other thing

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.150 
to that a little bit and the other thing
was<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.330> use<00:03:31.480> a<00:03:31.510> j-roller<00:03:31.890> I've<00:03:32.890> been

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
was not to use a j-roller I've been

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.070 
was not to use a j-roller I've been
using<00:03:33.340> gel<00:03:33.670> rollers<00:03:34.060> on<00:03:34.210> things<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:34.540> Formica

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
using gel rollers on things like Formica

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.360 
using gel rollers on things like Formica
and<00:03:35.620> veneer<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.870> know<00:03:37.990> a<00:03:38.260> little<00:03:39.040> bit<00:03:39.250> of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
and veneer you know a little bit of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.330 
and veneer you know a little bit of
veneer<00:03:40.030> work<00:03:40.210> that<00:03:40.390> I've<00:03:40.480> done<00:03:40.510> for<00:03:41.020> years<00:03:41.950> and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
veneer work that I've done for years and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.280 
veneer work that I've done for years and
apparently<00:03:43.150> what<00:03:43.420> you're<00:03:43.600> supposed<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.020> use

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
apparently what you're supposed to use

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.270 
apparently what you're supposed to use
is<00:03:44.700> some<00:03:45.700> kind<00:03:45.940> of<00:03:46.410> almost<00:03:47.410> like<00:03:47.590> a<00:03:47.680> scraper<00:03:48.040> or

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
is some kind of almost like a scraper or

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.640 
is some kind of almost like a scraper or
a<00:03:48.580> yeah<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.570> guess<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:50.050> don't<00:03:50.290> know<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.560> to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
a yeah I guess I don't know I have to

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.250 
a yeah I guess I don't know I have to
look<00:03:50.770> into<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.060> get<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:53.020> really

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
look into that but you get you really

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.670 
look into that but you get you really
want<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.830> make<00:03:54.010> contact<00:03:54.760> with<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.990> contact

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
want to make contact with that contact

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.440 
want to make contact with that contact
cement<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.160> really<00:03:57.370> want<00:03:57.550> them<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:58.000> meet<00:03:58.210> and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
cement you really want them to meet and

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.230 
cement you really want them to meet and
so<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.990> guess<00:03:59.650> what<00:04:00.160> people<00:04:00.520> are<00:04:00.640> saying<00:04:00.910> is

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
so I guess what people are saying is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.360 
so I guess what people are saying is
with<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.540> j-roller<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.440> don't<00:04:02.680> get<00:04:02.950> quite<00:04:03.340> as

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
with a j-roller you don't get quite as

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.940 
with a j-roller you don't get quite as
much<00:04:03.640> contact<00:04:04.209> as<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:05.020> would<00:04:05.290> with<00:04:05.530> something

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
much contact as you would with something

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.250 
much contact as you would with something
I'm<00:04:06.430> thinking<00:04:06.490> almost<00:04:07.150> like<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.450> piece<00:04:08.080> of

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
I'm thinking almost like a piece of

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.680 
I'm thinking almost like a piece of
plywood<00:04:08.740> using<00:04:09.520> that<00:04:09.850> as<00:04:10.030> a<00:04:10.060> scraper<00:04:10.450> and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
plywood using that as a scraper and

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.480 
plywood using that as a scraper and
that's<00:04:10.990> illustrated<00:04:11.620> in<00:04:11.770> one<00:04:11.920> of<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.100> videos

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
that's illustrated in one of the videos

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.000 
that's illustrated in one of the videos
they've<00:04:13.330> got<00:04:13.570> a<00:04:13.600> professional<00:04:14.140> guide<00:04:14.740> there

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
they've got a professional guide there

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.320 
they've got a professional guide there
on<00:04:15.130> staff<00:04:15.459> it<00:04:15.670> kind<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:15.880> goes<00:04:16.060> through

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
on staff it kind of goes through

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.009 
on staff it kind of goes through
everything<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:17.070> anyway<00:04:18.540> I'm<00:04:19.540> thinking<00:04:19.600> this

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
everything so anyway I'm thinking this

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.080 
everything so anyway I'm thinking this
is<00:04:20.169> probably<00:04:20.769> going<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:21.190> be<00:04:21.310> a<00:04:21.459> project<00:04:21.790> that

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
is probably going to be a project that

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.330 
is probably going to be a project that
happens<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.660> July<00:04:22.960> because<00:04:23.320> I<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:24.040> is<00:04:24.190> going

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
happens in July because I this is going

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.830 
happens in July because I this is going
to<00:04:24.400> be<00:04:24.490> one<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.700> my<00:04:24.790> major<00:04:25.030> projects<00:04:25.630> I'm<00:04:25.720> going

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
to be one of my major projects I'm going

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.870 
to be one of my major projects I'm going
to<00:04:25.900> want<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.080> think<00:04:26.290> about<00:04:26.410> it<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.010> if<00:04:27.520> I<00:04:27.610> build

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
to want to think about it and if I build

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.060 
to want to think about it and if I build
a<00:04:27.970> chair<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.270> going<00:04:28.419> to<00:04:28.480> build<00:04:28.660> two<00:04:28.870> chairs<00:04:29.200> so

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
a chair I'm going to build two chairs so

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.159 
a chair I'm going to build two chairs so
it's<00:04:30.400> not<00:04:30.610> one<00:04:30.820> of<00:04:30.880> those<00:04:31.060> things<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:31.990> would

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
it's not one of those things that would

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.050 
it's not one of those things that would
have<00:04:32.380> that<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:32.980> could<00:04:33.190> start<00:04:33.460> on<00:04:33.610> Monday<00:04:33.940> and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
have that I could start on Monday and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.140 
have that I could start on Monday and
finish<00:04:34.330> by<00:04:34.510> Friday<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:36.100> guess<00:04:36.790> that's<00:04:36.910> it

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
finish by Friday so I guess that's it

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.810 
finish by Friday so I guess that's it
I'll<00:04:37.330> see<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.660> soon
