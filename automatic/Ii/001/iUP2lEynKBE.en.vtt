to go ahead play with this for a few

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.760 
to go ahead play with this for a few
days<00:07:01.510> see<00:07:02.510> how<00:07:02.660> good<00:07:02.900> it<00:07:02.960> is<00:07:03.200> see<00:07:03.500> how<00:07:03.620> it

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
days see how good it is see how it

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.520 
days see how good it is see how it
performs<00:07:04.340> I'm<00:07:04.490> more<00:07:04.640> connected<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.090> my<00:07:05.180> TV<00:07:06.110> and

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:06.530 
performs I'm more connected to my TV and

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.680 
performs I'm more connected to my TV and
which<00:07:07.220> is<00:07:07.370> a<00:07:07.400> little<00:07:07.729> further<00:07:07.880> further<00:07:08.390> away

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:08.690 
which is a little further further away

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.890 
which is a little further further away
from<00:07:08.720> my<00:07:09.789> router<00:07:10.789> so<00:07:11.240> we'll<00:07:11.479> see<00:07:11.660> how<00:07:11.840> the

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900 
from my router so we'll see how the

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.560 
from my router so we'll see how the
Wi-Fi<00:07:12.680> performance<00:07:12.860> is<00:07:13.490> the<00:07:13.700> last<00:07:14.360> time<00:07:14.539> I

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
Wi-Fi performance is the last time I

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.719 
Wi-Fi performance is the last time I
bought<00:07:14.840> one<00:07:15.020> of<00:07:15.140> these<00:07:15.289> about<00:07:15.590> our<00:07:15.710> amigo<00:07:16.100> mx2

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:16.729 
bought one of these about our amigo mx2

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:19.150 
bought one of these about our amigo mx2
it<00:07:17.300> crashed<00:07:17.780> about<00:07:17.990> three<00:07:18.380> or<00:07:18.500> four<00:07:18.680> days<00:07:18.860> and

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
it crashed about three or four days and

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.460 
it crashed about three or four days and
so<00:07:19.789> I'd<00:07:19.970> never<00:07:20.210> even<00:07:20.510> caught<00:07:20.720> on<00:07:20.960> to<00:07:21.110> reviewing

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
so I'd never even caught on to reviewing

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.409 
so I'd never even caught on to reviewing
it<00:07:21.710> so<00:07:22.340> this<00:07:22.460> time<00:07:22.520> around<00:07:22.789> I'm<00:07:23.000> going<00:07:23.180> to<00:07:23.270> play
