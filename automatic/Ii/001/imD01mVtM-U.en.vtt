Australia and South Africa England have
an<00:02:45.180> excellent<00:02:45.540> form<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:45.990> home<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:47.280> day<00:02:47.460> wise

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
an excellent form at home one day wise

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.870 
an excellent form at home one day wise
do<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.090> feel<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.780> early<00:02:49.110> team<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.880> has

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
do you feel that the early team is has

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.700 
do you feel that the early team is has
developed<00:02:51.300> well<00:02:51.510> under<00:02:51.870> under<00:02:52.140> Captain<00:02:52.500> Cook

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
developed well under under Captain Cook

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.610 
developed well under under Captain Cook
yeah<00:02:53.370> definitely<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.850> think<00:02:53.910> obviously<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:55.470> was

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
yeah definitely I think obviously it was

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.170 
yeah definitely I think obviously it was
a<00:02:55.650> transition<00:02:56.160> paired<00:02:56.370> what<00:02:56.520> once<00:02:56.910> he<00:02:57.030> took

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
a transition paired what once he took

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.610 
a transition paired what once he took
over<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.600> was<00:02:57.720> always<00:02:57.900> going<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.530> know

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
over and was always going to be you know

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.740 
over and was always going to be you know
difficult<00:02:59.190> settling<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.850> as<00:03:00.090> him<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:00.450> himself

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
difficult settling in as him for himself

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.210 
difficult settling in as him for himself
and<00:03:01.110> I've<00:03:01.200> learning<00:03:01.500> his<00:03:01.620> game<00:03:01.800> again<00:03:02.070> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
and I've learning his game again and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.740 
and I've learning his game again and
went<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.400> one<00:03:02.550> day<00:03:02.670> cricket<00:03:02.790> but<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:03.660> he's

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
went in one day cricket but I think he's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.420 
went in one day cricket but I think he's
an<00:03:03.870> outstanding<00:03:04.200> job<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.920> just<00:03:05.100> shows<00:03:05.160> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
an outstanding job and it just shows to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520 
an outstanding job and it just shows to
