shooting<00:02:01.570> next<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.890> run<00:02:03.460> one<00:02:03.730> quick<00:02:04.090> clean<00:02:04.420> pass

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
shooting next I run one quick clean pass

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.620 
shooting next I run one quick clean pass
through<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.170> barrel

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.600 

then<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.900> take<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> breech<00:02:12.890> plug<00:02:13.100> out<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
then I take the breech plug out of the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.790 
then I take the breech plug out of the
barrel<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.540> how<00:02:14.720> easy<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.350> with<00:02:15.770> a

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
barrel see how easy this is with a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.550 
barrel see how easy this is with a
quick-release<00:02:16.250> breech<00:02:16.910> plug<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.450> I<00:02:18.230> place<00:02:18.530> it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
quick-release breech plug and I place it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.199 
quick-release breech plug and I place it
in<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> part<00:02:19.220> Soaker<00:02:21.430> then<00:02:22.430> we<00:02:22.940> want<00:02:23.150> to

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
in the part Soaker then we want to

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.500 
in the part Soaker then we want to
remove<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.690> barrel<00:02:24.080> from<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.380> action<00:02:25.510> you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
remove the barrel from the action you

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.830 
remove the barrel from the action you
only<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.140> remove<00:02:27.470> one<00:02:27.830> screw<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:32.720> I'll

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
only have to remove one screw then I'll

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.140 
only have to remove one screw then I'll
break<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.230> action<00:02:33.650> open<00:02:34.010> just<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
break the action open just like this and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.870 
break the action open just like this and
the<00:02:35.569> barrel<00:02:35.930> comes<00:02:36.230> right<00:02:36.620> out<00:02:38.830> next<00:02:39.830> I'll<00:02:40.280> set

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
the barrel comes right out next I'll set

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.490 
the barrel comes right out next I'll set
the<00:02:41.060> barrel<00:02:41.330> down<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.780> horizontal<00:02:42.200> surface

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
the barrel down on a horizontal surface

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.040 
the barrel down on a horizontal surface
and<00:02:43.069> spray<00:02:43.550> barrel<00:02:43.970> blaster<00:02:44.420> foaming<00:02:44.810> bore

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
and spray barrel blaster foaming bore

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.740 
and spray barrel blaster foaming bore
cleaner<00:02:45.470> into<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.069> bore<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:47.000> let<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.300> work<00:02:47.510> on

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
cleaner into the bore and let it work on

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.860 
cleaner into the bore and let it work on
its<00:02:47.959> own<00:02:48.110> for<00:02:48.410> about<00:02:48.560> an<00:02:48.680> hour<00:02:48.830> or<00:02:49.100> so

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
its own for about an hour or so

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.300 
its own for about an hour or so
essentially<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.050> foaming<00:02:51.290> bore<00:02:51.650> cleaner<00:02:52.040> is

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
essentially the foaming bore cleaner is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.699 
essentially the foaming bore cleaner is
doing<00:02:52.700> all<00:02:52.880> of<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.209> hard<00:02:53.420> work<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:53.720> me<00:02:54.290> while

doing all of the hard work for me while
I'm<00:02:54.890> off<00:02:55.100> doing<00:02:55.340> something<00:02:55.880> else<00:02:56.030> in<00:02:56.959> about<00:02:57.230> an

I'm off doing something else in about an

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.289 
I'm off doing something else in about an
hour<00:02:57.560> I'll<00:02:57.890> just<00:02:58.310> run<00:02:58.550> two<00:02:58.760> or<00:02:58.880> three<00:02:59.090> patches

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
hour I'll just run two or three patches

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:13.920 
hour I'll just run two or three patches
through<00:02:59.780> this<00:02:59.959> barrel<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.739> clean

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.509 

that's<00:03:14.930> all<00:03:15.140> easy<00:03:15.380> enough<00:03:15.739> Chad<00:03:16.070> but<00:03:16.340> what

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
that's all easy enough Chad but what

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.759 
that's all easy enough Chad but what
about<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.940> guy<00:03:17.150> who<00:03:17.180> needs<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:18.170> clean<00:03:18.530> the

to clean the barrel between the shots

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.720 
to clean the barrel between the shots
well<00:03:27.170> for<00:03:27.380> those<00:03:27.500> situations<00:03:28.310> what<00:03:28.549> I

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
well for those situations what I

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.240 
well for those situations what I
recommend<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.049> barrel<00:03:30.380> blaster<00:03:30.859> wonder

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
recommend is the barrel blaster wonder

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.640 
recommend is the barrel blaster wonder
gel<00:03:31.519> what's<00:03:32.299> unique<00:03:32.660> about<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.079> Wonder<00:03:33.410> gel

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
gel what's unique about the Wonder gel

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.009 
gel what's unique about the Wonder gel
is<00:03:33.890> that<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.370> is<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.549> gel<00:03:35.030> rather<00:03:35.420> than<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> liquid

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
is that it is a gel rather than a liquid

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.289 
is that it is a gel rather than a liquid
so<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.829> won't<00:03:37.040> spill<00:03:37.489> out<00:03:37.640> in<00:03:37.850> your<00:03:38.000> shooting

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
so it won't spill out in your shooting

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.170 
so it won't spill out in your shooting
box<00:03:38.600> or<00:03:38.930> your<00:03:39.079> Possible's<00:03:39.680> bag<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.310> because

box or your Possible's bag and because

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.060 
box or your Possible's bag and because
it<00:03:41.359> sticks<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.079> patch<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.709> more

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
it sticks to the patch it's more

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.580 
it sticks to the patch it's more
economical<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:44.120> use<00:03:44.359> now<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.320> have<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
economical to use now that you have the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.800 
economical to use now that you have the
gel<00:03:45.859> on<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.160> patch<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.760> run<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.630> patch

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
gel on the patch you run the patch

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.509 
gel on the patch you run the patch
through<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.709> like<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.040> would<00:03:49.280> with<00:03:49.310> any
