hello<00:00:00.960> youtube<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.650> joe<00:00:01.949> quill<00:00:02.129> 509<00:00:02.550> here

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hello youtube this is joe quill 509 here

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.990 
hello youtube this is joe quill 509 here
with<00:00:02.970> my<00:00:03.380> 20-minute<00:00:04.380> timer<00:00:04.830> I<00:00:05.130> designed<00:00:05.730> it<00:00:05.819> as

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
with my 20-minute timer I designed it as

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.030 
with my 20-minute timer I designed it as
a<00:00:06.029> 10<00:00:06.420> minute<00:00:06.690> timer<00:00:06.960> but<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.259> ended<00:00:07.500> up<00:00:07.710> making

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
a 10 minute timer but I ended up making

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.450 
a 10 minute timer but I ended up making
a<00:00:08.340> 20-minute<00:00:08.940> timer<00:00:09.150> instead<00:00:09.840> so<00:00:10.710> here's<00:00:11.280> how

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
a 20-minute timer instead so here's how

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.379 
a 20-minute timer instead so here's how
it<00:00:11.550> works<00:00:11.670> um<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:12.840> counts<00:00:13.290> down<00:00:13.410> um<00:00:14.389> and

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
it works um it just counts down um and

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.050 
it works um it just counts down um and
let<00:00:15.690> me<00:00:15.780> go<00:00:16.230> real<00:00:16.470> quick<00:00:16.619> oh<00:00:16.920> by<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.550> way<00:00:17.640> for<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
let me go real quick oh by the way for a

build<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.460> does<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.090> quick<00:00:24.300> build

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
build this does this quick build

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.429 
build this does this quick build
challenge<00:00:24.800> thing<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.949> think<00:00:26.220> it's<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.550> cool

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
challenge thing I think it's really cool

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.990 
challenge thing I think it's really cool
so<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> decided<00:00:28.890> hey<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.130> wanted<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> build<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
so I decided hey I wanted to build this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
so I decided hey I wanted to build this
but<00:00:30.990> neither<00:00:31.380> me<00:00:31.619> nor<00:00:31.679> my<00:00:31.980> friends<00:00:32.309> could

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
but neither me nor my friends could

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.310 
but neither me nor my friends could
settle<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:34.850> way<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.910> time<00:00:36.360> all<00:00:36.809> this<00:00:37.140> because

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
settle on a way to time all this because

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
settle on a way to time all this because
none<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.460> trust<00:00:38.730> me<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:39.329> trust

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
none of them trust me and I don't trust

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
none of them trust me and I don't trust
any<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.809> them<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.559> have<00:00:41.129> issues<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.579> anyway

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
any of them and I have issues and anyway

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.350 
any of them and I have issues and anyway
so<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:44.010> those<00:00:44.219> structures<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.149> for

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
so that is what those structures are for

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.440 
so that is what those structures are for

he's<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.600> some<00:00:48.629> pretty<00:00:48.840> cool<00:00:48.960> stuff<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.469> there

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
he's got some pretty cool stuff on there

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.299 
he's got some pretty cool stuff on there
here<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:50.879> second<00:00:51.420> on<00:00:52.129> here's<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
here is the one second on here's the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.090 
here is the one second on here's the
inside<00:00:53.430> that<00:00:54.210> colon<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.530> actually<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
inside that colon is actually the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.849 
inside that colon is actually the
oscillator<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.989> controlled<00:00:58.440> by

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
oscillator and it's all controlled by

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.490 
oscillator and it's all controlled by
that<00:00:59.460> switch<00:01:00.030> which<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.050> turns<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that switch which just turns the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
that switch which just turns the
oscillator<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> off<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.789> really<00:01:03.030> all

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
oscillator on and off that's really all

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
oscillator on and off that's really all
it<00:01:03.239> does<00:01:03.589> so<00:01:04.589> trite<00:01:04.830> ignore<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.129> green<00:01:05.339> stuff

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it does so trite ignore that green stuff

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
it does so trite ignore that green stuff
for<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.820> anyway<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> cold<00:01:06.750> oscillates<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
for now anyway the cold oscillates and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
for now anyway the cold oscillates and
it's<00:01:08.130> got<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:08.490> output<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:09.600> has

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
it's got to an output to here which has

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's got to an output to here which has
a<00:01:10.140> pulsar<00:01:10.950> or<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> pulse<00:01:12.000> limiter<00:01:13.010> which<00:01:14.010> goes

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
a pulsar or a pulse limiter which goes

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.780 
a pulsar or a pulse limiter which goes
to<00:01:14.640> all<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:16.009> then<00:01:17.009> every<00:01:17.220> 10<00:01:17.400> seconds

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
to all this and then every 10 seconds

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.230 
to all this and then every 10 seconds
this<00:01:18.420> goes<00:01:18.630> off<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.220> moves<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.369> around<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
this goes off and moves that around and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
this goes off and moves that around and
you<00:01:21.840> got<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.409> go<00:01:22.530> off<00:01:22.710> um<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
you got to see that go off um but the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.810 
you got to see that go off um but the
problem<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.110> design<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.299> these<00:01:28.820> glass

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
problem with this design is these glass

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.749 
problem with this design is these glass
blocks<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.439> built<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.860> off<00:01:32.070> by<00:01:32.729> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
blocks the way the built it's off by I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.469 
blocks the way the built it's off by I
think<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:33.930> two<00:01:34.140> yeah<00:01:34.320> two<00:01:34.350> blocks<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
think one or two yeah two blocks so the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
think one or two yeah two blocks so the
reset<00:01:36.810> circuit<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.380> kick<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.710> when

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
reset circuit has to kick in when

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.810 
reset circuit has to kick in when
they're<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.220> off<00:01:39.740> until<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:41.460> can<00:01:41.610> go<00:01:41.700> all

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
they're all off until they can go all

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090 
they're all off until they can go all
the<00:01:41.850> way<00:01:41.939> around<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.390> get<00:01:42.479> reset<00:01:42.720> again<00:01:43.100> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the way around and get reset again and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.350 
the way around and get reset again and
I'll<00:01:44.220> explain<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
I'll explain more about that if I do a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.310 
I'll explain more about that if I do a
tutorial<00:01:45.570> anyway<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.479> 10<00:01:48.479> turns<00:01:48.930> off

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
tutorial anyway here is the 10 turns off

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.270 
tutorial anyway here is the 10 turns off
it<00:01:50.100> triggers<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.180> minute<00:01:51.479> timer<00:01:52.280> which

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it triggers this one minute timer which

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.789 
it triggers this one minute timer which
will<00:01:53.640> bring<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:54.659> where<00:01:55.140> bring<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
will bring up where bring down the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.209 
will bring up where bring down the
minute<00:01:56.390> clock<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.219> then

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
minute clock there we go and then

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.780 
minute clock there we go and then
eventually<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.880> will<00:01:59.909> rotate<00:02:00.450> until<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
eventually that will rotate until the

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.719 
eventually that will rotate until the
that<00:02:02.790> yellow<00:02:03.060> block<00:02:03.360> gets<00:02:04.020> here<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.729> then

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that yellow block gets here and then

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.109 
that yellow block gets here and then
that<00:02:06.210> yellow<00:02:06.479> block<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:07.849> trip

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that yellow block will trip

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.839 
that yellow block will trip
this<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.929> will<00:02:09.959> go<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.319> pulse

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
this and it will go to that pulse

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.970 
this and it will go to that pulse
limiter<00:02:11.849> which<00:02:12.090> goes<00:02:12.900> into<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.260> memory<00:02:13.620> unit

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
limiter which goes into this memory unit

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.770 
limiter which goes into this memory unit
and<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.610> memory<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.269> toggles<00:02:15.659> that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
and the memory it just toggles that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.910 
and the memory it just toggles that
between<00:02:16.080> 0<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:19.159> 0<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.489> 1<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:22.799> all<00:02:22.890> just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
between 0 and 0 and 1 and it all just

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.430 
between 0 and 0 and 1 and it all just
keeps<00:02:23.400> counting<00:02:23.670> down<00:02:23.819> until<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:25.019> down<00:02:25.319> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
keeps counting down until you down to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.979 
keeps counting down until you down to
zero<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.890> currently<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:27.030> no<00:02:27.390> form<00:02:28.049> of<00:02:28.140> output
