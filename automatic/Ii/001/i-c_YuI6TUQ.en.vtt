00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
now this image I have to say is the

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.329 
now this image I have to say is the
craziest<00:00:03.179> one<00:00:03.510> I've<00:00:03.689> seen<00:00:03.959> yet<00:00:04.020> I<00:00:04.529> looked<00:00:05.160> at

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
craziest one I've seen yet I looked at

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.330 
craziest one I've seen yet I looked at
it<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.549> few<00:00:05.790> weeks<00:00:05.940> ago<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:07.350> didn't<00:00:07.680> do

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
it a few weeks ago and I didn't do

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.259 
it a few weeks ago and I didn't do
anything<00:00:08.610> with<00:00:09.030> it

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
anything with it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.870 
anything with it
and<00:00:09.540> for<00:00:10.410> some<00:00:10.590> reason<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.130> decided<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.639> come

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
and for some reason I decided to come

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.200 
and for some reason I decided to come
back<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.690> again<00:00:12.809> today<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.940> things<00:00:14.940> had

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
back to it again today and things had

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.090 
back to it again today and things had
changed<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.680> image<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.449> from<00:00:18.720> left

they're<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.330> same<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:28.050> when<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> first

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the nice one but the mean one I don't

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.200

know<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.770> any<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> remember<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.729> movie

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
know if any of you remember that movie

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.350 
know if any of you remember that movie
but<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.380> mean<00:01:19.590> gremlins<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
but there was some mean gremlins and

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
but there was some mean gremlins and
anyway<00:01:21.590> this<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.799> reminds<00:01:23.159> me<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> mean

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
anyway this one reminds me of the mean

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.399 
anyway this one reminds me of the mean
gremlin<00:01:24.270> he<00:01:24.450> has<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.140> little

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
gremlin he has kind of that little

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
gremlin he has kind of that little
pointy<00:01:25.830> chin<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.430> then<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> evil<00:01:27.060> little

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
pointy chin and then the evil little

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420 
pointy chin and then the evil little
ears<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.229> right<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
ears and and right here you can see a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.350 
ears and and right here you can see a
tail<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:31.070> so<00:01:32.070> anyway<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> went<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> look<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
tail and so anyway I went to look at the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.289 
tail and so anyway I went to look at the
image<00:01:33.799> yesterday<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> what<00:01:36.180> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
image yesterday and this is what it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.170 
image yesterday and this is what it
looks<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.950> completely<00:01:38.280> changed

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
looks like so it's completely changed

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
looks like so it's completely changed
from<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> original<00:01:40.140> image<00:01:40.470> looked<00:01:40.770> like

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
from what the original image looked like

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.660 
from what the original image looked like
and<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:42.540> doesn't<00:01:42.930> make<00:01:43.140> any<00:01:43.320> sense<00:01:43.770> why<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and it doesn't make any sense why you

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.050 
and it doesn't make any sense why you
would<00:01:44.970> take<00:01:45.079> what<00:01:46.079> appears<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.340> real

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
would take what appears to be a real

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.740 
would take what appears to be a real
creature<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.979> then<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.250> put<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:51.420> big

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
creature and then just put in this big

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.420 
creature and then just put in this big
dark<00:01:52.380> blob<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> middle<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> image<00:01:54.450> to

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
dark blob in the middle of the image to

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.679 
dark blob in the middle of the image to
begin<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> image<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.420> grainy

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
begin with the image is really grainy

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.499 
begin with the image is really grainy
anyway<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> then<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.640> one<00:01:59.850> looks<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.149> it's

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
anyway and then this one looks like it's

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.399 
anyway and then this one looks like it's
been<00:02:00.630> darkened<00:02:01.439> some<00:02:02.399> somewhat<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
been darkened some somewhat this is the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.350 
been darkened some somewhat this is the
original<00:02:04.530> date<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.340> image<00:02:05.700> when<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:05.969> first

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
original date of the image when I first

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.010 
original date of the image when I first
downloaded<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.619> back<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.129> September<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
downloaded it back in September and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.690 
downloaded it back in September and
silly<00:02:10.020> me<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.649> thinking<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.160> had<00:02:11.400> some

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
silly me I was thinking that I had some

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.410 
silly me I was thinking that I had some
time<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.510> work<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.959> image

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
time to work with the image

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.850 
time to work with the image
could<00:02:13.569> come<00:02:13.780> back<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.349> would<00:02:14.470> be<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.709> its

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
could come back and it would be in its

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.860 
could come back and it would be in its
original<00:02:15.130> format<00:02:15.819> but<00:02:16.060> clearly<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.569> image

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
original format but clearly the image

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.309 
original format but clearly the image
has<00:02:17.200> been<00:02:17.410> altered<00:02:17.680> by<00:02:18.069> NASA<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:19.180> something<00:02:19.959> is

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
has been altered by NASA so something is

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.770 
has been altered by NASA so something is
really<00:02:20.590> strange<00:02:21.069> going<00:02:21.190> on<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.640> either<00:02:22.239> NASA

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
really strange going on here either NASA

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.280 
really strange going on here either NASA
is<00:02:23.260> putting<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.220> artifacts<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.690> anomalies

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
is putting in artifacts and anomalies

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.620 
is putting in artifacts and anomalies
that<00:02:27.099> aren't<00:02:27.459> there<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.790> begin<00:02:28.060> with<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.480> they

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
that aren't there to begin with and they

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.420 
that aren't there to begin with and they
are<00:02:28.660> editing<00:02:29.230> them<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.650> make<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.980> look<00:02:30.220> like

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
are editing them to make it look like

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.250 
are editing them to make it look like
there's<00:02:30.700> something<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:31.330> not<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
there's something there that's not and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.070 
there's something there that's not and
then<00:02:32.800> removing<00:02:33.370> them<00:02:33.580> or<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.510> are<00:02:34.630> actually

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
then removing them or they are actually

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.590 
then removing them or they are actually
removing<00:02:35.709> live<00:02:36.100> creatures<00:02:36.760> from<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> images

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
removing live creatures from the images

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.180 
removing live creatures from the images
so<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:38.890> really<00:02:39.340> kind<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.910> sad<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.380> see<00:02:41.890> that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
so it's really kind of sad to see that

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.520 
so it's really kind of sad to see that
our<00:02:42.700> tax<00:02:43.000> dollars<00:02:43.480> are<00:02:43.660> being<00:02:43.690> used<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.349> this

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
our tax dollars are being used in this

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.699 
our tax dollars are being used in this
way<00:02:44.739> to<00:02:44.800> play<00:02:45.040> games<00:02:45.370> with<00:02:45.810> society<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.110> not

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
way to play games with society and not
