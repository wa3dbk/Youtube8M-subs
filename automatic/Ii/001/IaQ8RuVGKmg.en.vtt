00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
talking about the belt height limit

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.440 
talking about the belt height limit
because<00:00:05.160> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.490> be<00:00:05.549> mainly<00:00:05.759> speculation

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
because going to be mainly speculation

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.789 
because going to be mainly speculation
because<00:00:06.600> most<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.290> things<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.620> know<00:00:07.740> you

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
because most of the things we know you

because most of the things we know you
don't<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.130> any<00:00:08.280> facts<00:00:08.550> from<00:00:08.670> 4j<00:00:09.120> because<00:00:09.420> uh

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
don't have any facts from 4j because uh

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.209 
don't have any facts from 4j because uh
the<00:00:10.050> belt<00:00:10.260> idler<00:00:10.440> if<00:00:10.650> you're<00:00:10.740> wondering<00:00:10.860> is

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the belt idler if you're wondering is

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.160 
the belt idler if you're wondering is
it's<00:00:11.759> increasing<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> height<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.929> world

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
it's increasing the height of the world

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
it's increasing the height of the world
where<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.620> build<00:00:13.830> from<00:00:14.089> 128<00:00:15.089> 256

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
where you can build from 128 256

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840 
where you can build from 128 256
essentially<00:00:16.440> double<00:00:16.800> their<00:00:17.430> works<00:00:17.580> out<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.760> be

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
essentially double their works out to be

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.460 
essentially double their works out to be
slightly<00:00:18.090> more<00:00:18.420> than<00:00:18.449> doubled<00:00:18.779> sort<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.320> when

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
slightly more than doubled sort of when

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.929 
slightly more than doubled sort of when
you<00:00:19.560> think<00:00:19.590> about<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.670> it

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you think about it but just it

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.429 
you think about it but just it
essentially<00:00:21.600> doubles<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> world<00:00:22.230> height

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
essentially doubles the world height

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.779 
essentially doubles the world height
which<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.800> really<00:00:23.039> great<00:00:23.189> thing<00:00:23.279> people<00:00:23.730> who

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
which is a really great thing people who

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.009 
which is a really great thing people who
build<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.090> lot<00:00:24.240> because<00:00:24.420> it<00:00:24.600> allows<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> go

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
build a lot because it allows you to go

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.689 
build a lot because it allows you to go

it<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> xpac<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.689> way<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> xbox<00:01:10.170> works

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it but the xpac the way the xbox works

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.920 
it but the xpac the way the xbox works
saw<00:01:10.650> makes<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.189> hard<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> basically<00:01:12.810> be

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930

willing why the issue in ism I believe
the<00:01:15.960> issue<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.460> double<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the issue is because to have double the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
the issue is because to have double the
world<00:01:18.000> right<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.720> means<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.170> essentially

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
world right that means it essentially

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.990 
world right that means it essentially
doubles<00:01:20.040> number<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.340> chunks<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> world

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
doubles number of chunks in the world

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.270 
doubles number of chunks in the world
and<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.140> reason<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> limited<00:01:23.100> bolt

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and the reason we have a limited bolt

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
and the reason we have a limited bolt
size<00:01:23.430> next<00:01:23.700> box<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.060> 864<00:01:24.960> by<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> 64<00:01:25.680> Prime

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
size next box it's 864 by a 64 Prime

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.160 
size next box it's 864 by a 64 Prime
correct<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.570> memory

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
correct it's because the memory

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
correct it's because the memory
limitations<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> Xbox<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.759> seven

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
limitations of the Xbox it's a seven

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.880 
limitations of the Xbox it's a seven

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
point trying to play a 2013 game and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
point trying to play a 2013 game and
obviously<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.659> can<00:01:36.869> expect<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.409> has<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.619> be

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
obviously you can expect there has to be

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
obviously you can expect there has to be
downgrade<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.159> quite<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> few<00:01:38.400> ways<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.240> of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
downgrade in quite a few ways and one of

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.460 
downgrade in quite a few ways and one of
those<00:01:39.420> ways<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> limit<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.409> number

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
those ways is there to limit the number

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
those ways is there to limit the number
of<00:01:40.590> junks<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> world<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:42.030> they<00:01:42.180> could<00:01:42.420> you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
of junks in the world so they could you

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
of junks in the world so they could you
know<00:01:43.049> make<00:01:43.229> otherwise<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.250> creates<00:01:44.490> serious

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
know make otherwise it creates serious

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
know make otherwise it creates serious
issues<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> remember<00:01:45.479> they<00:01:45.570> had<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.290> big<00:01:46.560> old

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
issues I remember they had a big old

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.840 
issues I remember they had a big old
debate<00:01:47.040> about<00:01:47.159> where<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.520> were<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:47.670> to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
debate about where they were going to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
debate about where they were going to
increase<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> world<00:01:48.450> size<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> they

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
increase the world size and they

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780 
increase the world size and they
basically<00:01:49.530> said<00:01:49.890> no<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> can't<00:01:50.460> ever<00:01:50.610> happen

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
basically said no it can't ever happen

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
basically said no it can't ever happen
because<00:01:51.119> we'd<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> optimize<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.200> code

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because we'd have to optimize the code

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
because we'd have to optimize the code
double<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.310> increase<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> world<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
double as much to increase the world I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.719 
double as much to increase the world I
to<00:01:54.630> increase<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> world<00:01:55.170> size<00:01:55.409> by<00:01:56.340> even<00:01:56.610> like

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
to increase the world size by even like

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.120 
to increase the world size by even like
1.5<00:01:57.329> times<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.530> increase<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> world

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
1.5 times so to increase the world

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
1.5 times so to increase the world
height<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.579> essentially<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> same<00:02:00.299> thing

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
height it's essentially the same thing

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.139 
height it's essentially the same thing
but<00:02:00.960> you're<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.860> they'd<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.030> make

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
but you're it's they'd have to make

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.370 
but you're it's they'd have to make
massive<00:02:03.420> breakthroughs<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> coding

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
massive breakthroughs in the coding

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.139 
massive breakthroughs in the coding
which<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.950> probably<00:02:05.280> expect<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:05.850> trying

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
which I probably expect they're trying

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449 
which I probably expect they're trying
to<00:02:06.210> make<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:07.409> whoever<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.310> they're

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
to make but whoever or not they're

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.040 
to make but whoever or not they're
actually<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.119> not<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.450> really

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
actually going to or not is really

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.550 
actually going to or not is really
really<00:02:10.319> unlikely<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:12.440> run

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
really unlikely because run

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.789 
see the built right limit increased
mainly<00:02:48.750> because<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.170> memory<00:02:49.500> limitations

mainly because of the memory limitations

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.199 
mainly because of the memory limitations
of<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.280> xbox<00:02:51.920> for<00:02:52.920> jay<00:02:53.130> they<00:02:53.459> might<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.940> come

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
of the xbox for jay they might just come

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.580 
of the xbox for jay they might just come
out<00:02:54.360> with<00:02:54.480> some<00:02:54.660> miraculous<00:02:54.959> solution<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.530> it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
out with some miraculous solution to it

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.350 
out with some miraculous solution to it
as<00:02:55.650> i<00:02:55.739> said<00:02:55.950> but<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.370> highly<00:02:56.670> unlikely<00:02:56.850> so

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
as i said but it's highly unlikely so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.089 
as i said but it's highly unlikely so
that's<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.660> verdict<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.440> video<00:02:58.680> it's

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
that's the verdict of this video it's

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.770 
that's the verdict of this video it's
probably<00:02:59.640> not<00:02:59.790> going<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> happen<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.330> wait<00:03:00.540> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
probably not going to happen in wait to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.780 
probably not going to happen in wait to
try<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.440> treat<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.680> at<00:03:01.769> 4j<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:02.310> me<00:03:02.459> because

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
try and treat you at 4j with me because

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.250 
try and treat you at 4j with me because
then<00:03:03.000> they<00:03:03.299> won't<00:03:03.450> respond<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.870> me<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.140> we'll

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
then they won't respond to me then we'll

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.170 
then they won't respond to me then we'll
just<00:03:04.380> want<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:04.680> people<00:03:04.980> asking<00:03:05.940> them<00:03:06.090> if
