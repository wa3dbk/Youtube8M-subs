this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.319> our<00:00:01.530> look<00:00:01.800> inside<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.760> rolling<00:00:03.270> gp8<00:00:03.990> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
this is our look inside a rolling gp8 a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.240 
this is our look inside a rolling gp8 a
guitar<00:00:05.220> processor<00:00:05.879> from<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.270> 80s<00:00:06.779> and<00:00:10.070> it<00:00:11.070> is

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
guitar processor from the 80s and it is

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.530 
guitar processor from the 80s and it is
believed<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:12.000> be<00:00:12.210> all<00:00:12.480> analog<00:00:13.080> circuitry

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
believed to be all analog circuitry

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.250 
believed to be all analog circuitry
I'll<00:00:15.540> see<00:00:15.900> very<00:00:16.710> many<00:00:17.750> processing<00:00:18.750> chips<00:00:19.050> in

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
I'll see very many processing chips in

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:38.200 
I'll see very many processing chips in
here<00:00:31.910> lots<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.149> capacitors<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.110> resistors

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.860 

the<00:00:39.210> power<00:00:39.450> section<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:42.379> very<00:00:43.379> dusty<00:00:44.870> from

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the power section here very dusty from

00:00:45.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
the power section here very dusty from
the<00:00:48.620> chip<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.070> battery<00:01:02.390> this<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.489> chip

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the chip is the battery this is the chip

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:15.710 
the chip is the battery this is the chip
with<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:06.950> GPA<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.460> version<00:01:10.549> one<00:01:13.100> zero<00:01:14.100> zero

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
with the GPA a version one zero zero

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.429 
with the GPA a version one zero zero
I<00:01:17.630> don't<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.020> any<00:01:19.049> other

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I don't know if they have any other

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.560 
I don't know if they have any other
versions<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:21.080> we<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> input<00:01:23.570> inputs

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
versions but we have the input inputs

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.080 
versions but we have the input inputs
and<00:01:24.720> outputs<00:01:25.229> here<00:01:26.420> which<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> second<00:01:29.820> board

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and outputs here which the second board

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:38.450 
and outputs here which the second board
that<00:01:30.360> it's<00:01:30.509> attached<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:53.660 

it's<00:01:39.460> an<00:01:39.579> adjusting<00:01:40.210> part<00:01:40.540> here

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.270 

that's<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.510> look<00:01:54.690> inside<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.350> Roland<00:01:56.270> gp8
