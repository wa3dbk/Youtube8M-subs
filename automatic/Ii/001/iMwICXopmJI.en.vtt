00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.839
 Good, I'll show you how 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.920
 the goalkeeper line works 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.920
 you can see that the ball rotates 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.920
 and fro 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.170
 I'll show you the positions the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.380
 first we all know that the goalkeeper 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.210
 he can only get the ball on his court 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.739
 defensive here in case he can receive 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:39.120
 passing the ball is from the middle of the court 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.870
 You may receive a time not to occur 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.590
 risk of being lacking the same athlete 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:52.500
 backing the ball to the goalkeeper 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:56.969
 it is advisable for the goalkeeper to stay on the court 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.359
 the offensive or after the line of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:04.250
 to avoid the risk of receiving the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:09.049
 ball again and without fail 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.150
 Good, then the goalkeeper will stand 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.040
 on the left 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.970
 another player on the right another player 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 in the center and the other two on the 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 I get the mark and I'll go 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.670
 show you goals of several 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.630
 Ways I'll skip the video now you 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.630
 will understand better 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:48.200
 ok goal with the goalkeeper positioned at 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:52.880
 Left again, the passing ball works. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.369
 to the player through the left turn 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:04.850
 for what is in the center has opened the space 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:12.800
 and kicks the goal over there 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:15.350
 ball opened here and kicks the goal 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.000
 I'm showing you several 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:26.260
 situations that you can do that goal 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.830
 the player coming behind received it and 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.830
 scored goal against in another way 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.500
 rang appeared 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:48.520
 the player appeared and goals of several 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.680
 ways 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:55.930
 This is called a goalkeeper-line. 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 because we use the goalkeeper as a player 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.680
 there is an advantage of five athletes 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.680
 against four opponents 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:18.550
 Good, I'll skip the video one more time. 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.550
 complete for you at home the xerem 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:58.490
 so the folks just practice on 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:03.270
 Quite because futsal reminding you 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.300
 futsal is a collective game is not a game 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.640
 individual 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:14.130
 individualism it can be applied 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.020
 or a dribbling move when the scheme 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:23.100
 tactic is not working there you 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:26.030
 can play a dribbling move but it is 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.610
 essential to play collectively 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.350
 playing in group training hard if 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.140
 devoting enough 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.120
 surely you will win any 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.180
 game 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.580
 a question that everyone else makes the team 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.550
 adversary they also know how to do 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.410
 casters know how to play 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:51.210
 maneuvers with the ball know to play goalkeeper 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:54.540
 line but that thing knows know more 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.130
 who will train more will improve 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.430
 more 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.660
 and you're more likely to win that 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.050
 that to err less is the great champion 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.490
