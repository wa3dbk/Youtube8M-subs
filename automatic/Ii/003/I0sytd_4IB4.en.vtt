00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.560
 which is super soft super slim and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.060
 with such brilliance I experienced a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.250

 I liked it enough it returned brightness 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.830
 A little bit of my hair is 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 porous 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.920
 so maybe I have to do a little 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.590
 more but I've seen a great result shine 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.020

 Simple and I'll show you the way to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.600
 You are a new product that this one. 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:00.989

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059

 I received from a small shop I'll leave the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.700
 information here below the video and that's it 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.810
 People forgive me for my voice and hoarse 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.380

 Super kiss, good people, so I'm here. 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 in my bathroom and I will then moisturize 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.900
 my hair 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.840
 my most recipe hair on the tips is 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.509
 more porous at the tips because of gold 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.250
 This is how I cauterized him. 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.130
 it's not so dry 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.409
 but without writing so dry that my 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.130
 fingers do not even slip through the hair 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.950
 now not until you're good and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.899
 I have the most hair that is recycled from this 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.110
 side here I do not know why this part 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.420
 here is more parched then will give 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.979

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.360
 so rock comics is bamboo and let's go 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.350

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.690
 Good, I freak out, and I'll let you 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.069
 act for 10 minutes 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.069
 Rinse and now let's dry 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.080
 with the aid of a paddle brush and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.530
 clearance at the same time you songs 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.530

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.570
 now as own brush to make 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:06.320
 brush I'll smoothing while I go 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:09.350
 passing dryer at the time of the fringe 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:14.560
 using a small thermal brush 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.560
 that makes it easier for us to straighten 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 contained girls and boys 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.290
 this is the result he got super soft 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.600
 and it really moisturizes and gives 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.120
 very beautiful shine on the hair then 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.140
 I liked it a lot and this is the result of 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.140
 straight hair okay 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.020
 Let's see the ripple effect that is mine. 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.910
 Preferred then before anything else 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.300
 uses a little eye that is an oil of 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.490
 macadamia with argan I spend more on 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.850
 which is where I dry more and I will 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.220
 spreading to the rest of the hair - 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.160
 root use this my baby liss he is 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.910
 old man but I always start from 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.310
 low but does not have much son squid is not 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.050
 always it out and go rolling your hair 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:19.739
 out and you 're rolling on the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:21.959
 sequence on the other side is the 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.450
 front and rolled into 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.420
 only the front wick is just for 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.880
 give a trick looks like a hairstyle is 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.070
 because usually natural hair a 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.310
 side is sometimes turned inward to 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.900
 out then I do it 's good is that 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.960
 result of it rolled up 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.320
 now I'm going to break up the curls with the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.040
 fingers like a comb the fingers and the 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.040
 people are going to undo 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:03.120
