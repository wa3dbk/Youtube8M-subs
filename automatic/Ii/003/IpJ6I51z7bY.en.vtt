little drop actually that one saw this

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.930 
little drop actually that one saw this
Tom<00:00:04.560> Friedman<00:00:05.040> did<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.279> piece<00:00:05.460> with<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.790> and

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
Tom Friedman did this piece with you and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.970 
Tom Friedman did this piece with you and
I<00:00:06.000> saw<00:00:06.420> you<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:06.870> not<00:00:07.170> was<00:00:07.290> only<00:00:07.680> actually

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I saw you do this not was only actually

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.890 
I saw you do this not was only actually
excited<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.460> get<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.670> see<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.090> actually<00:00:09.510> tried

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
excited I get to see it actually tried

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.390 
excited I get to see it actually tried
to<00:00:09.929> smash<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.500> thing<00:00:10.559> with<00:00:10.860> that's<00:00:11.219> right

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
to smash this thing with that's right

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.209 
to smash this thing with that's right
camera<00:00:11.670> here<00:00:11.849> that's<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> really<00:00:12.599> light<00:00:13.080> bulb<00:00:13.440> I

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
camera here that's a really light bulb I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.560 
camera here that's a really light bulb I
good<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.639> could<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.849> yeah<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.420> like

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
good this you could just yeah it's like

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.540 
good this you could just yeah it's like
you<00:00:15.839> could<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.109> with<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.710> yeah<00:00:17.490> you

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
you could do that with it and yeah you

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.179 
you could do that with it and yeah you
notice<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> sound<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:19.289> tells<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.740> how<00:00:19.859> stiff

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
notice the sound it tells you how stiff

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.790 
notice the sound it tells you how stiff
it<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.520> yeah<00:00:22.100> meet<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.250> hard<00:00:24.050> very<00:00:25.050> strong

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it is yeah meet this hard very strong

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.830 
it is yeah meet this hard very strong
very<00:00:25.859> stiff<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.880> stuff<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.210> absorb<00:00:27.539> 12

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
very stiff this stuff can absorb 12

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
very stiff this stuff can absorb 12
times<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.260> much<00:00:28.380> energy<00:00:28.439> per<00:00:29.429> pound<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.820> steal

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
times as much energy per pound to steal

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.849 
times as much energy per pound to steal

its two-thirds carbon fiber one-third
thermoplastic<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.820> he's<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> carbon<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
thermoplastic because he's a carbon and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.500

nylon<00:00:34.440> plywood<00:00:35.239> automatically<00:00:36.239> made<00:00:36.390> and

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
nylon plywood automatically made and

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
nylon plywood automatically made and
then<00:00:36.600> we<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.809> stick<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.290> hot<00:00:38.010> die<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
then we just stick it on a hot die and

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
then we just stick it on a hot die and
mold<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> shape<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> wanted<00:00:40.230> less

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
mold it to the shape you wanted less

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.740 
mold it to the shape you wanted less
than<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> minute<00:00:40.860> yeah<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.149> say<00:00:42.480> auto

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
than a minute yeah so it can be say auto

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
than a minute yeah so it can be say auto
body<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.590> why<00:00:44.520> isn't<00:00:44.730> everybody<00:00:44.879> rushing

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
body right why isn't everybody rushing

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.580 
body right why isn't everybody rushing
in<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> well<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.200> was<00:00:46.350> just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
in to do that well this was just

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
in to do that well this was just
validated<00:00:47.160> over<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> last<00:00:47.670> couple<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.120> years

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
validated over the last couple of years

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
validated over the last couple of years

now<00:01:03.120> if<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> make<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> car<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.350> stuff

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
now if you make a car out of this stuff

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.660 
now if you make a car out of this stuff
yeah<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.350> lose<00:01:07.560> half<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.010> weight<00:01:08.189> half<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
yeah you lose half the weight half the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.210 
yeah you lose half the weight half the
fuel<00:01:08.850> use<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.960> anyway<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> owe<00:01:10.920> mrs.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
fuel use it anyway that's you owe mrs.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.210 
fuel use it anyway that's you owe mrs.
on<00:01:11.520> yes<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.840> costs<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> same<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
on yes it costs the same to make and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.609 
on yes it costs the same to make and
it's<00:01:14.430> safer<00:01:14.820> 12<00:01:15.299> times<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.930> crash<00:01:16.140> energy

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
it's safer 12 times the crash energy

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.380 
it's safer 12 times the crash energy
absorption<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.220> steel<00:01:17.490> per<00:01:17.520> pound<00:01:17.970> why<00:01:18.240> does

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
absorption of steel per pound why does

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.550 
absorption of steel per pound why does
it<00:01:18.509> cost<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.840> same<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> make<00:01:19.259> aren't<00:01:19.470> these

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it cost the same to make aren't these

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.580 
it cost the same to make aren't these
really<00:01:19.830> expensive<00:01:20.070> material<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.580> well<00:01:20.610> yeah

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
really expensive material as well yeah

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
really expensive material as well yeah
but<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.369> man<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.570> much

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
but the way you man you don't need much

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.870 
but the way you man you don't need much
material<00:01:25.020> when<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.670> different

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
material when it's so much different

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.160 
material when it's so much different
stronger<00:01:27.540> than<00:01:27.659> steel<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.909> actually<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
stronger than steel and actually the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.039 
stronger than steel and actually the
costlier<00:01:31.890> materials<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.579> offset<00:01:33.119> by<00:01:33.360> making

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
costlier materials are offset by making

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.469 
costlier materials are offset by making
the<00:01:34.229> propulsion<00:01:34.829> system<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:36.060> three<00:01:36.299> times

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the propulsion system about three times

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.020 
the propulsion system about three times

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
