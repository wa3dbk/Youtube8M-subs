focusing in on the camera instead of
looking<00:01:55.290> elsewhere<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.040> they<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> see

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
looking elsewhere because they can see

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.810 
looking elsewhere because they can see
themselves<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.950> that<00:01:58.950> works<00:01:59.219> really<00:01:59.460> good

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
themselves and that works really good

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.600 
themselves and that works really good
the<00:02:00.420> other<00:02:00.570> thing<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.740> does<00:02:02.009> it<00:02:02.040> maneuvers

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the other thing is it does it maneuvers

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
the other thing is it does it maneuvers
around<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.479> because<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.229> does

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
around a little more because it does

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
around a little more because it does
have<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.680> feature<00:02:04.890> maneuvers<00:02:05.520> around<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
have that feature maneuvers around a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.510 
have that feature maneuvers around a
little<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.299> than<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> omd<00:02:06.899> em5<00:02:07.020> does<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> i

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
little more than the omd em5 does and i

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.780 
little more than the omd em5 does and i
really<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.869> touch<00:02:10.440> fire<00:02:10.860> feature<00:02:11.430> which

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
really like the touch fire feature which

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.490 
really like the touch fire feature which
is<00:02:11.819> also<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.420> om-d<00:02:12.780> but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is also on the om-d but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
is also on the om-d but
it's<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.190> cool<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.730> works<00:02:14.910> really<00:02:15.150> great

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it's really cool it works really great

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.150 
it's really cool it works really great
you<00:02:15.540> focus<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.260> see<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.010> hit

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you focus you see what you want you hit

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.620 
you focus you see what you want you hit
the<00:02:17.280> screen<00:02:17.610> where<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.880> want<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> focus

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the screen where you want it to focus

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.910 
the screen where you want it to focus
and<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:19.140> focuses<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.800> fires<00:02:20.070> so<00:02:20.880> fast<00:02:21.500> I'm<00:02:22.500> not

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
and it focuses and fires so fast I'm not

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.290 
and it focuses and fires so fast I'm not
sure<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.700> my<00:02:24.590> d7000<00:02:25.590> focuses<00:02:26.490> faster<00:02:27.090> than

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
sure that my d7000 focuses faster than

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.370 
sure that my d7000 focuses faster than
the<00:02:27.660> EPL<00:02:28.110> 5<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.680> think<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.490> EPL<00:02:29.850> 5<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:31.200> this

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
the EPL 5 I think the EPL 5 and this

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.620 
the EPL 5 I think the EPL 5 and this
isn't<00:02:31.709> a<00:02:31.830> testing<00:02:32.490> thing<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.940> haven't<00:02:33.270> done<00:02:33.390> any

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
isn't a testing thing I haven't done any

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.930 
isn't a testing thing I haven't done any
stopwatch<00:02:34.440> test<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.490> shooting<00:02:35.850> the

stopwatch test just a shooting the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.180 
stopwatch test just a shooting the
camera<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.420> how<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.660> feels<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.200> feels<00:02:37.230> as<00:02:37.860> fast

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
camera and how it feels it feels as fast

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.300 
camera and how it feels it feels as fast
as<00:02:38.430> my<00:02:38.610> d7000<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:39.690> focus<00:02:40.080> very<00:02:40.740> nice<00:02:40.980> very

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
as my d7000 for focus very nice very

feels cheap and plasticky it's actually
it's<00:02:52.560> really<00:02:52.950> nice<00:02:53.459> build<00:02:53.880> for<00:02:54.239> an

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it's really nice build for an

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.479 
it's really nice build for an
inexpensive<00:02:54.630> kit<00:02:55.290> lens<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:56.010> seems<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.459> be

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
inexpensive kit lens and it seems to be

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.130 
inexpensive kit lens and it seems to be
plenty<00:02:56.850> sharp<00:02:57.270> I've<00:02:57.510> been<00:02:57.660> getting<00:02:57.959> pretty

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
plenty sharp I've been getting pretty

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.160 
plenty sharp I've been getting pretty
decent<00:02:58.709> photos<00:02:59.070> out<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.489> I<00:02:59.670> have<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.660> 45

millimeter f-18 on the way and I'm

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.000 
millimeter f-18 on the way and I'm
probably<00:03:03.600> going<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.900> pick<00:03:04.050> up<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.290> Panasonic

20 millimeter f17 and probably get a lot
of<00:03:08.459> use<00:03:08.580> out<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.910> those<00:03:09.140> lenses<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.010> seems

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
of use out of those lenses but it seems

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.220 
of use out of those lenses but it seems
really<00:03:11.580> good<00:03:11.810> let<00:03:12.810> me<00:03:12.870> tell<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.140> another

really good let me tell you another

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.660 
really good let me tell you another
couple<00:03:13.680> features<00:03:13.920> here<00:03:14.370> that<00:03:14.430> were

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
couple features here that were

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.400 
couple features here that were
attractive<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.330> me<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.630> why<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:15.780> picked<00:03:16.050> up<00:03:16.230> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
attractive to me on why I picked up the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.949 
attractive to me on why I picked up the
EPL<00:03:16.739> 5<00:03:16.950> as<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.910> said<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.330> got<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> 16

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
EPL 5 as I said it's got the 16

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.020 
EPL 5 as I said it's got the 16
megapixel<00:03:19.620> sensor<00:03:19.980> that's<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.370> same<00:03:20.610> one<00:03:20.790> in

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
megapixel sensor that's the same one in

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.470 
megapixel sensor that's the same one in
the<00:03:21.720> olympus<00:03:22.170> omd<00:03:22.440> em5<00:03:22.760> king<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.940> hill<00:03:24.150> for

basically the image quality out of this

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.740 
basically the image quality out of this
thing<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.440> on<00:03:28.650> par<00:03:28.950> with<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.299> d7000<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.450> any

thing is on par with the d7000 and any

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.539 
thing is on par with the d7000 and any
