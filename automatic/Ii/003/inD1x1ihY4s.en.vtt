00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
to jump in my veins and we actually do

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.900 
to jump in my veins and we actually do
the<00:05:29.979> fun<00:05:30.130> vain<00:05:31.680> but<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:33.070> can't<00:05:33.490> catch<00:05:33.639> her<00:05:33.729> she

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
blows her a flash to get away from me so

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.450 
blows her a flash to get away from me so
that<00:05:35.229> we<00:05:35.380> will<00:05:35.530> actually<00:05:35.800> pick<00:05:35.889> up<00:05:35.950> the<00:05:36.070> hill

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
that we will actually pick up the hill

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.430 
that we will actually pick up the hill
so<00:05:37.090> she<00:05:37.180> actually<00:05:37.419> just<00:05:37.570> isolate<00:05:37.990> our<00:05:40.440> push

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
so she actually just isolate our push

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:57.020 
so she actually just isolate our push
push<00:05:41.710> push

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.910 

so<00:05:57.750> yeah<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:57.900> think<00:05:58.080> I'm<00:05:58.200> in<00:05:58.290> Oracle's<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:58.740> pick

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
so yeah I think I'm in Oracle's I pick

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.280 
so yeah I think I'm in Oracle's I pick
on<00:05:59.010> Merc<00:05:59.160> treads<00:05:59.430> so<00:06:00.420> we<00:06:00.600> just<00:06:00.720> damage<00:06:01.050> on<00:06:01.170> me

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
on Merc treads so we just damage on me

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.430 
on Merc treads so we just damage on me
and<00:06:01.410> reduce<00:06:02.030> consideration<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.780> Oracles<00:06:04.170> is

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
and reduce consideration the Oracles is

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.510 
and reduce consideration the Oracles is
really<00:06:04.620> nice<00:06:09.950> so<00:06:10.950> here<00:06:11.130> we<00:06:11.160> can<00:06:11.250> just<00:06:11.370> do

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
really nice so here we can just do

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.580 
really nice so here we can just do
barren<00:06:11.790> because<00:06:11.880> I'm<00:06:12.360> mobile<00:06:12.630> time<00:06:12.900> I<00:06:13.230> do

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
barren because I'm mobile time I do

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.820 
barren because I'm mobile time I do
enough<00:06:13.950> damage<00:06:13.980> to<00:06:14.340> knock<00:06:14.490> it<00:06:14.610> out<00:06:14.700> and<00:06:15.090> plus<00:06:15.480> a

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
enough damage to knock it out and plus a

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.780 
enough damage to knock it out and plus a
locally<00:06:16.830> based<00:06:17.330> on<00:06:18.330> experience<00:06:18.840> and<00:06:19.350> we<00:06:20.340> skip

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790 
locally based on experience and we skip

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.440 
locally based on experience and we skip
Ribery<00:06:22.520> like<00:06:23.520> they<00:06:23.670> knew<00:06:23.790> we<00:06:23.940> were<00:06:24.060> there<00:06:24.090> but

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
there's nothing to do about it actually

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.400 
there's nothing to do about it actually
picking<00:06:26.730> a<00:06:26.880> double<00:06:27.150> kill<00:06:27.330> I<00:06:27.510> Night<00:06:27.780> Live<00:06:28.080> and
