probably<00:02:38.560> more<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:40.570> water<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:41.110> still

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
probably more and the water is still

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.430 
probably more and the water is still
very<00:02:41.710> clear<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:43.450> haven't<00:02:43.870> even<00:02:44.050> changed<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
very clear I haven't even changed the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.280 
very clear I haven't even changed the
cartridge<00:02:44.860> now<00:02:45.790> I'm<00:02:46.090> I'm<00:02:46.570> deciding<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.170> change

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
cartridge now I'm I'm deciding to change

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.000 
cartridge now I'm I'm deciding to change
the<00:02:47.620> cartridge<00:02:48.130> so<00:02:48.550> let's<00:02:49.500> let's<00:02:50.500> take<00:02:50.710> a<00:02:50.740> look

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
the cartridge so let's let's take a look

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.870 
the cartridge so let's let's take a look
at<00:02:51.100> this

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.060 

you<00:02:54.880> like<00:02:55.060> my<00:02:55.270> lid<00:02:55.810> here<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.230> got<00:02:56.770> this<00:02:56.920> for

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
you like my lid here I got this for

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.810 
you like my lid here I got this for
about<00:02:57.130> seven<00:02:57.640> bucks<00:02:57.910> from<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.020> pet<00:02:59.260> shop<00:02:59.500> um

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
about seven bucks from a pet shop um

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.960 
about seven bucks from a pet shop um
lucky<00:03:01.600> me<00:03:02.110> anyway<00:03:02.920> as<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.190> can<00:03:03.460> see<00:03:03.730> it's

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
lucky me anyway as you can see it's

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.540 
lucky me anyway as you can see it's
pretty<00:03:04.210> dirty<00:03:04.660> in<00:03:04.930> there<00:03:05.080> now<00:03:05.550> there's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
pretty dirty in there now there's

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.200 
pretty dirty in there now there's
probably<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.300> lot<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:08.160> good<00:03:09.160> bacteria<00:03:09.460> that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
probably a lot of good bacteria that

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.580 
probably a lot of good bacteria that
keeps<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.600> aquarium<00:03:11.050> cycled<00:03:12.300> um<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.470> you

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
keeps this aquarium cycled um but you

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.010 
keeps this aquarium cycled um but you
know<00:03:14.740> I<00:03:15.100> noticed<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.970> it's<00:03:16.540> getting<00:03:16.870> too

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
know I noticed that it's getting too

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.610 
know I noticed that it's getting too
bulky<00:03:17.380> in<00:03:17.710> there<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.360> might<00:03:19.780> start

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
bulky in there so it might start

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.590 
bulky in there so it might start
clogging<00:03:21.280> the<00:03:21.310> actual<00:03:21.730> filter<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.300> I<00:03:22.390> don't

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
clogging the actual filter if I don't

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.430 
clogging the actual filter if I don't
change<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:22.990> pretty<00:03:23.200> soon<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:25.230> right<00:03:26.230> now<00:03:26.410> I

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
change it pretty soon so right now I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.510 
change it pretty soon so right now I
would<00:03:26.770> rate<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.160> filter<00:03:28.170> at<00:03:29.170> about<00:03:29.560> four<00:03:30.280> out

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
would rate this filter at about four out

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.710 
would rate this filter at about four out
of<00:03:30.550> five<00:03:31.050> just<00:03:32.050> because<00:03:32.880> in<00:03:33.880> order<00:03:34.090> for<00:03:34.360> us<00:03:34.690> to

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
of five just because in order for us to

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.270 
of five just because in order for us to
actually<00:03:35.130> keep<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.250> going<00:03:36.670> we<00:03:36.850> do<00:03:37.000> need<00:03:37.210> to

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
actually keep it going we do need to

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.850 
actually keep it going we do need to
take<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.459> whole<00:03:39.670> cartridge<00:03:40.540> out<00:03:40.780> which<00:03:41.440> takes

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
take the whole cartridge out which takes

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.760 
take the whole cartridge out which takes
out<00:03:42.070> a<00:03:42.280> lot<00:03:42.490> of<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.790> good<00:03:43.000> bacteria<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.560> do

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
out a lot of the good bacteria so I do

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.000 
out a lot of the good bacteria so I do
want<00:03:45.070> to<00:03:45.160> keep<00:03:45.520> monitoring<00:03:46.470> for<00:03:47.470> any<00:03:47.680> possible

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
want to keep monitoring for any possible

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.270 
want to keep monitoring for any possible
ammonia<00:03:48.970> spikes<00:03:49.480> after<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:50.260> take<00:03:50.650> this<00:03:50.830> one<00:03:51.070> out

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
ammonia spikes after I take this one out

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.840 
ammonia spikes after I take this one out
and<00:03:51.520> put<00:03:51.700> a<00:03:51.730> new<00:03:51.790> one<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:53.670> anyways

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.780 

I'll<00:03:57.850> keep<00:03:58.270> you<00:03:58.480> guys<00:03:58.660> up<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.020> date<00:03:59.350> I<00:03:59.500> guess

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
I'll keep you guys up to date I guess

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.949 
I'll keep you guys up to date I guess
the<00:04:00.790> only<00:04:00.880> thing<00:04:01.000> I'm<00:04:01.300> going<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.660> make<00:04:01.810> sure<00:04:01.840> I

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
the only thing I'm going to make sure I

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.370 
the only thing I'm going to make sure I
don't<00:04:02.260> that<00:04:02.950> I<00:04:02.980> don't<00:04:03.280> do<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.930> clean<00:04:04.930> out<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
don't that I don't do is clean out the

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.310 
don't that I don't do is clean out the
filter<00:04:05.800> so<00:04:06.810> pretty<00:04:07.810> much<00:04:07.959> what<00:04:08.080> I'm<00:04:08.140> going<00:04:08.260> to

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
filter so pretty much what I'm going to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
filter so pretty much what I'm going to
do<00:04:08.410> is<00:04:08.590> take<00:04:09.550> this<00:04:09.760> part<00:04:10.060> out<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.440> then<00:04:11.440> put<00:04:12.310> a

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
do is take this part out and then put a

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.250 
do is take this part out and then put a
new<00:04:12.459> one<00:04:12.580> in<00:04:12.730> but<00:04:13.690> I'm<00:04:13.810> not<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.080> to<00:04:14.140> be

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
new one in but I'm not going to be

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.670 
new one in but I'm not going to be
cleaning<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:15.370> stuff<00:04:16.270> right<00:04:16.480> there<00:04:16.810> that's

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
cleaning that stuff right there that's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.950 
cleaning that stuff right there that's
good<00:04:18.070> bacteria<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.940> actually<00:04:19.000> helps<00:04:19.660> break

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:19.960 
good bacteria that actually helps break

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.680 
good bacteria that actually helps break
down<00:04:19.989> ammonia<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:21.820> forth<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.510> can

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
down ammonia and so forth you can

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.920 
down ammonia and so forth you can
I probably<00:04:22.960> know<00:04:23.410> that<00:04:23.830> already<00:04:24.780> if<00:04:25.780> you

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
I probably know that already if you

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.310 
I probably know that already if you
don't<00:04:26.110> go<00:04:26.620> learn<00:04:26.830> about<00:04:26.890> the<00:04:27.250> nitrogen<00:04:27.700> cycle

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
don't go learn about the nitrogen cycle

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.020 
don't go learn about the nitrogen cycle
and<00:04:29.320> yeah<00:04:31.260> one<00:04:32.260> more<00:04:32.380> thing<00:04:32.590> though<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.950> do<00:04:33.760> have

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
and yeah one more thing though I do have

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.930 
and yeah one more thing though I do have
another<00:04:34.300> 10<00:04:34.840> gallon<00:04:35.170> tank<00:04:35.230> I<00:04:35.770> use<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.640> filter

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
another 10 gallon tank I use this filter

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.990 
another 10 gallon tank I use this filter
put<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.630> in<00:04:37.750> there<00:04:37.960> for<00:04:38.140> about<00:04:38.980> two<00:04:39.460> two<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
put it in there for about two two to

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.710 
put it in there for about two two to
three<00:04:40.180> days<00:04:40.390> and<00:04:41.280> Wow<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:43.240> know<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.660> just

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
three days and Wow it you know it just

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.970 
three days and Wow it you know it just
cycled<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.590> 10<00:04:44.980> gallon<00:04:45.340> tank<00:04:45.370> really<00:04:45.940> fast<00:04:46.980> so

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
cycled the 10 gallon tank really fast so

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.390 
cycled the 10 gallon tank really fast so
yeah<00:04:49.200> that's<00:04:50.200> another<00:04:50.410> way<00:04:50.650> cycling<00:04:51.100> your

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
yeah that's another way cycling your

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.340 
yeah that's another way cycling your
tank<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:53.350> probably<00:04:53.770> will<00:04:54.070> see<00:04:54.310> that<00:04:54.490> from

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
tank you probably will see that from

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.510 
tank you probably will see that from
other<00:04:56.350> videos<00:04:56.890> on<00:04:57.070> YouTube

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
other videos on YouTube

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.130 
other videos on YouTube
or<00:04:57.760> I<00:04:57.790> might<00:04:58.150> have<00:04:58.300> actually<00:04:58.690> covered<00:04:58.870> that

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
or I might have actually covered that

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.010 
or I might have actually covered that
one<00:04:59.260> too<00:04:59.550> anyways<00:05:00.550> that's<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.180> for<00:05:01.240> that<00:05:01.480> I

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
one too anyways that's it for that I

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.480
