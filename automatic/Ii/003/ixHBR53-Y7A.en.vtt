in-depth view at kind of my opinion and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.920 
in-depth view at kind of my opinion and
maybe<00:01:23.040> how<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.280> should<00:01:23.580> look<00:01:23.759> at<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.060> too<00:01:24.299> ok

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
maybe how you should look at this too ok

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.080 
maybe how you should look at this too ok
so<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.259> flight<00:01:25.979> school<00:01:26.189> update<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.909> know

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
so the flight school update we know

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460 
so the flight school update we know
everything<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.600> came<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> said

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
everything that came with it like I said

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.929 
everything that came with it like I said
it<00:01:28.560> was<00:01:28.650> some<00:01:28.770> new<00:01:28.890> planes<00:01:29.159> some<00:01:29.490> new<00:01:29.610> clothing

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
it was some new planes some new clothing

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.810 
it was some new planes some new clothing
new<00:01:30.299> parachutes<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.439> few<00:01:31.920> new<00:01:32.040> missions<00:01:32.490> and

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
new parachutes a few new missions and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.580 
new parachutes a few new missions and
you<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.210> flying<00:01:33.689> challenges<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.409> things

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
you know flying challenges and things

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249 
you know flying challenges and things
like<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:35.189> there's<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:36.240> key<00:01:36.689> component

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
like that but there's one key component

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
like that but there's one key component
to<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.740> for<00:01:37.920> me<00:01:38.070> kind<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> ruined<00:01:39.119> this

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
to this that for me kind of ruined this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.109 
to this that for me kind of ruined this
DLC<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> common<00:01:41.220> economic<00:01:41.400> principle

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
DLC and it's a common economic principle

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.870 
DLC and it's a common economic principle
and<00:01:42.590> whether<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> realize<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and whether you realize it or not you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850 
and whether you realize it or not you
actually<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.200> principle<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.740> your

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
actually use this this principle in your

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.130 
actually use this this principle in your
mind<00:01:47.040> every<00:01:47.520> single<00:01:47.820> day<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.049> is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
mind every single day and so what is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
mind every single day and so what is
that<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.009> called<00:01:50.340> cost<00:01:50.820> versus

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that well it is called cost versus

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.149 
that well it is called cost versus
benefit<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.259> said<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.799> do<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
benefit now like I said you all do it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.770 
benefit now like I said you all do it
regardless<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.820> whether<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.180> realize<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.600> or

regardless of whether you realize it or

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.749

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
not every time you go to buy something

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.249 
not every time you go to buy something
every<00:01:56.880> time<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.180> want<00:01:57.479> something<00:01:57.899> in<00:01:58.049> your

every time you want something in your
head<00:01:58.520> subconsciously<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.640> maybe<00:02:00.149> also

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
head subconsciously or maybe also

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.480 
head subconsciously or maybe also
consciously<00:02:00.869> sometimes<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.829> do<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> cost

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
consciously sometimes you do a cost

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.730 
consciously sometimes you do a cost
versus<00:02:02.969> benefit<00:02:03.329> analysis<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
versus benefit analysis now what is this

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
versus benefit analysis now what is this
it's<00:02:05.189> very<00:02:05.310> simple<00:02:05.610> it's<00:02:05.790> exactly<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it's very simple it's exactly what it

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.630 
it's very simple it's exactly what it
sounds<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.530> when<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.890> analyze<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
sounds like it is when you analyze the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.460 
sounds like it is when you analyze the
cost<00:02:08.910> versus<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> benefit<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.080> something

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.000 
by then maybe could go on to a new card
let's<00:02:48.630> say<00:02:48.810> sixteen<00:02:49.290> thousand<00:02:49.710> dollars

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
let's say sixteen thousand dollars

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.950 
let's say sixteen thousand dollars
that's<00:02:50.310> kind<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.610> pricey<00:02:50.790> but<00:02:51.450> there's<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.720> big

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
that's kind of pricey but there's a big

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.540 
that's kind of pricey but there's a big
benefit<00:02:52.380> you've<00:02:52.590> got<00:02:52.800> yourself<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.190> brand<00:02:53.400> new

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
benefit you've got yourself a brand new

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.220 
benefit you've got yourself a brand new
car<00:02:53.760> you've<00:02:54.030> got<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.210> way<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.420> get<00:02:54.690> from<00:02:54.870> point<00:02:55.050> A

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
car you've got a way to get from point A

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.500 
car you've got a way to get from point A
to<00:02:55.260> point<00:02:55.470> B<00:02:55.710> very<00:02:56.250> quickly<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:57.240> bought

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
to point B very quickly you bought

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.880 
to point B very quickly you bought
yourself<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.930> chunk<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.290> metal<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.740> go

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
yourself a chunk of metal that can go

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.070 
yourself a chunk of metal that can go
over<00:02:59.040> 100<00:02:59.460> miles<00:02:59.700> an<00:02:59.940> hour<00:03:00.030> or<00:03:00.300> why<00:03:00.480> not<00:03:00.690> so

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
over 100 miles an hour or why not so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.080 
over 100 miles an hour or why not so
then<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.890> move<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.640> flight<00:03:02.850> school

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
then we move on to the flight school

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.450 
then we move on to the flight school
update<00:03:03.420> now<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.990> know<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.410> isn't<00:03:04.620> real<00:03:05.130> money

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
update now I know this isn't real money

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.100 
update now I know this isn't real money
but<00:03:05.700> it's<00:03:05.850> grand<00:03:06.090> theft<00:03:06.210> out<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.480> money<00:03:06.630> but

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
but it's grand theft out of money but

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.080 
but it's grand theft out of money but
let's<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> quick<00:03:07.770> cost<00:03:08.280> versus<00:03:08.790> benefit

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
let's do a quick cost versus benefit

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.240 
let's do a quick cost versus benefit

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.630 
Theft Auto 5 now I'm not going to pick
one<00:03:13.470> of<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> planes<00:03:13.770> in<00:03:13.950> particular<00:03:14.460> because

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
one of the planes in particular because

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.430 
one of the planes in particular because
as<00:03:15.300> far<00:03:15.360> as<00:03:15.570> I'm<00:03:15.780> concerned<00:03:15.810> they're<00:03:16.320> all

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
as far as I'm concerned they're all

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.650 
as far as I'm concerned they're all
pretty<00:03:16.680> much<00:03:16.800> kind<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.460> same<00:03:17.700> plane<00:03:18.240> being

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
pretty much kind of the same plane being

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.300 
pretty much kind of the same plane being
that<00:03:18.840> none<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.050> them<00:03:19.200> had<00:03:19.440> anything<00:03:19.770> different

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
that none of them had anything different

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.470 
that none of them had anything different
from<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.550> other<00:03:20.700> none<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.030> them<00:03:21.150> had<00:03:21.330> any

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
from the other none of them had any

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.660 
from the other none of them had any
weapons<00:03:21.960> or<00:03:22.110> anything<00:03:22.170> they<00:03:22.950> all<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.400> fly

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
weapons or anything they all just fly

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.180 
weapons or anything they all just fly
and<00:03:23.700> that's<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.210> they<00:03:24.330> do<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.920> let's<00:03:25.920> say<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
and that's all they do so let's say the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.980 
and that's all they do so let's say the
average<00:03:26.310> cost<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.820> these<00:03:26.970> planes<00:03:27.240> was<00:03:27.450> 1.5

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
average cost of these planes was 1.5

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.200 
average cost of these planes was 1.5
million<00:03:28.380> dollars<00:03:28.680> that's<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.280> cost<00:03:29.430> 1.5

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
million dollars that's the cost 1.5

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.570 
million dollars that's the cost 1.5
million<00:03:30.510> dollars<00:03:30.750> what<00:03:31.350> is<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.620> benefit<00:03:31.980> well

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
million dollars what is the benefit well

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.280 
million dollars what is the benefit well
obviously<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.180> benefit<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.540> receiving<00:03:34.200> that

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
obviously the benefit is receiving that

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.020 
obviously the benefit is receiving that
plane<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.830> being<00:03:35.130> able<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:35.430> get<00:03:35.550> from<00:03:35.700> point<00:03:35.910> A

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
plane and being able to get from point A

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.270 
plane and being able to get from point A
to<00:03:36.060> point<00:03:36.180> B<00:03:36.420> very<00:03:36.870> quickly<00:03:37.200> however<00:03:37.830> here's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
to point B very quickly however here's

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.130 
to point B very quickly however here's
the<00:03:38.490> problem<00:03:38.760> i<00:03:39.000> have<00:03:39.150> with<00:03:39.180> all<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.630> we

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
the problem i have with all that we

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.930 
the problem i have with all that we
already<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> game<00:03:41.580> for<00:03:41.850> free

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
already have that in the game for free

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.280 
already have that in the game for free
and<00:03:42.270> that<00:03:42.450> was<00:03:42.540> called<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> fighter<00:03:42.990> jet

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
and that was called the fighter jet

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.320 
and that was called the fighter jet
found<00:03:43.710> in<00:03:43.950> fort<00:03:44.160> zancudo<00:03:44.280> for<00:03:44.910> free<00:03:45.060> it's

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
found in fort zancudo for free it's

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.880 
found in fort zancudo for free it's
really<00:03:45.690> not<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:45.900> hard<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.320> steal<00:03:46.500> one<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.800> you

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
really not that hard to steal one if you

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.530 
really not that hard to steal one if you
want<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.100> get<00:03:47.190> fighter<00:03:47.370> jet<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:48.090> go<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.480> you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
want to get fighter jet you go and you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.660 
want to get fighter jet you go and you
steal<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.290> you<00:03:49.770> know<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.220> would<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.340> one

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
steal one so you know it would be one

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.060 
steal one so you know it would be one
thing<00:03:50.910> like<00:03:51.090> I<00:03:51.120> said<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.840> know<00:03:52.740> one<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:52.980> the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
thing like I said if you know one of the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.740 
thing like I said if you know one of the
planes<00:03:53.310> had<00:03:53.670> some<00:03:54.000> new<00:03:54.120> rockets<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.600> we've

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
planes had some new rockets that we've

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.600 
planes had some new rockets that we've
never<00:03:54.870> had<00:03:55.020> before<00:03:55.170> or<00:03:55.710> some<00:03:56.070> new<00:03:56.250> some<00:03:56.580> new

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
never had before or some new some new

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.130 
never had before or some new some new
weapon<00:03:57.030> attachments<00:03:57.240> something<00:03:57.810> like<00:03:57.960> that

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
weapon attachments something like that

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.440 
weapon attachments something like that
but<00:03:58.620> they<00:03:58.710> added<00:03:59.010> three<00:03:59.340> new<00:03:59.370> planes<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.090> all

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
but they added three new planes that all

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.420 
but they added three new planes that all
they<00:04:00.690> do<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.870> they<00:04:01.290> they<00:04:01.650> fly<00:04:01.950> at<00:04:02.100> different

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
they do is they they fly at different

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.980 
they do is they they fly at different
speeds<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.000> they<00:04:03.090> hold<00:04:03.240> different<00:04:03.660> amounts

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
speeds and they hold different amounts

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.780 
speeds and they hold different amounts
of people<00:04:04.350> and<00:04:04.560> that's<00:04:04.920> really<00:04:05.160> all<00:04:05.280> there<00:04:05.460> is

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
of people and that's really all there is

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.240 
of people and that's really all there is
to<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.420> the<00:04:06.570> benefit<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.050> really<00:04:07.830> not<00:04:08.220> very

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
to it so the benefit is really not very

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.280 
to it so the benefit is really not very
good<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.060> lot<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.570> money<00:04:09.600> in<00:04:09.930> terms<00:04:10.080> of

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
good it's a lot of money in terms of

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.840 
good it's a lot of money in terms of
Grand<00:04:10.500> Theft<00:04:10.620> Auto<00:04:10.740> money<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> ton<00:04:11.820> of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
Grand Theft Auto money that is a ton of

about<00:04:22.710> half<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.130> cost<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.880> benefit<00:04:24.270> as<00:04:24.419> far

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
about half the cost the benefit as far

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.540 
about half the cost the benefit as far
as<00:04:24.750> I'm<00:04:24.870> concerned<00:04:24.900> once<00:04:25.410> again<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.950> pretty

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
as I'm concerned once again is pretty

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.379

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
nothing else like it in Grand Theft out

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.390 
nothing else like it in Grand Theft out
of<00:04:30.150> 5<00:04:30.300> lots<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.139> hours<00:04:31.379> of<00:04:31.499> fun<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.830> really<00:04:32.189> enjoy

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
of 5 lots of hours of fun I really enjoy

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.640 
of 5 lots of hours of fun I really enjoy
however<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.270> is<00:04:33.389> just<00:04:33.629> not<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:34.110> case<00:04:34.289> with

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
however that is just not the case with

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.980 
however that is just not the case with
the<00:04:34.830> plane<00:04:35.069> so<00:04:35.520> having<00:04:36.120> said<00:04:36.150> all<00:04:36.360> of<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.599> I

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
the plane so having said all of that I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.890 
the plane so having said all of that I
do<00:04:37.259> not<00:04:37.560> think<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:38.479> Rockstar<00:04:39.479> really<00:04:39.719> had

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
do not think that Rockstar really had

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.480 
do not think that Rockstar really had
their<00:04:40.080> heads<00:04:40.229> on<00:04:40.379> straight<00:04:40.590> there<00:04:40.889> in<00:04:41.129> making

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
their heads on straight there in making

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.219 
their heads on straight there in making
that<00:04:41.520> decision<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.360> I<00:04:42.509> feel<00:04:42.840> like<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.139> was

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
that decision I just I feel like it was

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.200 
that decision I just I feel like it was
a<00:04:43.289> poor<00:04:43.590> decision<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.189> it<00:04:44.490> was<00:04:44.520> not<00:04:44.849> really

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
a poor decision and it was not really

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.239 
a poor decision and it was not really
executed<00:04:45.810> well<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.379> so<00:04:46.620> another<00:04:46.830> thing<00:04:46.919> that

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:47.249 
executed well and so another thing that

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:48.589 
executed well and so another thing that
I<00:04:47.279> thought<00:04:47.460> was<00:04:47.610> interesting<00:04:47.789> is<00:04:48.300> that<00:04:48.330> they

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
I thought was interesting is that they

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:50.330 
I thought was interesting is that they
actually<00:04:48.629> made<00:04:49.110> a<00:04:49.139> trailer<00:04:49.740> for<00:04:49.979> this<00:04:50.159> update

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
actually made a trailer for this update

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.830 
actually made a trailer for this update
this<00:04:50.699> is<00:04:50.849> the<00:04:50.939> first<00:04:51.120> trailer<00:04:51.389> that<00:04:51.689> they've

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
this is the first trailer that they've

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.170 
this is the first trailer that they've
released<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.379> quite<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> while<00:04:52.740> I<00:04:53.279> think<00:04:54.029> it's

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
released in quite a while I think it's

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.640 
released in quite a while I think it's
also<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.569> first<00:04:54.599> trailer<00:04:55.080> they've<00:04:55.439> ever

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
also the first trailer they've ever

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.559 
also the first trailer they've ever
released<00:04:56.009> for<00:04:56.219> a<00:04:56.249> DLC<00:04:56.819> update<00:04:56.849> you<00:04:57.330> know<00:04:57.419> they

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
released for a DLC update you know they

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.179 
released for a DLC update you know they
didn't<00:04:57.810> do<00:04:57.870> it<00:04:57.900> for<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:58.439> business<00:04:58.650> update<00:04:59.159> I

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
didn't do it for the business update I

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.260 
didn't do it for the business update I
don't<00:04:59.460> think<00:04:59.639> they<00:04:59.759> didn't<00:04:59.939> do<00:05:00.000> for<00:05:00.029> the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
don't think they didn't do for the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.760 
don't think they didn't do for the
hipster<00:05:00.569> update<00:05:00.840> or<00:05:00.960> anything<00:05:01.229> like<00:05:01.259> that<00:05:01.409> and

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
hipster update or anything like that and

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.379 
hipster update or anything like that and
so<00:05:02.219> I<00:05:02.250> thought<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.580> know<00:05:02.729> this<00:05:03.029> was<00:05:03.210> going<00:05:03.330> to

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
so I thought you know this was going to

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:04.850 
so I thought you know this was going to
be<00:05:03.449> really<00:05:03.840> good<00:05:03.870> I<00:05:04.139> thought<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:04.710> there

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
be really good I thought that there

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.950 
be really good I thought that there
would<00:05:04.949> be<00:05:05.009> at<00:05:05.250> least<00:05:05.279> the<00:05:05.580> Hydra<00:05:06.120> I<00:05:06.270> would<00:05:06.719> have

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
would be at least the Hydra I would have

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.290 
would be at least the Hydra I would have
bought<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.349> Hydra<00:05:07.800> however<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.759> dlc<00:05:09.120> came

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
bought the Hydra however the dlc came

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
buying any planes the thing that ruined

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.170 
buying any planes the thing that ruined
it<00:05:57.870> for<00:05:58.020> me<00:05:58.050> is<00:05:58.319> the<00:05:58.349> price<00:05:58.979> if<00:05:59.310> these<00:05:59.849> planes

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
it for me is the price if these planes

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.939 
it for me is the price if these planes
would<00:06:00.449> have<00:06:00.539> been<00:06:00.659> five<00:06:01.110> hundred<00:06:01.589> thousand

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
would have been five hundred thousand

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.499 
would have been five hundred thousand
dollars<00:06:01.979> maybe<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:02.669> most<00:06:02.789> expensive<00:06:03.089> one<00:06:03.330> was

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
dollars maybe the most expensive one was

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.510 
dollars maybe the most expensive one was
a<00:06:03.539> million<00:06:03.990> the<00:06:04.439> DLC<00:06:04.830> in<00:06:04.889> my<00:06:05.009> opinion<00:06:05.219> would

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
a million the DLC in my opinion would

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.760 
a million the DLC in my opinion would
have<00:06:05.639> been<00:06:05.729> a<00:06:05.759> lot<00:06:05.909> better<00:06:05.969> and<00:06:06.419> I<00:06:06.899> would<00:06:07.560> rate

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
have been a lot better and I would rate

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.790 
have been a lot better and I would rate
it<00:06:07.800> a<00:06:07.979> lot<00:06:08.189> higher<00:06:08.399> but<00:06:09.229> obviously<00:06:10.229> rockstar

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
it a lot higher but obviously rockstar

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.200 
it a lot higher but obviously rockstar
wants<00:06:10.949> to<00:06:11.129> make<00:06:11.250> their<00:06:11.399> money<00:06:11.580> and<00:06:11.909> five

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
wants to make their money and five

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.909 
wants to make their money and five
hundred<00:06:12.509> thousand<00:06:12.779> dollars<00:06:12.839> is<00:06:13.229> a<00:06:13.289> little<00:06:13.770> bit

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
hundred thousand dollars is a little bit

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.469 
hundred thousand dollars is a little bit
cheap<00:06:14.250> for<00:06:14.460> a<00:06:14.490> plane<00:06:14.759> I<00:06:14.789> understand<00:06:15.360> they

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
cheap for a plane I understand they

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.089 
cheap for a plane I understand they
probably<00:06:15.750> want<00:06:16.020> to<00:06:16.110> maintain<00:06:16.259> some<00:06:16.740> amount<00:06:16.979> of

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
probably want to maintain some amount of

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.730 
probably want to maintain some amount of
realism<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.909> this<00:06:18.060> as<00:06:18.300> well<00:06:18.330> so<00:06:18.930> i<00:06:19.169> don't<00:06:19.649> know

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.709 
realism to this as well so i don't know
