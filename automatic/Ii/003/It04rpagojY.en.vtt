00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 as true we are in the middle of a tour 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.940
 what are we going to do all summer long? 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 for several cities chile so 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 happy happy of this reunion with 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.030
 the Chilean public several moments very 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.450
 special because he took the stage 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.640
 three former members rose louis from his 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.039
 do cristian also goes up andres like 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.189
 how they lived this and how a little the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.010
 emotion of being together again good 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.949
 It was very special after a couple of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.990
 months will meet again the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.390
 group in which we had a quantity 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.610
 of years important is to feel the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 affection of the group and of the people also 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 same as before and the same ones the same 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.600
 same faith the same energy was a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.579
 sensation did the people have and I think that 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.340
 he has to give his verdict but we 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.190
 we felt super well also climbed 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.079
 Andrew André tell me what it means 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 this to think about the future is also 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.610
 a reunion the same people are 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.730
 ask this this gesture of doing this 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.750
 theme that is yours 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.300
 So, see, I think we see here 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.460
 several of us who are parents and 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.890
 responsible for this since it has 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.140
 talent and responsible that has so many 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.630
 followers and that has been so faithful to the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.650
 struggles and aspirations and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.660
 dreams of this Chilean people and I think that 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:27.200
 that responsibility makes one never 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.300
 be away one is always in the iiap to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.420
 Although I have already carried since 97 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.360
 out of it but I think that one always 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.580
 continue for this because one is 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.800
 here for a love that has nothing to do 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.289
 only with the music and with the fact 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.720
 that we are many brothers here but that 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.340
 it has to do with the love of our 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.750
 dreams to our wishes our 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.580
 aspirations we can see them again 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.619
 together several times doing this 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.880
 we can get together many times 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.659
 in fact we are working on a new 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.999
 day 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.679
 and maybe tomorrow we will be 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.380
 new playing on a stage because no 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.899
 You never ages and while both 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.810
 feet stand and the voice stays 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.739
 we will be the nine are here more others 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.900
 four that are in reserve yet 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.970
 well extra with many members roberto 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.069
 I know they already have three concerts 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.959
 planned 1 on January 29 in the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.549
 teletón theater in santiago 1 the first 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.310
 February at the Municipal Theater of 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.349
 vineyard and also on February 5 in the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.879
 municipal theater of Valparaíso but 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.769
 they have plans to do more concert 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.120
 because even when they love each other and what is 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.480
 what is the idea that cities want 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.730
 visit us we are here until late 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.099
 February the idea is that there are good 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.700
 several things that are still 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.440
 finishing managing 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.569
 We really want to be in 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.959
 conception in Antofagasta in the north 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.540
 especially the one you already know has a 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.910
 part of the important heart there in the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.920
 atacama desert then there are many 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.080
 things that are still being 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.060
 they are finishing solving we hope 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.980
 that we can travel much of Chile 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.500
 We look forward to seeing all of our 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.340
 good people this today allowed us already 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.140
 give them a preview of what we are like 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.569
 I hope there are many many 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.970
 concerts and a lot of reunions with 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.640
 many friends and people we want 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.980
 I imagine being those in Mexico 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.900
 and come on tour chile or it's not like 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.630
 backwards of how it was how it feels now 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.000
 follow visiting artists only the 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.920
 Chileans we could be on tour in 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.890
 chile our heart is always in 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.080
 chiles we can already be live almost 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.480
 ten years in paris between paris and mexico 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.430
 when we were exiled in our 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.560
 heart always remained in silicon it 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.330
 would open we're in Mexico for one thing 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.450
 circumstantial should not forget that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.700
 Chile does not have enough spaces 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.470
 so that the artists so that the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.920
 musicians who are in this art 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.160
 popular we can really work in 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.380
 that and live let's say our of 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.280
 our work not only what 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.230
 we are doing 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.709
 the public is waving because they look 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.720
 here still what we are doing more 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.310
 it is open a workspace and 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.560
 that space that we are opening 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.459
 It will also serve for many others 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.459
 Chileans because
