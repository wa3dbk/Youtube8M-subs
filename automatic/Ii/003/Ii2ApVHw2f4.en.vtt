 his gondola is a very lively city 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.019
 Despite the superficial car, everything has its order 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.689
 as in many cities of the East 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.810
 the branches are arranged street by street 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.810
 we are so started the driven to scrap 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.830
 There are only aquariums shops all over the street 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.830
 alternately a shock for ornamental fish and one for aquariums 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.750
 Facilities and aquariums 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.899
 I already gave it 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.180
 the Far Eastern taste is in our view the occasional 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.880
 getting used to 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.230
 the tenth world of water 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.140
 only aquariums are presented in this shop 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.170
 designed very differently 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.000
 but all without fish stocking, some without water 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.050

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 dpa 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.430
 next to seven points taste 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.620
 but you can quickly find aquariums 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.770
 which meet European tastes 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.510
 all bets are relatively large 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.050
 in fact, I never experienced this here 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.320
 more than the aquarium facilities I am interested in the fish he is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.980
 Tobe offered 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.960
 Tourists do not normally buy here 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.170
 The sellers do not even try to get into conversation with me 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.170
 So I can look around here undisturbed 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.689
 First of all, you can see fish here 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:14.939
 as you know it from home 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.640
 many of these animals 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.899
 are native to Southeast Asia 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.069
 for example 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.010
 These beautiful protect fish 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.010
 Fox's photos are finally happening 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.509
 this beautiful veil cock breeding 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:37.189
 if one can be divided about such breeds 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.569
 Striking here is the trend for big fish 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 if possible with red or yellowish color 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.699
 for the locals 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.029
 especially for the Chinese 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.679
 I wanted these fish luck 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.329
 more precisely 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.709
 or gold 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.709
 These lucky charms can also be quite costly 

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:08.149
 this sclerosis bird of paradise musk costs the equivalent of 250 euros 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.630
 and the golden one you 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.749
 much more 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.869
 in Germany it is forbidden to introduce these bones here 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:18.439
 she bred 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.569
 also this gift Date 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.010
 or Arora close 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.349
 from Amazonia 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.669
 Also they are only suitable for very large aquariums this bat 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:29.440
 loaches 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.979
 Mitsubishi Primus Asiatic big 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.589
 they are also referred to as a carp symbol 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:38.589
 they can clear up to 60 inches long 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:44.209
 No we have to do it for there are no other fish species 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.999
 unimaginable in Europe 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.999
 but here as Fischer also painted 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.939
 this has the yellow left form of the food Corre Amis Ellrich 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.840
 but also colorful perch remain from this Grafite did not let move 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.919
 next door again interesting fish 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.120
 also only for large aquariums 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.759
 they are broken bones 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.400
 possible oscilloscopes lay 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.569
 The fish are originally from North America 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.569
 So they are apparently bred on the ponds here 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.400
 it gives up 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.699
 no wonder 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.699
 was in a gold-colored 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.460
 Corresponding is picture for these Altenkirchen rivers 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.250
 and of course 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.580
 for this route guidance 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.580
 Incidentally, the only cancers 4 5 million 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.069
 we are going to visit another war 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.520
 Here you can also see the passenger data 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.710
 not with 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.879
 which you can catch and talk yourself out of 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.289
 Dollars before 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.430
 actually easy to understand 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.270
 besides the costs 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.789
 a taste aberration 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.789
 the man suffers from having good German 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.919
 Of course, there is also the ship's kiss here 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.389
 in all colors 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.389
 but preferred 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.870
 small can for philistines 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.770
 Lead us in the last of the four shops next to Schleier Weather there is 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.389
 here also the real fighters 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.389
 but only humans 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.960
 the assortment does not differ significantly from that 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.569
 what we have already seen 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.819
 but here is something more interesting 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.029
 African closed 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.539
 in the refrigerated counter 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.580
 there are water fishing since sunday 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.960
 at least reach lengths of 15 to 25 centimeters 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.479
 in the long run 17 cents what he did not keep 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.439
 in the back of the shop 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.159
 we see beautiful discus offered in pairs 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:30.829
 yes these are really gorgeous Eclipse
