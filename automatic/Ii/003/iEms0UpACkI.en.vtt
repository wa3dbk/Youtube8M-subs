00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:12.990
 I do a review of the motorcycle as the ignition 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.910
 already put the electronic truth of the wire 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.670
 not a silicone collector I will take off 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.000
 put two carba 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.000
 here here 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:45.719
 what about carbon and collectors here are hulls 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:49.379
 even cleaner collector as you can see I'm new 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.769
 In this case, but already bogged down with his head 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.019
 the engine is arranged how everything works I know 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.229
 that this is all that should be smooth 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.510
 as you can see just to practice 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.689
 was interested in how to work on one 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:14.299
 consumption by the way yes decreased I do not know well 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:38.149
 liters all ate fine sit comfortably all 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:38.149
 cool such a crocodile 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.579
 leg 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:48.390
 leg he himself did with a stud 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:51.060
 small tractor painted spirit 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.490
 the battery was bought last year 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.320
 new way you need to add oil another liter 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.259
 in general, what needs to be done here 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:10.470
 add a liter of oil change tap 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:12.660
 gasoline and a and put the filter shorter 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.260
 I do not know whether nulevik put on 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.140
 each price each carb filtering 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 or this one here is a healthy one 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.560
 center 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:35.620
 tires new markers are also new but by the way 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.349
 yes brakes brake weak need 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.069
 something to do tighten probably either 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.670
 change pads do not think tighten and 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.669
 all the headlights will work fine 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.870
 secured a temporary version but tapes already 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:56.250
 looks good in general 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.250
 vidos it cool
