00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.090 
already had like one loaded up I want to
actually<00:05:10.480> have<00:05:10.810> one<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.260> read<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.530> I<00:05:11.770> did<00:05:11.980> this

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
actually have one I read it I did this

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.650 
actually have one I read it I did this
earlier<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:12.610> that's<00:05:12.790> why<00:05:12.940> it's<00:05:12.970> already<00:05:13.540> in

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
earlier so that's why it's already in

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.480 
earlier so that's why it's already in
the<00:05:13.810> shipping<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.260> already<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.710> car<00:05:14.920> so

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
the shipping it already in the car so

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.000 
the shipping it already in the car so
there<00:05:15.610> we<00:05:15.700> go<00:05:16.230> interestingly<00:05:17.230> they're<00:05:17.740> really

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.710 
there we go interestingly they're really
hammering<00:05:18.430> home<00:05:18.670> that<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.000> can<00:05:19.150> actually<00:05:19.330> buy

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
character slot so there you go eight
