that<00:01:01.420> was<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.839> ones<00:01:02.019> that<00:01:02.170> did<00:01:02.350> three

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
that was the ones that did three

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.300 
that was the ones that did three
batteries<00:01:03.160> each<00:01:03.339> I<00:01:03.699> had<00:01:04.210> two<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.449> them

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.310 
batteries each I had two of them

purchased<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.400> Canadian<00:01:06.820> Tire<00:01:07.060> if<00:01:07.450> anybody's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
purchased the Canadian Tire if anybody's

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.290 
purchased the Canadian Tire if anybody's
thinking<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.530> using<00:01:08.890> these<00:01:09.010> for<00:01:09.400> any<00:01:09.670> leaks<00:01:09.970> I

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
thinking of using these for any leaks I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.530 
thinking of using these for any leaks I
would<00:01:10.900> highly<00:01:11.350> recommend<00:01:11.380> not<00:01:11.980> doing<00:01:12.400> it<00:01:12.550> and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
would highly recommend not doing it and

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.730 
would highly recommend not doing it and
two<00:01:13.990> things<00:01:14.230> happen<00:01:14.619> first<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.159> all<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
two things happen first of all the the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.800 
two things happen first of all the the
charges<00:01:18.189> themselves<00:01:18.670> are<00:01:18.790> 15<00:01:19.150> amp<00:01:19.360> charger

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
charges themselves are 15 amp charger

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.039 
charges themselves are 15 amp charger
but<00:01:20.079> they<00:01:20.380> unfortunately<00:01:21.720> cycle<00:01:22.720> through<00:01:22.930> the

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
but they unfortunately cycle through the

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.410 
but they unfortunately cycle through the
batteries<00:01:23.409> one<00:01:23.590> at<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.799> time<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:25.180> in<00:01:25.299> other

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
batteries one at a time so in other

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.109 
batteries one at a time so in other
words<00:01:25.659> if<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.020> battery<00:01:26.409> one<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:27.700> charger

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
words if this is battery one the charger

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.480 
words if this is battery one the charger
would<00:01:28.240> charge<00:01:28.600> this<00:01:28.840> one<00:01:29.049> for<00:01:29.950> five<00:01:30.130> minutes

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
would charge this one for five minutes

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.340 
would charge this one for five minutes
at<00:01:30.579> 15<00:01:30.970> amps<00:01:31.329> then<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.600> would<00:01:31.720> move<00:01:31.840> on<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.200> this

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
at 15 amps then it would move on to this

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.230 
at 15 amps then it would move on to this
one<00:01:32.530> at<00:01:32.680> 15<00:01:33.100> amps<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.610> would<00:01:33.759> move<00:01:33.880> on<00:01:34.060> to

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
one at 15 amps that would move on to

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.819 
one at 15 amps that would move on to
this<00:01:34.390> one<00:01:34.540> at<00:01:34.689> 15<00:01:35.049> amps<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.470> then<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.680> would

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
this one at 15 amps and then it would

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.609 
this one at 15 amps and then it would
start<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.250> process<00:01:36.700> over<00:01:36.850> again<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.619> then

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
start the process over again and then

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.530 
start the process over again and then
the<00:01:39.310> second<00:01:39.640> charge<00:01:39.820> of<00:01:40.000> course<00:01:40.180> would<00:01:40.329> do<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
the second charge of course would do the

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.999 
the second charge of course would do the
same<00:01:40.719> thing<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.170> other<00:01:41.350> three<00:01:41.530> batteries<00:01:41.860> but

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
same thing the other three batteries but

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.550 
same thing the other three batteries but
the<00:01:42.130> problem<00:01:42.490> I<00:01:42.610> found<00:01:42.909> is<00:01:43.329> that<00:01:43.840> if<00:01:44.469> you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
the problem I found is that if you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.550 
the problem I found is that if you
hooked<00:01:44.740> up<00:01:44.890> both<00:01:45.070> chargers<00:01:46.049> without<00:01:47.049> breaking

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
hooked up both chargers without breaking

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.670 
hooked up both chargers without breaking
the<00:01:47.649> loop<00:01:47.860> somewhere<00:01:48.340> on<00:01:49.329> the<00:01:49.689> system<00:01:50.140> then

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
the loop somewhere on the system then

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.910 
the loop somewhere on the system then
one<00:01:50.950> charger<00:01:51.369> would<00:01:51.549> see<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.880> other<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
one charger would see the other and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.130 
one charger would see the other and
obviously<00:01:53.920> would<00:01:54.250> cause<00:01:54.460> problem<00:01:54.969> so<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.509> pop

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
obviously would cause problem so I pop

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.990 
obviously would cause problem so I pop
one<00:01:56.170> charger<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:56.950> took<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.280> back<00:01:57.460> they<00:01:57.640> replaced

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
one charger I took it back they replaced

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.520 
one charger I took it back they replaced
it<00:01:58.119> no<00:01:58.240> problem<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.719> entire<00:01:59.020> is<00:01:59.170> good<00:01:59.350> for

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
it no problem the entire is good for

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.240 
it no problem the entire is good for
that<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:01.149> when<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.170> got<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.500> next<00:02:02.740> ones<00:02:03.009> that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
that but when I got the next ones that

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.590 
that but when I got the next ones that
the<00:02:03.399> charger<00:02:03.789> that<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:03.969> had<00:02:04.119> that<00:02:04.270> was<00:02:04.390> still

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
the charger that I had that was still

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.560 
the charger that I had that was still
working<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:06.130> popped<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:07.090> one<00:02:07.240> new<00:02:07.359> one<00:02:07.479> I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
working it popped and the one new one I

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.090 
working it popped and the one new one I
got<00:02:07.750> was<00:02:07.930> fine<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.350> I'm<00:02:08.500> not<00:02:08.649> sure<00:02:08.710> whether<00:02:08.979> it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
got was fine so I'm not sure whether it

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.610 
got was fine so I'm not sure whether it
was<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.250> defect<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.820> chargers<00:02:10.360> or<00:02:10.600> what<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
was a defect in the chargers or what the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.220 
was a defect in the chargers or what the
application<00:02:12.220> was<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.580> just<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.420> word<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:13.990> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
application was but just a word to the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
application was but just a word to the
wise<00:02:14.380> there<00:02:15.130> were<00:02:15.220> pretty<00:02:15.430> good<00:02:15.610> chargers

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
wise there were pretty good chargers

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.460 
wise there were pretty good chargers
that<00:02:16.330> they<00:02:16.510> were<00:02:16.570> worth<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.840> money<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.350> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
that they were worth the money but the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.890 
that they were worth the money but the
problem<00:02:17.800> was<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.160> they<00:02:18.430> were<00:02:18.519> too<00:02:18.700> slow<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.180> B

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
problem was a they were too slow and B

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.080 
problem was a they were too slow and B
they<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.349> don't<00:02:20.920> cooperate<00:02:21.220> together<00:02:21.700> now

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
they just don't cooperate together now

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.470 
they just don't cooperate together now
these<00:02:22.239> two<00:02:22.510> guys

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
these two guys

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.589 
these two guys
I<00:02:23.510> have<00:02:24.080> two<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.380> them<00:02:24.470> here<00:02:24.680> one<00:02:25.220> here<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.700> gonna

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
I have two of them here one here I gonna

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.910 
I have two of them here one here I gonna
just<00:02:26.870> thrown<00:02:27.080> them<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.349> you<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.560> test<00:02:27.770> them

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
just thrown them in you to test them

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.080 
just thrown them in you to test them
because<00:02:28.099> I<00:02:28.160> will<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.430> know<00:02:28.459> again<00:02:28.819> I<00:02:28.849> didn't

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
because I will you know again I didn't

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.690 
because I will you know again I didn't
want<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.330> same<00:02:29.510> problems<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.050> happen<00:02:30.200> but<00:02:30.700> so

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
want the same problems to happen but so

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.160 
want the same problems to happen but so
far<00:02:31.910> these<00:02:32.090> scenes<00:02:32.330> work<00:02:32.510> really<00:02:32.690> well<00:02:32.900> these

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
far these scenes work really well these

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.839 
far these scenes work really well these
are<00:02:33.349> a<00:02:33.380> bit<00:02:33.560> different<00:02:34.040> they're<00:02:34.340> intelligent

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
are a bit different they're intelligent

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.970 
are a bit different they're intelligent
chargers<00:02:35.270> they<00:02:35.870> automatically<00:02:36.560> select<00:02:36.830> their

own battery type and the red LED and off

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.059 
own battery type and the red LED and off
you<00:02:39.860> can<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.250> there<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.630> rate<00:02:42.069> that

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
you can see it there and it's rate that

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.090 
you can see it there and it's rate that
led<00:02:43.430> right<00:02:43.580> there<00:02:44.290> is<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.470> battery<00:02:45.770> type<00:02:45.950> in

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
led right there is the battery type in

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.540 
led right there is the battery type in
this<00:02:46.220> case<00:02:46.430> red<00:02:46.730> means<00:02:47.140> flooded<00:02:48.140> lead-acid

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
this case red means flooded lead-acid

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.699 
this case red means flooded lead-acid

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
the Baha Ron's blue this is the charge

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.120 
the Baha Ron's blue this is the charge
one<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:53.930> it's<00:02:54.080> ready<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.500> legis<00:02:54.739> comes<00:02:54.950> on

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
one when it's ready this legis comes on

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.759 
one when it's ready this legis comes on
and<00:02:55.310> off<00:02:55.340> his<00:02:55.519> red<00:02:55.700> or<00:02:55.819> green<00:02:55.970> bit<00:02:56.209> anyway<00:02:57.080> and

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
and off his red or green bit anyway and

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.430 
and off his red or green bit anyway and
these<00:02:57.980> are<00:02:58.130> xx<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.580> chargers<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.239> that<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.319> to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
these are xx and chargers and that is to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.320 
these are xx and chargers and that is to
say<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.830> they<00:03:01.040> charge<00:03:01.370> all<00:03:01.730> three<00:03:01.970> batteries

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
say that they charge all three batteries

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.350 
say that they charge all three batteries
simultaneously<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.640> will<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:05.060> and

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
simultaneously so and it will just and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.150 
simultaneously so and it will just and
it<00:03:05.450> basically<00:03:05.690> monitors<00:03:06.380> each<00:03:06.500> battery<00:03:06.980> and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
it basically monitors each battery and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.580 
it basically monitors each battery and
distributes<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> current<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:09.170> those<00:03:09.350> that

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
distributes the current to those that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.740 
distributes the current to those that
require<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.819> just<00:03:11.030> did<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.209> check<00:03:11.540> with<00:03:11.720> a

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
require it and I just did a check with a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.140 
require it and I just did a check with a
voltmeter<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.500> these<00:03:12.980> are<00:03:13.160> all<00:03:13.340> now<00:03:13.580> around

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
voltmeter and these are all now around

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.630 
voltmeter and these are all now around
twelve<00:03:14.480> point<00:03:14.720> two<00:03:14.870> volts<00:03:15.069> which<00:03:16.069> is<00:03:16.100> perfect

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
twelve point two volts which is perfect

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.940 
twelve point two volts which is perfect
so<00:03:16.819> it<00:03:17.420> is<00:03:17.630> actually<00:03:17.959> charging<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.590> very<00:03:18.830> very

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
so it is actually charging it very very

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.620 
so it is actually charging it very very
close<00:03:19.250> so<00:03:19.489> individually<00:03:20.120> charging<00:03:20.510> each

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
close so individually charging each

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.020 
close so individually charging each
battery<00:03:21.019> which<00:03:21.290> prevents<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.860> from<00:03:22.030> under

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
battery which prevents you from under

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.460 
battery which prevents you from under
charging<00:03:23.450> or<00:03:23.600> overcharging<00:03:24.260> when<00:03:24.350> you're

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
charging or overcharging when you're

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.470 
charging or overcharging when you're
doing<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.739> serious<00:03:25.040> string<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:25.549> think<00:03:26.299> these<00:03:26.420> are

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
doing a serious string I think these are

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.210 
doing a serious string I think these are
going<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.780> work<00:03:26.900> out<00:03:27.080> really<00:03:27.110> well<00:03:27.590> their

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
going to work out really well their

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.390 
going to work out really well their
wealth<00:03:28.430> heat<00:03:28.850> sunken<00:03:29.239> apparently<00:03:29.690> these<00:03:29.840> are

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
wealth heat sunken apparently these are

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.099 
wealth heat sunken apparently these are
waterproof<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.850> even<00:03:32.209> salt<00:03:32.540> waterproof

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
waterproof and even salt waterproof

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.620 
waterproof and even salt waterproof
which<00:03:33.560> makes<00:03:33.769> it<00:03:33.920> perfect<00:03:34.400> for<00:03:34.630> evey

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
which makes it perfect for evey

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.800 
which makes it perfect for evey
applications<00:03:36.730> so<00:03:37.730> what<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:37.940> would<00:03:38.090> do<00:03:38.570> is

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
applications so what I would do is

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.569 
applications so what I would do is
probably<00:03:39.049> I'm<00:03:39.739> going<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> try<00:03:40.130> these<00:03:40.190> for<00:03:40.549> a

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
probably I'm going to try these for a

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.920 
probably I'm going to try these for a
while<00:03:40.760> but<00:03:41.600> you<00:03:42.410> know<00:03:42.500> what<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.739> think<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.930> am

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
while but you know what I think I am

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.250 
while but you know what I think I am
going<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.560> say<00:03:46.549> that<00:03:46.850> these<00:03:47.690> seem<00:03:47.989> to<00:03:48.019> be<00:03:48.140> the

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
going to say that these seem to be the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.120 
going to say that these seem to be the
ticket<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.920> oh<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:50.510> put<00:03:50.840> me<00:03:51.019> I<00:03:51.049> have<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.380> kilowatt

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
ticket so oh I put me I have a kilowatt

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.330 
ticket so oh I put me I have a kilowatt
meter<00:03:52.280> down<00:03:52.519> here<00:03:53.170> and<00:03:54.170> about<00:03:54.470> it<00:03:54.890> seem<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.190> be

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
meter down here and about it seem to be

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.920 
meter down here and about it seem to be
wandering<00:03:55.790> around<00:03:56.140> 632<00:03:57.140> 650<00:03:58.100> watts<00:03:58.720> I'm<00:03:59.720> just

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
wandering around 632 650 watts I'm just

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.080 
wandering around 632 650 watts I'm just
changing<00:04:00.109> amps<00:04:00.620> it's<00:04:01.489> about<00:04:01.609> seven<00:04:01.940> and<00:04:02.000> a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
changing amps it's about seven and a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.860 
changing amps it's about seven and a
half<00:04:02.120> ounce<00:04:02.510> which<00:04:02.780> is<00:04:02.810> correct<00:04:03.310> and

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
half ounce which is correct and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.390 
half ounce which is correct and
apparently<00:04:05.870> these<00:04:06.170> are<00:04:06.350> fast<00:04:06.650> chargers<00:04:07.190> so

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
apparently these are fast chargers so

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.050 
apparently these are fast chargers so
we'll<00:04:07.640> see<00:04:07.819> how<00:04:07.940> fast<00:04:09.190> go<00:04:10.190> back<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.519> watts<00:04:10.730> so

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
we'll see how fast go back to watts so

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.880 
we'll see how fast go back to watts so
I'm<00:04:11.750> going<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.900> let<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.140> go<00:04:12.350> all<00:04:12.470> night<00:04:12.680> and

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
I'm going to let this go all night and

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.949 
I'm going to let this go all night and
it<00:04:13.670> also<00:04:13.790> has<00:04:14.000> it<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.209> of<00:04:14.390> course<00:04:14.450> kilowatt

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
it also has it this of course kilowatt

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.590 
it also has it this of course kilowatt
meter<00:04:15.079> also<00:04:15.440> has<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.590> timer<00:04:15.920> on<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.539> let<00:04:17.539> me

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
meter also has a timer on it let me

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.050 
meter also has a timer on it let me
switch<00:04:17.840> over<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.079> time<00:04:18.669> right<00:04:19.669> there<00:04:19.880> it's

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
switch over to time right there it's

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.610 
switch over to time right there it's
been<00:04:20.180> 23<00:04:20.450> minutes<00:04:21.039> and<00:04:22.039> 23<00:04:22.400> minutes<00:04:22.820> it's<00:04:22.940> used

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
been 23 minutes and 23 minutes it's used

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.300 
been 23 minutes and 23 minutes it's used
0.111<00:04:24.620> kilowatt<00:04:25.580> hours<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:27.039> we'll<00:04:28.039> just<00:04:28.190> go

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
0.111 kilowatt hours so we'll just go

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.270 
0.111 kilowatt hours so we'll just go
back<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.900> watts<00:04:29.900> again<00:04:30.229> and<00:04:30.440> then<00:04:31.190> I'm

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
back to the watts again and then I'm

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.770 
back to the watts again and then I'm
going<00:04:31.400> to<00:04:31.460> see<00:04:31.640> how<00:04:31.820> long<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.060> takes<00:04:32.210> this<00:04:32.570> will

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
going to see how long it takes this will

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.540 
going to see how long it takes this will
also<00:04:32.930> tell<00:04:33.260> me<00:04:33.409> exactly<00:04:33.530> how<00:04:33.890> much<00:04:34.010> power<00:04:34.280> are

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
also tell me exactly how much power are

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.330 
also tell me exactly how much power are
using<00:04:34.849> the<00:04:34.970> car

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
using the car

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.400 
using the car
it's<00:04:35.520> going<00:04:35.669> to<00:04:35.730> be<00:04:35.790> very<00:04:35.880> handy<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.419> try<00:04:37.290> and

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
it's going to be very handy to try and

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.350 
it's going to be very handy to try and
get<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.740> miles<00:04:38.310> per<00:04:38.550> gallon<00:04:38.910> if<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.180> want

chargers<00:04:48.560> this<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:50.190> think<00:04:50.340> these<00:04:50.610> are

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
chargers this is a I think these are

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.189 
chargers this is a I think these are
going<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:50.940> work<00:04:51.060> out<00:04:51.240> really<00:04:51.389> well<00:04:51.540> these<00:04:52.050> are

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
going to work out really well these are

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.560 
going to work out really well these are
two<00:04:52.229> hundred<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.650> thirty<00:04:52.830> dollars<00:04:52.919> each<00:04:53.570> by

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
two hundred and thirty dollars each by

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.659 
two hundred and thirty dollars each by
the<00:04:54.600> way<00:04:54.870> so<00:04:55.169> four<00:04:55.740> hundred<00:04:55.979> sixty<00:04:56.100> bucks<00:04:56.460> for

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
the way so four hundred sixty bucks for

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.070 
the way so four hundred sixty bucks for
a<00:04:56.699> pair<00:04:56.880> of<00:04:56.940> charges<00:04:57.389> isn't<00:04:57.570> too<00:04:57.840> bad<00:04:58.020> I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
a pair of charges isn't too bad I

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.710 
a pair of charges isn't too bad I
thought<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.910> now<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.120> know<00:05:00.240> they<00:05:00.389> work<00:05:00.570> I

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
thought and now that I know they work I

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.960 
thought and now that I know they work I
will<00:05:00.780> install<00:05:01.229> them<00:05:01.470> properly<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.010> and<00:05:02.729> get

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
will install them properly and and get

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.030 
will install them properly and and get
them<00:05:03.120> in<00:05:03.240> somewhere<00:05:03.720> where<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.470> can<00:05:04.650> mount<00:05:04.770> them

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
them in somewhere where I can mount them

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.370 
them in somewhere where I can mount them
and<00:05:05.220> then<00:05:06.180> just<00:05:06.389> extend<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.840> legs<00:05:07.020> out<00:05:07.139> or

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
and then just extend the legs out or

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.740 
and then just extend the legs out or
they<00:05:07.530> need<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.710> go<00:05:07.919> and<00:05:08.270> we'll<00:05:09.270> go<00:05:09.389> from<00:05:09.510> there

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750
