for<00:00:00.690> our<00:00:00.810> kids<00:00:01.050> today<00:00:01.230> we're<00:00:01.469> going<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:01.650> go

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
for our kids today we're going to go

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.490 
for our kids today we're going to go
over<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.220> lathe<00:00:02.899> what<00:00:03.899> to<00:00:04.020> look<00:00:04.140> for<00:00:04.380> when

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
over the lathe what to look for when

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.889 
over the lathe what to look for when
buying<00:00:04.560> one<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.460> how<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> use<00:00:06.509> some<00:00:06.720> of<00:00:06.750> the

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
buying one and how to use some of the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.980 
buying one and how to use some of the
basic<00:00:07.290> functions<00:00:08.150> the<00:00:09.150> lathe<00:00:09.300> has<00:00:09.510> two<00:00:09.780> ends

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
basic functions the lathe has two ends

basic functions the lathe has two ends
the<00:00:10.260> headstock<00:00:10.710> which<00:00:10.920> spins<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.910> tailstock

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
the headstock which spins the tailstock

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.300 
the headstock which spins the tailstock
which<00:00:12.630> says<00:00:13.309> stays<00:00:14.309> still<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.289> what<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.920> lathe

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
which says stays still so what the lathe

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.820 
which says stays still so what the lathe
is<00:00:17.340> usually<00:00:17.960> measured<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> between

when you're purchasing a lathe now the
English<00:00:49.110> generally<00:00:49.950> refer<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> swing<00:00:50.820> as

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
English generally refer to the swing as

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.189 
English generally refer to the swing as
the<00:00:51.960> distance<00:00:52.350> between<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.219> center<00:00:53.910> point

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and all the speeds in in between so I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.620 
and all the speeds in in between so I
can<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.590> change<00:01:58.890> these<00:01:59.159> by<00:01:59.520> adjusting<00:02:00.479> these

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
can just change these by adjusting these

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
can just change these by adjusting these
levers<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.799> course<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.670> car

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
levers of course it's not like a car

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
levers of course it's not like a car
gearbox<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> goes<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.990> smoothly<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
gearbox or it goes in smoothly I

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440 
gearbox or it goes in smoothly I
actually<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.250> sometimes<00:02:05.729> work<00:02:05.969> these<00:02:06.240> in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
actually have to sometimes work these in

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.660 
actually have to sometimes work these in
so<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.799> course<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> make<00:02:08.489> sure

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so of course you're going to make sure

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.249 
so of course you're going to make sure
that<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.000> done<00:02:09.149> while<00:02:09.420> there<00:02:09.629> while<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
that it's done while there while the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.750 
that it's done while there while the
machine<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.009> operation

machine is not in operation

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.460 
machine is not in operation
so<00:02:13.760> we've<00:02:13.940> got<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.180> currently<00:02:14.570> in<00:02:14.690> speed

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
so we've got it currently in speed

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.220 
so we've got it currently in speed
number<00:02:15.770> two<00:02:15.980> which<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.580> 250<00:02:17.510> revolutions<00:02:18.110> per

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.550 
number two which is 250 revolutions per
minute<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.480> we<00:02:20.720> can<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.020> switch<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.200> between

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
minute and we can just switch it between

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.740 
minute and we can just switch it between
those<00:02:21.800> keys<00:02:22.070> depending<00:02:22.580> on<00:02:22.670> what<00:02:22.880> work<00:02:23.540> we're

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
those keys depending on what work we're

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.500

doing one of the things is particularly
that's<00:02:26.870> probably<00:02:27.350> missing<00:02:27.680> on<00:02:27.830> is<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:30.370> gearbox

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
that's probably missing on is a gearbox

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.850

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
bag the fact that we we could learn how

bag the fact that we we could learn how
to<00:04:21.680> grind<00:04:21.979> our<00:04:22.220> own<00:04:22.250> tools<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:23.510> high<00:04:23.720> speed

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
to grind our own tools as high speed

to grind our own tools as high speed
still<00:04:24.350> means

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
still means

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.210 
still means
that<00:04:25.490> we<00:04:25.670> could<00:04:25.850> do<00:04:25.970> any<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.330> these<00:04:27.190> make<00:04:28.190> the

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
that we could do any of these make the

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.910 
that we could do any of these make the
tools<00:04:28.550> double-ended<00:04:29.330> and<00:04:29.870> also<00:04:30.290> make<00:04:30.500> custom

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
tools double-ended and also make custom

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.520 
tools double-ended and also make custom
one-off<00:04:31.340> tools<00:04:31.820> for<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> certain<00:04:32.660> job<00:04:32.900> it's

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
one-off tools for a certain job it's

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.780 
one-off tools for a certain job it's
definitely<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.040> skill<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.640> would

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
definitely a skill that I would

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.090 
definitely a skill that I would
recommend<00:04:35.090> people<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.140> learn<00:04:36.290> maybe<00:04:36.770> we<00:04:36.950> can

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
recommend people to learn maybe we can

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.970 
recommend people to learn maybe we can
cover<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:37.400> in<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.700> future<00:04:38.860> so<00:04:39.860> we've

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
cover that in the future so we've

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.580 
cover that in the future so we've
covered<00:04:40.160> most<00:04:40.400> of<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.670> basics<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.840> make<00:04:42.440> sure

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
covered most of the basics so make sure

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.930 
covered most of the basics so make sure
you<00:04:42.740> have<00:04:42.890> fun<00:04:43.070> while<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.430> are<00:04:43.490> milling<00:04:43.730> and
