00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.410
 I will try to do it already so 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.510

 very grateful guys exactly works on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 consoles new generation under the gene and while 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 he is not personally questionable well if 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.149
 there will be some information in the description 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.440
 Under the video, add text works or not 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.510
 on this or that console 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 I'll say right away that this bug is not with 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.059
 catch you need a friend to perform 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.200
 This bug we initially go to 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.840
 pause then go to the network and start 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.439
 case created by rockstar confrontation 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.189
 This we in opposition are looking for task under 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.920
 the name of the corrupt cop we run it 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 then in the settings we do everything 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.299
 as i'm on the video still guys to perform 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 This bug is very important when you 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.189
 remove the settings for this task block 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
 weapons worth starting there found so 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.119
 leave it if you put your something 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.270
 you will not get a damn and you 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.759
 will have already exactly puts the starting 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 Weapon either starter found here already 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 no difference 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.880
 still guys you have to change the costumes 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.850
 put the name of the classic so that later 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.979
 you could hope this costume 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.860
 cop and that is sure to put 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.590
 starting weapon fleas weapons 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.230
 then we put the costumes classic and 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.120
 then we start why it costs me 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.530
 it is the balance of the teams that looks like 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.660
 then we could just in case 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.330
 change roles with my friend 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.700
 that is, for example, either from an outcast or 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.770
 the criminal in my money worked with 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.620
 a criminal to get a cop suit 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.630
 this is justice called well 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.700
 as soon as you set up this whole task 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 you immediately invite your partner 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.600
 for doing this bug for me 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.209
 this suddenly arshan 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.730
 and thank you for helping with the implementation 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.550
 this bug as soon as it joined 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.790
 you immediately start this business then you 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.510
 see something that someone from you will throw in 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.700
 the team 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.190
 criminals in my opinion this is necessary 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.350
 because in the outcast I did not find the costume 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.380
 it was from this cop and did not have to 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.739
 go to the felon team and I'm there him 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.780
 found this costume of justice and how 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.610
 only you found it you run too 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.610
 this case is clicked there is ready 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.350
 immersed in this assignment you right there 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.090
 sit down at the nearest point is cut off 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.910
 near somewhere in the center and where 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.120
 free space and book in the world 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.850
 a helicopter that will help you 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.650
 performing this bug well and when you 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.380
 you ordered it already expect it 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.730
 a helicopter when he arrives at you 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.190
 This helicopter is needed to 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.260
 you will spawn exactly the parachute because 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.090
 we will travel in textures and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 maybe you have not the first time 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.709
 it will turn out while we will be all 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.890
 try your friend will guard our 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.260
 a helicopter so that it does not disappear ie we 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.480
 let's get together a helicopter to give us a parachute 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.120
 that is, a parachute is given to us automatically. 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.250
 then whether we are doing the execution 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.230
 this bug but as soon as you got into this 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.420
 the helicopter you are heading to the cop 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.400
 the site well and arriving by helicopter to 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.860
 this police station you fly 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.450
 back side where we remember on 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.360
 there are secret locations that are already 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.270
 In my opinion it was fixed but it does not matter, but here we are 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.070
 when you landed with a helicopter and your 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.230
 to a friend so that he gets into this helicopter 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.930
 either standing close to being given 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.430
 the helicopter did not disappear having found a car outside 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.700
 SUV which is pretty 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.010
 high we drive in the back 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.800
 this police station then 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.290
 lean our car against this wall 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.360
 come here this is where I show on 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.500
 map there who do not know is 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.870
 police station 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.400
 as soon as we leaned this car to 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.220
 we jump onto the wall of the car 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.380
 jump on this wall like me on video 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.720
 then we make sure that we have 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.390
 parachutes and jump off and in this look 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.090
 empty space just under the texture 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.850
 immediately open the parachute and fly like 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.160
 I have three halls in the video where they know 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.100
 there is a texture 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.830
 of our garage and after the possible which 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.530
 attempts we did get into our garage for 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.570
 I'll explain later how they appear 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.460
 it is not just the garage it is struck with 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.970
 apartment that is here aleksey manual 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.290
 here we fly by parachute and then we 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.290
 already go to our apartment 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.139
 having come at last to our apartment we 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.270
 heading to the wardrobe and there we are already 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.759
 think of what you need this suit all 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.710
 same save and very cool what this 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.930
 costume immediately with a cap that is not necessary 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.740
 torment out to some more bucks with 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.720
 cap 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.570
 that is, do not have to bother immediately 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.610
 all we have this suit I save 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.860
 call a cop everyone can call 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.139
 in my own way but I like it better and 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.720
 then we can safely go out 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.910
 of this assignment and then when we already 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.979
 put on this saved suit named 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.470
 interaction in the subjects we already have 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.539
 this screen suit will be so guys not 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.330
 worry but still a big minus 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:44.360
 This bug is that if you have 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.820
 it is a garage that is there is an opportunity 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.650
 that you appear in this garage without 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.630
 apartments you can not save 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.090
 This costume has a solution to this problem. 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.830
 you still have to and should replace 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.410
 garage for an apartment 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.800
 Well, sometimes not everyone will have such crap 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.630
 but still it seems to me worth buying later 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.460
 yet all the apartments so that you have 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.260
 for sure to throw you into one of 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.610
