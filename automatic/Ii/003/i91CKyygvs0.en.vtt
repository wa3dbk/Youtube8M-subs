00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
slightly soon and but i still have

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
slightly soon and but i still have
fences<00:00:44.010> or<00:00:44.190> walls<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> guys<00:00:44.820> can't<00:00:45.090> climb

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
fences or walls so you guys can't climb

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.180 
fences or walls so you guys can't climb
over<00:00:45.629> them<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.020> look<00:00:46.230> around<00:00:46.350> spawn<00:00:46.860> which<00:00:47.070> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
over them and look around spawn which is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
over them and look around spawn which is
a<00:00:47.219> pretty<00:00:47.460> good<00:00:47.610> radius<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.660> about<00:00:48.719> 75

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.319 
a pretty good radius it's about 75
radius<00:00:50.070> so<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.489> should<00:00:50.670> be<00:00:50.700> pretty<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.239> to

wood did pretty well I think so we're
now<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> walk<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> little<00:01:42.840> bit<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
now going to walk a little bit on the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.340 
now going to walk a little bit on the
town<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:44.520> yeah<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.079> we've<00:01:46.320> been

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
town so yeah this is what we've been

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.440 
town so yeah this is what we've been
pretty<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.920> been<00:01:47.159> building<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.329> these

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
pretty much been building all of these

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.969 
pretty much been building all of these
buildings<00:01:48.659> are<00:01:48.899> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.200> same<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.680> trust

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
buildings are kind of the same but trust

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.840 
buildings are kind of the same but trust
me<00:01:50.040> they<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.549> different

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
me they all will have different

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
me they all will have different
interiors<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.810> won't<00:01:52.079> be<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> same<00:01:52.380> as

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
interiors so it won't be the same as

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.789 
interiors so it won't be the same as
much<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.040> think<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:55.560> thought<00:01:55.740> about

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
much as you think it is we thought about

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440 
much as you think it is we thought about
making<00:01:56.189> little<00:01:56.399> areas<00:01:56.790> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.149> look<00:01:57.270> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
making little areas kind of look a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.740 
making little areas kind of look a
little<00:01:57.689> bit<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> same<00:01:58.170> because<00:01:58.590> well<00:01:59.750> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
little bit the same because well it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.889 
little bit the same because well it
helps<00:02:01.020> gives<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.799> feeling<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.240> little<00:02:03.450> FML

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
helps gives a feeling of a little FML

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.370 
helps gives a feeling of a little FML
part<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.560> yeah<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.110> making

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
part because yeah but we will be making

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.320 
part because yeah but we will be making
a<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.680> different<00:02:08.129> every<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.520> happier

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
a little different every little happier

won't<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.920> bad<00:02:13.189> so<00:02:14.189> yeah<00:02:14.389> that's<00:02:15.389> pretty

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
won't be that bad so yeah that's pretty

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.080 
won't be that bad so yeah that's pretty
much<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:16.079> for<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:18.049> lot<00:02:19.049> of<00:02:19.109> you<00:02:19.260> been

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
much it for that and a lot of you been

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.819 
much it for that and a lot of you been
thinking<00:02:21.090> about<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.450> classes<00:02:21.689> how<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.049> asked

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
thinking about the classes how I asked

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.750 
thinking about the classes how I asked
on<00:02:22.920> Facebook<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.709> some<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.950> might<00:02:26.159> be<00:02:26.370> how

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
on Facebook so some of that might be how

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.209 
on Facebook so some of that might be how
we<00:02:26.819> might<00:02:27.180> do<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.629> will<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.260> classes

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
we might do it will be that classes

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.789 
we might do it will be that classes
instead<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.730> being<00:02:30.329> classes<00:02:30.870> would<00:02:31.079> be<00:02:31.290> just

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
instead of being classes would be just

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.420 
instead of being classes would be just
titles<00:02:32.579> that<00:02:32.879> we<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.329> have<00:02:33.629> as<00:02:33.840> classes<00:02:34.430> so

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
titles that we just have as classes so

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.030 
titles that we just have as classes so
you<00:02:35.519> will<00:02:35.819> have<00:02:36.030> skills<00:02:36.719> that<00:02:37.079> will<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.829> able

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
you will have skills that will be able

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.140 
you will have skills that will be able
to<00:02:38.219> still<00:02:38.519> be<00:02:38.669> unlock<00:02:38.969> right<00:02:39.209> there<00:02:39.419> but<00:02:39.719> at

to still be unlock right there but at
certain<00:02:42.150> levels<00:02:42.419> some<00:02:43.079> skills<00:02:43.409> will<00:02:43.500> be

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
certain levels some skills will be

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:06.419 
to have a certain title which would not

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.270 
to have a certain title which would not
really<00:03:06.569> be<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.840> class<00:03:07.199> but<00:03:07.530> mostly<00:03:07.859> a<00:03:07.919> title

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
really be a class but mostly a title

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.059 
really be a class but mostly a title
that<00:03:08.400> will<00:03:08.669> be<00:03:10.219> stationed<00:03:11.219> as<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:12.199> title<00:03:13.199> in

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
that will be stationed as a title in

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.280 
that will be stationed as a title in
class<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.269> that'll<00:03:15.509> be<00:03:15.569> something<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.019> should

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
class so that'll be something you should

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.589 
class so that'll be something you should
be<00:03:16.439> looking<00:03:16.590> forward<00:03:16.949> to<00:03:17.310> another<00:03:18.090> thing<00:03:18.389> is

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
be looking forward to another thing is

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.080 
be looking forward to another thing is
that<00:03:18.680> we've<00:03:19.680> been<00:03:19.829> thinking<00:03:20.340> about<00:03:20.459> adding

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
that we've been thinking about adding

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.629 
that we've been thinking about adding
more<00:03:21.599> plugins<00:03:22.470> but<00:03:23.009> the<00:03:23.099> problem<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.519> with

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
more plugins but the problem is with

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.539 
more plugins but the problem is with
that<00:03:23.699> is<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.379> we<00:03:25.379> are<00:03:25.650> having<00:03:26.009> problems<00:03:26.159> with

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
that is that we are having problems with

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.969 
that is that we are having problems with
Ram<00:03:26.849> because<00:03:27.509> well<00:03:28.169> we<00:03:28.470> are<00:03:28.530> using<00:03:28.739> our<00:03:28.949> own

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
Ram because well we are using our own

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.879 
Ram because well we are using our own
computer<00:03:29.519> server<00:03:29.759> that<00:03:30.000> which<00:03:30.209> holds<00:03:30.889> has

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
computer server that which holds has

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.189 
computer server that which holds has
enough<00:03:32.220> RAM<00:03:32.519> for<00:03:32.819> it<00:03:32.909> but<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.569> plugins<00:03:34.019> will

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:34.199 
enough RAM for it but the plugins will

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.800 
enough RAM for it but the plugins will
make<00:03:34.409> it<00:03:34.560> slower<00:03:34.889> so<00:03:35.340> if<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.239> all<00:03:36.329> want<00:03:36.569> more

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
make it slower so if you all want more

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.780 
make it slower so if you all want more
plugins<00:03:37.139> we<00:03:37.889> would<00:03:38.069> really<00:03:38.189> appreciate<00:03:38.340> some

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
plugins we would really appreciate some

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.270 
plugins we would really appreciate some
donations<00:03:39.509> from<00:03:39.599> y'all<00:03:39.870> so<00:03:40.739> it's<00:03:41.040> possible

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
donations from y'all so it's possible

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
plug is we're thinking of putting in

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.580 
plug is we're thinking of putting in
will<00:04:04.469> be<00:04:05.539> the<00:04:06.539> quest<00:04:06.780> plugin<00:04:07.199> which<00:04:07.349> pretty

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
will be the quest plugin which pretty

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.219 
will be the quest plugin which pretty

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
won't be to confuse about it if you kill

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.879 
won't be to confuse about it if you kill
a<00:04:29.550> player<00:04:29.849> you<00:04:30.300> will<00:04:30.479> be<00:04:30.630> sent<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.870> gel<00:04:31.139> instead

a player you will be sent a gel instead

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.860 
a player you will be sent a gel instead
of<00:04:32.039> being<00:04:32.250> banned<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.940> most<00:04:33.180> servers<00:04:33.419> do<00:04:33.720> it

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
of being banned like most servers do it

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.279 
of being banned like most servers do it
you<00:04:34.410> will<00:04:34.560> be<00:04:34.710> sent<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.400> jail<00:04:35.699> and<00:04:35.729> in<00:04:36.150> jail<00:04:36.539> you

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
you will be sent to jail and in jail you

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.809 
you will be sent to jail and in jail you
will<00:04:37.410> have<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.770> escape<00:04:37.949> from<00:04:38.250> jail<00:04:38.490> all<00:04:38.699> the

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
will have to escape from jail all the

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.659 
will have to escape from jail all the
way<00:04:38.970> there<00:04:39.900> will<00:04:40.050> be<00:04:40.229> items<00:04:40.620> in<00:04:40.830> foods<00:04:41.099> gel

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
way there will be items in foods gel

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.650 
way there will be items in foods gel
will<00:04:41.819> be<00:04:41.940> a<00:04:41.970> 200<00:04:42.690> feet<00:04:43.080> on<00:04:43.729> square<00:04:44.729> box<00:04:45.030> radius

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
will be a 200 feet on square box radius

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.230 
will be a 200 feet on square box radius
so<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:47.220> would<00:04:47.340> be<00:04:47.490> like<00:04:47.610> its<00:04:47.789> own<00:04:47.940> dungeon

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
to me on captain gin so so on my skype

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.760 
to me on captain gin so so on my skype
last<00:06:27.509> but<00:06:27.719> not<00:06:27.810> least<00:06:27.870> we<00:06:28.349> have<00:06:28.380> another

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
last but not least we have another

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.379 
last but not least we have another
plugin<00:06:29.069> that<00:06:29.280> we<00:06:29.909> have<00:06:30.060> thought<00:06:30.270> about

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
plugin that we have thought about

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.540 
plugin that we have thought about
putting<00:06:30.779> in<00:06:30.960> for<00:06:31.229> animals<00:06:31.860> which<00:06:32.159> will<00:06:32.400> be

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
putting in for animals which will be

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.950 
putting in for animals which will be
more<00:06:32.760> aggressive<00:06:33.000> towards<00:06:33.479> you<00:06:33.570> when<00:06:33.690> you<00:06:33.810> try

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
more aggressive towards you when you try

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.580 
more aggressive towards you when you try
to<00:06:33.990> attack

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
to attack

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.890 
to attack
so<00:06:34.860> they<00:06:35.100> would<00:06:35.280> fight<00:06:35.490> back<00:06:35.630> that<00:06:36.630> would<00:06:36.780> be

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 
so they would fight back that would be

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.080 
so they would fight back that would be
all<00:06:37.080> mostly<00:06:37.470> likely<00:06:37.770> and<00:06:38.190> this<00:06:38.700> has<00:06:38.880> been

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
all mostly likely and this has been

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.770 
all mostly likely and this has been

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530 
on Twitter Facebook and even if you want

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.460 
on Twitter Facebook and even if you want
to<00:06:47.030> my<00:06:48.030> YouTube<00:06:48.420> which<00:06:48.840> you<00:06:49.050> don't<00:06:49.140> have<00:06:49.320> to

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.240 
to my YouTube which you don't have to
but<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:50.370> would<00:06:50.550> be<00:06:50.610> probably<00:06:51.090> more<00:06:52.010> likely<00:06:53.010> the

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
but it would be probably more likely the

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.770 
but it would be probably more likely the
best<00:06:53.280> thing<00:06:53.550> to<00:06:53.640> do<00:06:53.790> since<00:06:54.000> if<00:06:54.210> you<00:06:54.300> want<00:06:54.720> to
