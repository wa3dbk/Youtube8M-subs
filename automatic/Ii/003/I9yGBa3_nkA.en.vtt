00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.810
 good we have here a tied manufactured to 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.900
 hand for tripod 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.370
 of the tripod hooks here where 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.529
 They are threaded mos 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.930
 then we have now a sleeve for 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.730
 leave a link here of how it was made 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.930
 although this is for the galaxy s2 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 we fit here 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.710
 once fitted here we put a 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.489
 tripod part that is placed 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 here and when placing it here you can 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.480
 hook on the tripod and then 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.600
 hook it on the tripod so you can 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.750
 to move it to be able to record then 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.770
 everything is perfectly or leave here 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.680
 same the link to see how it was done 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.829
 for a galaxy s 4 but the procedure 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:05.390
 it's been practically the same 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:09.340
 and nothing else I hope you like the idea and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.010
 nothing that thumbs up if you liked it 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.990
 subscribe 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:21.070
 and that's something very simple with a 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.470
 housing a cheap cover and with the cover 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.120
 cheap as it goes a piece of plastic 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.620
 here with a couple of screws though 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.930
 has here other holes was for 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.690
 mistake because he warned in the video 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.600
 that has to be to put the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.830
 phone like that and I put the pieces to 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.630
 I put it back here, I had to 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.880
 phone here with a zoom up here 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.520
 Well, the images came back to me 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.950
 logically then I had to go back to 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.470
 pierce the other time to put it 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.930
 the cue in its place but nothing does not 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.409
 I remember just in case I did not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.730
 go to the other side 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.370
 and nothing again I leave you here link and 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.090
 I am applied there and you see it for 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.250
 prepared for the s4 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.960
 but the procedure I have to be 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 the same 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.229
 and a little health placed and until the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.229
 next april
