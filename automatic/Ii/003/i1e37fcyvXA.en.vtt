CRAIG ALEXANDER: My name's Craig
Alexander, professional

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.370
triathlete from Sydney,
Australia.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.210
I've been pretty consistent
in all the years

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.230
with my bike split.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.120
I think when you've had a decent
level of success, doing

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.580
things a certain way, you're
always reluctant to change.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.280
It's always hard to compare from
year to year, even at the

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.230
same race, because conditions
can be different.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.340
Obviously, I have ways
of comparing in

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.030
terms of my power output.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.600
And it is no question that last
year on a new bike, this

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.810
bike right here, my power
expenditure was actually less

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.240
than it had been in
the past when I

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.170
went 30 minutes quicker.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.100
So I think when you're talking
about a late sport, world

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.600
class sport, knocking seconds
off is big thing.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.870
When you take a chunk of 30
minutes off, it's almost

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.680
unheard of.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.310
And I couldn't really believe
it myself, to be honest.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.440
I have faith in the science.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.360
It's not that I never did
or I wasn't a believer.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.660
I come from more of a mentality
where the basis of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.019
success is hard work
and preparation.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.320
And that will get you so far.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.140
But to go to the next level,
you have to run out every

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.740
[? gramble ?]

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.610
and look at other avenues.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.640
And looking at your equipment
is a huge part of that.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.440
Today we're here at the A2 Wind
Tunnel in Mooresville

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.270
doing some testing of different
products, mainly the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.130
new specialist McLaren helmet,
but also just tweaking a few

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910
other things, obviously
utilizing Chris and Matt's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.280
expertise and also tweaking some
other little things with

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.530
the position.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.070
If You're.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340
Talking about the highest level
of performance against

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.610
the best competition in the
world, you're looking at

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.410
performance gains in a whole
range of areas and one of

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.070
those areas is aerodynamics.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.900
Most recently, what they
call the new generation

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.680
super-bikes, they're all tested
extensively in the wind

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.160
tunnel with aerodynamics
experts.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.460
And there's a lot of validity
in the findings.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.480
Aerodynamics is a big part of
any sport where there's a lot

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.745
of movement and fast movement.

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.000
And the faster you go, the more
important it becomes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.740
There's a lot of guys here today
who have forgotten more

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.130
about this stuff than
I ever knew.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.230
And I just trust their expertise
and their knowledge.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.340
Bottom line for me is, it's
all about the performance.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.889
I'm just interested in going
fast and winning races.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.410
I'm not just going to take
anyone's word for it, either.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.400
There's real gains to
be had in here.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.870
I've been in here a couple of
times now, and I've seen what

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.120
can happen.
