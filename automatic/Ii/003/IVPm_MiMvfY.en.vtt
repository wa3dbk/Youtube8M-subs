use in my sky block world I wasn't

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.220 
use in my sky block world I wasn't
really<00:00:11.880> happy<00:00:12.240> with<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.480> other<00:00:12.599> options<00:00:13.080> out

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.640 
there
I<00:00:13.679> needed<00:00:14.190> something<00:00:14.429> fast<00:00:14.940> safe<00:00:15.750> with<00:00:16.230> lots

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
I needed something fast safe with lots

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.010 
I needed something fast safe with lots
of<00:00:16.890> storage<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.940> needed<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> automatically

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
of storage and I needed to automatically

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.349 
of storage and I needed to automatically
dispense<00:00:19.500> pickaxes<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.789> that's<00:00:21.000> what<00:00:21.210> we're

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
dispense pickaxes so that's what we're

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.130 
dispense pickaxes so that's what we're
going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.779> building<00:00:22.140> today<00:00:22.310> in<00:00:23.900> step<00:00:24.900> one

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
going to be building today in step one

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.599 
going to be building today in step one
we're<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.740> building<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.310> frame

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
we're going to be building the frame

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.849 
we're going to be building the frame
this<00:00:26.910> starts<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:27.300> with<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.510> five<00:00:27.960> wide<00:00:28.289> V<00:00:28.590> shape

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this starts out with a five wide V shape

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.349 
this starts out with a five wide V shape
and<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.160> already<00:00:29.400> started<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> block<00:00:30.090> here

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and I already started with a block here

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.620 
and I already started with a block here
so<00:00:30.570> I'd<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:31.099> an<00:00:32.099> idea<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> where<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> wanted<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
so I'd have an idea of where I wanted to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
so I'd have an idea of where I wanted to
build<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.200> there's<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.739> five<00:00:35.280> wide

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
build it so there's our five wide

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
build it so there's our five wide
v-shaped<00:00:35.940> cool<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:37.320> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.590> be

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
v-shaped cool then we're going to be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.440 
v-shaped cool then we're going to be
placing<00:00:37.920> down<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.520> double<00:00:38.850> chest<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.420> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
placing down a double chest like this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
placing down a double chest like this
then<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.320> funnel<00:00:40.590> three<00:00:40.980> hoppers

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
then we're gonna funnel three hoppers

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
then we're gonna funnel three hoppers
into<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> side<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> double<00:00:42.690> chest<00:00:42.930> then

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
into the side of that double chest then

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.319 
into the side of that double chest then
we<00:00:43.920> need<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.160> place<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.489> solid<00:00:44.730> block<00:00:45.000> here

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.070 
cobblestone block in the back and you
can<00:03:16.920> see<00:03:17.100> that<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.880> cobblestone<00:03:18.420> generates

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
can see that the cobblestone generates

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.810 
can see that the cobblestone generates
very<00:03:19.290> very<00:03:19.500> quickly<00:03:19.740> now<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.490> are<00:03:20.610> playing

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
very very quickly now if you are playing

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.850 
very very quickly now if you are playing
in<00:03:20.910> something<00:03:21.270> in<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.870> Skyblock<00:03:22.500> where<00:03:22.770> you

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
in something in like Skyblock where you

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.030 
in something in like Skyblock where you
have<00:03:23.070> only<00:03:23.760> one<00:03:24.330> lava<00:03:24.810> source<00:03:25.140> or<00:03:25.380> lava<00:03:25.740> is<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
have only one lava source or lava is a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.090 
have only one lava source or lava is a
very<00:03:26.490> limited<00:03:26.730> resource<00:03:26.990> we<00:03:27.990> can<00:03:28.170> add<00:03:28.440> like<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
very limited resource we can add like a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.460 
very limited resource we can add like a
little<00:03:29.190> topper<00:03:29.880> here<00:03:30.240> to<00:03:30.600> contain<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.230> lava

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
little topper here to contain the lava

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
little topper here to contain the lava
then<00:03:32.010> we<00:03:32.160> drop<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.640> single<00:03:33.150> lava<00:03:33.510> source

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
then we drop a single lava source

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.990 
then we drop a single lava source
instead<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.380> two<00:03:34.590> right<00:03:35.190> here<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.490> this<00:03:35.610> split

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
instead of two right here on this split

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.270 
instead of two right here on this split
and<00:03:36.209> then<00:03:36.390> it'll<00:03:36.570> cut<00:03:37.230> itself<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.740> half<00:03:37.920> and

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
and then it'll cut itself in half and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.640 
and then it'll cut itself in half and
we'll<00:03:38.640> still<00:03:38.880> get<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.150> double<00:03:39.630> lava<00:03:40.260> source

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
we'll still get that double lava source

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.050 
we'll still get that double lava source
for<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:41.730> quicker<00:03:42.240> cobblestone<00:03:43.230> generation

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
for the quicker cobblestone generation

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.490 
for the quicker cobblestone generation
there<00:03:45.060> you<00:03:45.120> go<00:03:45.300> that's<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:46.170> end<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.410> the

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
there you go that's the end of the
