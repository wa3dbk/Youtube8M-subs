00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
I'll test that out put some water in NZ

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.640 
I'll test that out put some water in NZ
they<00:03:59.130> leak<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.610> then<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.299> kind<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.290> spray

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
they leak and then this kind of spray

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.650 
they leak and then this kind of spray
one<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:02.010> also<00:04:02.160> had<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.519> pump<00:04:02.850> one<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:03.329> don't

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
one I also had like a pump one I don't

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.940 
one I also had like a pump one I don't
want<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.989> because<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.350> would<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.890> would

then you can just like spray tank
fact<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.510> know<00:04:15.949> we'll<00:04:16.949> see<00:04:17.130> how<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.400> works

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
fact you know we'll see how that works

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.110 
fact you know we'll see how that works
out

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
out

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.629 
out
saya<00:04:18.840> thought<00:04:19.410> right<00:04:19.620> about<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.419> yeah<00:04:21.419> so

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
saya thought right about that yeah so

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.520 
saya thought right about that yeah so
leak<00:04:23.639> out<00:04:23.820> some<00:04:24.330> dollars<00:04:24.900> toward<00:04:25.169> survival

items

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.790 

a<00:04:28.129> quick<00:04:29.129> note<00:04:29.340> about<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.759> icebreakers

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
a quick note about the icebreakers

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.089 
a quick note about the icebreakers
plastic<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:32.520> took<00:04:33.150> off<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.419> stickers<00:04:33.810> and

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
plastic I took off the stickers and

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.890 
plastic I took off the stickers and
almost<00:04:35.099> immediately<00:04:35.310> this<00:04:36.060> tab<00:04:36.389> broke<00:04:36.690> off

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
almost immediately this tab broke off

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.619 
almost immediately this tab broke off
that<00:04:38.180> helps<00:04:39.470> seal<00:04:40.470> it<00:04:40.620> up<00:04:40.849> so<00:04:41.849> I<00:04:42.300> wouldn't

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
that helps seal it up so I wouldn't

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:45.770 
that helps seal it up so I wouldn't
recommend<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:44.240> looks<00:04:45.240> like<00:04:45.389> I'll<00:04:45.539> have<00:04:45.569> to

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
recommend this looks like I'll have to

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.060 
recommend this looks like I'll have to
find<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.289> pill<00:04:47.099> container<00:04:47.460> some<00:04:47.909> another
