 hi guys are the girls how are i 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.920
 I'm guy demel and in this episode I'm going 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.250
 to teach how to draw a shovel 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.800
 diamonds and leave a diamond shovel 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.070
 good 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.240
 in the previous episode I showed him how 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.860
 draw the peak east and good let's start 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.779
 with the shovel 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.779
 the view you see here 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:38.379
 well first here we start making a 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.379
 square of 4 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.740
 then we make another one here, well, 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.740
 as the typical one also 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:01:00.030
 and so we are doing 6 always as 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.359
 will you see 10 or 16 s 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.330
 now we are going to have to make a layer 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:10.740
 from top mouth 1 well here and another here 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.520
 as if we were going to do one more but 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520
 just the little tips 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.460
 and the following ones we added another k 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.110
 and another case 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.110
 you think about drawing well 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.710
 Well, they have to do it more straight 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.820
 but the son of all that 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.820
 very well now here we give two more 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.979
 and another box the tips 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.979
 and here the same but here 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.920
 and another one here 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.409
 and good hearing right now they have to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.240
 talk 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:05.270
 and one more here and there but 3 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.159
 this is how it is 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.159
 the same we add more 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.800
 well that would be the shovel this is the shovel 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.069
 and now good of diamonds so that 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:29.270
 combine with the peak then very well 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:34.080
 the color we need blue 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.870
 the brown does not look what color brown 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 and good a black pencil a black fiber 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.160
 that I got 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.739
 all the edges or all these 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.090
 edges here for this black 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.819
 well I painted it I come well good already from a 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.689
 painter what would be the background 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.349
 the outside edges of the shovel and I 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.890
 forget to discount the end of the tip 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.710
 of technique 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.990
 then that one like that 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.010
 two jobs 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:20.769
 and ends in two like that 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.989
 and well there you will see no and that too 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.970
 goes black 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.970
 well there that is to finish and so 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.870
 so now we grab 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:41.840
 and we paint from here to here all this 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.640
 ok, the shovel is already taking shape 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.270
 and with that I'm good finish 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.800
 paint everything in here 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.140
 and this is what it would have in the end 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:00.680
 all good as you see 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:08.090
 I put a better light reflection 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.090
 better go 1 and 1 this is the shovel 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.900
 good this and this 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 I'm going to show you how to draw the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.910
 ax 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.810
 so good these futures until the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.810
 next chao
