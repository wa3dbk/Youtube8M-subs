completely unacceptable
and<00:02:42.280> obviously<00:02:42.430> if<00:02:42.730> thing<00:02:43.330> comes<00:02:43.540> back<00:02:43.750> up<00:02:43.959> all

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170

by<00:02:44.320> itself<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.800> about<00:02:44.950> half<00:02:45.190> at<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.430> time

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
by itself and about half at this time

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.190 
by itself and about half at this time
because<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.209> turned<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.540> off<00:02:46.690> andand<00:02:46.959> I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
because I just turned it off andand I

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.650 
because I just turned it off andand I
kind<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.560> do<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.459> yeah<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.420> you're<00:02:49.510> dead<00:02:49.630> on
