00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.849
 band is already monday football Monday 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.889
 confederations today plays nigeria against 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 Tahiti a must-see game 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.730
 I say for the relatives of the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 Nigerians and Haitians but also 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.420
 it's football Monday for the band 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.250
 unmissable today we are going to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 learn to correctly center the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 ball I say in the subject came out that already 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:32.090
 that we are talking about confederations 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:34.160
 nigeria mexico 00 plus the centers 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.970
 so let's give everything to the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.400
 centers for this type of center is the 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.350
 Most players probably do 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.739
 you have done it and the truth is the most 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.739
 easy 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.740
 what I do not understand is how there are players 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.740
 professionals who do this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.970
 yes 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.900
 let's still say that the ball was in 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.300
 movement came three players 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.840
 Now l do not step but the ball 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.840
 stopped 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.350
 you can give some effect to 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.329
 center the ball in this way this with 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.810
 the purpose of the auctioneer having 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.810
 advantage 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.770
 because the effect of the ball helps you 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.770
 finish stronger 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.710
 this type of centers are very effective 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.420
 because they are stronger and you do not have 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.520
 to worry if he's going to grab the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.439
 ball or not the force that leads to the center 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.740
 is directly proportional to the auction 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.740
 of the player 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.620
 do not 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.550
 these centers are used many times 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.770
 by the players who do not use the other 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.020
 leg look good when they come out and 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.319
 everything but nothing like focusing well with the 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.319
 two feet 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.950
 The bad thing about not knowing is entering with the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.960
 two feet is that sometimes you take bad 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.700
 decisions what I'm going to do is that when 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.800
 you reach the final line and you must enter what 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.420
 as fast as possible there are times when you 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.880
 stop and you put the ball to your foot 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.390
 good and then centras which takes away the 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.390
 surprise factor 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.849
 better when you reach that final line and 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.980
 must center with the Swedish leg 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.940
 try it and you'll see that it's much easier 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.940
 of what you thought 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.500
 these centers are mainly for 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.680
 deceive the opponent if it reaches the line 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.840
 end and you raise the face eye you raise the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.520
 face watching your forward on tip not 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.370
 it occurs to you to turn back because 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.170
 if not the cloth defense guess then 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.050
 if you raise your face pretending that you will 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.730
 pass to the most advanced player a center 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.570
 the ball backwards for someone 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.570
 arrive and the auction 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.989
 this type of center has several 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.730
 advantages is the famous search engine because 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.470
 may the goal your front star 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.310
 or maybe the goal in its own arc the 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.310
 same defense 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.770
 you will only send a 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.270
 center and with enough force to 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.620
 that the foot that gets in the way or 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.620
 be it turn into a coup 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.449
 here comes the real difficulty for 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.189
 send a good center there are different 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.439
 factors that can prevent you from sending a 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:53.990
 good center in motion for example 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.699
 that you're a trunk and just hit him 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.009
 hitting the ball without trying to give 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.950
 advantage to your front you just hit him 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.990
 already 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.580
 other factors that do not look good 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.580
 steps and you end up doing this 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.680
 and the factor they are most afraid of 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.790
 players that you bounce the ball just 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.790
 when you are going to center 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.409
 but on the other hand if you manage to send a 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.210
 center with the ball the movement speaks 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:23.179
 very good about you and your technique 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.979
 individual do not despair concentrate 

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:26.959
 and measures well the steps so that when 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.909
 put your support foot what do you put 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:32.229
 exactly on the side of the ball and you 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.229
 you can paste in a good way 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.779
 you just have to let the ball between 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.289
 just your profile and that's when you 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.289
 you must paste 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.139
 Well, you saw all the types of 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.970
 centers that there are and the right way to 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.770
 do them here the important thing is that your 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.569
 centers reach where we really 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.580
 you want to put many players only 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:02.409
 they enter by focusing center on the ball 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.360
 to see who plays it and by chance 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.520
 the true objective of a good center 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.620
 is that you put it where you want and what 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.300
 give all the benefits to your header I 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.099
 I say goodbye my name is israel and 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.840
 remember to be attentive to my networks 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.219
 social here I put them so that 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.379
