zentorno wasn't even a million dollars
in<00:02:23.340> these<00:02:23.520> past<00:02:23.790> two<00:02:23.970> DLCs<00:02:24.390> both<00:02:24.600> super<00:02:24.930> cars

were<00:02:25.230> over<00:02:25.410> two<00:02:25.560> million<00:02:25.770> now<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.490> don't<00:02:26.820> know

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
were over two million now I don't know

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.790 
were over two million now I don't know
much<00:02:27.150> about<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> clothes<00:02:27.990> prices<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
stuff I don't think that's changed much

stuff I don't think that's changed much
but<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.960> mean<00:02:31.110> unfortunately<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.400> looks<00:02:32.460> like<00:02:32.790> a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
but I mean unfortunately it looks like a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.210 
but I mean unfortunately it looks like a
lot<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.050> updates<00:02:34.590> are<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.100> be

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
lot of the updates are going to be

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.070 
lot of the updates are going to be
expensive<00:02:35.820> just<00:02:36.180> because<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> lot<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.960> people

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
expensive just because a lot of people

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.410 
expensive just because a lot of people
especially<00:02:37.620> now<00:02:38.070> after<00:02:38.460> all<00:02:38.940> these<00:02:39.090> heists

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
especially now after all these heists

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.510 
especially now after all these heists
and<00:02:39.750> double<00:02:40.080> XP<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.740> double<00:02:41.010> money<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
everything you know people have money so

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.770 
everything you know people have money so
rocks<00:02:44.370> are<00:02:44.580> definitely<00:02:45.090> gonna<00:02:45.180> capitalize<00:02:45.450> on

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
rocks are definitely gonna capitalize on

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.990

that<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.620> would<00:02:46.740> make<00:02:46.890> sense<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.490> know<00:02:47.520> from<00:02:47.850> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that it would make sense you know from a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.810 
that it would make sense you know from a
business<00:02:48.240> point<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:49.110> make<00:02:50.040> stuff<00:02:50.280> expensive

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
business point to make stuff expensive

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.130 
business point to make stuff expensive
because<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.390> have<00:02:51.570> people<00:02:51.720> spend<00:02:52.080> their

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
because you have people spend their

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620 
because you have people spend their
money<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:53.250> for<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.520> next<00:02:53.610> DLC<00:02:54.209> they<00:02:54.480> got

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.600 
freakin job or fleece a job double money
it<00:03:07.410> wouldn't<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.860> an<00:03:07.920> outrageous<00:03:08.310> pair<00:03:08.459> I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
it wouldn't be an outrageous pair I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.430 
it wouldn't be an outrageous pair I
don't<00:03:08.820> think<00:03:09.150> they<00:03:09.870> were<00:03:09.930> worried

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
don't think they were worried

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.020 
don't think they were worried
necessarily<00:03:11.070> about<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.400> payout<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.910> you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
necessarily about the payout that you

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.150 
necessarily about the payout that you
would<00:03:12.150> get<00:03:12.330> if<00:03:12.510> there<00:03:12.660> was<00:03:12.750> double<00:03:13.050> money<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
would get if there was double money and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.490 
would get if there was double money and
RP<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.850> nobody<00:03:15.420> wants<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.750> play<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.170> man

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
RP I just nobody wants to play that man

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470 
RP I just nobody wants to play that man
it's<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.070> two<00:03:17.280> player<00:03:17.519> heist<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:18.180> really

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
it's a two player heist it's really

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.050 
it's a two player heist it's really
boring<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.980> basically<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.489> a<00:03:20.730> tutorial

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
boring it's basically just a tutorial

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.360 
boring it's basically just a tutorial
heist<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.080> think<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.920> reason<00:03:23.340> why

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
heist and I think that's the reason why

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.910 
heist and I think that's the reason why
I<00:03:23.489> mean<00:03:23.790> yeah<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:24.450> not<00:03:24.750> because<00:03:25.590> they<00:03:25.709> didn't

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
I mean yeah it's not because they didn't

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.190 
I mean yeah it's not because they didn't
want<00:03:26.070> people<00:03:26.340> making<00:03:26.519> an<00:03:27.480> absurd<00:03:27.840> amount<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
want people making an absurd amount of

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.960 
want people making an absurd amount of
money<00:03:28.380> because<00:03:28.650> they<00:03:28.860> wouldn't<00:03:29.100> know<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.610> yeah

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
money because they wouldn't know so yeah

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.670 
money because they wouldn't know so yeah
that's<00:03:30.209> that's<00:03:30.510> basically<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.019> reason<00:03:31.200> but

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's that's basically the reason but

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.050 
that's that's basically the reason but
we<00:03:31.769> don't<00:03:31.950> know<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.220> really<00:03:32.700> good<00:03:32.940> question

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
we don't know a really good question

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.030 
we don't know a really good question

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
come out yet so we're just speculating

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.800 
come out yet so we're just speculating
here<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:47.400> high<00:03:47.580> life<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.150> hipster<00:03:48.570> and

then the flight school the high life you

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.840 
then the flight school the high life you
can<00:03:52.290> combine<00:03:52.530> both<00:03:52.920> ill-gotten<00:03:53.340> gains<00:03:53.610> part

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
can combine both ill-gotten gains part

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.509 
can combine both ill-gotten gains part
one<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.239> two<00:03:54.330> at<00:03:54.720> similar<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> high<00:03:56.340> life

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
one and two at similar to a high life

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.120 
one and two at similar to a high life
update<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.420> next<00:03:57.720> one<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.410> a<00:03:58.650> low<00:03:58.920> life

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
update the next one if it is a low life

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.850 
update the next one if it is a low life
or<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> low<00:03:59.730> rider<00:03:59.940> or<00:04:00.120> whatever<00:04:00.810> DLC<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.709> it

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
or a low rider or whatever DLC and it

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.580 
or a low rider or whatever DLC and it
has<00:04:02.010> 12<00:04:02.459> cars<00:04:02.820> that's<00:04:03.480> really<00:04:03.810> similar<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.320> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
has 12 cars that's really similar to the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.680 
has 12 cars that's really similar to the
hips<00:04:05.160> or<00:04:05.340> update<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.730> had<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> bunch<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.420> cars

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
hips or update that had a bunch of cars

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.900 
hips or update that had a bunch of cars
that<00:04:06.780> weren't<00:04:07.200> as<00:04:07.320> expensive<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.070> then<00:04:08.700> if

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
that weren't as expensive and then if

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.640 
that weren't as expensive and then if
there<00:04:09.090> is<00:04:09.239> going<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.630> be<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.780> stunt<00:04:10.350> school

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
there is going to be a stunt school

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.460 
there is going to be a stunt school
which<00:04:10.769> even<00:04:11.010> Rockstar<00:04:11.580> artis<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.780> that's

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
which even Rockstar artis then that's

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.199 
which even Rockstar artis then that's
really<00:04:13.650> similar<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> flight<00:04:14.640> school<00:04:14.940> so

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
really similar to the flight school so

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.860 
really similar to the flight school so
the<00:04:16.200> reason<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.830> if<00:04:17.459> that's<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.239> case<00:04:18.450> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
the reason that if that's the case the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.599 
the reason that if that's the case the
reason<00:04:19.169> they're<00:04:19.320> doing<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:19.859> because<00:04:20.340> it's

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
reason they're doing it is because it's

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.400 
reason they're doing it is because it's
successful<00:04:21.150> like<00:04:21.330> why<00:04:21.570> fix<00:04:22.020> something<00:04:22.140> that's

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
successful like why fix something that's

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.740 
successful like why fix something that's
broken<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.979> know<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.669> high<00:04:23.850> life<00:04:24.030> was<00:04:24.360> one<00:04:24.660> of

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
broken you know the high life was one of

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.900 
broken you know the high life was one of
the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.900 
the
best<00:04:25.150> DLCs<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.690> think<00:04:26.110> they've<00:04:26.200> ever<00:04:26.290> done<00:04:26.440> and

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
best DLCs I think they've ever done and

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.040 
best DLCs I think they've ever done and
to<00:04:27.910> make<00:04:28.120> they'll<00:04:28.270> gotten<00:04:28.540> gains<00:04:28.690> sort<00:04:28.990> of

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
to make they'll gotten gains sort of

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.900 
to make they'll gotten gains sort of
like<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.530> mean<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.710> granite<00:04:30.070> it<00:04:30.460> was<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.700> lot

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
like that I mean a granite it was a lot

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.880 
like that I mean a granite it was a lot
more<00:04:30.940> expensive<00:04:31.300> but<00:04:31.690> at<00:04:31.990> end<00:04:32.680> of<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.830> day

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
more expensive but at end of the day

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.460 
more expensive but at end of the day
it's<00:04:33.070> similar<00:04:33.370> stuff<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:35.050> hips<00:04:35.230> are

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
it's similar stuff and the hips are

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.560 
it's similar stuff and the hips are
update<00:04:35.740> that<00:04:36.160> was<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.730> wasn't<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.450> know

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
update that was it wasn't you know

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.420 
update that was it wasn't you know
amazing<00:04:37.960> but<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.620> was<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.890> was<00:04:39.010> really<00:04:39.280> good

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
amazing but it was it was really good

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.160 
amazing but it was it was really good
and<00:04:39.700> it<00:04:39.880> had<00:04:40.030> really<00:04:40.450> cool<00:04:40.720> clothes<00:04:40.960> actually

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
and it had really cool clothes actually

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.390 
and it had really cool clothes actually
that<00:04:41.470> was<00:04:41.560> probably<00:04:41.710> where<00:04:41.890> my<00:04:41.980> favorite<00:04:42.280> deal

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
that was probably where my favorite deal

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.730 
that was probably where my favorite deal
sees<00:04:42.670> that<00:04:43.300> included<00:04:43.990> like<00:04:44.260> clothes<00:04:44.560> and

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
sees that included like clothes and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.340 
sees that included like clothes and
stuff<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:45.190> this<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.270> lowlife<00:04:46.660> ELC<00:04:47.110> yeah<00:04:47.320> I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
stuff and this this lowlife ELC yeah I

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.740 
stuff and this this lowlife ELC yeah I
think<00:04:48.100> that'd<00:04:48.310> be<00:04:48.430> pretty<00:04:48.580> cool<00:04:48.700> or<00:04:48.970> low<00:04:49.150> ride

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
think that'd be pretty cool or low ride

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.510 
think that'd be pretty cool or low ride
or<00:04:49.870> whatever<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.380> case<00:04:50.410> may<00:04:50.710> be<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:51.010> then<00:04:51.460> the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
or whatever the case may be and then the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.160 
or whatever the case may be and then the
flight<00:04:51.730> school<00:04:52.000> not<00:04:52.150> granite<00:04:52.360> that<00:04:52.600> one<00:04:52.810> was

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
flight school not granite that one was

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.070 
flight school not granite that one was
probably<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.370> worst<00:04:54.400> DLC<00:04:55.150> besides<00:04:55.840> like

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
probably the worst DLC besides like

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080 
probably the worst DLC besides like
beach<00:04:56.260> bum<00:04:56.530> just<00:04:57.460> because<00:04:57.700> it<00:04:57.790> was<00:04:57.850> really

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
beach bum just because it was really

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.300 
beach bum just because it was really
disappointing<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:58.870> think<00:04:59.440> Rockstar<00:04:59.860> kind<00:05:00.220> of

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
disappointing I think Rockstar kind of

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.620 
disappointing I think Rockstar kind of
learned<00:05:00.430> from<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.670> and<00:05:00.820> maybe<00:05:01.150> if<00:05:01.450> they<00:05:01.570> do

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
learned from that and maybe if they do

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.930 
learned from that and maybe if they do
do<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.110> stunt<00:05:02.380> school<00:05:02.710> they'll<00:05:03.250> obviously

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
do the stunt school they'll obviously

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.790 
do the stunt school they'll obviously
make<00:05:04.450> it<00:05:04.570> better<00:05:04.750> and<00:05:04.840> everything<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.530> like<00:05:05.710> I

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
make it better and everything and like I

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.960 
make it better and everything and like I
just<00:05:05.890> said<00:05:06.100> they're<00:05:06.250> probably<00:05:06.430> not<00:05:06.580> gonna<00:05:06.730> fix

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
just said they're probably not gonna fix

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.490 
just said they're probably not gonna fix
something<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.780> know<00:05:07.870> really<00:05:08.110> isn't

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
something that you know really isn't

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.440 
something that you know really isn't
broken<00:05:08.770> and<00:05:09.100> that's<00:05:09.490> just<00:05:09.610> how<00:05:09.730> it<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:09.910> it's

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
broken and that's just how it is it's

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.050 
broken and that's just how it is it's
probably<00:05:10.690> easier<00:05:11.320> for<00:05:11.530> them<00:05:11.590> to<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:12.280> make

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
probably easier for them to to make

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.670 
probably easier for them to to make
stuff<00:05:13.360> similar<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:14.050> it<00:05:14.140> I<00:05:14.200> mean<00:05:14.290> as<00:05:14.410> you<00:05:14.440> can

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
stuff similar to it I mean as you can

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.110 
stuff similar to it I mean as you can
see<00:05:14.860> some<00:05:15.040> of<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.190> supercars<00:05:15.670> they<00:05:15.940> look

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
see some of the supercars they look

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.610 
see some of the supercars they look
really<00:05:16.330> similar<00:05:16.570> no<00:05:16.810> grand<00:05:16.990> they're<00:05:17.140> not<00:05:17.260> the

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
really similar no grand they're not the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.200 
really similar no grand they're not the
exact<00:05:17.920> same<00:05:18.070> thing<00:05:18.250> I'm<00:05:18.400> not<00:05:18.520> hating<00:05:18.730> on<00:05:18.970> them

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
exact same thing I'm not hating on them

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.900 
exact same thing I'm not hating on them
for<00:05:20.110> doing<00:05:20.200> that<00:05:20.440> because<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:21.310> DLCs<00:05:21.670> aren't

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
for doing that because the DLCs aren't

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.400 
for doing that because the DLCs aren't
the<00:05:22.000> same<00:05:22.120> thing<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.450> get<00:05:22.810> new<00:05:22.960> clothes<00:05:23.230> and

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
the same thing you get new clothes and

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.010 
the same thing you get new clothes and
everything<00:05:23.620> get<00:05:24.130> new<00:05:24.360> vehicles<00:05:25.360> even<00:05:25.960> though

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
everything get new vehicles even though

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.210 
everything get new vehicles even though
they<00:05:26.110> are<00:05:26.260> similar<00:05:26.710> they're<00:05:26.920> not<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.190> same

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
they are similar they're not the same

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.130 
they are similar they're not the same
but<00:05:27.640> yeah<00:05:27.790> that's<00:05:27.940> just<00:05:28.060> how<00:05:28.240> I<00:05:28.270> see<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.630> and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
but yeah that's just how I see it and

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.930 
but yeah that's just how I see it and
for<00:05:29.530> all<00:05:29.620> we<00:05:29.770> know<00:05:29.980> man<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.310> next<00:05:30.490> two<00:05:30.580> DLCs

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
for all we know man the next two DLCs

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.190 
for all we know man the next two DLCs
does<00:05:31.120> this<00:05:31.210> lowlife<00:05:31.540> or<00:05:31.720> low<00:05:31.810> rider<00:05:32.020> in<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
does this lowlife or low rider in the

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.150 
does this lowlife or low rider in the
stunt<00:05:32.440> school<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:32.680> could<00:05:32.770> be<00:05:32.920> completely

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
stunt school it could be completely

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.610 
stunt school it could be completely
different<00:05:33.340> but<00:05:33.910> it's<00:05:34.270> all<00:05:34.480> speculation<00:05:34.870> until

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
different but it's all speculation until

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.430 
different but it's all speculation until
obviously<00:05:36.520> we<00:05:36.730> see<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.060> like<00:05:37.660> always<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.290> then

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
obviously we see it like always and then

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.230 
obviously we see it like always and then
finally<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:38.980> last<00:05:39.010> question<00:05:39.550> from<00:05:39.700> Kyle<00:05:40.030> he

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
finally the last question from Kyle he

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.670 
finally the last question from Kyle he
says<00:05:40.419> would<00:05:40.780> you<00:05:40.840> recommend<00:05:41.320> spending<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
says would you recommend spending the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.380 
says would you recommend spending the

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
of money I mean even at the half off I

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.770 
of money I mean even at the half off I
bought<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:14.590> it<00:06:15.190> I've<00:06:15.880> never<00:06:15.910> used<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:16.510> you<00:06:16.660> know

bought it it I've never used it you know
there's<00:06:17.380> a<00:06:17.470> lot<00:06:17.620> of<00:06:17.650> stuff<00:06:17.919> in<00:06:18.010> the<00:06:18.130> game<00:06:18.250> that

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
there's a lot of stuff in the game that

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.490 
there's a lot of stuff in the game that
it's<00:06:18.550> cool<00:06:18.820> to<00:06:18.970> have<00:06:19.210> but<00:06:19.570> I<00:06:19.810> don't<00:06:20.080> think<00:06:20.230> it's

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
it's cool to have but I don't think it's

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.409 
it's cool to have but I don't think it's
worth<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:21.040> money<00:06:21.190> especially<00:06:22.030> if<00:06:22.090> you<00:06:22.210> are

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
worth the money especially if you are

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:24.240 
worth the money especially if you are
saving<00:06:23.200> up<00:06:23.440> I<00:06:23.590> would<00:06:23.800> definitely<00:06:23.919> recommend
