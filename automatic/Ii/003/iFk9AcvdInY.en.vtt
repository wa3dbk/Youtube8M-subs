00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.900
 in what 43 what do I know what the fuck you say 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.920
 Spanish tps indicates racing maps 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.559
 of 5 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.340
 this game information features x 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.480
 all the catches we go down 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.550
 until this part 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 these are the link are liquid 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.720
 changeable so if in some 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.090
 server that is in this v this in 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.000
 any of all somewhere that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.559
 it does not work that is not downloaded from 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.930
 another ready for example can lower the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.590
 part an idea that download it from 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.230
 here I would have face 4 from here and etc 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.510
 they are four three parts of 500 mb and now 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.880
 of 200 278 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.610
 We will order all the parts are 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.700
 four only 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.020
 and once the download I have 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.280
 downloaded to show you 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.260
 unfortunately for the video how 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.670
 download them without zinc as installed 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.900
 because if it does not take more time to download 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.230
 the game and so on 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.600
 good down the four parties once 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.180
 that the download to all that does not have 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.730
 no mistake no if you do not know how 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.070
 to download 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.190
 I reviewed my previous video as well as 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.720
 download from cÃ¡diz and in that video 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.960
 they were going to know how 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.850
 then we download once they are all 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.700
 the parts inside the folder without 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.750
 mistakes the four parts become 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.670

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.850

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.220

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.630
 of the folder they need a game 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.370
