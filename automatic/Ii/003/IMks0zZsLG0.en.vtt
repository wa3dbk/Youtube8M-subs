00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
range and precision all of the weapon

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.120 
range and precision all of the weapon
modifications<00:02:29.970> are<00:02:30.180> balanced<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:31.620> if<00:02:31.950> you

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
modifications are balanced so if you

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.890 
modifications are balanced so if you
were<00:02:32.250> creep<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.670> instance<00:02:33.000> enlightened<00:02:33.690> bold

were creep for instance enlightened bold
then<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.770> will<00:02:34.950> give<00:02:35.130> your<00:02:35.280> weapon<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.790> higher

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
then it will give your weapon a higher

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.720 
then it will give your weapon a higher
precision<00:02:36.450> but<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.530> trade-off<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
precision but the trade-off is that the

precision but the trade-off is that the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
rate of fire will be reduced likewise

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.450 
rate of fire will be reduced likewise
we'll<00:02:42.420> budget<00:02:42.750> lay<00:02:42.930> ammunition<00:02:43.590> increase

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
we'll budget lay ammunition increase

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.640 
we'll budget lay ammunition increase
damage<00:02:44.700> but<00:02:45.660> at<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.840> cost<00:02:46.140> of<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.470> higher

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
damage but at the cost of a higher

recoil<00:02:48.920> that's<00:02:49.920> all<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:50.660> remember<00:02:51.660> that

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
recoil that's all for now remember that

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.420 
recoil that's all for now remember that
