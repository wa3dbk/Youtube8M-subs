00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.950
 guys my name is trishin boris 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.600
 Viktorovich 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.059
 I am a teacher online learning center 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.389
 your point ru and we continue 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.309
 prepare for the math ege 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.039
 let's solve the following problem it 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.609
 usually b1 and such is the vital task 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.519
 before the task sounds so in the apartment where 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.680
 living alexey installed a counter for 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.080
 cold water flow measurement known 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 that on September 1, the meter showed consumption 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.930
 103 cubic meters and October 1 is still 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.090
 showed the flow rate of 114 cubic meters 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.180
 it is asked how many alexey will have 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.320
 pay for September ice for consumption 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.809
 water in September 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.309
 if the price of one cubic meter is 19 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.600
 rubles 20 kopecks 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.309
 Well, let's solve the problem in order 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 to understand how much will be needed 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.280
 pay for September need to count 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.449
 how much water did he spend in September 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.460
 yes it means it is necessary from testimony in October 1 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.369
 October deduct testimony September 1 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 this is exactly that month with 1 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 September to October 1 and that is exactly 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.470
 month that interests us 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.159
 this is the month of September for which he spent 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.090
 this water turns out we need from 114 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:27.530
 subtract 103 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 Well, it turns out 11 means 11 cubic meters 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.560
 he spent September 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.810
 but also to find out how much 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.700
 he needs to pay for these 11 cubic meters 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.579
 need 11 cubic meters multiplied by the price 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.060
 one cubic meter of this cold 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:54.930
 water at 19 rubles 20 kopecks that is 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.810
 19 2 here is the answer, that is, bring in rubles 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.659
 so here you need to calculate the value 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.420
 this value well let's calculate 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.700
 values ​​are easiest in my opinion but 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.129
 who wants can post who wants can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.619
 Essentially what the dream means is still number 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.780
 need to multiply by 11 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.860
 starts the number multiplied by 10 plus the number 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.610
 multiply by dy 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.019
 evil found multiply by 10 that's it so much 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.909
 yes because when multiplying by 10 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:28.280
 we transfer a comma by 1 character 192 plus 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:30.140
 this number is multiplied by 1 plus 19 and 20 here 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 let's add up the easiest thing to add 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.760
 19 2 how 19 kills almost 20 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.700
 let's add it here 20 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:43.209
 212 yes, but here up to 20 was not enough 08 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.780
 then it will be missing 08 to 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.720
 212 that is, 211 barely 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.569
 that's understandable 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.849
 get here so much we can just 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.430
 certainly add 92 add 19 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.840
 Two more prescribe but to whom how more 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.310
 like yes it's clear that you are 11 to 19 2 you 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.480
 somehow multiply that is the most 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.700
 the main thing is to understand how from the given tasks and here 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.769
 isolate the information that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.099
 required yes here's the first thing to understand 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.380
 that consumption for September is not at all 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.019
 this figure as you might think yes it is 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.980
 the difference between the values ​​in October and 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.160
 value in September because consumption 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.379
 103 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.970
 by the first of September this is how many 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.510
 the moment of establishment of the counter to 1 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.440
 September 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.780
 spent Alexei yes and 114 since 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.120
 installation of the counter before October 1, spent 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.359
 Alexei therefore the difference between these 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.319
 values just exactly how much water 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.359
 Alexey spent for September here we are all 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.280
 thought how much he is a builder for 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.540
 September multiplied by the price of one 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.840
 cubic meter of water got the answer 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.949
 211 and 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.430
 and 2 this is exactly what you need to write in the form 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.400
 replies 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.449
 guys I invite you to my classes 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.400
 preparing for the math e bbe part 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:09.949
 subscribe our channel on u tube to 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.579
 watch task parsing every day until
