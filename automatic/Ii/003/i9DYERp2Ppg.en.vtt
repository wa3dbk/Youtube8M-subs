00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
America when this is out or maybe if

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.200 
America when this is out or maybe if
it's<00:00:28.529> not<00:00:28.650> out<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:28.980> all<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.580> no<00:00:29.609> idea<00:00:29.970> so

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
it's not out at all I have no idea so

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
it's not out at all I have no idea so
but<00:00:30.990> here<00:00:31.199> it's<00:00:31.500> still<00:00:31.710> pretty<00:00:31.859> new<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.489> I

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
but here it's still pretty new so I

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.830 
but here it's still pretty new so I
thought<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> would<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.210> review<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
thought I would do review because I

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.060 
thought I would do review because I
haven't<00:00:34.079> actually<00:00:34.260> seen<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.680> lot<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.920> people

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
haven't actually seen a lot of people

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
haven't actually seen a lot of people
talk<00:00:35.430> about<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.809> think<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.500> good

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
talk about this but I think it's a good

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.880 
talk about this but I think it's a good
idea<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.850> talk<00:00:39.059> about<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.890> it's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
idea to do talk about it because it's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.440 
idea to do talk about it because it's
quite<00:00:41.070> pricey<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.730> do<00:00:41.879> want<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.210> kind

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so first I'm gonna start with the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.939 
so first I'm gonna start with the
packaging<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.620> looks<00:00:55.770> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
packaging and this is what it looks like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.840 
packaging and this is what it looks like
so<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.430> classic<00:00:57.000> black<00:00:57.239> tube<00:00:57.800> this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
so a classic black tube this is just the

so a classic black tube this is just the
packaging<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> would<00:01:00.780> Brown<00:01:00.960> has<00:01:01.260> for

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680

I have is medium and I'm pretty sure

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
I have is medium and I'm pretty sure
that<00:01:20.939> they<00:01:21.060> only<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.570> three<00:01:21.840> colors<00:01:22.259> or

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that they only have three colors or

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.429 
that they only have three colors or
maybe<00:01:23.009> four<00:01:23.400> max<00:01:23.640> which<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.509> don't<00:01:25.080> think<00:01:25.259> is

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
maybe four max which I don't think is

enough<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> problem<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.210> every

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
enough that is a problem with every

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
don't have enough colors and that just

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.960 
don't have enough colors and that just
really<00:01:33.900> annoys<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.710> thank<00:01:35.250> God<00:01:35.430> medium

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
really annoys me but thank God medium

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.490 
really annoys me but thank God medium
does<00:01:36.150> suit<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.509> pretty<00:01:36.750> well<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
does suit me pretty well it's not a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.370 
does suit me pretty well it's not a
perfect<00:01:38.009> match<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.490> still<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.720> does<00:01:39.990> suit<00:01:40.229> my

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
perfect match but still it does suit my

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.870 
perfect match but still it does suit my
skin<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.070> quite<00:01:41.400> nicely

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
skin and quite nicely

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.289 
skin and quite nicely
this<00:01:42.150> comes<00:01:42.420> with<00:01:42.570> SPF<00:01:43.200> 35<00:01:43.619> which<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.610> good<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this comes with SPF 35 which is good and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
this comes with SPF 35 which is good and
it's<00:01:46.020> pretty<00:01:46.290> high<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.860> BB<00:01:47.100> cream<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it's pretty high for a BB cream so I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.039 
it's pretty high for a BB cream so I
think<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.210> it's<00:01:48.329> definitely<00:01:48.450> good<00:01:48.899> you

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
think that it's definitely good you

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780 
think that it's definitely good you
don't<00:01:49.229> need<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.500> wear<00:01:49.649> sunblock<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.369> drill<00:01:50.610> or

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
don't need to wear sunblock and drill or

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.929 
don't need to wear sunblock and drill or
anything<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.020> there<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:52.950> 40<00:01:53.460> ml<00:01:53.670> in

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
anything like that and there is 40 ml in

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.719 
anything like that and there is 40 ml in
the<00:01:54.090> tube<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.380> would<00:01:55.649> say<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.250> does<00:01:56.520> run<00:01:56.700> out

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the tube and I would say it does run out

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.209 
the tube and I would say it does run out
pretty<00:01:57.060> quickly<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.799> for<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> money<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.100> you

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
pretty quickly so for the money that you

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.080 
pretty quickly so for the money that you
pay<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.909> have<00:01:59.939> no<00:02:00.329> idea<00:02:00.570> how<00:02:00.659> much

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
pay I have no idea how much

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.740 
pay I have no idea how much
was<00:02:01.380> around<00:02:02.380> 30<00:02:02.799> pounds<00:02:03.280> maybe<00:02:03.460> 28<00:02:03.820> something

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
was around 30 pounds maybe 28 something

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.450 
was around 30 pounds maybe 28 something
like<00:02:04.899> that<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.530> sure<00:02:05.740> it's<00:02:05.920> different<00:02:06.100> like

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
like that I'm sure it's different like

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.059 
like that I'm sure it's different like
an<00:02:06.789> every<00:02:07.030> store<00:02:07.299> but<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:08.860> money<00:02:09.009> that

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
an every store but for the money that

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.580 
an every store but for the money that
you<00:02:09.190> pay<00:02:09.459> I<00:02:09.489> would<00:02:09.910> say<00:02:10.149> it's<00:02:10.539> pricey<00:02:11.019> because

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
you pay I would say it's pricey because

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.860 
you pay I would say it's pricey because
this<00:02:11.950> runs<00:02:12.280> out<00:02:12.400> really<00:02:12.730> quickly<00:02:12.970> there's<00:02:13.569> not

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
this runs out really quickly there's not

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.979 
this runs out really quickly there's not
too<00:02:14.410> much<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.950> tube<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.720> definitely<00:02:16.720> do

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
too much in the tube so definitely do

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.600 
too much in the tube so definitely do
kind<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.290> keep<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.680> mind<00:02:17.950> now<00:02:18.280> for<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
kind of keep that mind now for the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.670 
kind of keep that mind now for the
coverage<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.150> would<00:02:19.299> say<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:19.629> gives<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.110> light

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
coverage I would say this gives a light

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.619 
coverage I would say this gives a light
to<00:02:21.099> medium<00:02:21.310> coverage<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.970> can<00:02:22.120> build<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.480> up

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
to medium coverage you can build it up

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.710 
to medium coverage you can build it up
to<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:23.019> kind<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.069> proper<00:02:24.489> medium<00:02:24.879> but<00:02:25.209> you<00:02:25.599> would

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
to a kind of proper medium but you would

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.080 
to a kind of proper medium but you would
never<00:02:25.930> get<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.769> full<00:02:27.250> coverage<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.849> I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
never get a full coverage with this I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.630 
never get a full coverage with this I
mean<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.269> can<00:02:28.480> try<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.720> put<00:02:29.560> five<00:02:29.830> layers<00:02:30.160> but

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
mean you can try to put five layers but

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
mean you can try to put five layers but
still<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:31.750> going<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:31.930> look<00:02:32.019> cakey<00:02:32.260> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
still it's going to look cakey and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.110 
still it's going to look cakey and
you're<00:02:33.010> never<00:02:33.190> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.430> achieve<00:02:33.579> full

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
you're never going to achieve full

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.000 
you're never going to achieve full
coverage<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:34.750> then<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.989> isn't<00:02:35.140> any<00:02:35.410> green<00:02:35.680> so

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
coverage but then it isn't any green so

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.520 
coverage but then it isn't any green so
you<00:02:36.400> really<00:02:37.000> shouldn't<00:02:37.269> expect<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.959> be<00:02:38.170> too

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you really shouldn't expect it to be too

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.190 
you really shouldn't expect it to be too
covering<00:02:39.099> so<00:02:39.569> definitely<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.660> conceived<00:02:41.049> is<00:02:41.170> a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
covering so definitely a conceived is a

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.900 
covering so definitely a conceived is a
must<00:02:41.530> if<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.799> have<00:02:41.890> acne<00:02:42.069> under-eye<00:02:42.700> circles

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
must if you have acne under-eye circles

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.940 
must if you have acne under-eye circles
or<00:02:43.480> just<00:02:43.750> any<00:02:43.840> problems<00:02:44.200> with<00:02:44.319> your<00:02:44.440> skin<00:02:44.620> this

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
or just any problems with your skin this

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.009 
or just any problems with your skin this
is<00:02:45.010> not<00:02:45.160> going<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.519> come<00:02:45.640> down<00:02:45.790> at<00:02:45.910> all<00:02:46.060> but<00:02:46.810> in

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
is not going to come down at all but in

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.319 
is not going to come down at all but in
general<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.739> wear<00:02:48.040> one<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.489> two<00:02:48.819> layers<00:02:49.000> it

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
general if you wear one or two layers it

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.150 
general if you wear one or two layers it
does<00:02:49.480> even<00:02:49.720> out<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.110> complexion<00:02:50.230> makes<00:02:51.010> you

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
does even out the complexion makes you

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
does even out the complexion makes you
look<00:02:51.310> very<00:02:51.519> fresh<00:02:51.819> very<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:53.110> kind<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.379> evens

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
look very fresh very just kind of evens

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.229 
look very fresh very just kind of evens
out<00:02:53.739> your<00:02:53.799> skin<00:02:53.920> tone<00:02:54.280> which<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.489> always<00:02:54.910> good

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
out your skin tone which is always good

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.530 
out your skin tone which is always good
and<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.620> finish<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.310> actually<00:02:57.849> think<00:02:58.299> this

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
and for the finish I actually think this

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.119 
and for the finish I actually think this
gives<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.989> matte<00:02:59.349> finish

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
gives a matte finish

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.390 
gives a matte finish
I<00:03:00.160> mean<00:03:00.690> maybe<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.349> me<00:03:02.560> that's<00:03:03.099> kind<00:03:03.370> of

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
I mean maybe just for me that's kind of

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.000 
I mean maybe just for me that's kind of
how<00:03:03.579> I<00:03:03.610> see<00:03:04.000> it<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:04.390> definitely<00:03:05.019> first<00:03:05.769> when

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
how I see it but definitely first when

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.860 
how I see it but definitely first when
you<00:03:06.100> apply<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.609> feels<00:03:06.850> like<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.030> gel<00:03:07.480> it's

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
you apply it it feels like a gel it's

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.840 
you apply it it feels like a gel it's
not<00:03:08.109> too<00:03:08.319> creamy<00:03:08.560> it's<00:03:08.920> kind<00:03:09.130> of<00:03:09.190> sticky<00:03:09.639> for

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
not too creamy it's kind of sticky for

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.629 
not too creamy it's kind of sticky for
me<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.150> get<00:03:10.359> a<00:03:10.510> matte<00:03:10.780> finish<00:03:11.139> which<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.889> think

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
me to get a matte finish which I think

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.490 
me to get a matte finish which I think
it's<00:03:12.790> good<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.030> BB<00:03:13.450> cream<00:03:13.660> because<00:03:13.870> most<00:03:14.350> of

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it's good for BB cream because most of

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.589 
it's good for BB cream because most of
them<00:03:14.620> are<00:03:14.769> really<00:03:15.010> oily<00:03:15.280> and<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.209> throughout

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
them are really oily and just throughout

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.270 
them are really oily and just throughout
the<00:03:16.750> day<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.930> don't<00:03:17.349> know<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.560> few<00:03:17.709> hours<00:03:17.889> you

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
the day I don't know in a few hours you

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.860 
the day I don't know in a few hours you
end<00:03:18.459> up<00:03:18.579> with<00:03:18.670> an<00:03:18.790> oily<00:03:18.940> face<00:03:19.239> which<00:03:19.510> is<00:03:19.660> not

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
end up with an oily face which is not

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.650 
end up with an oily face which is not
good<00:03:20.049> well<00:03:20.769> unless<00:03:21.099> you<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.280> dry<00:03:21.549> skin<00:03:21.660> so

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
good well unless you have dry skin so

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.930 
good well unless you have dry skin so
for<00:03:23.470> me<00:03:23.590> this<00:03:23.889> is<00:03:24.069> good<00:03:24.280> because<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.609> have

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
for me this is good because I have

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.330 
for me this is good because I have
normal<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.660> combination<00:03:25.840> skin<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:26.799> I<00:03:26.829> do<00:03:26.980> get

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
normal to combination skin so I do get

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.580 
normal to combination skin so I do get
oily<00:03:27.700> sometimes<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.780> really<00:03:29.139> does<00:03:29.380> help

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
oily sometimes and this really does help

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.120 
oily sometimes and this really does help
to<00:03:29.709> stop<00:03:30.010> that<00:03:30.810> for<00:03:31.810> dry<00:03:32.079> skin<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.709> would<00:03:32.919> not

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
to stop that for dry skin I would not

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.940 
to stop that for dry skin I would not
commend<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.579> because<00:03:34.290> it's<00:03:35.290> just<00:03:35.530> too<00:03:35.769> much

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
commend it because it's just too much

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.099 
commend it because it's just too much
I<00:03:36.010> think<00:03:36.280> unless<00:03:36.639> your<00:03:37.000> dry<00:03:37.239> skin<00:03:37.569> is<00:03:37.750> not<00:03:37.900> too

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
I think unless your dry skin is not too

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.069 
I think unless your dry skin is not too
flaky<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:38.889> just<00:03:39.760> very<00:03:40.060> kind<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.389> obvious<00:03:40.780> dry

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
flaky and just very kind of obvious dry

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.780 
flaky and just very kind of obvious dry
you<00:03:41.410> can<00:03:41.560> get<00:03:41.709> away<00:03:41.829> with<00:03:42.040> wearing<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:42.459> but

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
you can get away with wearing this but

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.210 
you can get away with wearing this but
if<00:03:42.910> it's<00:03:43.120> proper<00:03:43.540> proper<00:03:43.840> dry<00:03:44.049> this<00:03:44.829> would<00:03:45.069> not

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
if it's proper proper dry this would not

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.650 
if it's proper proper dry this would not
be<00:03:45.430> too<00:03:45.609> good<00:03:45.819> I'm<00:03:46.030> sure<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.450> is

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
be too good I'm sure this is

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.780 
be too good I'm sure this is
moisturizing<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.829> does<00:03:47.980> have<00:03:48.190> hydrating

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
moisturizing like it does have hydrating

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.240 
moisturizing like it does have hydrating
properties<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:50.079> it's<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:50.680> going<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.919> dry<00:03:51.010> your

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
properties so it's not going to dry your

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.909 
properties so it's not going to dry your
skin<00:03:51.280> even<00:03:51.700> more<00:03:51.849> but<00:03:52.810> definitely<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.650> finish

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
skin even more but definitely the finish

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.650 
skin even more but definitely the finish
that<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.160> gave<00:03:54.310> them<00:03:54.459> how<00:03:54.639> it<00:03:54.790> looks<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.329> does

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
that it gave them how it looks it does

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.050 
that it gave them how it looks it does
look<00:03:55.870> matte<00:03:56.139> so<00:03:56.500> for<00:03:57.130> oily<00:03:57.340> skin<00:03:57.430> normal

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
look matte so for oily skin normal

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.759 
look matte so for oily skin normal
combination<00:03:58.329> it's<00:03:58.750> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.019> perfect<00:03:59.440> for

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
combination it's going to be perfect for

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.039 
combination it's going to be perfect for
dry<00:03:59.859> skin<00:04:00.250> maybe<00:04:00.819> not<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.450> dries<00:04:01.660> out<00:04:01.810> really

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
dry skin maybe not it dries out really

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.479 
dry skin maybe not it dries out really
quickly<00:04:02.290> when<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.620> apply<00:04:02.889> it<00:04:02.919> so<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.280> need<00:04:03.370> to

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
quickly when you apply it so you need to

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.309 
quickly when you apply it so you need to
blend<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:03.880> really<00:04:04.180> fast<00:04:04.540> otherwise<00:04:04.870> you're

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
blend it really fast otherwise you're

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.800 
blend it really fast otherwise you're
gonna<00:04:05.380> end<00:04:05.590> up<00:04:05.739> patchy<00:04:06.000> which<00:04:07.000> it's<00:04:07.630> not<00:04:07.750> a

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
gonna end up patchy which it's not a

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.020 
gonna end up patchy which it's not a
problem<00:04:07.989> for<00:04:08.109> me<00:04:08.410> but<00:04:08.799> I<00:04:09.010> mean<00:04:09.280> if<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:09.730> really

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
problem for me but I mean if you really

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.320 
problem for me but I mean if you really
want<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.269> spend<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.629> time<00:04:10.719> that

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
want to spend the time that

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.870 
want to spend the time that
in<00:04:11.750> making<00:04:12.110> sure<00:04:12.350> that<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:13.070> jawline<00:04:13.310> kind<00:04:13.820> of

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
in making sure that the jawline kind of

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.390 
in making sure that the jawline kind of
hairline<00:04:14.330> it's<00:04:14.630> not<00:04:14.870> too<00:04:14.990> obvious<00:04:15.170> then<00:04:15.740> maybe

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
hairline it's not too obvious then maybe

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.640 
hairline it's not too obvious then maybe
it<00:04:16.970> might<00:04:17.150> be<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.390> bit<00:04:17.660> of<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.840> struggle<00:04:18.110> for<00:04:18.260> you

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
it might be a bit of a struggle for you

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.350 
it might be a bit of a struggle for you
so<00:04:18.890> definitely<00:04:19.310> do<00:04:19.489> try<00:04:19.730> to<00:04:19.760> blend<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.239> out

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
so definitely do try to blend it out

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.020 
so definitely do try to blend it out
really<00:04:20.660> quickly<00:04:20.930> even<00:04:21.410> though<00:04:21.560> it<00:04:21.950> does<00:04:22.340> look

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
really quickly even though it does look

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.400 
really quickly even though it does look
matte<00:04:23.330> at<00:04:23.600> first

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
matte at first

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.840 
matte at first
throughout<00:04:24.890> the<00:04:25.040> date<00:04:25.250> becomes<00:04:25.460> more

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
throughout the date becomes more

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.730 
throughout the date becomes more
natural-looking<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:26.900> that<00:04:27.140> is<00:04:27.260> definitely<00:04:27.470> a

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
natural-looking so that is definitely a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.370 
natural-looking so that is definitely a
plus<00:04:28.010> also<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.030> wanted<00:04:29.330> to<00:04:29.450> mention<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:29.870> the

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
plus also I wanted to mention that the

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.060 
plus also I wanted to mention that the
color<00:04:31.060> don't<00:04:32.060> kind<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.390> look<00:04:32.600> at<00:04:32.810> how<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.170> looks

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
color don't kind of look at how it looks

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.190 
color don't kind of look at how it looks
when<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.150> first<00:04:35.360> comes<00:04:35.660> out<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.960> tube

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
when it first comes out of the tube

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.020 
when it first comes out of the tube
because<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.800> looks<00:04:36.980> a<00:04:37.130> lot<00:04:37.280> lighter<00:04:37.520> than<00:04:37.760> it

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
because it looks a lot lighter than it

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.050 
because it looks a lot lighter than it
will<00:04:38.240> become<00:04:38.600> later<00:04:38.870> on<00:04:39.170> because<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.400> don't

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
will become later on because I don't

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.390 
will become later on because I don't
know<00:04:41.300> if<00:04:41.360> this<00:04:41.480> is<00:04:41.510> oil<00:04:41.810> free<00:04:41.960> or<00:04:42.710> not<00:04:43.040> it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
know if this is oil free or not it

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.870 
know if this is oil free or not it
doesn't<00:04:43.640> actually<00:04:43.700> say<00:04:45.520> yeah<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.550> don't<00:04:46.790> know

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
doesn't actually say yeah I don't know

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.940 
doesn't actually say yeah I don't know
if<00:04:46.940> it's<00:04:47.090> oil<00:04:47.330> free<00:04:47.420> but<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.020> does<00:04:48.050> oxidize<00:04:48.440> on

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
if it's oil free but it does oxidize on
