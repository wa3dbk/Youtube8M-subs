series<00:00:47.219> by<00:00:47.399> Rick<00:00:47.610> Yancey<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:48.390> specifically

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
series by Rick Yancey more specifically

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
series by Rick Yancey more specifically
the<00:00:49.110> curse<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.590> Wendigo<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the curse of the Wendigo which is the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
the curse of the Wendigo which is the
second<00:00:51.149> book<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> series<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.050> thought<00:00:52.170> that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
second book in the series I thought that

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
second book in the series I thought that
book<00:00:52.620> was<00:00:52.829> particularly<00:00:53.340> graphic<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
book was particularly graphic and

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.069 
book was particularly graphic and
horrifying

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
horrifying

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
horrifying
I<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.350> believe<00:00:55.469> horror<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.280> big

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
I don't believe horror is very big

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
I don't believe horror is very big
within<00:00:57.180> young<00:00:57.570> adult<00:00:57.840> genre<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.590> that's<00:00:58.800> one

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
within young adult genre so that's one

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.010 
within young adult genre so that's one
reason<00:00:59.370> why<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.910> should<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.390> turned<00:01:00.600> into<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
reason why it should be turned into a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.170 
reason why it should be turned into a
film<00:01:01.350> also<00:01:01.649> set<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.370> late<00:01:02.579> 19th<00:01:03.030> century

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
film also set in the late 19th century

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.420 
film also set in the late 19th century
so<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> think<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.229> costume<00:01:04.680> design<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
so I think the costume design and the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.429 
so I think the costume design and the
setting<00:01:05.760> would<00:01:05.880> look<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.390> fantastic<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
setting would look really fantastic and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.929 
setting would look really fantastic and
I<00:01:07.530> immediately<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> Benedict

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
I immediately think of Benedict

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
I immediately think of Benedict
Cumberbatch<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> believe<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.020> Monster<00:01:10.290> mala

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
Cumberbatch to believe in Monster mala

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
Cumberbatch to believe in Monster mala
jizz<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.189> he<00:01:11.310> would<00:01:11.430> be<00:01:11.549> fantastic<00:01:12.270> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
jizz I think he would be fantastic in

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
jizz I think he would be fantastic in
that<00:01:12.630> role<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.159> neurolytic<00:01:14.670> he

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that role because of how neurolytic he

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
that role because of how neurolytic he
is<00:01:15.270> as<00:01:15.750> Sherlock<00:01:16.320> Holmes<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.220> dark

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
is as Sherlock Holmes it's just a dark

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
is as Sherlock Holmes it's just a dark

give it to lock and key by Joe Hill and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.830 
give it to lock and key by Joe Hill and
Gabriel<00:01:46.950> Rodriguez<00:01:47.640> initially<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.720> was

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
Gabriel Rodriguez initially it was

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.590 
Gabriel Rodriguez initially it was
proposed<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.470> be<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.890> TV<00:01:50.310> series<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.390> got

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
proposed to be a TV series but that got

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.969 
proposed to be a TV series but that got
canned<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.799> pretty

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
canned I think it would be pretty

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.560 
canned I think it would be pretty
challenging<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.210> graphic

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
challenging because of the graphic

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.690 
challenging because of the graphic
nature<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> series<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.610> many

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
nature of the series but there's so many

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.270 
nature of the series but there's so many
cool<00:01:57.090> things<00:01:57.119> within<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.960> story<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.710> love

Klein<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.590> those<00:02:06.770> would<00:02:07.010> be<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.370> cold

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
Klein I think those would be so cold

turns into a film when I was reading it
it<00:02:09.950> was<00:02:10.070> like<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.580> movie<00:02:10.970> playing<00:02:11.210> in<00:02:11.360> my<00:02:11.540> head

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
it was like a movie playing in my head

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.630 
it was like a movie playing in my head

Scott<00:02:20.660> Pilgrim<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.740> think<00:02:22.310> Edgar<00:02:22.520> Wright

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
Scott Pilgrim and I think Edgar Wright

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.180 
Scott Pilgrim and I think Edgar Wright
would<00:02:23.270> be<00:02:23.300> really<00:02:23.840> cool<00:02:24.020> as<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> director<00:02:24.860> he<00:02:24.890> of

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
would be really cool as a director he of

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.130 
would be really cool as a director he of
course<00:02:25.430> directed<00:02:26.120> Shaun<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> Dead<00:02:26.720> and

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
course directed Shaun of the Dead and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.590 
course directed Shaun of the Dead and
Hot<00:02:27.290> Fuzz<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:27.950> I<00:02:28.190> think<00:02:28.550> if<00:02:28.970> ready<00:02:29.240> player<00:02:29.570> one

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
Hot Fuzz so I think if ready player one

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.050 
Hot Fuzz so I think if ready player one
was<00:02:30.110> directed<00:02:30.770> by<00:02:30.800> Edgar<00:02:31.160> Wright<00:02:31.550> I<00:02:31.820> think

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
was directed by Edgar Wright I think

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.880 
was directed by Edgar Wright I think

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
that would be fantastic and making

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.530 
that would be fantastic and making
