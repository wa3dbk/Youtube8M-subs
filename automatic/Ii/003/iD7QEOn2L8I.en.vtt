00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 good evening dear people and welcome 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.339
 at a small promotion video like 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.340
 you know, maybe, you are developing 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.139
 Fleischer community continues to grow 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.420
 if the actual simulator those the 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.460
 most at the moment the fsx already use 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.820
 is getting a little older there are 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.170
 always many solutions around 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.029
 emerging problems a bit too 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.890
 fix the flight simulator a bit 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.990
 more beautiful and of course 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.580
 this year of flight simulation always 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.180
 a little bit further to live on 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.310
 receive 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.199
 I'm over a few weeks ago 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.940
 very interesting thing I encountered 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.770
 you like in this video a bit 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.540
 want to bring closer and although the ifs 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.910
 cloud the ifs cloud 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.620
 I have that on a news page for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.890
 the flight simulation discovers to more or 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.020
 less on the edge than a beta project 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 and I have the whole course directly 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.710
 have a look 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.750
 You know, I'm so much back then 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.579
 over muddy flew partly a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 bit about fs open or over 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.190
 selfoss server sometimes from thomas or 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.739
 in the end then often times from 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.949
 Thomas and I have never been that way 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.330
 happy because of course I'm only with 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.820
 friends could fly with the people 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.979
 i also invited i had 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 always looking for a solution sometimes 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.570
 just a lot of people together 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.150
 to fly without just this compulsion too 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.390
 have funk memorizing procedures too 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.060
 can or just on the teamspeak two 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.240
 to be like it is, for example 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.460
 is common practice and there I have 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.200
 just coincidentally discovered the ifs cloud 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.820
 and ifs cloud you can do it that way 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.579
 Imagine how to intervene between 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.189
 the cell forest with infinite 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.920
 Freedoms and a regulated but 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.409
 stable solution such as ev 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.990
 ifs cloud the right in between and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.720
 offers you the possibility in the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.270
 singleplayer on a secure 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.759
 a stable server to connect where 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.680
 at least 50 people a day 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.229
 and night are online and on the whole 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.700
 scattered world yes and much more 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.979
 You do not really have to know one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.299
 the software loads under connected 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.979
 in the singleplayer and then there is 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.210
 actually already going on if you are 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.429
 then on the big server with the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.530
 all the people around it a 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.360
 usually when you sport in frankfurt 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.330
 then really a lot going on and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.240
 then you can 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.870
 you have no problem with somehow 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.270
 fence one's nerves or with them 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.190
 again to be kicked too 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.830
 can do as you like and if 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.200
 someone is the more civilized flies 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.270
 and the problem is that other people 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800
 Annoy then you can hide that too 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.990
 but less to the technical 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.280
 details you can on the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.160
 see for yourself 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.530
 In any case, yes, the cloud is for me 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.550
 a great possibility was also a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.960
 discover new community and briefly 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.630
 after I made the first video 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.880
 have and also the tutorial that yes 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.830
 maybe not quite like that anymore 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.920
 current tutorial but still 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.470
 valid tutorials cloud there has me 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.390
 someone wrote from a virtual 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.600
 airline from a virtual he land the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.550
 just on the fs cloud is active and indeed 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.170
 want the virtual airline air berlin 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.760
 world and they have the boys of the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.620
 airberlin world asked me if 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.570
 I stop by at the teamspeak 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.220
 I would like to and the whole thing times 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.510
 wants to explain a bit and also 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.370
 I would like to fly with them 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.900
 and I noticed very quickly 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.280
 after a bit with them 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.980
 I flew that is a great 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.200
 community is and that 's super nice 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.410
 People and competent people are the ones 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.450
 one here maybe one quite 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.100
 offer new multiplayer experience and 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.870
 I've also become a relatively fast member 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.209
 because I just enjoyed it 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.840
 which fly over the cloud more often 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.519
 and on their teamspeak and have me 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.530
 thought yes how can it do it 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:52.420
 the ifs cloud and of course the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.940
 guys the airberlin world virtual 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.019
 airline a bit to promote and that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.500
 I want to be here now in this video 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.730
 do 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.630
 I have a little something about the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.970
 klaut talked and yes I would like 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.709
 of course push a bit here as well 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.440
 as far as it is possible for me 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.989
 but also the guys of the virtual airline 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.910
 I would like to air Berlin here at this 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.350
 point mentioned for me within the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.060
 Last weeks also a completely new 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.459
 I have designed homepage after me 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.010
 noticed you have the old homepage of 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.900
 which is no longer necessarily to 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.060
 representative and of course not 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.840
 absolutely nice to new member 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.010
 to recruit 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.210
 and since I have time 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.740
 set and if you down the the 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.530
 description looks you can find next to the 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.720
 link for the fs cloud in itself too 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.960
 link to this homepage I for the 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.850
 guys the ss cloud and it will be fine 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.250
 airline air berlin 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.870
 if you look at it you see 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.460
 a little bit of the sense of the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.350
 virtual air line so a small 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.100
 Join a small community 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.170
 within it, it steals one 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.270
 Helps with technical questions but 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.650
 Of course, also ready if mine 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.370
 Round Fly wants to meet a few people 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.340
 and a nice community and also 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.810
 a nice community for discussion 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.940
 there it is, be it technical or general 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.130
 and I hope this site succeeds 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.430
 now a bit more representative too 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.600
 be for the virtual airline and 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.260
 Of course, maybe a bit 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.780
 for the ifs cloud itself and I want to 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.170
 bring you a little closer 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.490
 Just give it a hint 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.500
 if you look for one 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.840
 Solution looks for the multiplayer 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.660
 really carefree to fly though 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.970
 beginner or expert then you are up 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.820
 the ss cloud right looks at you 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.710
 Just take a look and you will be relative 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.300
 Quick to remember that as you said if you 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.740
 Beginners are you the airs 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.970
 we are unsure but we would like that 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.820
 even if you have advanced 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.560
 you can find it with the rtc bot 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.900
 virtual air lines here really 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:58.660
 are perfectly organized and one 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.480
 diverse range of functions over one 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.820
 virtual web all over the support 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.830
 possibilities just the cloud a great 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.570
 basis to develop further in the 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.420
 multiplayer also in the flight simulation 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.700
 in itself and if you like one 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.200
 to have interesting German community 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.360
 Just look at the website 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.910
 accident also on the teamspeak the 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.190
 virtual airline air berlin been world 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:24.070
 usually yes I am yes 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.700
 Nobody so the advertising and in general 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:31.990
 anything big for other organization 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:35.320
 But I notice the flight simulator 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.780
 community is pretty fragmented 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.340
 partially in small groups 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.190
 bit bound to youtubechannel 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.449
 partially 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.389
 also a bit to the networks 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.740
 bound but find yourself here 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.460
 hopefully in the future a few more 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:53.580
 people together independently and with fun 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.800
 on the flight simulation and I hope 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.009
 after watching the thing a little bit closer 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.060
 that I have stopped by 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:04.919
 on the fs cloud and the vr berlin 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.630
 and who does not know that much yet 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.520
 about the fs stealing like that 

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.780
 Installation processes are the 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.699
 can also just below in the 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.009
 description look there you will find 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.900
 tutorial video of me what actually 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:17.520
 should cover the most important things 

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.220
 and if there are more questions 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.560
 Of course, here also like to be in 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.539
 the comments of the tutorial videos or 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.949
 the direct contact wants to have 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.660
 Just look at the team plays 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:29.039
 which is the cloud over her place 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.620
 everything in the description on the 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:34.039
 homepage and so on and I hope so 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.479
 could you guys with this little video 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:39.539
 new a new experience for the 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:42.770
 show multiplayer and also a bit 

00:07:39.539 --> 00:07:45.690
 the future of the fsx multiplayer were 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.840
 and a little something for the community 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:50.699
 do a bit of community 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.380
 operate together yes and in 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.479
 In this sense, I hope that one 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.220
 sometime and maybe soon 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:59.250
 also the virtual airs uncertain 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.430
 can do and you will sound 70 to 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.430
 denne
