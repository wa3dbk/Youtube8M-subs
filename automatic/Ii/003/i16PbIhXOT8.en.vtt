cool stuff in this map bat are pretty
awesome<00:00:22.369> glitches<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.580> found<00:00:23.970> earlier

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
awesome glitches that I found earlier

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.759 
awesome glitches that I found earlier
and<00:00:24.900> I've<00:00:25.080> done<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.880> out<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.090> math

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
and I've done this with the out of math

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.500 
and I've done this with the out of math
barriers<00:00:28.769> gone<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.789> if<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.060> don't<00:00:30.240> have<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.449> do

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
barriers gone so if you don't have to do

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
barriers gone so if you don't have to do
that<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:31.050> rush<00:00:31.260> mode<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.369> sure

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
that just going rush mode and make sure

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.270 
that just going rush mode and make sure
it<00:00:32.820> needs<00:00:33.000> more<00:00:33.420> players<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.260> plant<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
it needs more players and plant all the

it needs more players and plant all the
bombs<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> out<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.210> map<00:00:36.390> barriers<00:00:37.050> will<00:00:37.320> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
bombs and out of map barriers will be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380 
bombs and out of map barriers will be
going<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.129> side<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> my<00:00:38.820> barriers<00:00:39.239> are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
going and one side of my barriers are

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.700 
going and one side of my barriers are
going<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.020> able<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> place<00:00:40.500> the

how to do the mortar glitch all you need
to<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.719> push<00:00:58.020> start<00:00:58.469> hold<00:00:59.370> r1<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.629> hit

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
to do is push start hold r1 and hit
