00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.550 
and so well this thing's got a maximum
read<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> 220<00:01:30.299> megabytes<00:01:30.630> per<00:01:30.689> second<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.229> a

in<00:02:12.000> Taiwan<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.600> who<00:02:13.560> cares<00:02:13.770> who<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:17.610> warrant

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
in Taiwan so who cares who this warrant

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.440 
in Taiwan so who cares who this warrant
is<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.420> warranty<00:02:19.110> against<00:02:19.290> defects<00:02:20.450> honestly

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
is it warranty against defects honestly

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.390 
is it warranty against defects honestly
what<00:02:21.660> kind<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.960> camera<00:02:22.410> doesn't<00:02:23.040> let<00:02:23.220> you

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
what kind of camera doesn't let you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.820 
what kind of camera doesn't let you
record<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:24.600> when<00:02:24.930> it's<00:02:25.080> plugged<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.470> even<00:02:25.500> if

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
record like when it's plugged in even if

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.650 
record like when it's plugged in even if
the<00:02:25.890> battery's<00:02:26.190> flat<00:02:26.400> seriously<00:02:27.060> work<00:02:27.420> like

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the battery's flat seriously work like

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.480 
the battery's flat seriously work like
people<00:02:27.990> yeah<00:02:28.710> it's<00:02:28.800> fun<00:02:28.920> anyway<00:02:29.100> we'll<00:02:29.340> wait

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
people yeah it's fun anyway we'll wait

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.130 
people yeah it's fun anyway we'll wait
um<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.300> like<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> warranty<00:02:33.960> cuff

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
um so this is just like a warranty cuff

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.160 
um so this is just like a warranty cuff
particular<00:02:34.890> interesting<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:35.310> nice<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.610> have

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
particular interesting but nice to have

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.020 
particular interesting but nice to have
so<00:02:37.170> yeah<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.560> feels<00:02:37.740> fairly<00:02:38.520> solid<00:02:38.850> for<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
so yeah it feels fairly solid for a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.390 
so yeah it feels fairly solid for a
reliable<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.510> pretty<00:02:40.470> basic<00:02:40.650> obviously<00:02:41.220> well

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
reliable a pretty basic obviously well

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.590 
reliable a pretty basic obviously well
actually<00:02:41.610> a<00:02:41.790> spate<00:02:42.000> elaborate<00:02:42.330> supposed<00:02:42.540> to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
actually a spate elaborate supposed to

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.450 
actually a spate elaborate supposed to
go<00:02:42.720> little<00:02:43.230> rub<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.590> looks<00:02:43.860> kind<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.100> cool<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
go little rub it looks kind of cool and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.840 
go little rub it looks kind of cool and
then<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.390> course<00:02:45.420> we've<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:46.110> few<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:47.190> solve

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
then of course we've got a few we solve

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.150 
then of course we've got a few we solve
extra<00:02:48.150> bits<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.420> but<00:02:48.570> you<00:02:48.690> say<00:02:48.810> features<00:02:49.350> you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
extra bits as but you say features you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.110 
extra bits as but you say features you
could<00:02:50.280> wrap<00:02:50.400> something<00:02:50.550> around<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.940> guess

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
could wrap something around that I guess

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.910 
could wrap something around that I guess
if<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.360> want<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.720> over<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> laboratory

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
if you want to be over a laboratory

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.560 
if you want to be over a laboratory
round<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:53.910> which<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.120> clearly<00:02:54.420> what

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
round that in which is clearly what

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.880 
round that in which is clearly what
that's<00:02:54.720> meant<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:56.690> data<00:02:57.690> transfer<00:02:57.930> lights<00:02:58.560> or

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
that's meant for data transfer lights or

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.200 
that's meant for data transfer lights or
whatever<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.430> officially<00:02:59.790> called<00:02:59.970> I

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
whatever that is officially called I

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.640 
whatever that is officially called I
don't<00:03:00.270> know<00:03:00.600> should<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.900> google<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.320> did<00:03:01.500> not

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
don't know should I google it did not

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.550 
don't know should I google it did not
and<00:03:02.370> there's<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> few<00:03:03.150> logos<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:04.290> pretty

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
and there's a few logos and it's pretty

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.530 
and there's a few logos and it's pretty
simplistic<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.250> um<00:03:05.460> I<00:03:05.760> will<00:03:06.120> go<00:03:06.210> plug<00:03:06.420> it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
simplistic really um I will go plug it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.270 
simplistic really um I will go plug it
in<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.690> run<00:03:06.780> some<00:03:06.900> benchmarks<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.530> we'll<00:03:08.220> get

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
in and run some benchmarks and we'll get

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.790 
in and run some benchmarks and we'll get
back<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.550> my<00:03:10.970> right<00:03:11.970> guys<00:03:12.230> so<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.620> now

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
back to my right guys so we have now

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.190 
back to my right guys so we have now
retreated<00:03:14.520> my<00:03:14.640> computer<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.600> do<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> little<00:03:15.900> bit

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
retreated my computer to do a little bit

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.720 
retreated my computer to do a little bit
of<00:03:16.350> first<00:03:16.890> time<00:03:17.100> testing<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.520> this<00:03:17.640> thing<00:03:18.230> so

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
of first time testing on this thing so

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.190 
of first time testing on this thing so
just<00:03:20.730> say<00:03:20.910> sort<00:03:21.270> of<00:03:21.300> heads-up<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.870> mean<00:03:22.020> it's

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
just say sort of heads-up I mean it's

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.290 
just say sort of heads-up I mean it's
obviously<00:03:22.680> going<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:23.090> expected<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.150> all

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
obviously going to be expected with all

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.170 
obviously going to be expected with all
kinds<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.630> memory<00:03:25.170> devices<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:26.090> despite<00:03:27.090> this

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
kinds of memory devices but despite this

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.670 
kinds of memory devices but despite this
fact<00:03:27.330> being<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.570> 32<00:03:27.930> gigabyte<00:03:28.140> memory<00:03:28.350> stick

you<00:03:28.920> only<00:03:29.160> get<00:03:29.310> 29

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
you only get 29

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.110 
you only get 29

well no near enough 30 gig free because

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.430 
well no near enough 30 gig free because
the<00:03:33.840> SI<00:03:34.200> bastards<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.790> like<00:03:36.000> foxes<00:03:36.420> over<00:03:36.750> and

benchmarks<00:04:06.120> on<00:04:06.530> right<00:04:07.530> guys<00:04:07.910> so<00:04:08.910> I've<00:04:09.150> run

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
benchmarks on right guys so I've run

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.890 
benchmarks on right guys so I've run
three<00:04:09.540> tests<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.470> coarser<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:11.400> sick<00:04:11.640> and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
three tests on the coarser very sick and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.140 
three tests on the coarser very sick and
I've<00:04:12.900> also<00:04:13.110> run<00:04:13.290> tests<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.910> standard<00:04:14.910> kind

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
I've also run tests on a standard kind

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.270 
I've also run tests on a standard kind
of<00:04:15.270> USB<00:04:15.630> 2.0<00:04:15.959> very<00:04:16.140> sick<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:17.040> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
of USB 2.0 very sick and that is the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.960 
of USB 2.0 very sick and that is the
Kingston

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
Kingston

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.699 
Kingston
one<00:04:18.120> gigabyte<00:04:18.480> memory<00:04:18.600> stick<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.140> one<00:04:19.620> which

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
one gigabyte memory stick the one which

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.200 
one gigabyte memory stick the one which
everybody<00:04:20.130> seems<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.430> have<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.789> the<00:04:20.940> one<00:04:20.970> with

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
everybody seems to have is the one with

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.760 
everybody seems to have is the one with
the<00:04:21.270> white<00:04:21.419> case<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.930> everybody<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:22.620> here

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
the white case and everybody in here

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.050 
the white case and everybody in here
who's<00:04:22.979> been<00:04:23.010> the<00:04:23.250> education<00:04:23.640> system<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:23.970> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
who's been the education system in the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.930 
who's been the education system in the
last<00:04:24.150> five<00:04:24.450> years<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.990> have<00:04:25.080> one

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
last five years to have one

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.200 
last five years to have one
so<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:28.020> can<00:04:28.110> probably<00:04:28.260> see<00:04:28.470> from<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> results

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
so you can probably see from the results

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.010 
so you can probably see from the results
I<00:04:30.210> mean<00:04:30.840> buddy<00:04:31.050> how<00:04:32.270> we've<00:04:33.270> got<00:04:33.510> peaking<00:04:33.930> at

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
I mean buddy how we've got peaking at

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
I mean buddy how we've got peaking at
230<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.040> even<00:04:35.970> at<00:04:36.090> lowest<00:04:36.420> it's<00:04:36.600> 225<00:04:37.200> I<00:04:37.530> mean

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
230 and even at lowest it's 225 I mean

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.140 
230 and even at lowest it's 225 I mean
the<00:04:38.850> box<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.210> quoting<00:04:39.570> 220<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.380> it's<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:41.190> mean

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
the box is quoting 220 so it's I mean

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.230 
the box is quoting 220 so it's I mean
it's<00:04:42.390> really<00:04:43.290> pretty<00:04:43.470> good<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.070> as<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
it's really pretty good and as to the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.820 
it's really pretty good and as to the
right<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.750> mean<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.110> only<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.320> little<00:04:46.440> under

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
right I mean it's only a little under

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.980 
right I mean it's only a little under
it's<00:04:47.160> about<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.430> box<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.880> going<00:04:48.090> 55<00:04:48.600> we're

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
it's about the box is going 55 we're

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.990 
it's about the box is going 55 we're
getting<00:04:49.140> between<00:04:49.590> 53<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.370> 52<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:52.730> mean<00:04:53.730> it's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
getting between 53 and 52 I mean it's

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.700 
getting between 53 and 52 I mean it's
pretty<00:04:54.360> damn<00:04:54.570> good<00:04:54.780> I<00:04:54.840> mean<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.140> don't<00:04:55.470> think

pretty damn good I mean I don't think

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.140 
pretty damn good I mean I don't think
you<00:04:55.830> get<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:55.980> real<00:04:56.160> idea<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.520> how<00:04:56.610> fast<00:04:56.880> that

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
you get a real idea of how fast that

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.120 
you get a real idea of how fast that
bloody<00:04:57.360> well<00:04:57.480> is<00:04:57.630> but<00:04:58.020> when<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.290> look<00:04:58.650> at<00:04:58.920> the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
bloody well is but when you look at the

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.530 
bloody well is but when you look at the
sequential<00:04:59.460> reading<00:04:59.730> rights<00:04:59.880> of<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.270> stander

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
sequential reading rights of the stander

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.870 
sequential reading rights of the stander
myristic<00:05:00.780> I'm<00:05:01.140> getting<00:05:01.530> let's<00:05:02.280> see<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.550> worse
