you're gonna get that high launch low
spin<00:00:35.969> trajectory<00:00:36.829> by<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.129> focusing<00:00:38.550> on

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
spin trajectory by really focusing on

the<00:00:38.760> feel<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.270> driver<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.200> we<00:00:40.320> went<00:00:40.530> away

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the feel of this driver and we went away

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
the feel of this driver and we went away
from<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> things<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
from a lot of the things like the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
from a lot of the things like the
adjustability<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.809> kind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> their<00:00:43.590> their

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
adjustability that kind of their their

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
adjustability that kind of their their
hindrances<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> design<00:00:45.090> process<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:46.200> by

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
hindrances in the design process by by

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
hindrances in the design process by by
keeping<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> very<00:00:47.219> traditional<00:00:47.550> very<00:00:48.120> clean

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
keeping it very traditional very clean

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.139 
keeping it very traditional very clean
we<00:00:48.960> were<00:00:49.079> able<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.530> focus<00:00:49.860> on<00:00:50.219> putting<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
we were able to focus on putting the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.639 
we were able to focus on putting the
weight<00:00:51.300> exactly<00:00:51.750> where<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.930> wanted<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> so

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
weight exactly where we wanted it to so

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
weight exactly where we wanted it to so
that<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.829> would<00:00:52.949> sound<00:00:53.190> proper<00:00:53.789> sound<00:00:54.059> very

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that it would sound proper sound very

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
that it would sound proper sound very
crisp<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.079> sound<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.949> hit<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> ball

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
crisp and it sound like you hit the ball

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760 
crisp and it sound like you hit the ball
really<00:00:56.550> hard<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.360> still<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.899> very<00:00:57.930> soft

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
really hard but still in a very soft

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.799 
really hard but still in a very soft
almost<00:00:58.980> muted<00:00:59.520> feel<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
almost muted feel so it you know it just

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
almost muted feel so it you know it just
feels<00:01:01.079> solid<00:01:01.440> feels<00:01:01.980> crisp<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.609> feels<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.969> an

driver<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:55.360> then<00:02:55.480> as<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.630> get<00:02:55.870> outside<00:02:56.050> of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
driver but then as you get outside of

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.560 
driver but then as you get outside of
that<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.310> central<00:02:57.940> area<00:02:58.030> on<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.420> Miss

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
that that that central area on the Miss

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.110 
that that that central area on the Miss
hits<00:02:58.810> just<00:02:59.380> there's<00:03:00.100> thinner<00:03:00.400> areas<00:03:00.880> that<00:03:01.000> are

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
hits just there's thinner areas that are

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.640 
hits just there's thinner areas that are
really<00:03:01.330> gonna<00:03:01.450> boost<00:03:01.750> those<00:03:01.990> ball<00:03:02.230> speeds<00:03:02.500> on

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
really gonna boost those ball speeds on

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.980 
really gonna boost those ball speeds on

MLI<00:03:07.480> what<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.959> does<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.440> when<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.650> when<00:03:09.340> you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
MLI what that does is when you when you

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.920 
MLI what that does is when you when you

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
course you want to hit it you know right

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.710 
course you want to hit it you know right
in<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.459> center<00:03:12.790> where<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.209> optimal

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
in the center where you get optimal

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
speed but as you go up if you go if you

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.770 
speed but as you go up if you go if you
hit<00:03:17.950> up<00:03:18.100> higher<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.670> face<00:03:18.880> if<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.570> club

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
hit up higher on the face if the club

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.870 
hit up higher on the face if the club
doesn't<00:03:19.989> have<00:03:20.200> a<00:03:20.230> good<00:03:20.500> vertical<00:03:20.769> mo<00:03:21.190> eye<00:03:21.220> then

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
doesn't have a good vertical mo eye then

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.610 
doesn't have a good vertical mo eye then
the<00:03:22.030> club's<00:03:22.269> gonna<00:03:22.450> rotate<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.989> lot<00:03:23.230> and<00:03:23.500> it's

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
the club's gonna rotate a lot and it's

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.229 
the club's gonna rotate a lot and it's
gonna<00:03:23.739> change<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.220> punch<00:03:24.489> characteristics

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
gonna change the punch characteristics

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.500 
gonna change the punch characteristics
by<00:03:25.750> keeping<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.320> strong<00:03:27.010> high<00:03:27.640> vertical<00:03:27.970> MLI

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
by keeping the strong high vertical MLI

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210 
by keeping the strong high vertical MLI
you<00:03:28.989> get<00:03:29.170> very<00:03:29.410> consistent<00:03:30.010> launch

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
you get very consistent launch

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.530 
you get very consistent launch
characteristics<00:03:30.850> regardless<00:03:31.269> of<00:03:31.360> where<00:03:31.450> you

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
characteristics regardless of where you

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.509 
characteristics regardless of where you
hit<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.750> on<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.930> face<00:03:32.110> up<00:03:32.350> and<00:03:32.500> now<00:03:32.650> so<00:03:33.280> one<00:03:33.430> of

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
hit it on the face up and now so one of

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.979 
hit it on the face up and now so one of
the<00:03:33.580> clever<00:03:33.820> things<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.239> did<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.540> save<00:03:34.720> weight

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
the clever things we did to save weight

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.780 
the clever things we did to save weight
on<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.590> we<00:03:35.739> use<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:35.980> chemical<00:03:36.280> etching

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
on this is we use a chemical etching

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.000 
on this is we use a chemical etching
process<00:03:37.330> well<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:38.019> it's<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.830> way<00:03:38.980> of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
process well that is it's it's a way of

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.190 
process well that is it's it's a way of
dipping<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.880> crown<00:03:40.120> into<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.690> chemical<00:03:41.110> that

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
dipping the crown into a chemical that

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.250 
dipping the crown into a chemical that
actually<00:03:41.590> fins<00:03:42.280> that<00:03:42.430> out<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.060> when<00:03:43.630> we<00:03:43.780> form

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
actually fins that out so when we form

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.229 
actually fins that out so when we form
this<00:03:44.440> head<00:03:44.709> and<00:03:44.950> actually<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.489> know<00:03:45.580> could

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
this head and actually you know could

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.660 
this head and actually you know could
make<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.780> crown<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.799> actually<00:03:48.250> starts<00:03:48.610> a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
make the crown it actually starts a

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.920 
make the crown it actually starts a
little<00:03:48.730> bit<00:03:48.940> thicker<00:03:49.180> but<00:03:49.480> we<00:03:49.570> want<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.840> get

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
little bit thicker but we want to get

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.170 
little bit thicker but we want to get
down<00:03:50.049> to<00:03:50.230> point<00:03:50.470> five<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.010> by<00:03:51.160> using<00:03:52.000> that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
down to point five so by using that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.490 
down to point five so by using that
chemical<00:03:52.570> etching<00:03:52.780> process<00:03:53.140> we're<00:03:53.260> able<00:03:53.350> to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
chemical etching process we're able to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.440 
chemical etching process we're able to
thin<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.830> out<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.549> central<00:03:54.940> portion<00:03:55.090> where

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
thin it out in the central portion where

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.759 
thin it out in the central portion where
it<00:03:55.480> doesn't<00:03:55.690> need<00:03:55.840> to<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.049> a<00:03:56.080> structurally

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
it doesn't need to be a structurally

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.350 
it doesn't need to be a structurally
rigid<00:03:57.160> we<00:03:57.489> can<00:03:57.610> get<00:03:57.700> it<00:03:57.790> down<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.060> 0.5

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
rigid we can get it down to 0.5

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.210 
rigid we can get it down to 0.5
millimeters<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.680> helps<00:03:59.920> lower<00:04:00.130> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
millimeters and that helps lower the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.800 
millimeters and that helps lower the
center<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:00.610> gravity<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.150> lower<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.480> spin<00:04:01.690> and

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
center of gravity and lower the spin and

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.850 
center of gravity and lower the spin and
the<00:04:01.900> performance<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.560> head

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.710 

it's<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:10.010> soft<00:04:10.400> sound<00:04:10.700> at<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.120> same<00:04:11.300> time<00:04:11.510> it's

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
it's a soft sound at the same time it's

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.480 
it's a soft sound at the same time it's
kind<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:11.990> got<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.170> little<00:04:12.319> piercing<00:04:12.680> quality<00:04:13.310> to

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:13.490 
kind of got a little piercing quality to

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.120 
kind of got a little piercing quality to
it<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:13.730> know<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:13.910> sounds<00:04:14.270> like<00:04:14.800> it's<00:04:15.800> very

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
it you know it sounds like it's very

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.430
