00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.190 
say at the time at the time I felt it
was<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:01.329> was<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.510> throwback

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
was it was a throwback

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.979 
was it was a throwback
really<00:04:02.859> to<00:04:03.069> what<00:04:03.280> David<00:04:04.120> Bowie<00:04:04.480> had<00:04:04.780> been

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
at that time would have been somebody

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.510 
at that time would have been somebody
more<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.419> Patti<00:04:31.900> Smith<00:04:32.380> for<00:04:32.680> example<00:04:32.740> and

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
more like Patti Smith for example and

in my critical career and I've learned
to<00:04:45.820> live<00:04:45.940> with<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.510> other<00:04:47.050> thing<00:04:47.169> I<00:04:47.500> wanted

to live with it the other thing I wanted
to<00:04:47.830> say<00:04:48.070> is<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.490> a<00:04:48.550> lot<00:04:48.910> of<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.539> music<00:04:49.840> that

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
to say is that a lot of the music that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.010 
to say is that a lot of the music that
Kate<00:04:50.500> Bush<00:04:50.770> has<00:04:50.979> done<00:04:51.010> since<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.970> time<00:04:52.389> I've

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
Kate Bush has done since that time I've

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.110 
Kate Bush has done since that time I've
it<00:04:54.039> I've<00:04:54.669> enjoyed<00:04:55.380> far<00:04:56.380> more<00:04:56.710> up<00:04:57.099> basically<00:04:57.789> at

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
it I've enjoyed far more up basically at

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.629 
it I've enjoyed far more up basically at
that<00:04:58.180> point<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:59.050> thought<00:04:59.380> there<00:04:59.740> were<00:04:59.949> too<00:05:00.490> many

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
that point I thought there were too many

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.120 
that point I thought there were too many
half-baked<00:05:01.389> dishes<00:05:01.960> being<00:05:02.289> served<00:05:02.740> in<00:05:03.099> the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
half-baked dishes being served in the

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.170 
half-baked dishes being served in the
hope<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:03.669> they'd<00:05:03.849> add<00:05:04.120> up<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.660> meal<00:05:05.020> and

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
hope that they'd add up to a meal and

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.399 
hope that they'd add up to a meal and
the<00:05:07.180> that<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.830> know<00:05:09.010> she<00:05:09.070> was<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:10.030> young<00:05:10.840> talent

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.409 
the that you know she was a young talent
