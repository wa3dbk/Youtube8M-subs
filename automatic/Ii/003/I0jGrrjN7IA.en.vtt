00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
stand in it mainly because your standing

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670

we're looking at it both you can stand

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.550 
we're looking at it both you can stand
in<00:02:05.030> width<00:02:05.270> by<00:02:05.450> lengthening<00:02:06.020> out<00:02:06.350> that

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
in width by lengthening out that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.249 
in width by lengthening out that
waterline<00:02:07.100> we<00:02:07.369> can<00:02:07.520> get<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> narrow<00:02:08.149> boat<00:02:08.509> that

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
waterline we can get a narrow boat that

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.949 
waterline we can get a narrow boat that
handles<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.709> lot<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.129> weight<00:02:10.390> but<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.660> super

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
handles a lot of weight but it's super

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.699 
handles a lot of weight but it's super
stable<00:02:12.379> because<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.160> length<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.360> that

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
stable because that length and that

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.140 
stable because that length and that
displacement<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:16.099> further<00:02:16.519> away<00:02:16.879> from<00:02:16.910> the
