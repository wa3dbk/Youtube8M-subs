00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's going to take up a lot of battery
and<00:01:54.420> if<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.750> were<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> throw<00:01:55.110> LT<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> mix

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and if you were to throw LT into the mix

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.910 
and if you were to throw LT into the mix
I'm<00:01:56.820> pretty<00:01:57.540> sure<00:01:57.810> it'll<00:01:58.049> start<00:01:58.380> draining<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I'm pretty sure it'll start draining the

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.490 
I'm pretty sure it'll start draining the
battery<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.640> fast<00:01:59.880> as<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.840> did<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
battery really fast as it did on the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.580 
battery really fast as it did on the
droid<00:02:01.740> DNA<00:02:02.189> which<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:03.420> had<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.290> low

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
droid DNA which really had a really low

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
droid DNA which really had a really low
battery<00:02:04.979> life<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.340> that's<00:02:05.579> mostly<00:02:05.969> due<00:02:06.180> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
battery life and that's mostly due to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
battery life and that's mostly due to
the<00:02:06.509> display<00:02:06.899> technology<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.099> they<00:02:08.250> decided

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
the display technology that they decided

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.880 
the display technology that they decided
to<00:02:08.819> use<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.119> hopefully<00:02:09.509> Sony<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.080> ZTE<00:02:10.560> or

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
to use but hopefully Sony and ZTE or

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.670 
to use but hopefully Sony and ZTE or
ziti<00:02:11.520> can<00:02:12.480> fix<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.900> battery

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
ziti can fix this battery

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.380 
ziti can fix this battery
