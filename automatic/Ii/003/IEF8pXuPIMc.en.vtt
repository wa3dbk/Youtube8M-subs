00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.390
 ivan basso as found the track of the new montichiari velodrome at 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.270
 covered 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.930
 but certainly a beautiful plant we were all impressed by that 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.020
 that the first sensations were made in mind or in time and in white snow 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.160
 to do it on 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.249
 really fantastic canapisa very smooth 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.319
 sliding a very very good wood 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:26.369
 emule or take advantage also l thank the managers and the whole 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.369
 Mayor 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.759
 in the aforementioned raw for allowing me to do these tests 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.129
 here you have come here to find some material to try 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.530
 riding position doing a series of tests and checks 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.260
 especially in view of the 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.980
 of the tiscali fox 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's say that in this is a period 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 parma relatively quiet so we took advantage for 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.710
 try the new new bicycle the new wheels in view of the vault 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.040
 2 stopwatch novellas that are there will be fundamental to the ranking as it is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.769
 born the need to come here to make fruit of the previous text what prompted you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.159
 why did you decide to 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.189
 questioning a Moden octopus riding a bicycle 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.220
 why 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.320
 Italian flags I was not satisfied with the time trial ehm 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.470
 I am convinced instead of being able to go to much stronger then 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 to make tests that have a meaning you have to do them in the absence of 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.660
 wind therefore not covered velodrome 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.020
 and I am very happy to be here to hear this 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.630
 day tarra 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.810
 . put the bike in place over the next two months 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.730
 with the right trim for the voice 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.970
 calculates the end of this day yesterday cavat turbo directions 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.500
 but I believe that more than anything else they are the answers that they give you 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.149
 more safety and then I believe that the specialty of the chronometer 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.440
 as well as 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.929
 to prepare the septum however the aerodynamics 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.679
 we need to work more I believe that in the next two months we have 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.509
 much more time compared 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.969
 now the approach to the tour of Italy also now 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.229
 give a lot of attention to this specialty 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.170
 explain to me that you have tried to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.120
 so find a meeting point between aerodynamics and power this 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.069
 meeting was reached 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.029
 sire net 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.219
 if it exists, I look at the dynamics very clearly, but it is not necessary 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.819
 lose sight of 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.769
 quantum pushes on the road bike compared with the stopwatch then 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.370
 you need to find one 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.239
 an optimal balance 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.339
 taranto earth in copper 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:45.779
 very mission site 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.409
 beat 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.419
 but you are watching the tour de frans from afar you know studio franza the two 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:57.599
 High active podiums as you see who you think will really be the man to beat 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.229
 and maybe a possible will be soon 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.829
 but difficult 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.429
 but I believe that 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.669
 not since the first stopwatch of the first day we have seen that 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:11.879
 all the less favored favorites are a last format starting from the countryside 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.780
 it will not be a tour to I believe that contador clearly has favors from 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.329
 prediction, however, the same charm and all the other favorites were 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.769
 all very good and 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.430
 will be open tour
