00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello everybody too this week who 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.480
 send it cool, too, arriving in Brazil 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.560
 June 12 is celebrated the day of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.510
 boyfriends 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.700
 so thinking about it I decided to make a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.250
 very special video in commemoration of the day 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 and when successful 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.930
 boyfriends I think of things very cute 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
 better maintained and it is obvious that it can not 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
 missing per share in cash 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.570
 so how can you see here a 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.310
 a little different 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 exactly this effect that I'm going to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
 Teach you how to do I'll teach you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.189
 is already done in the heart without the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.200
 your photos or your videos 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.300
 today there are several applications where 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.790
 you may have the same kind of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.980
 effect but I'll teach you how to do 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.770
 this manually directly into your 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.289
 camera is easy and quickly to 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.789
 do and we will answer you want 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.030
 learn from me just go on 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.030
 watching 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.720
 so this does not go to the tutorial for you 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.010
 I walk by step 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 Let me tell you a little bit 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.330
 about this effect this feat is called 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.750
 bouquet and it comes from the Japanese word 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.970
 which means pain or is it blurred 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 blurry and that's exactly what people 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.220
 can not really do it, we'll stay 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.920
 in focus that everything in the background stays 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.290
 totally out of focus then almost kitten 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.900
 to get funds says always focused 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.940
 I mean, you use a lens that has a good 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.490
 opening a large aperture for example 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.150
 the inscription is only now a 50 micron 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.560
 1.4 webtop dela is in 1,461 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.610
 pressing the Lord is a good subject. 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 unfocused 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.470
 so my mind is with 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.140
 large aperture and lower force on the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.580
 My biggest stop boss is going to be the opening 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.670
 of your lens 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.610
 the bigger the number of your ex top 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.070
 smaller with this lens aperture 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.890
 that is, the larger the aperture 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.930
 the smaller the opening, the more 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.640
 in focus things will stay 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.780
 you have an idea in a store that I 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.330
 quite like 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.550
 when we fight in the pupil everything stays 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.380
 blurry right we can not focus 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.820
 Very well in things, things are going well. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.530
 out of focus 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.470
 then this relates to the opening 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.510
 the pupil dilated when 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.550
 can see right would be the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.410
 camera aperture where everything 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.690
 gets out of focus in the background 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.130
 now with our normal back pupil 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.410
 back normal size 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.180
 we can see things well 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.970
 We better focus better on ourselves. 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.190
 then it would open in the smaller camera where 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.750
 everyone around will stay in focus 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 it is a technology alone to 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.450
 You better understand this opening. 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.180
 and df stop to help you 1 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.950
 But now enough talk and let's diet 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.500
 tutorial to teach you this step to 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
 I'm going for the best to start, shall we? 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.040
 talk about a poster board 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.629
 if you do not have catarina it can be used 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.050
 album cover also you 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.420
 no longer wearing scissors 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.489
 pen or pen to mark a 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.739
 lens with large aperture is 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:33.650
 example is 50mm 1.4 flex and clear 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.209
 a camera, however, the first time 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.269
 Let's do it, let's get our 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.569
 lens take off the cap and we go 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.370
 draw with the pen all 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.370
 circumference of this cap 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.010
 because the trace now we'll cut 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:02.590
 one important thing before cutting 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:05.180
 make a square here two lines 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:09.260
 because we 'll use this later too 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:16.549
 said that the country makes a bombinha but 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:18.769
 by listening you can not cut we go 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.900
 have something more or less like our 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.870
 buddy and let's do it, let's go 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.490
 fold in half 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.979
 Let's make a drawing that we want. 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.460
 Here then already helping me do 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.460
 heart I'm going to draw the heart here 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.200
 so I made it here far to do the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.200
 heart and now it 's just cut 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.670
 so drawing and cutting is over and over 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.020
 is our heart 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.750
 What are we going to do now we'll get 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.650
 the lens let's just fit our 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.910
 bad g here inside the lens is this catch 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.850
 the knowledge tape that child is 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:11.770
 Just to stick this to mine, here we go. 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.100
 stick her here just so she does not leave the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.260
 place that I think our team is 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.350
 It's really easy, we just study here. 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.820
 our ribbon and copper even he goes 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.860
 take our walk nor easy people 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.960
 here is our final result already with 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.760
 camera lens then personal only 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.010
 remembering what we said 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.100
 about of stop here how I am using 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:40.030
 50mm lenses 1.4 I placed here 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.740
 me f stop 1.4 so watch only see 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.690
 What is the smallest number she tends to 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.730
 stock and put it 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.470
 sometimes that of having super legal effect as well 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.470
 says focused on the background and will look amazing 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.150
 the staff then this is it I hope 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.800

 creativity you do not need to know 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.950
 bottom of heart may have for 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.030
 example you want just use the 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.410
 creativity
