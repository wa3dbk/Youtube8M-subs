00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
and on the instructions call for a chain

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.340 
and on the instructions call for a chain
16<00:01:39.530> which<00:01:40.040> makes<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.200> bigger<00:01:43.090> headband<00:01:44.350> like

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
16 which makes the bigger headband like

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.719 
16 which makes the bigger headband like
this<00:01:45.619> and<00:01:46.869> then<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.260> black<00:01:48.530> one<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.770> made<00:01:49.070> it

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.490 
this and then the black one I made it
actually<00:01:50.180> calls<00:01:50.479> for<00:01:52.150> 12<00:01:53.150> so<00:01:53.930> I'm<00:01:54.050> supposed<00:01:54.260> to

now to make the day even smaller one so
one<00:01:59.899> two<00:02:00.619> three<00:02:00.649> four<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.720> now<00:02:02.869> I<00:02:02.899> have<00:02:03.140> eight

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
one two three four so now I have eight

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.169 
one two three four so now I have eight
chains<00:02:04.960> one<00:02:05.960> two<00:02:05.990> three<00:02:06.590> four<00:02:06.979> five<00:02:07.340> six<00:02:07.700> seven

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
chains one two three four five six seven

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.680 
chains one two three four five six seven
eight

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
eight

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.080 
eight
this<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.350> make<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.649> smaller<00:02:10.040> than<00:02:10.880> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
this is to make it smaller than the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.630 
this is to make it smaller than the
black<00:02:11.330> one<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.600> made<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.560> what<00:02:13.340> we're<00:02:13.459> going<00:02:13.580> to

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
black one I made and what we're going to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.440 
black one I made and what we're going to
do<00:02:13.820> now<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.630> we're<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> slip<00:02:15.739> stitch

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
do now is we're going to slip stitch

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.540 
do now is we're going to slip stitch
into<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:18.739> fourth<00:02:19.040> chain<00:02:19.310> from<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:19.940> hook

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.480 

it's<00:02:24.030> very<00:02:24.330> simple<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.110> easy<00:02:25.350> then<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.130> chain

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
it's very simple and easy then you chain

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:34.520 
it's very simple and easy then you chain
up<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:27.530> one<00:02:28.790> two<00:02:30.170> three<00:02:31.700> four<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.140> slip

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
up for one two three four and you slip

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.380 
up for one two three four and you slip
stitch<00:02:34.920> into<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.430> fourth<00:02:35.700> chain<00:02:35.790> from<00:02:36.240> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
stitch into the fourth chain from the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
stitch into the fourth chain from the
hook<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.020> here<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.350> one<00:02:37.620> two<00:02:38.070> three<00:02:38.340> four

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
hook so here you have one two three four

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.200 
hook so here you have one two three four
so<00:02:40.410> basically<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.490> do<00:02:41.610> it<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.910> six

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
so basically you just do it to six

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.180 
so basically you just do it to six
stitches<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.990> first<00:02:43.320> round<00:02:43.740> that's<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
stitches in that first round that's the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.550 
stitches in that first round that's the
first<00:02:44.430> round<00:02:47.960> this<00:02:48.960> is<00:02:49.080> what<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.290> looks<00:02:49.440> like

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
first round this is what it looks like

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.660 
first round this is what it looks like
so<00:02:49.770> far

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
so far

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.160 
so far
for<00:02:52.180> round<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.570> we're<00:02:52.720> going<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.960> chain<00:02:53.140> up

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
for round so we're going to chain up

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.120 
for round so we're going to chain up
four<00:02:53.910> one<00:02:55.410> two<00:02:56.410> three<00:02:58.380> four<00:02:59.380> now<00:02:59.560> this<00:02:59.800> is<00:02:59.980> the

you want to use for this for headbands
is<00:05:55.840> kind<00:05:56.200> because<00:05:57.010> cotton<00:05:57.630> reserves<00:05:58.630> is<00:05:58.870> home

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450
