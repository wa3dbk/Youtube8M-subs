the<00:01:49.390> answer<00:01:49.690> is<00:01:49.840> yes<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:51.130> cx-9<00:01:51.580> does<00:01:51.820> have<00:01:52.000> an

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
the answer is yes the cx-9 does have an

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.270 
the answer is yes the cx-9 does have an
automatic<00:01:52.420> lift<00:01:52.720> gate<00:01:52.930> and<00:01:53.140> with<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.070> seats

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
automatic lift gate and with the seats

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.340 
automatic lift gate and with the seats
folded<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.760> you<00:01:54.970> get<00:01:55.090> about<00:01:55.240> 17<00:01:55.870> cubic<00:01:55.990> feet<00:01:56.170> of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
folded up you get about 17 cubic feet of

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.930 
folded up you get about 17 cubic feet of
space<00:01:56.440> now<00:01:56.830> I<00:01:56.860> thought<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.430> was<00:01:57.670> going<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.850> be

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
space now I thought that was going to be

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.310 
space now I thought that was going to be

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.390 
rating of two but I tried to close the
gate<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.490> won't<00:02:03.670> close<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.350> I'm<00:02:05.770> gonna<00:02:06.010> have<00:02:06.220> to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400

driving a car that's much smaller than
it<00:03:16.480> really<00:03:16.660> is<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:17.799> really<00:03:18.010> grateful

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
it really is so I was really grateful

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.979 
it really is so I was really grateful
for<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.670> fact<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.150> can<00:03:19.330> have<00:03:19.570> you<00:03:19.959> have

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
for the fact that you can have you have

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.600 
for the fact that you can have you have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
because probably I would have just spent

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.860 
because probably I would have just spent
the<00:03:24.250> entire<00:03:24.580> time<00:03:24.820> cutting<00:03:25.180> cars<00:03:25.480> off<00:03:25.660> because

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
the entire time cutting cars off because
