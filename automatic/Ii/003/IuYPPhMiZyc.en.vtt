it I'm not going to force carbonated so
I'm<00:00:21.150> gonna<00:00:21.359> prime<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.260> keg<00:00:22.580> using<00:00:23.580> five<00:00:24.090> grams

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
I'm gonna prime the keg using five grams

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.470 
I'm gonna prime the keg using five grams
of<00:00:24.750> sugar<00:00:25.380> for<00:00:25.619> every<00:00:25.890> liter<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.430> beer<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.330> I'm

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480

using<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.260> hundred<00:00:28.769> grams<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.369> sugar<00:00:29.880> here

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
using a hundred grams of sugar here

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.389 
using a hundred grams of sugar here
because<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.900> such<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.230> small<00:00:31.500> proportion<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
because it's such a small proportion of

the overall that was fermented in the
brew<00:00:35.070> I'm<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.760> using<00:00:35.940> ordinary<00:00:36.270> household

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
sugar so I'm gonna put the sugar into

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.420 
sugar so I'm gonna put the sugar into
the<00:00:40.559> keg<00:00:42.110> trying<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> inside<00:00:43.890> rather

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
first of all I'm going to run water

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
first of all I'm going to run water
through<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.629> siphon<00:00:55.020> tube<00:00:55.050> after<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
through the siphon tube after it

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
through the siphon tube after it
sterilized<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.910> make<00:00:57.030> sure<00:00:57.059> there's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
sterilized it just to make sure there's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
sterilized it just to make sure there's
no<00:00:57.539> sterilizing<00:00:58.140> solution<00:00:58.559> left<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
no sterilizing solution left in there

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and then I'm gonna trap some water in

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
and then I'm gonna trap some water in
the<00:01:01.199> tubing<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> kick-starts<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the tubing just so it kick-starts the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.140 
the tubing just so it kick-starts the
siphoning<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.559> need<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.100> suck<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
siphoning so don't need to suck on the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
siphoning so don't need to suck on the
end<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.420> siphon<00:01:06.780> tube<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.500> risk<00:01:07.710> any

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
end of the siphon tube and risk any

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.100 
end of the siphon tube and risk any
germs<00:01:08.220> or<00:01:08.880> microbes<00:01:09.450> they're<00:01:09.750> getting<00:01:09.990> in

now<00:02:00.680> let's<00:02:00.950> see<00:02:01.220> if<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.430> can't<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:03.530> get<00:02:03.650> a

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
now let's see if I can't just get a

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.050 
now let's see if I can't just get a
small<00:02:04.070> amount<00:02:04.159> into<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.700> glass

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.690 

after<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.870> bit<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.200> pain<00:02:14.470> doing<00:02:14.800> this<00:02:14.980> voice

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
after a bit of a pain doing this voice

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.360 
after a bit of a pain doing this voice
over<00:02:16.180> rather<00:02:16.420> than<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.860> audio<00:02:18.160> I'd

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
over rather than the the audio I'd

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.340 
over rather than the the audio I'd
already<00:02:18.550> force<00:02:19.330> had<00:02:19.540> recorded<00:02:19.930> whilst<00:02:20.170> doing

already force had recorded whilst doing

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.100 
already force had recorded whilst doing
the<00:02:20.530> video<00:02:21.330> cuz<00:02:22.330> I'm<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.510> gonna<00:02:22.630> feel<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> bit

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
the video cuz I'm not gonna feel a bit

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.010 
the video cuz I'm not gonna feel a bit
of<00:02:23.200> what<00:02:23.319> Wally<00:02:23.590> trying<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.300> pretend<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.450> taste

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
of what Wally trying to pretend to taste

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.640 
of what Wally trying to pretend to taste
the<00:02:26.260> bear<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> voiceover<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.319> can<00:02:29.470> tell

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
the bear on a voiceover but I can tell

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.690 
the bear on a voiceover but I can tell
you<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.950> sir

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
you that sir

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.350 
you that sir
I<00:02:31.709> was<00:02:32.709> very<00:02:32.920> impressed<00:02:33.370> by<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:36.030> first<00:02:37.030> taste

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
I was very impressed by the first taste

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.940 
I was very impressed by the first taste
that<00:02:37.569> I<00:02:37.600> got<00:02:37.810> there<00:02:38.050> obviously<00:02:38.739> it's<00:02:38.860> not

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that I got there obviously it's not

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.860 
that I got there obviously it's not
fizzy<00:02:39.250> because<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.730> carbon<00:02:40.239> dioxide<00:02:40.420> will

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
fizzy because the carbon dioxide will

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.809 
fizzy because the carbon dioxide will
have<00:02:40.989> escaped<00:02:41.319> out<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.310> bubble<00:02:42.580> trap

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
have escaped out of the the bubble trap

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.050 
have escaped out of the the bubble trap
in<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.410> fermenter<00:02:44.950> there<00:02:45.850> it's

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
in the in the fermenter there it's

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.759 
in the in the fermenter there it's
already<00:02:46.360> look<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.780> past<00:02:47.019> it's<00:02:47.500> got<00:02:47.739> a

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
already look in the past it's got a

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.040 
already look in the past it's got a
slight<00:02:48.100> haze<00:02:48.340> trousers<00:02:48.910> or<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.209> wheat<00:02:49.510> beer<00:02:49.540> do

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
slight haze trousers or a wheat beer do

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.570 
slight haze trousers or a wheat beer do
maybe<00:02:50.590> not<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.190> much<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:53.530> normal<00:02:53.950> week<00:02:54.310> beer

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
maybe not as much as a normal week beer

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.370 
maybe not as much as a normal week beer
but<00:02:55.269> I'll<00:02:55.360> tell<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> flavor<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.350> flavor

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
but I'll tell you the flavor the flavor

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.040 
but I'll tell you the flavor the flavor
was<00:02:56.830> really<00:02:57.160> good<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:57.600> I'll<00:02:58.600> certainly<00:02:58.870> be

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
was really good and I'll certainly be

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.100 
was really good and I'll certainly be
using<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.739> coriander<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.880> their<00:03:01.750> orange

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
using the coriander and their orange

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.520 
using the coriander and their orange
peel<00:03:02.380> in<00:03:02.709> an<00:03:03.069> all<00:03:03.250> grain<00:03:03.519> wheat<00:03:04.030> there<00:03:04.269> but<00:03:04.959> I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
peel in an all grain wheat there but I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.259 
peel in an all grain wheat there but I
was<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.280> impressed<00:03:06.580> with<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.760> result<00:03:07.090> here

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
was so impressed with the result here

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.030 
was so impressed with the result here
that<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.870> think<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.290> might<00:03:08.440> brew<00:03:08.650> this<00:03:08.739> again

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
that I think I might brew this again

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.590 
that I think I might brew this again
with<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.640> Cooper's<00:03:09.910> Australian<00:03:10.390> kick

with the the Cooper's Australian kick

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.090 
with the the Cooper's Australian kick
because<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.400> such<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.790> quick<00:03:13.360> one<00:03:13.569> to<00:03:13.720> brew

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
because it was such a quick one to brew

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.410 
because it was such a quick one to brew
you<00:03:15.100> know<00:03:15.220> as<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.519> may<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.000> seen<00:03:16.120> in<00:03:16.330> the

coriander seed the orange peel and a few
few<00:03:27.250> more<00:03:27.430> hops<00:03:27.670> but<00:03:28.630> yeah<00:03:29.560> that<00:03:29.980> was<00:03:30.130> very

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
few more hops but yeah that was very

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.280 
few more hops but yeah that was very
good<00:03:30.459> indeed<00:03:30.810> definitely<00:03:31.810> gonna<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.140> that

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
good indeed definitely gonna do that

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.530 
good indeed definitely gonna do that
again<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.860> can<00:03:33.489> strongly<00:03:33.790> recommend<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.329> try

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
again and can strongly recommend you try

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.690 
again and can strongly recommend you try
it<00:03:34.600> yourself<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:38.170> now<00:03:38.530> that's<00:03:38.709> all<00:03:38.920> siphoned

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
it yourself so now that's all siphoned

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
it yourself so now that's all siphoned
into<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:40.060> keg<00:03:40.269> getting<00:03:41.230> every<00:03:41.620> last<00:03:41.859> bit<00:03:42.160> of

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
into the keg getting every last bit of

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.390 
into the keg getting every last bit of
the<00:03:42.489> beer<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.780> put<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.799> lid<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.190> keg

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
the beer I can put the lid on the keg

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.539 
the beer I can put the lid on the keg
and<00:03:47.160> then<00:03:48.160> seal<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.720> by<00:03:50.220> connecting<00:03:51.220> to

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
and then seal it by connecting to

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.890 
and then seal it by connecting to
Mocambo<00:03:52.000> oxide<00:03:52.269> cylinder<00:03:52.690> through<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
Mocambo oxide cylinder through the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.050 
Mocambo oxide cylinder through the
regulator<00:03:53.370> ramping<00:03:54.370> up<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.579> pressure<00:03:54.609> to

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
regulator ramping up the pressure to

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.800 
regulator ramping up the pressure to
about<00:03:55.359> 20<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.530> 30<00:03:56.769> psi<00:03:57.209> that'll<00:03:58.209> seal<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.660> lid

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
about 20 to 30 psi that'll seal the lid

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.039 
about 20 to 30 psi that'll seal the lid
and<00:03:59.530> then<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.799> can<00:03:59.950> leave<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:01.420> an<00:04:01.810> ambient

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
and then I can leave it in an ambient

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.740 
and then I can leave it in an ambient
temperature<00:04:02.709> for<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:04.180> yeast<00:04:04.359> that's<00:04:04.600> in

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
temperature for the the yeast that's in

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.199 
temperature for the the yeast that's in
there<00:04:04.989> to<00:04:05.590> ferment<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.489> sugar<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.940> put<00:04:07.120> in

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
there to ferment the sugar that I put in

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.050 
there to ferment the sugar that I put in
there<00:04:07.920> it'll<00:04:08.920> build<00:04:09.100> up<00:04:09.340> pressure<00:04:09.489> but<00:04:09.880> it'll

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
there it'll build up pressure but it'll

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.449 
there it'll build up pressure but it'll
also<00:04:10.200> give<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.320> yeast<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.650> bit<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:11.859> a<00:04:11.920> kickstart

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
also give the yeast a bit of a kickstart

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.310 
also give the yeast a bit of a kickstart
remember<00:04:12.880> there<00:04:13.060> being<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.390> air<00:04:13.720> block<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.200> do

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
remember there being the air block I do

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.659 
remember there being the air block I do
want<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.859> yeast<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.190> there<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.459> add<00:04:15.549> flavor

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.179 

so<00:04:19.329> now<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.509> lid<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.019> sealed<00:04:20.439> I<00:04:20.560> can

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:21.189 
so now the lid is sealed I can

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:23.790 
so now the lid is sealed I can
disconnect<00:04:21.669> from<00:04:21.819> the<00:04:21.969> cylinder<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:23.020> take

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
disconnect from the cylinder and take

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.649 
disconnect from the cylinder and take
the<00:04:23.949> keg<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.360> leave<00:04:25.599> it<00:04:25.749> to<00:04:25.900> ferment<00:04:30.659> after

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
the keg and leave it to ferment after

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.779 
the keg and leave it to ferment after
around<00:04:31.960> about<00:04:32.229> a<00:04:32.259> week<00:04:32.680> at<00:04:33.189> the<00:04:33.370> ambient

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
around about a week at the ambient

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.330 
around about a week at the ambient
temperature<00:04:33.969> I<00:04:34.539> can<00:04:35.289> then<00:04:35.620> move<00:04:35.830> it<00:04:36.039> to<00:04:36.310> a

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
temperature I can then move it to a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.480 
temperature I can then move it to a
cooler<00:04:36.610> place<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:38.590> leave<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.009> for<00:04:39.249> a<00:04:39.310> couple

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
cooler place and leave that for a couple

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.749 
cooler place and leave that for a couple
of<00:04:39.699> weeks<00:04:39.849> before<00:04:40.150> sampling
