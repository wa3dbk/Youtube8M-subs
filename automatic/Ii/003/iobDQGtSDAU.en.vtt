00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 marcelinho you neighbors bought 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.849
 digital televisions but the condominium of 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.579
 you receive digital signal 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.380
 it seems that is not to ram marcelinho 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.450
 receive the digital signal that the globe 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.469
 offers and enjoys the best of television 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.009
 Brazilian 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:35.129
 you will need the following items 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.110
 an antenna the hf coaxial cable sufficient 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.730
 to get to everyone's house 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 processing equipment and 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.310
 amplification connector male connector 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 fpm connector is on the antenna or 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.770
 amplifier and 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.220
 required digital signal converter 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.840
 for the installation of the collective antenna 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.920
 it will be necessary to call a tennis player 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 professional 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 Marcelo, I think you're not the best. 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.680
 indicated you will not want to miss the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.740
 best digital tv goes 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.290
 The first step is to install the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.360
 antenna you need to put the antenna 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.080
 pointed to the signal transmitter 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.420
 digital 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.460
 a good tip is to look at where 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.920
 neighbors' digital antennas are 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.960
 pointing looks at what is husband 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 the location of the holder for the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.490
 antenna installation must be free of 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.490
 obstacles that may hinder the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:35.560
 signal reception as trees walls and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:37.690
 water boxes chosen from local to base 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.330
 must be installed firmly 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.720
 only this way you prevent the wind from bending 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.210
 your antenna and signal is weak in 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.430
 some condominiums may be required to 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.350
 installation of more than one antenna 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.229
 antennas can be installed in the same 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.200
 support while respecting the space 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.509
 minimum of 60 centimeters between them 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.240
 consult a professional antenna 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.280
 installed the second step is to install the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.490
 the cable that will connect the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.679
 antenna and your TV for this you 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.940
 need to install your connector efe 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.239
 male installed the connector tip is 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.720
 protect the connection with an insulation tape 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:22.930
 so that the water does not enter the connector 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.459
 now the third step places the cable in the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.090
 processing equipment and 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.090
 amplification 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.230
 the signal processing panel shall 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.260
 be installed indoors 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.270
 free from interference and humidity at home 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.650
 of the elevator for example is not a local 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.510
 indicated is where the mixers are. 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.050
 amplifiers and filters whose function is 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.300
 receive combine to equalize and amplify 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.050
 the signals received by preparing them for 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.850
 distribution 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.070
 amplifiers should be 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.470
 measured in terms of the quantity of 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.540
 apartments and size of the network 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.820
 distribution of the building 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.100
 distribution should be 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.650
 divided into parts with the use of a 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.950
 amplifier for each for execution 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.500
 this work requires a professional 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.360
 the next step is to make the cables 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.520
 arrive at all the units of the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.740
 condominium 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.840
 most of the buildings already have a 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.500
 specific population for the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.230
 antenna 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.200
 if this is not the case, your cable may be 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.180
 installed outside the building 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.790
 if your building only needs one 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.700
 amplifier your installation will be done 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.540
 the way it is illustrated is the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.770
 antenna 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.710
 this is the amplifier the line is the 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.170
 cables and each ball is a point of 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.630
 installation 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.030
 if the building is divided into wings 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.590
 this installation should be repeated to 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.090
 each class in this case in a building with 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.709
 many stories 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.670
 note that the sign of the floors 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.280
 low reaches by a separate cable so 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.340
 we decrease signal loss the cable 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.830
 arrived in your apartment 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.340
 then the next step is to plug the cable into 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.370
 your TV or converter if in your 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.680
 if it is necessary to use a converter you 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.350
 plug into the coaxial cable that came 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.210
 directly into the space provided. 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.480
 for antenna for lcd tvs 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.210
 led or plasma the interconnection with the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.919
 converter must be done by a cable 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.669
 hdmi and if your TV by tube 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:43.710
 you need to use the rc cable if your 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.470
 tv had already had input to the antenna 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.320
 digital you just plug the cable that comes out 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.680
 from your outlet directly into the air intake 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.020
 or at the antenna input the right input 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.850
 depends on each manufacturer 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.850
 it is best to read the instruction manual 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.779
 Calm down, people are already finishing 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:15.360
 we reached the last step to tune the 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:17.879
 through the menu options of your 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.339
 TV on some devices 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:26.069
 this is done automatically saw 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:28.409
 Marcelinho was easy and now you can 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.539
 enjoy the best of HDTV and 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.839
 programming in the comfort of your 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:32.839
 House
