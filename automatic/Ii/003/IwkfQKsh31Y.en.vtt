00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
ammo for you what happens is when you

a time and I'm pretty I'm like ninety
percent<00:00:44.910> sure<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.420> how<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.750> works<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
percent sure that's how this works but I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.709 
percent sure that's how this works but I
could<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.500> wrong<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.969> only<00:00:48.120> exactly<00:00:48.510> quote

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
could be wrong so the only exactly quote

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.220 
could be wrong so the only exactly quote
me<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:50.210> next<00:00:51.210> its<00:00:51.449> ability<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> gets

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
me on that next its ability it gets

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it it's a little awkward and it's when

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.620 
it it's a little awkward and it's when
you're<00:01:15.270> firing<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.840> full<00:01:16.049> auto<00:01:16.229> mode<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.630> it's

you're firing in full auto mode the it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
you're firing in full auto mode the it's
just<00:01:19.070> it's<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.369> over<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.729> place<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
just it's all over the place so you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.730 
just it's all over the place so you
definitely<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.869> reduce<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> recoil<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
definitely want to reduce that recoil in

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.609 
definitely want to reduce that recoil in
any<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.689> its<00:01:24.689> exotic<00:01:24.960> ability

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
any way that you can its exotic ability

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.429 
any way that you can its exotic ability
finally<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> gun<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.020> fired<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
finally is that the gun to be fired a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.640 
finally is that the gun to be fired a
full<00:01:28.650> auto<00:01:28.860> mode<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.720> means<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.049> has

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
full auto mode it that means it has

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.230 
full auto mode it that means it has
three<00:01:31.979> rounds<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> hold<00:01:32.939> down<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
three rounds so when you hold down the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
three rounds so when you hold down the
trigger<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> fire<00:01:34.020> all<00:01:34.259> three<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
trigger it's going to fire all three of

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.249 
trigger it's going to fire all three of
those<00:01:35.909> seven<00:01:36.409> round<00:01:37.409> bursts<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.340> whatever<00:01:38.700> and

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
those seven round bursts or whatever and

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.840 
those seven round bursts or whatever and
originally<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> had<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> eight<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.729> had

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
originally it had up to eight if you had

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
originally it had up to eight if you had
the<00:01:41.880> modifier<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.140> nerfed<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.649> eight

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the modifier on and they nerfed it eight

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.249 
the modifier on and they nerfed it eight
was<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> little<00:01:44.700> much<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.930> miss

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
was a little much because when you miss

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.569 
was a little much because when you miss
a<00:01:46.290> shot<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> chance<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.369> return

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
a shot it has a chance to return

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.270 
a shot it has a chance to return
directly<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> magazine<00:01:48.570> which<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.740> pretty

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
directly to the magazine which is pretty

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.590 
directly to the magazine which is pretty
cool<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.000> happening<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.450> means

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
cool but if that's happening that means

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.060 
cool but if that's happening that means
you're<00:01:51.720> missing<00:01:52.079> rounds<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:52.619> not

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you're missing rounds so it's not

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.740 
you're missing rounds so it's not
exactly<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.490> good<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.329> happening

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
exactly a good thing if it's happening

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.100 
exactly a good thing if it's happening
but<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:55.950> too<00:01:56.130> much<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.610> three<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
but it was too much and three is just it

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.770 
but it was too much and three is just it
felt<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.950> was<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.399> too<00:01:59.670> little<00:01:59.880> five

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
felt like it was just too little five

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
felt like it was just too little five
would<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.350> been<00:02:01.759> perfect<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.969> would<00:02:03.090> have

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
would have been perfect and I would have

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
would have been perfect and I would have
helped<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> gun<00:02:03.689> stand<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.200> because<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.189> is

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
helped a gun stand out because as it is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
helped a gun stand out because as it is
there<00:02:06.119> are<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.649> legendary<00:02:07.649> fusion<00:02:08.039> rifles

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
there are just legendary fusion rifles

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.490 
there are just legendary fusion rifles
that<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.789> way<00:02:08.970> better

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
that are way better

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.130 
that are way better
I'm<00:02:09.560> about<00:02:09.800> three<00:02:10.160> on<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:11.000> are<00:02:11.120> just<00:02:11.480> better

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
I'm about three on that are just better

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.640 
I'm about three on that are just better
for<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.560> crucible<00:02:13.070> then<00:02:13.460> been<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.090> gun<00:02:14.650> the

for the crucible then been this gun the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.950 
for the crucible then been this gun the
main<00:02:15.860> reason<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.490> because<00:02:17.180> with<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.480> legendary

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
main reason is because with a legendary

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.390 
main reason is because with a legendary
fusion<00:02:18.410> or<00:02:18.440> life<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.770> you<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.010> hide<00:02:19.190> behind

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400

cover<00:02:24.860> with<00:02:25.520> this<00:02:25.670> gun<00:02:25.910> you're<00:02:26.600> exposed<00:02:27.020> for<00:02:27.260> a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
cover with this gun you're exposed for a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.080 
cover with this gun you're exposed for a
significantly<00:02:28.220> longer<00:02:28.520> amount<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:29.030> time

significantly longer amount of time

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.940

because you have to stay out from cover
and<00:02:31.300> fire<00:02:32.300> all<00:02:32.780> three<00:02:33.380> rounds<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.040> then<00:02:34.280> go

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
and fire all three rounds and then go

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.970 
and fire all three rounds and then go
back<00:02:34.430> in<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.450> there's<00:02:36.350> just<00:02:36.680> you're

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
back in so you there's just you're

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.070 
back in so you there's just you're
exposed<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.730> you're<00:02:37.880> gonna<00:02:38.000> get<00:02:38.120> shot<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:39.020> a

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
exposed and you're gonna get shot for a

much longer period of time whereas a

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.690 
much longer period of time whereas a
legendary<00:02:41.690> weapon<00:02:42.080> it's<00:02:42.680> just<00:02:42.890> simple<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:43.610> a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
legendary weapon it's just simple it's a

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.400 
legendary weapon it's just simple it's a
simple<00:02:44.000> process<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.110> just<00:02:45.230> got<00:02:45.380> to

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
simple process but you just got to

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.870 
simple process but you just got to
adjust<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.130> adjust<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.610> that<00:02:46.700> it's

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
adjust to that if adjust to that it's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.570 
adjust to that if adjust to that it's
okay<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.989> exotic<00:02:48.380> ability<00:02:48.830> never<00:02:49.220> really

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
okay the exotic ability never really

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.550 
okay the exotic ability never really
came<00:02:49.820> in<00:02:50.030> handy<00:02:50.060> though<00:02:50.630> when<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> was<00:02:51.110> using<00:02:51.290> it

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
came in handy though when I was using it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.120 
came in handy though when I was using it
it<00:02:52.130> was<00:02:52.280> very<00:02:53.080> very<00:02:54.080> few<00:02:54.410> times<00:02:54.680> where<00:02:55.100> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
it was very very few times where I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.900 
it was very very few times where I
actually<00:02:55.459> got<00:02:56.530> multi<00:02:57.530> kills<00:02:57.830> because<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.790> was

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
actually got multi kills because it was

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.420 
actually got multi kills because it was
full<00:02:59.090> auto<00:02:59.360> most<00:03:00.170> of<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.380> time<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.620> just<00:03:00.890> I

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
full auto most of the time I just I

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.310 
full auto most of the time I just I
ended<00:03:01.760> up<00:03:01.850> using<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.390> as<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> regular<00:03:02.959> fusion

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
ended up using it as a regular fusion

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.960 
ended up using it as a regular fusion
rifle<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.709> only<00:03:03.920> firing<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.430> first<00:03:04.580> burst

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
rifle and only firing the first burst

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.290 
rifle and only firing the first burst
and<00:03:05.530> on<00:03:06.530> top<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:06.980> its<00:03:07.489> charge<00:03:07.850> time<00:03:08.150> is

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
and on top of that its charge time is

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.120 
and on top of that its charge time is
one<00:03:08.450> of<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.600> slowest<00:03:09.050> of<00:03:09.230> any<00:03:09.440> charge<00:03:09.739> rifles

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
one of the slowest of any charge rifles

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.660 
one of the slowest of any charge rifles
that<00:03:10.220> I<00:03:10.280> have<00:03:11.800> aside<00:03:12.800> from<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.160> crucible

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
do some damage I my example here was not

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.640 
do some damage I my example here was not
really<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.090> best<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.630> was<00:03:42.019> doing<00:03:42.230> nightfall

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
really the best I was doing nightfall

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.670 
really the best I was doing nightfall
there<00:03:43.220> was<00:03:43.310> no<00:03:43.579> elemental<00:03:44.540> modifier<00:03:45.290> although

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
there was no elemental modifier although

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.470 
there was no elemental modifier although
if<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:45.980> was<00:03:46.160> fire<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:47.180> would<00:03:47.269> have<00:03:47.390> been

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
if it was fire that would have been

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.170 
if it was fire that would have been
completely<00:03:47.860> decimated<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.549> it's<00:03:49.940> nice

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
completely decimated and so it's nice

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.539 
completely decimated and so it's nice
for<00:03:50.360> those<00:03:50.450> activities<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.290> I'm<00:03:52.220> gonna<00:03:52.400> have

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
for those activities but I'm gonna have

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.900 
for those activities but I'm gonna have
to<00:03:52.610> give<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.820> a<00:03:52.850> seven<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.390> a<00:03:53.510> half<00:03:54.549> 7.5<00:03:55.549> it's

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
to give it a seven and a half 7.5 it's

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.410 
to give it a seven and a half 7.5 it's
not<00:03:56.329> great<00:03:57.110> but<00:03:57.140> it's<00:03:58.040> also<00:03:58.310> not<00:03:58.640> bad<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.180> does

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
not great but it's also not bad it does

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.530 
not great but it's also not bad it does
have<00:03:59.750> its<00:03:59.959> uses<00:04:00.200> but<00:04:00.880> it's<00:04:01.880> just<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.209> very

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
have its uses but it's just a very

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.870 
have its uses but it's just a very
situational<00:04:03.500> weapon<00:04:03.950> if<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.430> if<00:04:04.549> you're<00:04:04.700> not

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
situational weapon if and if you're not

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.780 
situational weapon if and if you're not
in<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.209> situation<00:04:05.860> any<00:04:06.860> weapon<00:04:07.430> could<00:04:07.640> have

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
in that situation any weapon could have

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.310 
in that situation any weapon could have
filled<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.120> role<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:09.140> would<00:04:09.230> have

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
filled that role and you would have

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.490 
filled that role and you would have
still<00:04:09.530> had<00:04:09.709> your<00:04:09.890> exotic<00:04:10.190> slot<00:04:11.049> so<00:04:12.049> that's<00:04:12.290> why

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
still had your exotic slot so that's why

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.199 
still had your exotic slot so that's why
I'm<00:04:12.799> not<00:04:12.980> going<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.220> give<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.430> anything<00:04:13.640> above

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
I'm not going to give it anything above

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.800 
I'm not going to give it anything above
that<00:04:14.420> if<00:04:14.660> this<00:04:15.350> was<00:04:15.560> before<00:04:15.910> got<00:04:16.910> nerfed<00:04:17.239> it

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
that if this was before got nerfed it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.460 
that if this was before got nerfed it
would<00:04:17.959> definitely<00:04:18.260> be<00:04:18.680> an<00:04:18.979> eight

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
would definitely be an eight

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.320 
would definitely be an eight
because<00:04:19.829> eight<00:04:20.180> rounds<00:04:21.180> is<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.450> lot<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:23.330> that's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
because eight rounds is a lot and that's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.130 
because eight rounds is a lot and that's
what<00:04:24.660> made<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:25.080> gun<00:04:25.380> so<00:04:25.860> cool<00:04:26.460> i<00:04:26.880> like<00:04:27.750> alone

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.720 
what made this gun so cool i like alone
