00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
minami or the professor and so i'm

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.910 
minami or the professor and so i'm

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
guessing eventually probably at the end

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.229 
guessing eventually probably at the end
of<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.130> series<00:03:34.340> he<00:03:34.520> might<00:03:34.700> get<00:03:34.850> saved<00:03:35.120> i

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
of this series he might get saved i

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.160 
of this series he might get saved i
think<00:03:35.450> that's<00:03:35.570> going<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.750> be<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> main

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
think that's going to be the main

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.170 
think that's going to be the main
objective<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.830> ingame<00:03:37.220> goal<00:03:37.520> at<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.030> end<00:03:38.090> of

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
objective and ingame goal at the end of

objective and ingame goal at the end of
the<00:03:38.300> series<00:03:38.450> because<00:03:38.630> i<00:03:38.840> don't<00:03:39.050> remember

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290

there's another thing they bring up in
this<00:04:04.670> for<00:04:05.060> instance<00:04:05.209> we<00:04:05.540> find<00:04:05.780> out<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
this for instance we find out that the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.630 
this for instance we find out that the
police<00:04:06.380> force<00:04:06.680> are<00:04:06.830> probably<00:04:07.100> thinking<00:04:07.340> about

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
police force are probably thinking about

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.940

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
terrorists which is logical we got to

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.060 
terrorists which is logical we got to
think<00:04:12.049> about<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.290> something<00:04:12.620> like<00:04:12.739> this<00:04:12.859> will

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
think about the something like this will

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.059 
think about the something like this will
always<00:04:13.459> happen<00:04:13.640> when

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
always happen when

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.830 
always happen when
it's<00:04:14.189> like<00:04:14.340> someone<00:04:14.670> has<00:04:14.819> unique<00:04:15.150> ability<00:04:15.659> and

lock her up she could just easily go
through<00:05:22.500> the<00:05:22.650> police<00:05:23.099> walls<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.669> mean<00:05:23.820> she<00:05:24.000> just

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
through the police walls I mean she just

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.480 
through the police walls I mean she just
walked<00:05:24.419> out<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.659> a<00:05:24.930> prison<00:05:25.139> so<00:05:25.560> technically

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
walked out of a prison so technically

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.939 
walked out of a prison so technically
rinka<00:05:27.240> is<00:05:27.810> uncontrollable<00:05:28.409> you<00:05:28.590> can't<00:05:28.800> really

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
rinka is uncontrollable you can't really

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.740 
rinka is uncontrollable you can't really
control<00:05:29.280> her<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.699> she<00:05:29.789> keeps<00:05:29.970> her<00:05:30.150> powers<00:05:30.539> up

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
control her and she keeps her powers up

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.200 
control her and she keeps her powers up
so<00:05:31.080> I<00:05:31.470> can<00:05:31.919> see<00:05:32.039> why<00:05:32.310> they<00:05:32.550> would<00:05:32.699> want<00:05:32.729> to<00:05:32.970> walk

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
so I can see why they would want to walk

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.360 
so I can see why they would want to walk
Esper's<00:05:33.750> up<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.110> it's<00:05:34.320> kind<00:05:34.680> of<00:05:34.800> confusing<00:05:35.009> I

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
Esper's up and it's kind of confusing I

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.310 
Esper's up and it's kind of confusing I
mean<00:05:35.520> how<00:05:35.669> would<00:05:35.729> you<00:05:35.909> lock<00:05:36.090> an<00:05:36.270> esper<00:05:36.570> up<00:05:36.720> so<00:05:37.050> I

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
mean how would you lock an esper up so I

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.439 
mean how would you lock an esper up so I
eventually<00:05:38.250> see<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:38.880> know<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.150> humans

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
eventually see you know the humans

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.420 
eventually see you know the humans
developing<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.050> device<00:05:40.169> like<00:05:40.380> you<00:05:40.800> know<00:05:40.919> to

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
per device or something that could stop

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.610 
per device or something that could stop
their<00:05:45.210> powers<00:05:45.599> I<00:05:45.810> don't<00:05:45.990> know<00:05:46.080> something<00:05:46.530> like

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
their powers I don't know something like

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.379 
their powers I don't know something like
how<00:05:46.860> devil<00:05:47.250> fruit<00:05:47.430> users<00:05:47.820> use<00:05:48.030> like<00:05:48.210> when

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
how devil fruit users use like when

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.360 
how devil fruit users use like when
water<00:05:48.599> touches<00:05:48.840> them<00:05:49.199> or<00:05:49.409> the<00:05:49.830> sea<00:05:49.979> prison

water touches them or the sea prison

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:51.740 
water touches them or the sea prison
stone<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.820> could<00:05:51.120> see<00:05:51.270> something<00:05:51.509> like<00:05:51.630> that

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
stone I could see something like that

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.310 
stone I could see something like that
being<00:05:52.080> used<00:05:52.500> in<00:05:52.770> it<00:05:53.190> so<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:54.360> episode<00:05:54.810> very
