00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680

kit<00:00:31.029> what<00:00:32.029> he<00:00:32.180> says<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:32.629> drums<00:00:32.930> are<00:00:33.260> really

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
kit what he says the drums are really

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.110 
kit what he says the drums are really
actually<00:00:34.010> higher<00:00:34.280> in<00:00:34.309> pitch<00:00:34.730> than<00:00:34.790> you'd

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
actually higher in pitch than you'd

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.540 
actually higher in pitch than you'd
actually<00:00:35.480> think<00:00:35.890> because<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.010> drums<00:00:37.249> are<00:00:37.399> so

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
actually think because the drums are so

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.000 
actually think because the drums are so
big<00:00:37.910> you<00:00:38.230> would<00:00:39.230> just<00:00:39.350> assume<00:00:39.649> that<00:00:39.829> they<00:00:39.949> were

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
big you would just assume that they were

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.860 
big you would just assume that they were
tuned<00:00:40.339> lower<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:40.940> they<00:00:40.999> sound<00:00:41.300> lower<00:00:41.629> but

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
tuned lower and they sound lower but

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.529 
tuned lower and they sound lower but
they're<00:00:42.289> really<00:00:42.589> actually<00:00:42.769> tuned<00:00:43.159> high<00:00:43.539> John

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
they're really actually tuned high John

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.049 
they're really actually tuned high John
Bonham<00:00:44.899> wanted<00:00:45.320> more<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.620> a<00:00:45.739> big<00:00:46.429> band<00:00:46.699> drum

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
Bonham wanted more of a big band drum

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.149 
Bonham wanted more of a big band drum
sound<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:47.629> that's<00:00:48.319> kind<00:00:48.589> of<00:00:48.620> what<00:00:48.769> you<00:00:48.920> sound

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
sound and that's kind of what you sound

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.189 
sound and that's kind of what you sound
like<00:00:49.339> when<00:00:49.730> you<00:00:50.480> hear<00:00:50.659> them<00:00:50.809> without<00:00:51.019> any

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
like when you hear them without any

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.250 
like when you hear them without any
