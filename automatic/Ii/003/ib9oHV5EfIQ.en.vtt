the<00:03:12.380> big<00:03:12.560> one<00:03:12.769> was<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.400> slightly<00:03:13.850> under<00:03:14.030> I'm

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
the big one was just slightly under I'm

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.060 
the big one was just slightly under I'm
personally<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> opinion<00:03:15.620> that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
personally of the opinion that

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.680 
personally of the opinion that
everything<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:16.790> potatoes<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.510> chicken

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
everything but potatoes and chicken

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.600 
everything but potatoes and chicken
should<00:03:18.019> be<00:03:18.080> slightly<00:03:18.440> undercooked<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.220> for<00:03:19.459> me

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
should be slightly undercooked so for me

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.790 
should be slightly undercooked so for me
it<00:03:19.670> was<00:03:19.850> fine<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:20.330> for<00:03:20.480> some<00:03:20.780> they<00:03:21.350> would<00:03:21.530> find

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
it was fine but for some they would find

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.699 
it was fine but for some they would find
that<00:03:21.980> 5%<00:03:22.340> short<00:03:23.120> on<00:03:23.269> cooking<00:03:23.720> they<00:03:24.380> may<00:03:24.560> not

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
that 5% short on cooking they may not

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.890 
that 5% short on cooking they may not
like<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.070> texture<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:26.180> main<00:03:26.390> option<00:03:26.810> you

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
like the texture the main option you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.150 
like the texture the main option you
have<00:03:27.110> when<00:03:27.290> you're<00:03:27.410> getting<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:27.739> lobster<00:03:28.100> is
