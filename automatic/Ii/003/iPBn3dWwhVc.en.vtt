00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 I would like to start this issue with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 I will no longer make a small statement 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.880
 do reviews all 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 maybe it's not mine maybe it cost me 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.389
 do something else 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.450
 instead of sitting on chase sony vegas 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 and yesterday you know the games yesterday I broke 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.560
 that was the last straw i broke 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 keyboard and could no longer tolerate this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.220
 unbearable pain that I know for sure 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.310
 never in my life will I click on this 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 disgusting steam label I ate dolinski 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.120
 and gave the account to a friend more and more no 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.910
 no games have seen it all in the past 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.370
 my life is already saturated and now 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 when the game didnâ€™t become me all my time 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 I will dedicate 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.649
 although you don't need to know why i am 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.850
 came to this so suddenly yes because 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.690
 what the hell whole 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.520
 Igroprom if there are such games 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 I greet you on the channel games for comp 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 and today we have the second issue of the series 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.989
 pixel from you have to win the game 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.309
 you know, unlike the previous release 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.460
 today's product does not hint 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.520
 he spits in the face of the gamer with the words you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.479
 do not pass this game, I probably even 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.600
 I will not argue 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.150
 no definitely pass the game real and 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.460
 hardcore and there is not very much but you 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.130
 rather go crazy and go kill 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.400
 innocent people than go play on a hundred 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.320
 percent and freak you very soon 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.799
 Well, let's start the plot plot is not worth it 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.170
 to tell 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.270
 the game does not interfere at all but if 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.700
 pay attention to the fact and the hero 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.350
 the current impassable game is not much 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.500
 different from our previous 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.899
 the patients are both very greedy and are 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.899
 McDuck's fantasy prototypes 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.640
 but if the fork parker could close his eyes on 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.939
 a stack of money and which could not get 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 then in the impassable game you must assemble 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.130
 all one hundred bags of money just 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.810
 listen to 100 bags 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.880
 100 graphics developers did not stop 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.489
 on the banal stylization of levels under 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.590
 the graphics of the first generations of consoles they 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.170
 literally made an image in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.170
 imaginary lamp in both 80s TVs 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.720
 years but they did not stop here 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.709
 saving bulge pictures 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.340
 what can be said peerless work 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.770
 clap sound worth sound is also awesome 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.230
 stylized voiced only jumping hero 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.870
 projectiles preservation opponents and yet 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.230
 a couple of small things in general, everything is as it should 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.630
 be with a real old toy 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.880
 gameplay first and most important 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.030
 from the first time you will not pass this game 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.160
 how do not try to please and at the same time 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.920
 annoying possibility of choosing the wrong 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.500
 the ways that lead you to the hopeless 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.080
 having a pseudo open world game up 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.480
 ugliness is linear at first you have to 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.370
 queue to find red and blue items 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.120
 which will give you the opportunity to jump on 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.460
 respectively 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.560
 red and blue platforms then you 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.330
 learn to do a double jump and in 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.460
 end up climbing walls 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.710
 you pretty sweat and before 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.170
 open all these skills but 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.480
 consider that it was a warm-up 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100
 hardcore begins 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.680
 wildest unimaginable the most that neither 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.050
 there's hardcore hardcore vs wild 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.430
 which is simply impossible to pass traps 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.800
 and endless levels 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.690
 after passing 60 percent of the game 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.230
 stock up with validol diapers and 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.000
 mineral water for we are in shit what 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.740
 will happen next you find out yourself 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.140
 total 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.210
 honestly i didn't play either in the first and in 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.150
 second dark souls but i think you have 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.490
 Tuvans are not very inferior to gay 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.070
 the highest quality pseudo retro product 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.130
 of all I've seen, plus it's free 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.770
 everyone weighs about 20 megabytes so 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.400
 you will not be able to download it anymore 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.400
 nothing to add 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.030
