what<00:00:04.910> is<00:00:05.060> a<00:00:05.090> shadow<00:00:05.920> well<00:00:06.920> to<00:00:07.099> see<00:00:07.309> one<00:00:07.550> we<00:00:08.149> had

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 
what is a shadow well to see one we had

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.839 
what is a shadow well to see one we had
to<00:00:08.510> have<00:00:08.599> a<00:00:08.630> light<00:00:08.870> source<00:00:09.139> that<00:00:09.550> produces<00:00:10.550> a

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
to have a light source that produces a

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.960 
to have a light source that produces a
beam<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.300> light<00:00:11.920> we<00:00:12.920> see<00:00:13.190> that<00:00:13.370> beam<00:00:13.610> of<00:00:13.640> light

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
beam of light we see that beam of light

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.509 
beam of light we see that beam of light
when<00:00:14.960> it<00:00:15.050> hits<00:00:15.260> a<00:00:15.380> surface<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:16.010> is

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
when it hits a surface and is

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:22.390 
when it hits a surface and is
illuminated<00:00:17.150> a<00:00:19.599> shadow<00:00:20.599> is<00:00:20.869> formed<00:00:21.349> when<00:00:22.070> some

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
illuminated a shadow is formed when some

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.479 
illuminated a shadow is formed when some
object<00:00:23.320> blocks<00:00:24.320> part<00:00:24.800> of<00:00:24.919> that<00:00:25.039> stream<00:00:25.339> of

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:25.489 
object blocks part of that stream of

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.139 
object blocks part of that stream of
light<00:00:26.259> therefore<00:00:27.400> when<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:28.519> light<00:00:28.699> hits<00:00:28.970> an

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:29.149 
light therefore when the light hits an

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.950 
light therefore when the light hits an
object<00:00:29.569> or<00:00:29.779> surface<00:00:31.149> there<00:00:32.149> is<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.329> spot<00:00:32.720> that

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
object or surface there is a spot that

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.170 
object or surface there is a spot that
does<00:00:33.110> not<00:00:33.260> get<00:00:33.470> illuminated<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:34.730> is<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
does not get illuminated this is the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.920 
does not get illuminated this is the
shadow<00:00:36.460> shadows<00:00:37.460> take<00:00:37.760> on<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.210> silhouette<00:00:38.600> of

shadow shadows take on the silhouette of

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.229 
shadow shadows take on the silhouette of
the<00:00:39.530> object<00:00:40.039> that's<00:00:40.190> blocking<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.879> beam<00:00:41.059> of

light we are used to seeing shadows and
our<00:00:46.460> subconscious<00:00:46.730> knows<00:00:47.449> when<00:00:48.289> they're<00:00:48.500> not

our subconscious knows when they're not

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
our subconscious knows when they're not
right<00:00:49.179> it<00:00:50.179> won't<00:00:50.329> tell<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.839> why<00:00:51.140> it's<00:00:51.350> wrong

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
right it won't tell you why it's wrong

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.720 
right it won't tell you why it's wrong
it'll<00:00:52.730> just<00:00:52.940> make<00:00:53.269> it<00:00:53.480> feel<00:00:53.690> awkward<00:00:54.730> many

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
it'll just make it feel awkward many

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.660 
it'll just make it feel awkward many
times<00:00:56.379> if<00:00:57.379> shadows<00:00:57.980> are<00:00:58.160> a<00:00:58.190> little<00:00:58.370> bit<00:00:58.550> off

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
times if shadows are a little bit off

the objects that are supposed to be
sitting<00:01:01.190> on<00:01:01.280> something<00:01:01.789> appear<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.809> be<00:01:02.929> kind

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
sitting on something appear to be kind

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.399 
sitting on something appear to be kind
of<00:01:03.320> floating<00:01:03.920> it<00:01:04.670> won't<00:01:05.000> look<00:01:05.239> right<00:01:05.540> for<00:01:06.200> what

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
of floating it won't look right for what

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.690 
of floating it won't look right for what
you<00:01:06.590> want<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.980> achieve<00:01:08.620> granted<00:01:09.620> a<00:01:09.800> lot<00:01:10.640> of

you want to achieve granted a lot of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.750 
you want to achieve granted a lot of
computer<00:01:11.180> programs<00:01:11.720> will<00:01:12.680> do<00:01:12.950> shadows<00:01:13.430> for

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
computer programs will do shadows for

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.900 
computer programs will do shadows for
you<00:01:14.320> but<00:01:15.320> again<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.890> get<00:01:16.040> what<00:01:16.160> you<00:01:16.340> might<00:01:16.580> want

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
you but again to get what you might want

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.480 
you but again to get what you might want
you<00:01:17.840> might<00:01:18.080> have<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.680> change<00:01:18.980> it<00:01:19.280> or

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
you might have to change it or

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.070 
you might have to change it or
manipulate<00:01:20.480> it<00:01:20.660> so<00:01:20.870> it<00:01:21.320> looks<00:01:21.530> a<00:01:21.650> certain<00:01:21.830> way

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.520 

here<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.290> a<00:01:27.320> simple<00:01:27.710> shadow<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.260> pole

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
here is a simple shadow it's a pole

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.480 
here is a simple shadow it's a pole
standing<00:01:31.370> on<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.520> surface<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.710> direction<00:01:34.280> and

standing on a surface the direction and
length<00:01:34.790> of<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.090> shadow<00:01:35.630> is<00:01:35.990> determined<00:01:36.740> by

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
length of the shadow is determined by

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.970 
length of the shadow is determined by
the<00:01:36.980> light<00:01:37.460> source<00:01:37.820> that's<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:38.980> where

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
the light source that's on it and where

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.820 
the light source that's on it and where
it's<00:01:40.430> coming<00:01:40.730> from<00:01:44.170> there<00:01:45.170> are<00:01:45.380> two<00:01:45.560> factors

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's coming from there are two factors

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.800 
it's coming from there are two factors
about<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.640> light<00:01:46.820> source<00:01:47.180> that<00:01:47.480> give<00:01:48.410> us<00:01:48.530> this

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
about the light source that give us this

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.140 
about the light source that give us this
one<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.440> angle<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.370> light<00:01:52.550> source<00:01:52.880> on

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
one is the angle of the light source on

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.350 
one is the angle of the light source on
the<00:01:53.180> ground<00:01:53.450> plane<00:01:54.020> itself<00:01:54.910> this<00:01:55.910> gives<00:01:56.210> us

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
the ground plane itself this gives us

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.790 
the ground plane itself this gives us
the<00:01:56.540> starting<00:01:56.810> point<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.260> shadow<00:01:57.500> at<00:01:57.770> the

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
the starting point the shadow at the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.310 
the starting point the shadow at the
base<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:59.720> out<00:01:59.900> in<00:02:00.140> some<00:02:00.410> direction<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
base and going out in some direction the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.460 
base and going out in some direction the
other<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:04.820> angle<00:02:05.300> down<00:02:05.630> from<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.290> light

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
other is the angle down from the light

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.690 
other is the angle down from the light
source<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:08.690> shows<00:02:09.019> where<00:02:09.319> like<00:02:09.530> can<00:02:09.950> start

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
source that shows where like can start

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.470 
source that shows where like can start
going<00:02:10.940> over<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.210> top<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.750> object<00:02:11.900> and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
going over the top of the object and

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.770 
going over the top of the object and
illuminate<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.630> surface

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
illuminate the surface

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.960 
illuminate the surface
thus<00:02:16.780> giving<00:02:17.170> us<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.470> length<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.250> shadow

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.830 

let's<00:02:21.970> find<00:02:22.269> a<00:02:22.360> shadow<00:02:22.690> in<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.739> simple<00:02:24.099> drawing

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
let's find a shadow in a simple drawing

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.229 
let's find a shadow in a simple drawing
here<00:02:25.840> I've<00:02:26.080> drawn<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.349> red<00:02:26.590> line<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.760> could<00:02:28.060> be

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
here I've drawn a red line that could be

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.759 
here I've drawn a red line that could be
that<00:02:28.510> pole<00:02:28.810> we<00:02:29.200> just<00:02:29.440> saw<00:02:30.930> when<00:02:31.930> we<00:02:32.080> do<00:02:32.260> simple

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
that pole we just saw when we do simple

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.229 
that pole we just saw when we do simple
cast<00:02:33.549> shadows<00:02:34.230> we<00:02:35.230> get<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.560> just<00:02:35.769> decide<00:02:36.239> what

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
cast shadows we get to just decide what

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.350 
cast shadows we get to just decide what
angle<00:02:37.900> will<00:02:38.769> be<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.040> ground<00:02:39.250> angle<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.330> angle

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
angle will be the ground angle the angle

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.240 
angle will be the ground angle the angle
down<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.360> ground<00:02:43.660> angle<00:02:44.140> says<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.950> shadow

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.319 
down the ground angle says the shadow
comes<00:02:45.610> out<00:02:45.849> in<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.330> direction<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.880> angle

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
comes out in this direction the angle

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.420 
comes out in this direction the angle
down<00:02:49.569> comes<00:02:50.560> from<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.860> top<00:02:51.069> of<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> object

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
down comes from the top of the object

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.089 
down comes from the top of the object
the<00:02:52.299> last<00:02:52.569> place<00:02:52.989> that<00:02:53.290> it<00:02:53.380> blocks<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.769> stream

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
the last place that it blocks the stream

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.550 
the last place that it blocks the stream
of<00:02:54.250> light<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.760> comes<00:02:55.720> down<00:02:55.959> towards<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
of light and comes down towards the

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.180 
of light and comes down towards the
ground<00:02:56.590> angle<00:02:58.410> where<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.440> hits<00:02:59.829> the<00:03:00.010> ground

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
ground angle where it hits the ground

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.949 
ground angle where it hits the ground
angle<00:03:00.810> tells<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:02.110> when<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.069> shadow<00:03:03.519> stops

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.210 

and<00:03:07.959> here<00:03:08.230> we<00:03:08.379> have<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:09.549> shadow<00:03:10.980> now<00:03:11.980> let's

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and here we have the shadow now let's

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.449 
and here we have the shadow now let's
look<00:03:12.370> how<00:03:12.549> we<00:03:12.610> use<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:12.879> simple<00:03:14.010> flagpole<00:03:15.010> method

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
look how we use a simple flagpole method

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.930 
look how we use a simple flagpole method
to<00:03:16.420> determine<00:03:16.750> shadows<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.829> more<00:03:18.190> complicated

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
to determine shadows on more complicated

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.349 
to determine shadows on more complicated
or<00:03:19.090> three-dimensional<00:03:20.079> objects<00:03:21.000> here<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.239> an

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
or three-dimensional objects here is an

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.979 
or three-dimensional objects here is an
isometric<00:03:22.720> drawing<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.410> a<00:03:24.040> cube<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:25.540> find<00:03:25.810> its

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
isometric drawing of a cube to find its

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.430 
isometric drawing of a cube to find its
shadow<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:27.340> must<00:03:27.609> be<00:03:27.760> able<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.030> find<00:03:28.299> where<00:03:29.079> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
shadow we must be able to find where the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.220 
shadow we must be able to find where the
edges<00:03:30.000> cast<00:03:31.000> shadows<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.810> where<00:03:32.530> they<00:03:32.680> stop

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
edges cast shadows and where they stop

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.250 
edges cast shadows and where they stop
we<00:03:35.230> can<00:03:35.440> make<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.889> vertical<00:03:36.459> edge

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
we can make a vertical edge

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.050 
we can make a vertical edge
represented<00:03:38.260> by<00:03:38.349> a<00:03:38.380> flagpole<00:03:38.769> just<00:03:39.700> like<00:03:39.880> our

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
represented by a flagpole just like our

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.620 
represented by a flagpole just like our
last<00:03:40.209> little<00:03:40.930> demonstration<00:03:42.329> so<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.389> would

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
last little demonstration so you would

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.650 
last little demonstration so you would
have<00:03:43.780> three<00:03:44.049> flag<00:03:44.349> poles<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:45.489> represent<00:03:46.090> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
have three flag poles that represent the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.830 
have three flag poles that represent the
edges<00:03:47.079> that<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.290> see<00:03:48.480> there<00:03:49.480> would<00:03:49.630> have<00:03:49.780> to

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
edges that you see there would have to

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.559 
edges that you see there would have to
be<00:03:50.049> another<00:03:50.290> flagpole<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.250> represent<00:03:52.239> the

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
be another flagpole to represent the

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.809 
be another flagpole to represent the
edge<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.989> don't<00:03:53.230> see<00:03:53.470> because<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.519> affects

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
edge you don't see because it affects

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.349 
edge you don't see because it affects
the<00:03:55.209> shape<00:03:55.480> of<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.840> shadow<00:03:56.880> again<00:03:57.880> we<00:03:58.150> have

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
the shape of the shadow again we have

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.780 
the shape of the shadow again we have
our<00:03:58.389> ground<00:03:58.750> angle<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.470> the<00:04:00.220> angle<00:04:00.669> down<00:04:01.019> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
our ground angle and the angle down and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.789 
our ground angle and the angle down and
we're<00:04:03.790> going<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.030> use<00:04:04.239> them<00:04:04.569> to<00:04:05.109> calculate<00:04:05.349> the

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
we're going to use them to calculate the

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.059 
we're going to use them to calculate the
shadows<00:04:06.310> of<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:07.660> edges<00:04:08.079> which<00:04:08.889> are

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
shadows of the edges which are

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.030 
shadows of the edges which are
represented<00:04:09.609> by<00:04:09.639> the<00:04:09.760> poles<00:04:10.590> first<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:11.829> find

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
represented by the poles first we find

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.789 
represented by the poles first we find
the<00:04:12.220> ground<00:04:12.400> angles<00:04:13.319> then<00:04:14.319> we're<00:04:14.530> going<00:04:14.739> to

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
the ground angles then we're going to

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.120 
the ground angles then we're going to
use<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.370> angle<00:04:15.760> down<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:17.109> find<00:04:17.410> where<00:04:17.919> these

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
use the angle down to find where these

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.240 
use the angle down to find where these
lines<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.880> represent<00:04:19.239> shadows<00:04:20.079> end

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.150 

now<00:04:25.180> we<00:04:25.240> put<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.690> lines<00:04:25.900> back<00:04:26.200> in<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.800> make<00:04:26.980> the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
now we put the lines back in to make the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.350 
now we put the lines back in to make the
queue<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:28.020> we<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.170> see<00:04:29.790> where<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.970> edges

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
queue and we can see where the edges

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.110 
queue and we can see where the edges
would<00:04:31.630> make<00:04:31.840> shadows<00:04:32.640> notice<00:04:33.640> one<00:04:33.880> of<00:04:34.000> these

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
would make shadows notice one of these

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.190 
would make shadows notice one of these
would<00:04:34.600> happen<00:04:34.900> inside<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.620> cube<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.750> it<00:04:37.900> isn't

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
would happen inside the cube so it isn't

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.760 
would happen inside the cube so it isn't
going<00:04:38.230> to<00:04:38.470> show<00:04:38.560> up<00:04:39.600> also<00:04:40.600> because<00:04:41.380> this<00:04:41.590> is<00:04:41.650> a

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
going to show up also because this is a

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.910 
going to show up also because this is a
solid<00:04:42.190> object<00:04:42.390> supposedly<00:04:43.440> we<00:04:44.440> wouldn't<00:04:44.740> see

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
solid object supposedly we wouldn't see

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.780 
solid object supposedly we wouldn't see
this<00:04:45.130> flagpole<00:04:45.720> we<00:04:46.720> wouldn't<00:04:47.110> see<00:04:47.320> all<00:04:48.280> the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
this flagpole we wouldn't see all the

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.060 
this flagpole we wouldn't see all the
shadow<00:04:49.090> from<00:04:49.360> that<00:04:49.600> edge<00:04:52.590> now<00:04:53.590> we<00:04:53.650> have<00:04:53.950> the

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
shadow from that edge now we have the

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.370 
shadow from that edge now we have the
three<00:04:54.250> flag<00:04:54.610> poles<00:04:54.940> that<00:04:55.660> represent<00:04:56.260> the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
three flag poles that represent the

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.710 
three flag poles that represent the
edges<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.840> their<00:04:58.840> shadows<00:05:00.360> now<00:05:01.360> we<00:05:01.420> have<00:05:01.600> to

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
edges and their shadows now we have to

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.170 
edges and their shadows now we have to
find<00:05:01.900> out<00:05:02.050> how<00:05:02.200> they<00:05:02.380> link<00:05:02.530> together<00:05:03.090> well<00:05:04.090> we

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
find out how they link together well we

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.080 
find out how they link together well we
know<00:05:04.360> that<00:05:04.390> the<00:05:04.690> flag<00:05:04.930> poles<00:05:05.850> bottoms<00:05:06.850> are

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
know that the flag poles bottoms are

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.770 
know that the flag poles bottoms are
linked<00:05:07.330> by<00:05:07.450> this<00:05:07.660> line<00:05:07.870> but<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.440> would<00:05:08.800> be<00:05:08.980> in

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
linked by this line but that would be in

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.210 
linked by this line but that would be in

the shadow this line up here connects

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.800 
the shadow this line up here connects
the<00:05:15.370> two<00:05:15.520> tops<00:05:15.790> of<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.060> poles<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:19.360> tops<00:05:19.630> of

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
the two tops of the poles so the tops of

the two tops of the poles so the tops of
the<00:05:19.900> shadows<00:05:20.290> would<00:05:20.470> be<00:05:20.590> attached<00:05:22.530> now<00:05:23.530> we're

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
the shadows would be attached now we're

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.540 
the shadows would be attached now we're
getting<00:05:24.040> near<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.850> final<00:05:25.300> shadow<00:05:26.160> we<00:05:27.160> look<00:05:27.340> at

getting near the final shadow we look at

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.850 
getting near the final shadow we look at
it<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:27.850> we<00:05:28.270> realize<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:29.020> we're<00:05:29.500> not<00:05:29.620> going

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
it and we realize that we're not going

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.280 
it and we realize that we're not going
to<00:05:29.950> have<00:05:30.160> a<00:05:30.220> shadow<00:05:30.610> from<00:05:30.910> this<00:05:31.120> pole<00:05:31.390> we<00:05:32.080> did

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
to have a shadow from this pole we did

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.260 
to have a shadow from this pole we did
need<00:05:32.500> to<00:05:32.560> find<00:05:32.919> its<00:05:33.130> height<00:05:33.370> though<00:05:36.210> now<00:05:37.210> we

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
need to find its height though now we

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.000 
need to find its height though now we
have<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.750> shape<00:05:37.990> of<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.230> shadow<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.890> would

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
have the shape of the shadow that would

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.610 
have the shape of the shadow that would
be<00:05:39.130> cast<00:05:39.430> by<00:05:39.729> this<00:05:39.790> cube<00:05:40.330> if<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.380> light<00:05:41.590> was

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
be cast by this cube if the light was

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.310 
be cast by this cube if the light was
coming<00:05:41.830> from<00:05:42.310> the<00:05:42.460> two<00:05:42.610> angles<00:05:43.140> we<00:05:44.140> have

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
coming from the two angles we have

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.460 
coming from the two angles we have
decided<00:05:44.590> upon<00:05:45.750> here<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:46.810> is<00:05:46.900> with<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.080> shaded

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
decided upon here it is with the shaded

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.730 
decided upon here it is with the shaded
side<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:48.010> here<00:05:49.000> is<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.210> shaded<00:05:49.600> side<00:05:49.810> with

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
side and here is the shaded side with

00:05:50.740 --> 00:06:00.660 
side and here is the shaded side with
the<00:05:50.919> shadow

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.730
