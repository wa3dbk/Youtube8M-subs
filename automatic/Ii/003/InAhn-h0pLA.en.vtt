foot<00:02:13.980> articulation<00:02:14.849> so<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:16.110> could<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.409> some

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
foot articulation so you could get some

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.190

very<00:02:16.890> limited<00:02:17.250> poses<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.330> whole<00:02:18.720> lot<00:02:19.170> of

very limited poses not a whole lot of

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.140 
very limited poses not a whole lot of
poses<00:02:19.769> but<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.099> can<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.909> some<00:02:21.530> though<00:02:23.150> you're

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
poses but you can get some though you're

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.880 
poses but you can get some though you're
just<00:02:24.180> better<00:02:24.690> off<00:02:24.780> kind<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.260> leaving<00:02:25.590> them<00:02:25.709> in

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
just better off kind of leaving them in

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.140 
just better off kind of leaving them in
static<00:02:26.430> standing<00:02:26.940> pose<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.930> works<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.680> guess

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
static standing pose this works I guess

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.850 
static standing pose this works I guess
but<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.629> is<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.290> best<00:02:31.470> you're<00:02:31.709> going

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
but this is really the best you're going

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.750 
but this is really the best you're going
to<00:02:31.920> be<00:02:31.980> able<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.400> do<00:02:34.040> Prime's<00:02:35.040> transformation

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
to be able to do Prime's transformation

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.369 
to be able to do Prime's transformation
is<00:02:35.879> probably<00:02:36.360> one<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.840> easiest

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
is probably one of the easiest

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.199 
is probably one of the easiest
transformations<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.459> seen<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.970> long

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
transformations I have seen in a long

00:02:39.209 --> 00:03:08.339 
transformations I have seen in a long
time<00:02:39.269> so<00:02:40.170> let's<00:02:40.560> go<00:02:40.739> ahead<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.190> get<00:02:41.519> into<00:02:41.700> it

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.929 

if<00:03:09.349> I'm<00:03:09.590> honest<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.159> is<00:03:10.219> probably<00:03:10.760> one<00:03:10.909> of

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
if I'm honest that is probably one of

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.910 
if I'm honest that is probably one of
the<00:03:11.090> most<00:03:11.209> dull<00:03:11.510> transformations<00:03:12.439> I've<00:03:12.650> seen

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the most dull transformations I've seen

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.009 
the most dull transformations I've seen
on<00:03:13.099> a<00:03:13.129> deluxe<00:03:13.489> er<00:03:13.700> sorry<00:03:14.120> warrior<00:03:14.689> class

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
on a deluxe er sorry warrior class

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.550 
on a deluxe er sorry warrior class
figure<00:03:15.469> in<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:16.219> very<00:03:16.670> long<00:03:17.000> time<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:17.719> think<00:03:18.260> it's

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
figure in a very long time I think it's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.990 
figure in a very long time I think it's
up<00:03:18.920> there<00:03:19.159> with<00:03:19.840> arachnid<00:03:20.840> levels<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:22.000> boredom

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
up there with arachnid levels of boredom

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.380 
up there with arachnid levels of boredom
the<00:03:23.209> vehicle<00:03:23.959> mode<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:24.200> end<00:03:24.349> up<00:03:24.530> with<00:03:24.739> is

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
the vehicle mode you end up with is

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.229 
the vehicle mode you end up with is
again<00:03:26.390> just<00:03:27.109> dull<00:03:27.609> yeah<00:03:28.609> there's<00:03:28.819> this<00:03:29.000> big

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
again just dull yeah there's this big

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.390 
again just dull yeah there's this big
red<00:03:29.540> splotch<00:03:30.200> on<00:03:30.439> the<00:03:30.500> side<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.010> vehicle

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
red splotch on the side of the vehicle

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.580 
red splotch on the side of the vehicle
mode<00:03:31.519> but<00:03:31.879> other<00:03:32.389> than<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:32.810> there's<00:03:33.260> no

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
mode but other than that there's no

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.149 
mode but other than that there's no
detailing<00:03:34.569> color<00:03:35.569> wise<00:03:36.019> there's<00:03:36.739> a<00:03:36.799> bunch<00:03:37.040> of

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
detailing color wise there's a bunch of

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.069 
detailing color wise there's a bunch of
panel<00:03:37.609> lining<00:03:37.970> which<00:03:38.120> I<00:03:38.269> appreciate<00:03:38.870> and

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
panel lining which I appreciate and

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.199 
panel lining which I appreciate and
there<00:03:39.170> is<00:03:39.290> some<00:03:39.470> decent<00:03:39.859> molding<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:40.760> there's

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
there is some decent molding but there's

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.960 
there is some decent molding but there's
no<00:03:41.659> color<00:03:42.560> it's<00:03:43.549> red<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.329> blue<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.700> I

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
no color it's red and blue that's it I

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.059 
no color it's red and blue that's it I
add<00:03:47.599> some<00:03:47.840> black<00:03:48.079> highlights<00:03:48.379> here<00:03:48.799> and<00:03:48.950> there

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
add some black highlights here and there

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.069 
add some black highlights here and there
I<00:03:49.250> do<00:03:49.579> appreciate<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.359> they<00:03:50.659> actually

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
I do appreciate that they actually

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.629 
I do appreciate that they actually
colored<00:03:51.409> in<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> smokestacks<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.489> is<00:03:52.609> a

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
colored in the smokestacks that is a

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.670 
colored in the smokestacks that is a
plus<00:03:52.939> but<00:03:53.569> I<00:03:53.629> would<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.200> see<00:03:54.379> some<00:03:54.560> other

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
plus but I would like to see some other

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.920 
plus but I would like to see some other
highlights<00:03:55.129> maybe<00:03:55.819> fill<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.329> these<00:03:56.480> grille

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
highlights maybe fill in these grille

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.740 
highlights maybe fill in these grille
holes<00:03:57.319> or<00:03:57.680> air<00:03:57.829> holes<00:03:58.129> with<00:03:58.400> black<00:03:58.700> maybe<00:03:59.510> do

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
holes or air holes with black maybe do

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.720 
holes or air holes with black maybe do
some<00:03:59.959> panel<00:04:00.409> lining<00:04:00.769> around<00:04:00.889> the<00:04:01.129> figure<00:04:01.370> in

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
some panel lining around the figure in

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.020 
some panel lining around the figure in
fact<00:04:02.299> I'll<00:04:02.450> probably<00:04:02.810> end<00:04:03.290> up<00:04:03.439> doing<00:04:03.650> that

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
fact I'll probably end up doing that

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.170 
fact I'll probably end up doing that
overall<00:04:05.030> transformation<00:04:06.019> is<00:04:06.409> dull<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:07.180> the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
overall transformation is dull and the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.379 
overall transformation is dull and the

overall robe or vehicle mode is equally

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.930 
overall robe or vehicle mode is equally
boring<00:04:11.629> and<00:04:12.500> I've<00:04:12.709> not<00:04:13.159> really<00:04:13.519> found<00:04:13.729> a<00:04:13.909> good

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
boring and I've not really found a good

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.710 
boring and I've not really found a good
place<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.690> store<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.379> weapon<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:16.419> think<00:04:17.419> it

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
place to store the weapon I think it

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.349 
place to store the weapon I think it
stores<00:04:18.169> back<00:04:18.650> here<00:04:19.159> because<00:04:19.400> there's<00:04:19.849> there

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
stores back here because there's there

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.870 
stores back here because there's there
are<00:04:20.479> two<00:04:20.659> pegs<00:04:21.039> right<00:04:22.039> there<00:04:22.310> on<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> inside

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
are two pegs right there on the inside

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.450 
are two pegs right there on the inside
of<00:04:23.060> his<00:04:23.180> robot<00:04:23.510> legs<00:04:23.810> and<00:04:24.139> right<00:04:24.979> at<00:04:25.130> the<00:04:25.220> tips

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
of his robot legs and right at the tips

of his robot legs and right at the tips
of<00:04:25.550> my<00:04:25.610> thumb<00:04:26.030> there<00:04:26.360> are<00:04:26.510> some<00:04:26.810> pegs<00:04:27.409> slide

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
of my thumb there are some pegs slide

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.689 
of my thumb there are some pegs slide
not<00:04:28.639> peg<00:04:28.940> holes<00:04:29.240> but<00:04:30.460> indentations<00:04:31.460> that

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
not peg holes but indentations that

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.390 
not peg holes but indentations that
looks<00:04:32.210> like<00:04:32.389> pegs<00:04:32.690> can<00:04:32.990> slide<00:04:33.289> in<00:04:33.470> there<00:04:33.710> so

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
looks like pegs can slide in there so

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.490 
looks like pegs can slide in there so
that<00:04:34.550> means<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.270> goes<00:04:35.449> on<00:04:35.659> like<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.930> and

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
that means that it goes on like that and

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.379 
that means that it goes on like that and
you<00:04:37.159> know<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.340> looks<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.539> equally<00:04:39.380> as<00:04:39.590> bad

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
you know that looks just equally as bad

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.089 
you know that looks just equally as bad
at<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.630> end<00:04:41.780> of<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.930> day<00:04:42.080> I<00:04:42.110> cannot<00:04:42.680> recommend
