them<00:01:08.130> time<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.479> might<00:01:09.720> start<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.049> dry<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.500> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
them time it might start to dry up a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.310 
them time it might start to dry up a
little<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.220> lose<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> lovely

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
like to apply this in a thin layer and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.800 
like to apply this in a thin layer and
very<00:01:25.290> often<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:25.950> go<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.640> apply<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
very often I will go in and apply a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.600 
very often I will go in and apply a
second<00:01:28.290> layer<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.920> fill<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.250> some<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
second layer just to fill it up some of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.780 
second layer just to fill it up some of
the<00:01:29.850> UM<00:01:30.290> coverage<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.460> can

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the UM coverage a little bit as you can

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
the UM coverage a little bit as you can
see<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.390> get<00:01:33.540> some<00:01:33.810> decent<00:01:33.990> coverage

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
see you can get some decent coverage

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980 
see you can get some decent coverage
there<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> don't<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.630> apply<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
there and but I don't like to apply it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.590 
there and but I don't like to apply it
too<00:01:37.290> thickly<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.670> otherwise<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.299> find

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
too thickly in one go otherwise I find

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440 
too thickly in one go otherwise I find
that<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.229> crease<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:41.009> don't<00:01:41.939> typically

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that it can crease I don't typically

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
that it can crease I don't typically
wear<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> primer<00:01:43.890> underneath

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
wear this with a primer underneath

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.460 
wear this with a primer underneath
although<00:01:44.909> I'm<00:01:45.119> sure<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.600> did<00:01:45.780> use<00:01:46.079> an<00:01:46.290> eye

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
although I'm sure if you did use an eye

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
although I'm sure if you did use an eye
primer<00:01:46.500> underneath<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.880> would<00:01:48.060> extend<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
primer underneath it would extend the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.960 
primer underneath it would extend the
wear<00:01:48.780> time<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.439> maybe<00:01:50.070> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> experienced

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
wear time and maybe if you experienced

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.300 
wear time and maybe if you experienced
any<00:01:51.119> problems<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.689> creasing<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:53.040> might

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
any problems with creasing that might

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.219 
any problems with creasing that might
help<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.970> alleviate<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.659> issue

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
help to alleviate that issue

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.830 
help to alleviate that issue
this<00:01:55.890> has<00:01:56.130> creased<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.700> me<00:01:56.880> maybe<00:01:57.119> once<00:01:57.600> or

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
this has creased on me maybe once or

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.539 
this has creased on me maybe once or
twice<00:01:57.899> when<00:01:58.439> I've<00:01:58.560> worn<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> think

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
twice when I've worn it but I think

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
twice when I've worn it but I think
that's<00:01:59.700> when<00:01:59.850> I've<00:01:59.969> kind<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.299> piled<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> on<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that's when I've kind of piled it on a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600 
that's when I've kind of piled it on a
little<00:02:01.049> bit<00:02:01.200> too<00:02:01.350> thickly<00:02:01.649> there<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.460> been

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
little bit too thickly there have been

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.639 
little bit too thickly there have been
many<00:02:02.909> days<00:02:03.180> where<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:03.750> worn<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.469> day

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
many days where I've worn this all day

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.459 
many days where I've worn this all day
long<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.520> has<00:02:05.700> increased<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.360> me<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.110> I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
long and it has increased on me at all I

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.249 
long and it has increased on me at all I
just<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.550> it's<00:02:08.700> wonderful<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.539> love<00:02:09.899> they

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
just think it's wonderful I love they

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.490 
just think it's wonderful I love they
almost<00:02:10.849> multi<00:02:11.849> dimension

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
almost multi dimension

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.220 
almost multi dimension
the<00:02:12.590> fact<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.610> shimmy<00:02:13.970> gives<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.480> it's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
the fact that the shimmy gives it it's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.290 
the fact that the shimmy gives it it's
just<00:02:15.440> really<00:02:15.740> nice<00:02:16.040> obviously<00:02:16.610> ideal<00:02:17.060> for

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
just really nice obviously ideal for

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.390 
just really nice obviously ideal for
this<00:02:17.390> time<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.690> year<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.260> think<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
this time of year but I think that the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.370 
this time of year but I think that the
shimmer<00:02:19.640> isn't<00:02:20.090> too<00:02:20.360> much<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:21.050> don't<00:02:21.200> think

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
shimmer isn't too much I don't think

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.290 
shimmer isn't too much I don't think
it's<00:02:21.620> too<00:02:21.920> in-your-face<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:22.940> think<00:02:23.150> it's

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
it's too in-your-face I don't think it's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's too in-your-face I don't think it's
too<00:02:23.660> overwhelming<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.950> think<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.280> just

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
too overwhelming I think it's just

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.070 
too overwhelming I think it's just
something<00:02:25.820> that<00:02:25.850> would<00:02:26.180> catch<00:02:26.420> people's<00:02:26.930> eyes

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
something that would catch people's eyes

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.900 
something that would catch people's eyes
and<00:02:27.110> they'd<00:02:27.530> be<00:02:27.590> like<00:02:27.740> oh<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.460> know<00:02:28.610> that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
and they'd be like oh you know that

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.940 
and they'd be like oh you know that
looks<00:02:29.120> nice<00:02:29.300> it's<00:02:29.780> nice<00:02:29.959> an<00:02:30.140> eye-catching<00:02:30.560> but

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
looks nice it's nice an eye-catching but

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.360 
looks nice it's nice an eye-catching but
not<00:02:31.130> in-your-face<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.620> don't<00:02:33.980> really

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
not in-your-face and so I don't really

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.860 
not in-your-face and so I don't really
know<00:02:34.490> what<00:02:34.670> else<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.910> say<00:02:35.060> about<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.720> really

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
know what else to say about it really

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.510 
know what else to say about it really
other<00:02:36.050> than<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.500> really<00:02:36.860> nice<00:02:37.040> product

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
other than it's a really nice product

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.970 
other than it's a really nice product
I've<00:02:38.209> not<00:02:38.420> been<00:02:38.600> using<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.990> so<00:02:39.290> much<00:02:39.350> as<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> base

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
I've not been using it so much as a base

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.120 
I've not been using it so much as a base
more<00:02:40.459> just<00:02:40.730> as<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:40.940> quick<00:02:41.360> easy<00:02:42.230> kind<00:02:42.980> of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
couple of times I have used it as a base

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.610 
couple of times I have used it as a base
and<00:02:47.000> put<00:02:47.209> it<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.690> top<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.020> that's<00:02:48.380> worked

even<00:03:10.310> better<00:03:10.610> for<00:03:10.970> me<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:11.570> a<00:03:12.130> really<00:03:13.130> nice

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.100 
even better for me so a really nice
product<00:03:13.610> something<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.239> really<00:03:14.600> enjoyed<00:03:14.930> using

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
product something I really enjoyed using

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.699 
product something I really enjoyed using
and<00:03:15.560> I<00:03:15.830> would<00:03:16.610> recommend<00:03:17.330> trying<00:03:17.780> these<00:03:18.110> I'm

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
and I would recommend trying these I'm

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.090 
and I would recommend trying these I'm
not<00:03:19.070> necessarily<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.820> biggest<00:03:20.120> fan<00:03:20.390> of<00:03:21.100> cream

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
not necessarily the biggest fan of cream

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.880 
not necessarily the biggest fan of cream
eyeshadows<00:03:22.580> because<00:03:23.480> they<00:03:23.720> tend<00:03:24.140> not<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.530> have

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
eyeshadows because they tend not to have

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.920 
eyeshadows because they tend not to have
the<00:03:25.100> best<00:03:25.390> pigmentation<00:03:26.390> they<00:03:26.540> tend<00:03:26.840> to

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
the best pigmentation they tend to

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.440 
the best pigmentation they tend to
crease<00:03:27.260> however<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.430> one<00:03:28.640> has<00:03:28.670> definitely

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
crease however this one has definitely

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.890 
crease however this one has definitely
made<00:03:30.230> me<00:03:30.410> feel<00:03:30.440> like<00:03:31.100> okay<00:03:31.970> maybe<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:32.540> want<00:03:32.810> to

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
made me feel like okay maybe I want to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.690 
made me feel like okay maybe I want to
try<00:03:33.049> a<00:03:33.080> few<00:03:33.350> more<00:03:33.410> cream<00:03:33.830> eyeshadows<00:03:34.280> because

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
try a few more cream eyeshadows because

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.740 
try a few more cream eyeshadows because
I<00:03:34.730> really<00:03:35.120> do<00:03:35.239> like<00:03:35.480> these<00:03:36.380> kind<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:37.690> kind<00:03:38.690> of

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
I really do like these kind of kind of

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.830 
I really do like these kind of kind of
modern<00:03:39.110> type<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.830> eye<00:03:40.010> shadows<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.360> they

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
modern type of eye shadows that they

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.990 
modern type of eye shadows that they
work<00:03:42.140> there's<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:42.799> much<00:03:42.950> better<00:03:43.160> than<00:03:43.579> they

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
work there's so much better than they
