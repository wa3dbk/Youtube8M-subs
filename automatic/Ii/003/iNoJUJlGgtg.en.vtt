00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.830 
fit it over the two pieces of the rod
and<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:55.379> I'm<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> use<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> my

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
and then I'm going to use some of my

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.389 
and then I'm going to use some of my
some<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:57.989> urethane<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.829> used<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.190> cast

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
some of my urethane that I used to cast

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
some of my urethane that I used to cast
lures<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.510> kind<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> fill<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.260> tubing

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
lures here to kind of fill up the tubing

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.399 
lures here to kind of fill up the tubing
and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.270> attach<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.480> rod<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:04.170> together

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
and then attach the rod back together

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.070 
and then attach the rod back together
and<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.540> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.689> work

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and I think it's going to work

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.359 
and I think it's going to work
so<00:01:07.590> let's<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.040> show<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
the rod out of that then I took a paper

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.559 
the rod out of that then I took a paper
clip<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.429> urethane<00:01:49.759> with<00:01:50.179> a<00:01:50.209> two-part

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
clip and the urethane with a two-part

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:51.940 
clip and the urethane with a two-part
urethane<00:01:50.719> all<00:01:51.140> mixed<00:01:51.439> up<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.679> I<00:01:51.770> basically

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
urethane all mixed up and I basically

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.919 
urethane all mixed up and I basically
just<00:01:52.219> took<00:01:52.939> that<00:01:53.090> paper<00:01:53.270> clip<00:01:53.599> and<00:01:53.719> kept

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
just took that paper clip and kept

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.050 
just took that paper clip and kept
shoving<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.560> urethane<00:01:55.189> down<00:01:55.579> that<00:01:55.819> tube

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
shoving the urethane down that tube

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.350 
shoving the urethane down that tube
until<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.450> got<00:01:56.659> it<00:01:56.750> filled<00:01:56.989> up<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.409> then<00:01:58.369> push

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
until I got it filled up and then push

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.899 
until I got it filled up and then push
the<00:01:59.509> tip<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.840> rod<00:01:59.989> in<00:02:00.319> there<00:02:00.610> lined<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.789> up

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
the tip of the rod in there lined it up

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.490 
the tip of the rod in there lined it up
so<00:02:02.119> that<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.360> guides<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:02.899> know<00:02:02.989> that<00:02:03.409> the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
so that the guides you know that the

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.619 
so that the guides you know that the
guides<00:02:03.709> were<00:02:03.950> in<00:02:04.039> line<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.549> then<00:02:05.299> made<00:02:05.599> sure

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:05.629 
guides were in line and then made sure

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:07.859 
guides were in line and then made sure
it<00:02:05.840> stayed<00:02:06.079> that<00:02:06.259> way<00:02:06.319> until<00:02:06.469> it<00:02:06.920> hardened<00:02:07.280> and

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
it stayed that way until it hardened and

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.180 
it stayed that way until it hardened and
I've<00:02:08.869> taken<00:02:09.079> it<00:02:09.200> apart<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:11.829> so<00:02:12.829> now<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.069> I've

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
I've taken it apart and so now that I've

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.890 
I've taken it apart and so now that I've
taken<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.549> apart<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.030> looks<00:02:14.239> like<00:02:14.420> it's<00:02:14.660> a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
taken it apart and it looks like it's a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.990 
taken it apart and it looks like it's a
pretty<00:02:15.860> solid<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.400> I'm<00:02:16.459> gonna<00:02:16.579> let<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.730> dry

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
pretty solid so I'm gonna let it dry

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.539 
pretty solid so I'm gonna let it dry
overnight<00:02:17.269> now<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.280> may

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
overnight now and I think that I may

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.509 
overnight now and I think that I may
have<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:20.000> fixed<00:02:20.329> my<00:02:20.540> rod<00:02:20.780> um<00:02:21.220> obviously<00:02:22.220> time

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
have just fixed my rod um obviously time

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.680 
have just fixed my rod um obviously time
will<00:02:22.700> tell<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.000> I'll<00:02:23.090> take<00:02:23.299> this<00:02:23.389> thing<00:02:23.540> out

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
will tell and I'll take this thing out

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.229 
will tell and I'll take this thing out
fishing<00:02:24.019> here<00:02:24.170> tomorrow<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.889> find<00:02:25.880> out<00:02:26.030> if

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
fishing here tomorrow and find out if

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.220 
fishing here tomorrow and find out if
I've<00:02:26.359> actually<00:02:26.540> fixed<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:26.989> but<00:02:27.079> I'm<00:02:27.200> pretty

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
I've actually fixed it but I'm pretty

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.809 
I've actually fixed it but I'm pretty
confident<00:02:27.799> I<00:02:27.889> think<00:02:28.099> I've<00:02:28.220> actually<00:02:28.400> got<00:02:28.670> this

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
confident I think I've actually got this

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.120 
confident I think I've actually got this
sucker<00:02:29.109> sucker<00:02:30.109> fixed<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.680> probably<00:02:30.980> will

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
sucker sucker fixed and it probably will

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.110 
sucker sucker fixed and it probably will
suffer<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> little<00:02:32.359> bit<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.780> performance<00:02:34.120> but

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
suffer a little bit of performance but

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.699 
suffer a little bit of performance but
maybe<00:02:35.510> not<00:02:35.750> even<00:02:35.900> enough<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:36.380> would<00:02:36.470> ever

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
maybe not even enough that I would ever

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.740 
maybe not even enough that I would ever
even<00:02:36.799> notice<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.790> we'll<00:02:38.120> find<00:02:38.269> out<00:02:38.420> I'll<00:02:38.599> take

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
even notice so we'll find out I'll take

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.089 
even notice so we'll find out I'll take
it<00:02:38.870> fishin<00:02:39.139> and<00:02:39.319> I'll<00:02:39.470> report<00:02:40.160> back<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:43.010> I'm

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
has worked

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.520 
has worked
it's<00:02:48.469> worked<00:02:48.709> fantastic<00:02:49.519> had<00:02:50.180> about<00:02:50.530> 16

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
it's worked fantastic had about 16

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.110 
it's worked fantastic had about 16
winter<00:02:51.709> time<00:02:51.920> now<00:02:52.129> I've<00:02:52.639> been<00:02:52.730> at<00:02:52.849> walleye

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
winter time now I've been at walleye

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.610 
winter time now I've been at walleye
fishing<00:02:53.450> several<00:02:53.870> times<00:02:54.049> with<00:02:54.319> it<00:02:54.439> it's

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
fishing several times with it it's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.239 
fishing several times with it it's
worked<00:02:54.829> great

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:55.249 
worked great

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.949 
worked great
I<00:02:55.280> honestly<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.790> can't<00:02:56.180> tell<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.930> difference

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
I honestly I can't tell the difference

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.809 
I honestly I can't tell the difference
between<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.769> way<00:02:57.889> it<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.099> now<00:02:58.219> fixed<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
between the way it is now fixed and the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.940 
between the way it is now fixed and the
way<00:02:58.939> it<00:02:59.030> was<00:02:59.180> before<00:02:59.359> growth<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.200> I<00:03:00.439> think<00:03:00.799> this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
way it was before growth so I think this

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.679 
way it was before growth so I think this
is<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.099> great<00:03:01.370> way<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.549> fix<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.879> rods<00:03:02.090> hopefully

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:02.689 
is a great way to fix the rods hopefully

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.799 
is a great way to fix the rods hopefully
it'll<00:03:03.409> work<00:03:03.530> for<00:03:03.709> you
