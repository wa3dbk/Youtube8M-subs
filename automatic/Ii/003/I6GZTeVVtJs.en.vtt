00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.090
 border edged 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.350
 no peak 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.530
 estimated m 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 his first thing 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.420

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.279
 time on reboot as 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.849

 they are not one or the other that other day 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:01.669

 backups 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:06.339
 sections 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.299

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.299
 programs what services are not 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.119

 her application rub very nice protection 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.459
 let's move the backup 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.459
 copying multiple deals 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.469
 before the match 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:42.469
 if the moment he himself was generous 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:47.279
 What is the model of some other arch system 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.989

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.269
 such that it was never bought before 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.059
 they gigolashvili 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.139
 choose m destination 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.509
 stored backup external meetings 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.899
 there is no court close 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.979
 but for keeping backups bright 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.669
 important documents attempts and here I am to you 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.509
 recommend using 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:16.299
 removable media is external hard 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.849
 the disk was not in the disk 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.249
 all frames 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:23.309
 it is not very 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:26.309
 but that means we looked 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.589
 chose a storage place 

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:30.379
 copies 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.379

 UAH sorting started after 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.150
 create backups 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.930
 if God forbid later 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.370
 system clouds firsthand
