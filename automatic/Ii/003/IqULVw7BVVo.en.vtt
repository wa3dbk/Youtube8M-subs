00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.270 
actually level with the top edge of the
cake<00:00:36.630> because<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> don't<00:00:37.890> want<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280

like this
the<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.770> doesn't<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.100> matter<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the it doesn't really matter what it

looks<00:00:41.550> like<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> bottom<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.360> can

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
looks like on the bottom because you can

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.910 
looks like on the bottom because you can
always<00:00:42.960> put<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> border<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:43.800> or

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
always put a border on there or

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.889 
always put a border on there or
something<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.420> want<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> very

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899

gently kind of roll this around and this

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.990 
gently kind of roll this around and this
is<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.399> confectioner<00:00:50.910> sugar<00:00:50.940> buttercream<00:00:51.680> that

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
is a confectioner sugar buttercream that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.459 
is a confectioner sugar buttercream that
will<00:00:54.000> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> crust<00:00:54.539> over<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.289> press

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
will kind of crust over so I can press

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
will kind of crust over so I can press
into<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:55.920> bit<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.510> it's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
into it a little bit and you see it's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:58.670 
into it a little bit and you see it's
putting<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> pattern<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.649> very

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
putting the pattern on there it's very

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.939 
putting the pattern on there it's very
light<00:00:59.039> but<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.520> enough<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.879> me<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.090> sing<00:01:00.949> so

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
light but it's enough for me to sing so

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.290 
light but it's enough for me to sing so
you<00:01:02.010> work<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.399> way<00:01:02.489> around<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.940> cake<00:01:03.120> like

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you work your way around the cake like

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.390 
you work your way around the cake like
that

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:16.480 
that
you<00:01:05.400> see<00:01:06.650> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> make<00:01:07.830> sure<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.070> lines<00:01:08.310> up

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.950 

now<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.939> deep<00:01:18.240> enough<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
now if you do this deep enough and it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410 
now if you do this deep enough and it
looks<00:01:19.140> okay<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.740> leave<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.970> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
looks okay you can just leave this but I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.649 
looks okay you can just leave this but I
usually<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.259> with<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> skewer<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:24.479> make

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
usually go back with a skewer to make

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.219 
usually go back with a skewer to make
sure<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.500> look<00:01:25.560> alright<00:01:27.170> when<00:01:28.170> you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
sure it's going to look alright when you

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
sure it's going to look alright when you
get<00:01:28.350> around<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.220> probably<00:01:30.090> not

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
get around here it's probably not

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
get around here it's probably not
actually<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.380> time<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.650> actually<00:01:31.950> did<00:01:32.130> kind

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
actually this time it actually did kind

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.310 
actually this time it actually did kind
of<00:01:32.430> line<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.729> exactly<00:01:33.180> right<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:34.140> probably

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
of line up exactly right it's probably

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.190 
of line up exactly right it's probably
not<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.220> exactly<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:36.079> where<00:01:37.079> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
not going to be exactly right where you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.130 
not going to be exactly right where you
started<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.710> where<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.009> ended<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.020> then<00:01:40.020> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
started and where you ended and then of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.450 
started and where you ended and then of
course<00:01:40.350> little<00:01:40.500> fibers<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> cakes

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
course little fibers get on the cakes

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.850 
course little fibers get on the cakes
you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:41.729> pull<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> off<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.680> every

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
you can pull that off but you know every

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.679 
you can pull that off but you know every
cake<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> back<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.030> unless<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
cake has a back so unless you have a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.850 
cake has a back so unless you have a
cake<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:45.960> people<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.350> going<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> be<00:01:46.590> looking

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
cake that people are going to be looking

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.889 
cake that people are going to be looking
at<00:01:47.009> cake<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> round<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.329> not<00:01:48.509> such<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> big

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
at cake in the round it's not such a big

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.670 
at cake in the round it's not such a big
deal<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> doesn't<00:01:49.860> line<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> perfectly<00:01:50.509> so

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
deal if it doesn't line it perfectly so

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.039 
deal if it doesn't line it perfectly so
part<00:01:52.680> two<00:01:53.240> now<00:01:54.240> you've<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.689> marks<00:01:54.930> on

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
part two now you've got the marks on

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.289 
part two now you've got the marks on
there<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.040> start<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
there you want to start with a just a

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
there you want to start with a just a
wooden<00:01:57.450> skewer<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.960> carefully<00:01:58.469> put<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
wooden skewer very carefully put this

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.420 
wooden skewer very carefully put this
here<00:01:59.909> line<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> up<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.200> line<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:02.340> know

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
here line it up with the line you know

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.179 
here line it up with the line you know
and<00:02:02.549> drag<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.420> slightly<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.890> don't<00:02:05.070> want

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and drag it just slightly you don't want

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.310 
and drag it just slightly you don't want
to<00:02:05.250> really<00:02:05.399> dig<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.880> there<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:07.259> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
to really dig it in there just kind of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.650 
to really dig it in there just kind of
press<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.979> drag<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:09.149> bit<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
press it and drag it a little bit and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.490 
press it and drag it a little bit and
you<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:09.929> have<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.170> go<00:02:10.259> all<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.560> up

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you don't have to go all the way up

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.610 
you don't have to go all the way up
because<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.980> will<00:02:12.220> dig<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.400> cake<00:02:12.640> out<00:02:12.820> and

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
because that will dig the cake out and

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.930 
because that will dig the cake out and
you're<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.800> go<00:02:14.920> all<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.160> way<00:02:15.250> around<00:02:15.670> if

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
you're going to go all the way around if

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.850 
you're going to go all the way around if
you're<00:02:16.540> dragging<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.530> bit<00:02:17.710> then

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you're dragging it a little bit then

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.780 
you're dragging it a little bit then
that<00:02:17.980> will<00:02:18.070> put<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.220> little<00:02:18.430> bit<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.610> pressure

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
that will put a little bit of pressure

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.670 
that will put a little bit of pressure
on<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.060> icing<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.540> won't<00:02:19.750> rip<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.350> icing

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
on the icing and it won't rip the icing

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.410 
on the icing and it won't rip the icing
if<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.370> just<00:02:21.580> stick<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:21.970> there<00:02:22.090> then<00:02:22.240> pull

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
if you just stick it in there then pull

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.880 
if you just stick it in there then pull
it<00:02:22.540> out<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:22.870> going<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.050> make<00:02:23.200> a<00:02:23.230> big<00:02:23.530> mark<00:02:23.710> and

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
it out it's going to make a big mark and

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.240 
it out it's going to make a big mark and
that's<00:02:23.950> not<00:02:24.130> going<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.340> be<00:02:24.430> good<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:26.010> just<00:02:27.010> drag

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
that's not going to be good so just drag

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.970 
that's not going to be good so just drag
it<00:02:27.460> very<00:02:28.060> gently<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.110> if<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.710> it<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.860> little

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
it very gently and if you do it a little

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.470 
it very gently and if you do it a little
bit<00:02:30.160> let's<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:30.790> that's<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.000> little<00:02:31.090> bit<00:02:31.300> deep

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
bit let's see that's a little bit deep

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.580 
bit let's see that's a little bit deep
so<00:02:31.840> you're<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.110> be<00:02:32.170> able<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.320> go<00:02:32.440> back

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
so you're going to be able to go back

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.620 
so you're going to be able to go back
and<00:02:32.740> just<00:02:32.890> press<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.100> down<00:02:33.280> or<00:02:34.270> smooth<00:02:34.510> it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
and just press that down or smooth it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.810 
and just press that down or smooth it
out<00:02:34.720> with<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.990> smoother<00:02:35.550> once<00:02:36.550> you're<00:02:36.700> ready

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
out with the smoother once you're ready

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.240 
out with the smoother once you're ready
and<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.180> keep<00:02:37.450> cleaning<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.440> skewer<00:02:38.740> off<00:02:38.920> so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
and just keep cleaning the skewer off so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.350 
and just keep cleaning the skewer off so
that<00:02:39.280> doesn't<00:02:39.550> have<00:02:39.730> icing<00:02:40.030> on<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:42.060> go<00:02:43.060> all<00:02:43.210> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
that doesn't have icing on it go all the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.320 
that doesn't have icing on it go all the
way<00:02:43.480> around<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:45.670> basically<00:02:45.820> just<00:02:46.030> go<00:02:46.209> all

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
way around so you basically just go all

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.480 
way around so you basically just go all
the<00:02:46.390> way<00:02:46.450> around<00:02:47.010> make<00:02:48.010> these<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.220> little<00:02:48.430> bit

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
the way around make these a little bit

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.470 
the way around make these a little bit
deeper<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:52.770> let's<00:02:53.770> see<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:55.030> see<00:02:55.180> this<00:02:55.300> one

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
deeper and let's see now see this one

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.300 
deeper and let's see now see this one
didn't<00:02:55.660> exactly<00:02:55.900> line<00:02:56.200> up<00:02:56.230> right<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.130> just

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
didn't exactly line up right so just

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.380 
didn't exactly line up right so just
make<00:02:57.430> sure<00:02:57.580> that<00:02:57.610> when<00:02:57.850> you're<00:02:57.970> doing<00:02:58.240> it

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
make sure that when you're doing it

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.880 
make sure that when you're doing it
you're<00:02:58.600> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.900> hitting<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.470> right<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.800> the

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
you're kind of hitting it right in the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.910 
you're kind of hitting it right in the
middle<00:03:01.050> and<00:03:02.050> I<00:03:02.140> could<00:03:02.290> feel<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.680> going<00:03:02.860> a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
middle and I could feel that was going a

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.080 
middle and I could feel that was going a
little<00:03:02.950> bit<00:03:03.160> deeper<00:03:03.430> into<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.670> icing<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.030> I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
little bit deeper into the icing so I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.850 
little bit deeper into the icing so I
kept<00:03:04.270> going<00:03:04.420> with<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.810> instead<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.500> pulling<00:03:05.650> it

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
kept going with it instead of pulling it

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.980 
kept going with it instead of pulling it
on<00:03:06.060> if<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.180> feel<00:03:07.360> that<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:07.630> dragging<00:03:07.840> the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
on if you feel that it's dragging the

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.420 
on if you feel that it's dragging the
icing<00:03:08.320> too<00:03:08.440> much<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:08.800> let<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:08.980> icing<00:03:09.100> sit

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
icing too much just let the icing sit

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.500 
icing too much just let the icing sit
for<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.580> little<00:03:09.760> bit<00:03:09.850> longer<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.770> kind<00:03:11.770> of

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
for a little bit longer to kind of

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.730 
for a little bit longer to kind of
solidify<00:03:13.510> a<00:03:13.540> little<00:03:13.750> bit<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.500> can<00:03:14.620> do

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
solidify a little bit and you can do

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.660 
solidify a little bit and you can do
this<00:03:14.860> if<00:03:15.010> you<00:03:15.100> want<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.310> stick<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.519> in<00:03:15.580> the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
this if you want to stick it in the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.880 
this if you want to stick it in the
fridge<00:03:15.820> just<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.120> make<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:17.290> little<00:03:17.650> stiffer

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
fridge just to make it a little stiffer

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.890 
fridge just to make it a little stiffer
this<00:03:18.760> will<00:03:18.940> be<00:03:19.030> the<00:03:19.150> back<00:03:19.269> because<00:03:19.570> I<00:03:19.630> can<00:03:19.780> see

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
this will be the back because I can see

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.120 
this will be the back because I can see
that<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.110> space<00:03:20.230> between<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:20.800> one<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.070> this

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
that the space between this one and this

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.440 
that the space between this one and this
one<00:03:21.190> is<00:03:21.400> different<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.970> that's<00:03:22.150> where<00:03:22.360> it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
one is different so that's where it

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.540 
one is different so that's where it
lined<00:03:22.660> up<00:03:22.810> probably<00:03:23.370> alright<00:03:24.370> then<00:03:24.489> you're

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
lined up probably alright then you're

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.410 
lined up probably alright then you're
going<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.730> go<00:03:24.850> back<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.209> other<00:03:25.300> direction

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
going to go back in the other direction

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:34.860 
going to go back in the other direction
just<00:03:32.730> very<00:03:33.730> gently<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.300> don't<00:03:34.600> want<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.780> make

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
just very gently you don't want to make

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.060 
just very gently you don't want to make
it<00:03:35.050> really<00:03:35.230> deep<00:03:35.560> because<00:03:35.709> then<00:03:35.890> you're<00:03:35.980> going

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
it really deep because then you're going

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.040 
it really deep because then you're going
to<00:03:36.130> then<00:03:36.820> you're<00:03:36.910> going<00:03:37.000> to<00:03:37.060> hit<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.300> cake<00:03:37.450> if

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
to then you're going to hit the cake if

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.710 
to then you're going to hit the cake if
that<00:03:38.260> happens<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:40.410> smooth<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.560> out<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:43.120> now

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
that happens just smooth it out and now

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.759 
that happens just smooth it out and now
we<00:03:43.780> know<00:03:43.959> which<00:03:44.080> side<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.410> going<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.680> the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
we know which side is going to be the

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.210 
we know which side is going to be the
bag<00:03:46.410> that<00:03:47.410> I<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.620> probably<00:03:47.769> smooth<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.160> out

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
bag that I can probably smooth that out

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.860 
bag that I can probably smooth that out
later<00:03:48.519> okay<00:03:54.120> I'm<00:03:55.120> also<00:03:55.239> kind<00:03:55.510> of<00:03:55.540> doing<00:03:55.750> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
later okay I'm also kind of doing the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.690 
later okay I'm also kind of doing the
sideways<00:03:56.320> and<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:57.100> makes<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.519> little<00:03:57.580> more

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
sideways and it makes it a little more

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.470 
sideways and it makes it a little more
difficult

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:12.339 

all<00:04:04.379> right<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:09.239> was<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.450> little<00:04:09.569> crooked

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.360 

it<00:04:13.349> gets<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.560> little<00:04:13.650> crooked<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.040> can<00:04:14.129> go<00:04:14.220> back

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
it gets a little crooked you can go back

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.420 
it gets a little crooked you can go back
and<00:04:14.519> kind<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.760> press<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:15.060> out<00:04:18.950> all<00:04:19.950> right<00:04:20.010> and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
and kind of press it out all right and

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.969 
and kind of press it out all right and
this<00:04:23.430> looks<00:04:23.700> like<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.970> worst<00:04:24.120> side<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.860> know

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
this looks like the worst side you know

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.830 
this looks like the worst side you know
you<00:04:26.070> smooth<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.610> icing<00:04:26.970> out<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.510> as<00:04:27.690> you're

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
you smooth the icing out and as you're

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.000 
you smooth the icing out and as you're
working<00:04:27.960> on<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.410> see<00:04:28.440> these<00:04:28.620> little<00:04:28.770> tiny

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
working on it you see these little tiny

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.320 
working on it you see these little tiny
fibers<00:04:29.250> only<00:04:29.639> where<00:04:29.760> they<00:04:29.820> come<00:04:30.030> from

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
fibers only where they come from

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.719 
fibers only where they come from
floating<00:04:31.200> around<00:04:31.290> an<00:04:31.530> ear<00:04:33.200> okay<00:04:34.200> there's<00:04:34.590> one

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
floating around an ear okay there's one

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.300 
floating around an ear okay there's one
so<00:04:35.729> obviously<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.510> check<00:04:36.780> but<00:04:37.280> what<00:04:38.280> I

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
so obviously just check but what I

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.670 
so obviously just check but what I
usually<00:04:38.490> do<00:04:38.760> with<00:04:38.910> these<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:40.200> I'll<00:04:40.350> go<00:04:40.500> back

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
usually do with these is I'll go back

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.460 
usually do with these is I'll go back
and<00:04:40.919> put<00:04:41.130> pearls<00:04:41.630> just<00:04:42.630> right<00:04:42.870> at<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.050> joints

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
and put pearls just right at the joints

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.490 
and put pearls just right at the joints
where<00:04:44.040> all<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.370> lines<00:04:44.880> meet<00:04:45.120> and<00:04:45.389> that<00:04:46.229> helps

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
where all the lines meet and that helps

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.719 
where all the lines meet and that helps
to<00:04:46.530> disguise<00:04:46.889> this<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.160> little<00:04:47.280> bit<00:04:47.490> where<00:04:47.639> the

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
to disguise this a little bit where the

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.129 
to disguise this a little bit where the
lines<00:04:48.000> overlap<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.600> kind<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.810> make<00:04:48.930> a<00:04:48.960> little

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
lines overlap and kind of make a little

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.100 
lines overlap and kind of make a little
Ridge<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:51.030> know<00:04:51.120> like<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.389> said<00:04:51.450> before<00:04:51.720> if

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
Ridge and you know like I said before if

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.140 
Ridge and you know like I said before if
it<00:04:52.410> looks<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:52.830> there's<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.250> place<00:04:53.850> that's<00:04:54.090> a

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
it looks like there's a place that's a

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.420 
it looks like there's a place that's a
little<00:04:54.330> too<00:04:54.660> deep<00:04:55.110> or<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.680> icing<00:04:56.010> is<00:04:56.130> kind<00:04:56.340> of

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
little too deep or the icing is kind of

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.670 
little too deep or the icing is kind of
coming<00:04:56.669> up<00:04:56.760> like<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.110> take<00:04:58.110> a<00:04:58.139> clean<00:04:58.470> piece

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
coming up like that take a clean piece

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.500 
coming up like that take a clean piece
of<00:04:58.860> typing<00:04:59.160> paper<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.790> just<00:05:00.090> press<00:05:00.270> it<00:05:00.389> on

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
of typing paper and just press it on

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.270 
of typing paper and just press it on
there<00:05:00.630> and<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.780> will<00:05:00.870> smooth<00:05:01.050> it<00:05:01.200> out<00:05:01.350> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
there and it will smooth it out so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.950 
there and it will smooth it out so
that's<00:05:02.400> basically<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.180> don't<00:05:03.600> dig<00:05:03.840> in

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
that's basically it just don't dig in

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.180 
that's basically it just don't dig in
too<00:05:04.139> deep<00:05:04.290> with<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.560> skewer<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.010> should

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
too deep with the skewer and you should

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.460 
too deep with the skewer and you should
be<00:05:05.280> good
