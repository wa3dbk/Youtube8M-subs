00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
custom with camera this is the board of

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.280 
custom with camera this is the board of
the<00:00:11.429> boards<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.269> board<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.630> does

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
the boards this is the board that does

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
the boards this is the board that does
it<00:00:13.440> all<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.580> many<00:00:14.730> pro<00:00:15.000> riders<00:00:15.389> have<00:00:15.570> gotten<00:00:15.870> so

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
it all so many pro riders have gotten so

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.060 
it all so many pro riders have gotten so
many<00:00:16.199> cover<00:00:16.650> shots<00:00:17.010> with<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.640> yeah<00:00:18.980> for<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
many cover shots with this yeah for the

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.070 
many cover shots with this yeah for the
reason<00:00:20.520> this<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.060> pretty<00:00:21.300> badass<00:00:21.539> it's

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
reason this thing is pretty badass it's

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.160 
reason this thing is pretty badass it's
part<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.380> gondola<00:00:23.039> package<00:00:23.519> series<00:00:24.170> it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
part of the gondola package series it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.500 
part of the gondola package series it
does<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> channel<00:00:25.890> system<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:27.090> like<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
does have the channel system and like I

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.509 
does have the channel system and like I
said<00:00:27.689> earlier<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.710> cambered<00:00:29.490> shape

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
said earlier it is a cambered shape

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.070 
said earlier it is a cambered shape
board<00:00:30.000> that's<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> good<00:00:30.449> thing<00:00:30.689> gives<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
board that's a good thing gives you a

stay fast all season long you will have

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.060 
stay fast all season long you will have

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to maintain this base you will have to

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
to maintain this base you will have to
put<00:01:53.250> wax<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.759> but<00:01:53.939> it's<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> absorb<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
put wax on it but it's going to absorb a
