00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.810
 how do you stay if I tell you that there is a 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:10.510
 car that runs on coffee 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.879
 these engineers in the bring attempts 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
 really ecological that do not harm the 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.380
 environment and still the human being 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.470
 He insists on continuing to use oil 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.440
 today I have another alternative to offer you 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.630
 of transport obviously is not at 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.880
 everyone's reach it's about a car 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 that has been invented recently 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.739
 works with coffee simply with coffee 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.020
 it is estimated that man is very expensive in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.460
 fuel because you have to invest some 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 70 kilos of roasted coffee to travel 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 330 kilometers so if you have in 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.850
 It has the value of a kilo of coffee as 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.530
 its cost is prohibitive let's say this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 car can only afford it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.420
 the rich but it is still an invention 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.420
 curious that it's worth mentioning 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.180
 you can see some images of this car 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.830
 it all started with a science program 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.900
 from the bbc 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 the experiment was to modify a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.920
 volkswagen scirocco 1998 on a car 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.900
 books and not a car that used coffee 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.900
 instead of fuel 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.740
 you can see an image here of 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.229
 of the maximum speed that goes to about 60 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.689
 miles per hour of maximum speed the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.920
 consumption you can also see the 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.259
 functioning 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.010
 if you know a little English 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.980
 you can 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:47.400
 through this image know more or 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.140
 minus the speed limits and the type 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.530
 of operation that this car has 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.760
 it's really just a matter of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.520
 car that has been created with 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.320
 the greenest intention in the world is 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.160
 say it has been created to not contaminate 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.130
 but it does not seem like a viable idea in the 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.200
 sense that they can only use it to 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.990
 those people who have a lot 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.000
 money and surely those people 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.010
 they will prefer to buy a ferrari or a 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.950
 lamborghini but they will not buy a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.930
 car that works with coffee only 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 the most rare and famous ones 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.900
 eccentrics will buy this kind of 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.900
 cars
