00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
upper slot over here this one this slot

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.050 
upper slot over here this one this slot
beneath<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> micro<00:01:20.549> SD<00:01:20.820> card

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
beneath that is for the micro SD card

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.160 
beneath that is for the micro SD card
which<00:01:21.240> I'll<00:01:21.360> show<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.509> how<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> insert<00:01:21.960> right

the little Ridge up here pointing
upwards<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.630> simply<00:01:27.869> put<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> here

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
upwards and then just simply put it here

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.030 
upwards and then just simply put it here
in<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> second<00:01:29.549> slot<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.680> front<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.950> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
in the second slot so one in front of it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.380 
in the second slot so one in front of it
this<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> SIM<00:01:32.640> card<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> micro

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
this for the SIM card is for the micro

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.850 
this for the SIM card is for the micro
SD<00:01:33.600> card<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.460> click<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.579> into<00:01:35.759> place

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
SD card and just click it into place

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.530 
SD card and just click it into place
there<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.950> go<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.579> remove<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> simply<00:01:39.360> a
