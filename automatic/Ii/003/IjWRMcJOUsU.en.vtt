00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.190 

it's<00:02:08.170> okay<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.880> like<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.060> lot<00:02:10.179> more<00:02:10.390> than<00:02:10.720> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
it's okay I like it a lot more than the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.110

movie<00:02:11.590> because<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.160> think<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.520> shiny<00:02:12.910> gold

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.240 
movie because I think the shiny gold
works<00:02:13.420> more<00:02:13.630> than<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.900> kind<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.709> dull<00:02:14.980> gold

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
works more than the kind of dull gold

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.860 
works more than the kind of dull gold

only problem is that he barely wears the

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.370 
only problem is that he barely wears the
armor<00:07:06.500> in<00:07:06.590> the<00:07:06.620> movie<00:07:06.890> I<00:07:07.070> mean<00:07:08.020> most<00:07:09.020> movie
