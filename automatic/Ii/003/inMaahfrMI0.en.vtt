00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.240
 one of the key rules is not easy 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.030
 fast sports management 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.460
 vehicle management so to speak on 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.680
 the limit is to control the balance 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.039
 car its balance 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.680
 remember earlier we said that any 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.090
 modern motorcycle body car 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.739
 or there are cards 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.739
 tested and proven product 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.319
 engineering thought and so he thought out 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.530
 everything is safe and balanced 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:47.499
 going on with the car in our case 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.839
 with maps bends for braking when 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:54.609
 I accelerate the nose All unstable 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.399
 behavior card with which your 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.530
 We push here we introduce not a site 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.620
 often devastation not in technology 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.080
 devastation in our heads and at this moment 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.509
 It is time to complain not about the cards but how 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.280
 spoke professor transfiguration 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.640
 the immortal work of the dog's heart 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.670
 This means that each of them must 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.789
 beat yourself on the head dwell on 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.509
 what weight distribution is like 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:25.390
 going on in terms of movement map 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.149
 panthers talking about balanced 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.159
 cars we mean equal 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.000
 distribution of its weight in between four 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:39.640
 wheels its weight distribution with a point 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.759
 view so to speak truction or speaking 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.979
 Russian language grip 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.979
 evenly distributed weight 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.140
 evenly and grip all four 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.780
 wheels coated this car 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.999
 maximally stable higher power 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.729
 clutch the greater our control over 

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:59.109
 maps and as a result, the faster we 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.200
 we can move on the highway 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.069
 now what happens when we 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.619
 accelerate what happens with the weight he 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:13.200
 transformed moving to the rear 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.200
 wheels in this way 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.270
 we have the maximum weight on the rear axle 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.940
 surely we get the maximum 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.550
 rear grip coated but 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.650
 while unloaded front wheels and 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.930
 vice versa during braking nose 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.300
 car as it dive bites into force 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.940
 again moving the weight now what 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.950
 occurs when overcoming 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.280
 This or that garage is important from the point 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.780
 view of a common understanding of the trajectory weight 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.550
 transformed into horizontal 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.830
 plane in the direction of the outer turning 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.720
 wheels in terms of the rights of citizens to 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.000
 weight moves to the left 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.630
 loading our left wheels and increasing 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.870
 their grip is coated 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.020
 right side of our car 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.480
 unloads 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.610
 Naturally the total weight of our car 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.280
 it does not change transformed 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.500
 superfluous distribution when our weight 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.170
 car transformed to the side 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.620
 some pair of wheels front rear 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.660
 or lateral increasing their grip he 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.200
 naturally getting smaller by two 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.140
 other 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.810
 turn reducing the grip force on them 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.150
 unfortunately in the end in terms of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.459
 of the car as a whole, we are faced with 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.320
 a decrease in the clutch or 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.440
 destabilizing our map 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.900
 it follows that we must and most importantly 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.239
 able to control the transformation 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.000
 weight card in the first place during the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.690
 overcoming turns now look what 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.640
 happens at the entrance to the turn in order to 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.320
 get there yes we reset depending 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.940
 on the speed of our map 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.250
 car over there you must either 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.650
 slow down or we remember that reset 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.250
 gas is the same braking 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.409
 we dump the gas loading the front 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.920
 wheels increasing their grip with 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:04:00.810
 coated 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.970
 we turn the steering wheel and remember that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.790
 our car is stable in this 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.420
 condition in this state he will say so 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.450
 less stable turning the turn we 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.239
 we start to add gas quickly but smoothly 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.709
 why because if we add gas 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.009
 sharply if we turn on 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.479
 button we get this state 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:28.280
 car multiplied by the turn we 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:31.169
 will get unloaded relatively 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.750
 discharged rear axle and given the sharp 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.600
 adding gas we get by the nose 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.610
 the car is to blame there is only our fear 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.400
 our instinct of self-preservation 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.000
 how to be remembered first and foremost 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.800
 rule is gas running on a bend like 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.099
 just we start at the corner entrance 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.169
 add gas we add it constantly 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.690
 smoothly and quickly until you exit 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.900
 turning if we work like gas 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.349
 button if we turn on the manifestation 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.820
 self-preservation instinct as gas discharge 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.120
 I turn into a turn too fast reset 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.220
 gas or don't bring my God braking 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.000
 we have this option when weight 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.130
 car moves then the rear axle on 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.099
 front again from the front axle to the rear 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.340
 add to this 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:21.419
 turn conditions 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.449
 we get anything except 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.610
 Stable map on the tracks where I 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.949
 managed to move fast enough 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.770
 the first question the newbies asked 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.440
 sounded like this show me 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.449
 correct trajectory in response as 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.550
 rule these people heard the phrase nicknames 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.220
 lauda correct trajectory 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.660
 this is a fast trajectory let's say that in 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.280
 this turn is the perfect trajectory 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:50.860
 right here but we have to do this 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.430
 here's how the perfect trajectory shift 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.190
 essentially verifying a practical sense 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.560
 correct ideal trajectory is 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.230
 one that allows us to apply 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.690
 the main rule is gases as soon as we 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.460
 started to add turns we 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.490
 add it until there is a release 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.820
 turning smoothly quickly and constantly 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.220
 see it smoothly fast smoothly she 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.570
 will also vary and tighter 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.690
 track where there is when the track will be 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.850
 enough or we will come after the race when 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.050
 the track will be punished she will 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.630
 completely different keep completely 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:29.320
 the other is hooked off the track and completely 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.500
 other smooth be that way 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.880
 correct and perfect trajectory 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.250
 determined by the main rule of gas 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.830
 good trajectory allows correct 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.970
 use gas that is constantly 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.440
 quickly but smoothly adding it in a turn 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.080
 so now we know that depending 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.630
 from that we accelerate 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.700
 or overcome this or that weight turn 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.870
 our car transforms into that 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.360
 or other side 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.370
 most stable cards with equal 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.980
 weight distribution on all wheels 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.080
 if one or another pair of wheels is unloaded 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.620
 the car as a whole is significantly less 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.620
 stable 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.409
 but 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.110
 people 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:28.750
 how it hurts go-karting is complicated how 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.530
 how tiring is karting 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:35.590
 this is an awesome car feeling 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:37.620
 multiplied by the indescribable joy of 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.620
 of success
