evolves<00:02:55.340> into<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.850> quake<00:02:56.090> Dragonoid<00:02:56.660> so

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
evolves into a quake Dragonoid so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.500 
evolves into a quake Dragonoid so
instead<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.890> having<00:02:58.040> quite<00:02:58.820> Dragonoid<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.390> you

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
unused file you haven't near the game

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.840 
unused file you haven't near the game
like<00:03:03.110> stand<00:03:03.800> by<00:03:03.950> like<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.190> fourth<00:03:04.400> back<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:04.730> time

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
like stand by like a fourth back in time

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.640 
like stand by like a fourth back in time
then<00:03:05.510> when<00:03:05.840> once<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.320> meet<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.560> requirements

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
from the evolution reference card then

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.850 
from the evolution reference card then
you<00:03:10.730> take<00:03:11.030> your<00:03:11.090> sex<00:03:11.450> 650g<00:03:12.140> back<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.590> run<00:03:12.709> out

you take your sex 650g back and run out

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.550 
you take your sex 650g back and run out
and<00:03:13.040> permanently<00:03:13.550> replace<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.090> with<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.560> so

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and permanently replace it with this so

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.380 
and permanently replace it with this so
example<00:03:15.980> if<00:03:16.040> I<00:03:16.130> are<00:03:16.190> bringing<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.610> three<00:03:17.180> back

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
example if I are bringing in three back

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.440 
example if I are bringing in three back
beyond<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.690> 650g<00:03:18.200> Dragonoid<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.299> two<00:03:20.299> other

beyond a 650g Dragonoid and two other
Bakugan<00:03:20.989> right<00:03:21.340> then<00:03:22.340> what<00:03:22.730> what<00:03:22.880> happened<00:03:23.269> is

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
Bakugan right then what what happened is

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.890 
Bakugan right then what what happened is
I<00:03:23.959> just<00:03:24.650> play<00:03:25.100> normally<00:03:25.340> okay<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.450> then

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
I just play normally okay and then

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.710 
I just play normally okay and then
pretend<00:03:27.080> uh<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.269> rest<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.570> quake

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
pretend uh on the rest of the quake

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.009 
pretend uh on the rest of the quake
Dragonoid<00:03:30.140> too<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.360> yeah<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.540> idea<00:03:32.840> i'm

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
Dragonoid too so yeah the idea i'm

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.960 
Dragonoid too so yeah the idea i'm
playing<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.560> then<00:03:33.650> look<00:03:34.070> I<00:03:34.220> get<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.640> gate<00:03:34.820> card

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
playing and then look I get to gate card

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.420 
playing and then look I get to gate card
during<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.269> youth<00:03:35.420> pile<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:36.709> have<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:36.860> 650d
