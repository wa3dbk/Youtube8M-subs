00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.970
 locomotive one of the most uncomfortable 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.620
 opponents for the Urals in the Premier League in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.360
 last season, Muscovites walked by 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.969
 our team train 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
 having beaten the Urals both 30 times but 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.300
 the sixteenth torus of this season 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 Yekaterinburg almost interrupted 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.310
 so unpleasant for me a series 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.660
 only 4 minutes of task were missing 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.910
 known need to be addressed as they 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.010
 appearances there is the first of these wards 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
 Alexander Tarkhanov managed on the eve 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.940
 did not miss in the opening of the meeting 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.500
 footballers lock the rights of the owners of course 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.180
 much more possessed the ball on 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.430
 Yekaterinburg is not only competently from 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 defended but could come forward 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.690
 yeroshenko received a pass 13 meters from 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 gate fighting tried to punch his cheek on 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.989
 execution 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.820
 performance and pumped up after not enough 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 mastery lady n'doye locomotive player 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.870
 cool freed from the guardianship of the Urals 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.820
 opening up under the transfer partners 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 the penalty area of ​​our team here 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 just could not break through on goal 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.510
 Ural's answer turned out to be much more acute 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.949
 Erohina gave right to pizza 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 second attempt shot into the penalty area 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.479
 loko ball despite the presence of defenders 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.049
 I got the same yes pitch which beat in 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.820
 touch 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.130
 alas as in the case since my 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.490
 Yaroshenko projectile flew again in the center 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.500
 the gate 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 guests practically allowed nothing 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.790
 the locomotive to create wot standards with the game 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.799
 Railway workers delivered a lot to the Urals 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.840
 troublesome and it is no wonder when in your 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.880
 team plays such a master as bussufa 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.280
 every overhang into the penalty can cause 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 panic lucky for urala such a panic in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.180
 first half translated only to hit 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.040
 the sword in the frame of the gate in the previous two 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.560
 matches against lacquer Yekaterinburg 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.079
 lost all four halves so zeros 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.329
 on the scoreboard at the end of the first 45 minutes of this 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.070
 games could already be considered a step forward 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.229
 it remains to solve one more problem 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.390
 try to hammer the locomotive gulch and your 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.040
 Miles can't do anything yet 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 it turned out and usm tin which 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.970
 completed a multi-way combination with 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.979
 with the participation of Yaroshenko Emelyanova and Erohina 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 the hosts continued to wield the sword but 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.070
 this is clearly scoring chances at the gate 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.049
 the queen did not arise 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.360
 note that the quick run to the gate 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.950
 he 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.230
 alla substitute fernandes 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 lacquer legionnaire himself began a dangerous attack 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.830
 his team himself tried it 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.330
 complete breaking the ball 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.800
 flew near the barbell 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.230
 chances to score a few minutes 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.450
 later built runaway to counterattack 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.280
 gogniev and asevedo spartak gave a penalty 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.620
 on gerson but abaev read this 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.630
 the situation and on time came out of the gate a little 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.520
 later asevedo was again on the edge 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.660
 attacks trying to complete with a header 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.850
 canopy Yaroshenko 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.220
 Alas, the ball flew past the second half 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.200
 nearing logical zero completion 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.940
 however, in the end the meeting hosts 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 increased the onset of imposing a penalty 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.140
 Yekaterinburg blows and canopies with 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.400
 standards that's the pressure and 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.380
 decided the fate of the match 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.090
 when the hand on the referee's stopwatch 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.920
 getting ready to start counting added 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.290
 time ural missed from the corner 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.820

 Tarkhanov did not keep zadoy 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.070
 who struck irresistible to the goalkeeper 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.180
 and yet there was the Urala a chance to lead 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.040
 cherkizovo draw 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
