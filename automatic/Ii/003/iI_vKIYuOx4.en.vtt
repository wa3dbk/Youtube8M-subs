00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.639 
you know people think just with the name
alone<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.600> Spanish<00:02:07.960> restaurant<00:02:08.050> but

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
alone that it's a Spanish restaurant but

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.839 
alone that it's a Spanish restaurant but
at<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.830> end<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.129> day<00:02:09.280> we're<00:02:09.429> doing<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.700> lot

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
at the end of the day we're doing a lot

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.339 
at the end of the day we're doing a lot
more<00:02:10.030> than<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.360> we're<00:02:10.569> doing<00:02:10.750> some<00:02:10.899> American

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
more than that we're doing some American

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.720 
more than that we're doing some American
food<00:02:11.530> doing<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> little<00:02:12.069> bit<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.250> French<00:02:12.489> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
food doing a little bit of French and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.160 
food doing a little bit of French and
everything<00:02:13.120> has<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:13.269> little<00:02:13.569> Latin<00:02:13.810> twist<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.140> I

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
everything has a little Latin twist so I

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.759 
everything has a little Latin twist so I
think<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.470> what's<00:02:14.650> important<00:02:15.010> about<00:02:15.190> it

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
think that's what's important about it

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.610 
think that's what's important about it
how<00:02:17.769> are<00:02:17.799> we<00:02:17.890> going<00:02:18.040> guys

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.710 

oh<00:02:20.650> yeah<00:02:21.430> hockey<00:02:22.269> almost<00:02:23.050> um<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.390> think<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
oh yeah hockey almost um so I think it's

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.449 
oh yeah hockey almost um so I think it's
always<00:02:25.900> important<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.440> we<00:02:26.920> take<00:02:27.099> a<00:02:27.160> couple

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
always important that we take a couple

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.369 
always important that we take a couple
different<00:02:27.640> things<00:02:28.090> from<00:02:28.629> our<00:02:28.780> generations

different things from our generations

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.809 
different things from our generations
and<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.769> reinvent<00:02:30.190> them<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.430> know<00:02:30.550> because

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:31.949 
and and reinvent them you know because
that's<00:02:30.970> what<00:02:31.120> makes<00:02:31.269> things<00:02:31.390> special<00:02:31.780> that's
