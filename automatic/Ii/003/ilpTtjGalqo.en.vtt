 everything done with granite electro 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.660

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:47.730
 appliances and furniture are from 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.819
 good quality we have here also a small 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:56.810
 slope nothing for them 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:59.329
 the cans this part of 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.670
 the house here on the left these two 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:07.040
 rooms two separate rooms from 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.659
 good dimensions for and years and being 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.069
 given that this is where the two small 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:16.510
 rooms always with fan and the 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.510
 lay a silage 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.769
 so it's a pretty wide and the second 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.199
 room next door a small room 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.989
 again I will have a lot of 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:40.120
 natural neighborhoods the plate going to 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:40.120
 quite wide fan fund is a little 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:46.370

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.829

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.689

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.150
 swimming pool 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.639
 so we can go back to dry 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.579
 directly in the pool here so 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.769
 we had food on this side 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.739
 that's where we came with 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:22.610

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.620
 the dining room the lunch area with 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:31.130
 a lot of clarity on the terrace 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:37.130
 and the pool is not bad so there 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:45.650
 it's the entrance of a small a little 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:47.500
 closet here for clothes and here the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.470
 master bedroom 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.470
 greater greater dimensions 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.229
 a lot of natural neighborhoods that makes 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.990
 that my video is a bit dark and 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:08.900
 a lot of details the ceiling of 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:16.270
 monuments and so overlooking the room 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:21.080
 private bath with separate shower here 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:25.849
 the private bc goes we have a small 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:31.669
 closet on this side is a bigger 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:35.740
 on that side there separated so rendered a 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.740
 half have received a half for madam 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 and so with double sink always the 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:48.390
 granite work port and us 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.390
 request quality 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:59.240
 I'm going to go outside to 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:01.750
 a little bit my terrace the terrace that 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.750
 is of good size 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.770
 and so my pool 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.240
 masters of it here like that one 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.169
 be able to review all of the 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.030
 pool and the covered terrace and the 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.069
 everything protected by the screen 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.690
 so it's not a veranda it's a 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.690
 screen for insects 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.229

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:42.180

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.150
 freedom to come dry you without 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.139
