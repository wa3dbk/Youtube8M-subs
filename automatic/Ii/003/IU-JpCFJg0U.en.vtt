00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hello to all and all horizons 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.759
 is a good little lot of special or 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.930
 in college it's just the votes 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.130
 the nominees we will say in quotation marks 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.679
 of pokemon that will be 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.580
 selected for the all-star battle at 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.730
 English Department 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.510
 So then I would give all the air 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:22.680
 wholesale information this all-star 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.660
 battle so it will be the sea ​​poker that 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.730
 break him the most votes that will be 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.090
 so in my team for the last 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 pokemon glade challenge so we're going 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.350
 face a guy will face 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 many people in theory we will not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.640
 do the league we will really do the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.559
 end of glee season 3 with this team 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.390
 so the team all star what and we will finish 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.649
 season 3 on that if we manage to win 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 because it always stays in two 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 blocks and of course because hey we're going 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.010
 not have the team all star for a 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.090
 episode only do you know when I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.190
 told you in the last todd which 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.600
 would have season 4 she will not appear 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.489
 right now but she will appear you 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.289
 not worry but the frame season 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.719
 will appear with the team all star here 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.129
 for a little more fire so well 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.140
 listen to the nominees so I'll go 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.950
 show them on the screen so it's tricker 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.680
 inferno 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.479
 so if mia braz we have molosses vic 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.590
 so yes he did not died there is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.790
 some pokemon who are not dead 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.860
 and who were caught it's not just 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.360
 the podiums that I liked capturing the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.009
 pokemon that was emblematic of the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.180
 series and never reveals that much 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.240
 pokemon so I try to take it 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.040
 so prijck at random so necessarily a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 ready who swim and who never died 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 by the way and who has survived a lot of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.640
 season then one must also know that he 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.170
 there are only 30 pokemon I can not 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 take all the pokémons simply 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.250
 would be too long and also because the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 straw poll do not allow me but good 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 I have too much pokemon enough 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.189
 daury we acted this is the cave of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.840
 season 1 but wins so are good the 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.200
 wheel but so make an impact of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 the army then make it to pikachu so 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.250
 godechot view to rename it but hey 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.810
 you all know it's godechot 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.880
 carmack the cisa who died just before 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.219
 its evolution so that if it's enough 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.140
 damage anyway so maybe not the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.700
 problem is not we have to the casa 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.459
 meridian that served us a lot 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.959
 rather good quantity we have faith that gold 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.950
 Here so I tried to take time 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.040
 guy because you gave it when 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.750
 even and we will not lie but 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.349
 the ninja is still pretty classy 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:21.349
 so we will see if it will be voted 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.980
 flagada so earth that was very very 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.620
 practice for the end of season 1 there 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.629
 seems to me yes that's it then we adf 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.010
 tougeki this rather good pokemon type 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.739
 ferry the first time a little money 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.890
 we had a seem noked ali yvelines the 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.170
 battle against the euphoria of the 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.180
 season 2 which was excellent filled with 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.599
 this talent everywhere it was it was enough 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.969
 hardcore 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.760
 we also have lu xia mushrooms that 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.709

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.040

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.189

 we also hurt ken kfc so the 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.669
 pokemon that was given to you at the 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.450
 end of the season finally towards the end of the 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:03:02.150
 season and of course cheap sports 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.879

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.919

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.109
 class and that if it's boring anyway 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:15.370
 one to jean paul keira who was when 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.260
 even pretty cool in pokemon plants 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.930

 shiny he died but on a creep what 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.190
 this damage there says the end of the 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.389
 season 2 was very sad without him 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.040
 then we have the recent luxury has a 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.530
 who so there is a lot served in front of a 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.299
 champion who is frankly he has 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.489
 really helped a lot we also 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.109
 soldier arcanes one who was really 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.389
 convenient 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:49.959
 we octopus he one of the best pokemon 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:53.329
 of clay with the ultimate level level 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:57.079
 87 which really served us a lot 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.129
 for the league we have only gildas no 83 very 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.389
 good stew that had served us for the 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.319
 league too but hey who died 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.000
 unfortunately and we have at the peak of 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.159
 pokemon and who died in season 3 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.829
 bet finally it's a voter but who 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.389
 was very very good and we allied poutou 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.150
 the pokemon of our team who is 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:18.049
 still not dead nor at 80 we have the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:21.289
 monitor see 78 and we at twin cities on 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.740
 cruel tantad of infinity and we have 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.570
 especially during domens when men's the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.850
 iconic season 3 podium 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.500
 and here it is that's 29 pokemon and 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.840
 the 30th pokemon because I thought 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.720
 we will add a small dose of trolls 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.120
 in season 1 we had captured a 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.320
 poke and we had renamed maele then 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.920
 for those who do not know it's the 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.200
 command conquer 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.990

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.870
