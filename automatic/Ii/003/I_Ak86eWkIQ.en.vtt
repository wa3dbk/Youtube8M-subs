00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 My name is Nastya I am the account holder 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.259
 co-owner of the photo we are with my husband 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.170
 we are engaged in photo video filming 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.349
 and also organized wedding ceremonies 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.600
 in Thailand and for a long time our account 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.390
 was a personal attribute like that 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.529
 most did not consider in their work 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.180
 until they realized that all communication all lie 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.300
 all communication with Armen translate 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.450
 moved to mobile and we need to somehow too 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.280
 go there all your strength there 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230
 throw actually it is very light 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.250
 good way to communicate with your 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.739
 friends and followers 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.539

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.199

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.690

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.390
 advice from them is very helpful and very 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.770
 interesting here and of course they helped us 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.590
 to make your account more 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 right professionally here 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 but so no less to gain subscribers in 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.729
 modern course of affairs that have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.570
 instagram yes maybe park years ago 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.570
 it was still real for today 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.060
 when there is already a lot of audience 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.450
 interesting accounts huge subscriptions 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.430
 thousandths here is the most to recruit subscribers 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 difficult enough and I think everyone 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 a professional is your place that's why we 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.920
 professionally engaged in photo shoot 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.110
 and we needed a team which 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.869
 professionally engaged in promotion 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.140
 instagram and that's why we turned 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.090
 promo gram and the result did not force myself 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.770
 to wait 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 our account in a short time from hundreds 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.939
 subscribers scored thousands of here and guys 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.340
 promised us that with four thousand 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.530
 subscribers will already begin orders here but 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 us precisely through much earlier when 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.450
 already had one and a half thousand subscribers 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.530
 we started orders 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.650
 and it was interesting wonder 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.810
 Of course it's nice here but more 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.170
 pleasure of course 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.590
 live communication and real emotions that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.330
 you get comments from likes 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.250
 from the fact that people like what you 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.080
 you do and many people ask questions 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.180
 completely different we chose directions 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:45.470
 Naturally photos 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:48.019
 at the same time we are holding a signature photo 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.180
 we have a very peculiar and with such 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.349
 own direction ie 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.349

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.500

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.630
