00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.130
 hi girls today i will talk to you about 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.920
 products that used in the last 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.180
 months and I liked them a lot 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.769
 this video is as always 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.050
 collaboration with donatella magazines 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.970
 rector to whom I send a kiss and leave you 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.890

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.739
 Click on it to see which ones are 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.060
 his favorites or there are always gods 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.950
 animals I want in my room 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.790
 you owe that of the mosquito just like 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.070
 i border smiled 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:31.550
 lately I have so many dark circles because 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.530
 I spend sleepless nights I know by studying 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.910
 only under stress and therefore I have 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.600
 dark circles is so strong that sometimes 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.540
 my mom always says a panda and then 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.510
 precisely or these dark circles so I was looking for 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.370
 a very covering concealer for 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.710
 the eye contour I said if I find it 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.510
 it could also be useful for girls 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.130
 who follow me for so many years 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.590
 dark circles strong and maybe collectors of 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.780
 usage I normally am not not 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.300
 they are therefore suitable for them some time 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.489
 ago I bought this urban pencil 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.770
 decay you think maybe I was 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.350
 stencil and is practically make one 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.020
 consistency concealer pencil 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.540
 creamy that serves precisely to correct 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.680
 the imperfections of the face so if I open 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.990
 punches that dark circles this concealer 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.830
 it was my salvation to you that is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.810
 very practical because you did 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.909
 so in pencil then more applied if 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.370
 you simply don't have to use it 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.350
 as happens with other fluid correctors 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.210
 then take 223 strips 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.549
 tap you are ready you can 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.020
 carry around for touch-ups but the 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.979
 which I like best about this 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.170
 concealer that covers simo that is covers 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.610
 coop covers a lot 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.190
 the only negative thing about this 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.229
 corrector and put very little why 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.870
 otherwise live in the folds another 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.850
 product 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.060
 there are so many that you will know about jarvis 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.420
 a is the rent 9 or a cream from 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.440
 day because it is for the hair 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.690
 practically a moisturizer 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.100
 imagine yourself from the themes treated for the face 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.990
 there is also moisturizers for i 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.120
 hair no longer knows what to invent in 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.040
 actually I didn't believe it very much 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.330
 I really wanted a product after the summer 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:14.280
 that I would then settle the tips of the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.860
 hair that will be really much 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.500
 ruined and so I said why not 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.110
 take this photo 9 of which so much 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.610
 they speak well it has proven this is one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.770
 cream that should be put on the tips of the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.990
 hair are lengths where you have them most 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.840
 damaged every day when you have them 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.880
 the need when you feel the need 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 it must be applied very pure because 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.590
 otherwise it weighs down the hair i 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.020
 hair suck produces like when 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.760
 see the cream on dry skin and the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.370
 skin the wing money immediately the same 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.020
 those hair is done then the hair 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.270
 they suck this one up 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.310
 it is a criminal who tries a cream but for 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.200
 hair and I noticed after a month of 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.450
 use this is the second one I buy 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.090
 does not last more than a month this is one 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.880
 bad thing because it also costs a little 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.470
 however as a restructuring treatment for 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.840
 I found my hair very well 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.480
 precisely after one month of use he has me 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.290
 completely resettled the hair 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.590
 so hair is really more than that 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.390
 healthy more nourished and less dry another 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.010
 product that you really liked is the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.180
 Pencil wearing right now is 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.940
 this morning so knicks that is the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.489
 816 fuchsia and precisely fuchsia pencil 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.680
 and used it in make-up inspired by 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.900
 rihanna and bought this husband here 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.940
 which I use very often even alone 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.320
 just like lipstick I like it because of 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.230
 pencils Knicks are really 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.239
 writers and remain on the lips for a long time 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.070
 just apply evening under the lips 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.230
 give just the presence of lipstick and 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.150
 an attachment lasts many hours 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.939
 858 is the new page and I needed it 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.610
 because I needed a pencil for 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.200
 I have many more brownish lips 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.879
 that I need a little about pink 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.459
 suggests combining maybe when it is 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.019
 rossetto di va a little more on the brown 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.900
 in short, a few lines and science adore 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.700
 when the rosÃ© pencil is not good 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.340
 in short, and I took this same 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.019
 not very good pigmentation speech 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.939
 too much lips can also be used as 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.099
 lipstick on all lips excellent 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.099
 really good price pencils 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.579
 product that uses are practically 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.930
 all all mine maybe even the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.370
 last month because I didn't feel like 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.470
 change the nail polish in fact now 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.870
 strangely not a Russian from this one 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.210
 room leaving crazy was the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.940
 now of a red, however, that it was 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.160
 a period in which precisely used 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.410
 only this that it was finished that that 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.960
 practically here and in the alleys stay there 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.139
 enamel gel effect with thick enamel 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.509
 the number 626 sorbet is frosty 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.780
 rose petals and is practically one 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.729
 just pink enamel with these 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.130
 iridescences and is very delicate very much 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.539
 cute has excellent durability me durations 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.759
 five days considered that 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.740
 lately he has had a lead action 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:00.569
 latex gloves that I usually wear 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.060
 so i'm doing the services so love 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:06.240
 free hand and video now also 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.830
 I have to say quite a good one 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.659
 durability but above all it is very chic very much 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.069
 fine then even if doing the simple 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.539
 passed just to not have the 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.319
 public is natural because maybe not 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.690
 you like them 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.069
 you want to feel a little more tidy is 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.560
 really very nice and told you 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.000
 I used it practically all of the 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.039
 month a message arrived a lot 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.360
 this year they are always sought when 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:27.180
 I make video and then turn it back on 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.919
 davis ruby is a bad thing nobody got me 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.139
 hilt 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.789
 then another product that you liked is 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.630
 this is also another product for 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:40.680
 hair and this place silicone taken 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:42.889
 zero mason a few months ago then what it is 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.479
 the coco silicone practically a 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.960
 substitute for the serious with the traditional 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:51.300
 that I have TV or used for years i 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.639
 my hair was still beautiful though 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.590
 after using them for so long 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.630
 time what I started to notice i 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.030
 my hair fell this is it 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.930
 a fluid goes put very little before 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.030
 to dry them or you hair well buffered 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.370
 or after drying on the tips 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.590
 as you do with liquid crystal e 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.050
 don't go out so much hair 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.930
 then the important and soft 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:18.480
 put little because if you put some 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.280
 more hair are stitches if you put them on 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.830
 shortly afterwards in the face water 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.240
 mirror gloss finish equal to 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.490
 that of silicones only that not 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.470
 Silicones are a really black 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.770
 pretty that readily available this 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:35.760
 of debora that 24 hours two highland and of 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.290
 enna that this blue teal green is a 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.770
 color that I especially love about 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:43.620
 dark eyes because it brings out the reflections 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:47.400
 of the eyes whether they be green or not 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:50.040
 brown if we hazel is black makes them 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.380
 more intense blues even more vibrant 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.900
 so it's a color that can be 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.850
 used as an alternative to black 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.940
 because it defines the eye very well 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.710
 however, it really pulls off reflections of the 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.450
 eyes for me the pencil of which 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.150
 spoke from bree and launch them meetup 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.950
 talked about this magic mark pencil 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.450
 which has more or less this color this is 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.640
 really very writing these 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.310
 eyeliner has excellent durability and then in the 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.690
 blacks and an eyeliner in pain then 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.890
 easy to apply, you know which ones 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.140
 are your favorite products 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.910
 of the last period as always there 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.300
 we keep next video and sent me a 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.300
 jar
