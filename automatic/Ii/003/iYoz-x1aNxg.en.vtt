00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 very good junkies of humor as you are 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.609
 welcome another Monday to ask your 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.350
 camel the section in which you 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.240
 you ask a lot of questions and I 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.790
 I answer the ones that the real one gives me more 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.090
 clear potato so good we're going to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.090
 start 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.859
 Ask curry if after drinking 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.140
 a glass of milk you take a yogurt 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 cuts digestion, obviously not 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.529
 because yogurt also contains milk 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.270
 but honestly with your faults of 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.390
 spelling so I get a cut of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.370
 digestion 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.440
 because we make the bed if it's going to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.050
 undoing the night is not an effort 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.640
 useless if I choose to see if finally someone 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.440
 who understands me so I 'm going to 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.739
 bother to make the bed if I'm going to 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:52.730
 to undo again and again one and 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:55.640
 again thanks because because I say it 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.500
 me and point because ask your camel 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.300
 Has no sense 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.680
 oh no uncle is right has nothing 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.329
 of the sense that if you are the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.829
 yankees of humor and I am your 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.140
 camel of humor I am the one that I give you 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.610
 the drug of humor does not make sense that 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.160
 the section is called ask your 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.130
 camel being the questions towards me not 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.560
 it does not make any kind of sense it's not worth 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.940
 what shampoos is for your hair to be so 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.280
 orange carrot 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.899
 I love good job, look, I do not 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.210
 unveil the secret but I'm going to 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.340
 tell is not not about shampoos, no sir 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.619
 neither of dyes of hair nor anything is matter 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.539
 of eating many but many many 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.479
 risketos throughout the day 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.550
 I'm mister risquet or that's why I have the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.070
 orange hair by the risketos not by 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.650
 else do the test do the test and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.970

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.730

 but for next time try to do 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.950

 you are a lazy fucking is more is that you spend 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.120
 more time in writing this question than 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.560
 to actually go to the sky line channel 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.080

 before giving them both a good

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.130
 kill someone please where are you going to 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.560
 stop not in my mother curry I'm finished 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.220
 to catch with all the humor the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.220
 I fuck fuck I do not know I do not know 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.780
 Running runs and the tower is running 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.940
 run and yes I have six bottles of 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.850
 whiskey in one hand and three beers in the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.010
 other 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.590
 six bottles of whiskey in one hand and 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.190
 three beers in the other 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.190
 acz 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.000
 and the question in stone paper or scissors 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.550
 when the paper wrapped the stone that 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.680
 it happened to him because he won the paper because 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.390
 man I think it's pretty clear the 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.550
 paper to have a wider surface 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.200
 get wrapped around the stone so 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.670
 that disables any kind of 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.310
 movement that wants to make the stone and 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.950
 therefore wins the competition if the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:35.700
 deaf people have never heard any language in 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.460
 what language do you think I'm going to see what 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.470
 better reflection I do not even have a whore 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.270
 idea had never thought about it or is it ever 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.950
 has stopped me to think is how they think 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.140
 the deaf clear if we think 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.750
 with our language but if they are deaf and 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.480
 have never heard anything like I think oysters 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.400
 what a good question because I really feel 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.910
 have no answer because it's great 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.920
 Great question what mental scratched if 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.449
 your grandmother proposes you to make a trio with 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.370
 her friend shell 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:04.110
 arias would certainly take her to the 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.120
 residence because if my grandmother asks me 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.889
 make a trio either with shell or with 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.409
 another one of her friends I think she's 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.300
 not bad enough to listen to me 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.949
 but that your grandmother asks you to make a trio 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.650
 no no it's not something that goes well is something 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.099
 that is not going well or is going wrong something is going 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.780
 bad there 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.940
 worry 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.380
 and well up to here the question you 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.270

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.680
 maybe there is one who has not yet satiated 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.630
 your daily dose of a 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.630
 Well, here you have more videos
