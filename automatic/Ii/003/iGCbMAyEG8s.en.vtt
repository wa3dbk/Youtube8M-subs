type of swords on that but it's nice to
know<00:01:29.469> that<00:01:29.499> the<00:01:29.770> research<00:01:30.069> has<00:01:30.279> been<00:01:30.310> done<00:01:30.490> and

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
know that the research has been done and

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.249 
know that the research has been done and
that<00:01:31.149> you're<00:01:31.299> looking<00:01:31.569> at<00:01:31.659> basically<00:01:32.079> what

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
that you're looking at basically what

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.319 
that you're looking at basically what
was<00:01:32.439> around<00:01:32.709> at<00:01:32.889> the<00:01:32.919> time<00:01:33.009> it<00:01:33.429> adds<00:01:33.880> immersion

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
was around at the time it adds immersion

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.289 
was around at the time it adds immersion
and<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.569> quite<00:01:34.779> like<00:01:34.959> that<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.939> units<00:01:37.209> are

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
and I quite like that the units are

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.120 
and I quite like that the units are
balanced<00:01:37.689> for<00:01:37.869> each<00:01:37.990> faction<00:01:38.229> each<00:01:38.770> of<00:01:39.039> the

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
balanced for each faction each of the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.469 
balanced for each faction each of the
ends<00:01:39.279> are<00:01:39.459> unlocked<00:01:39.880> through<00:01:40.060> different

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
ends are unlocked through different

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.969 
ends are unlocked through different
building<00:01:40.749> chains<00:01:40.990> and<00:01:41.259> are<00:01:41.409> appropriate<00:01:41.709> to

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
building chains and are appropriate to

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.589 
building chains and are appropriate to
the<00:01:42.159> late-game<00:01:42.369> for<00:01:42.789> high<00:01:42.909> tier<00:01:43.119> units<00:01:43.450> and

00:01:43.589 --> 00:01:43.599 
the late-game for high tier units and

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:45.300 
the late-game for high tier units and
their<00:01:43.959> cost<00:01:44.200> reflects<00:01:44.679> their<00:01:44.889> power<00:01:45.099> in

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
their cost reflects their power in

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.879 
their cost reflects their power in
campaigns<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:46.029> in<00:01:46.179> multiplayer<00:01:46.889> they

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
campaigns and in multiplayer they

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:49.260 
campaigns and in multiplayer they
haven't<00:01:48.130> gone<00:01:48.219> overboard<00:01:48.549> with<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:48.969> unit's

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
haven't gone overboard with the unit's

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.359 
haven't gone overboard with the unit's
either<00:01:49.450> there's<00:01:50.049> between<00:01:50.259> six<00:01:50.709> and<00:01:50.859> ten<00:01:51.069> units

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
either there's between six and ten units

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.800 
either there's between six and ten units
added<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.819> each<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.149> factions<00:01:52.359> and

added to each of the factions and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.019 
added to each of the factions and
basically<00:01:53.139> no<00:01:53.380> overlap<00:01:53.829> either<00:01:54.039> each<00:01:54.579> unit

basically no overlap either each unit

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:56.489 
basically no overlap either each unit
being<00:01:55.209> unique<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.779> of<00:01:55.869> extremely<00:01:56.289> high

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
being unique and of extremely high

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:57.870 
being unique and of extremely high
quality<00:01:56.529> with<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.130> unit<00:01:57.399> cards<00:01:57.700> being

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880

these<00:02:12.560> factions<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.250> will<00:02:13.340> need<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> faction

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
these factions you will need a faction

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.120 
these factions you will need a faction
unlock<00:02:14.270> mod<00:02:14.540> or<00:02:14.810> use<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.440> recommended<00:02:15.980> one

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
unlock mod or use the recommended one

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.160 
unlock mod or use the recommended one
which<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.520> all<00:02:16.730> factions<00:02:17.180> unlocked<00:02:17.600> that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
which is all factions unlocked that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.870 
which is all factions unlocked that
sorts<00:02:18.530> out<00:02:18.680> everyone's<00:02:19.100> victory<00:02:19.460> conditions

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
sorts out everyone's victory conditions

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670 
sorts out everyone's victory conditions
so<00:02:20.120> playing<00:02:20.390> as<00:02:20.540> a<00:02:20.570> faction<00:02:20.990> actually<00:02:21.440> works

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
so playing as a faction actually works

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980 
so playing as a faction actually works
and<00:02:21.920> has<00:02:22.040> an<00:02:22.160> end<00:02:22.310> goal<00:02:22.780> unfortunately<00:02:23.780> they

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
and has an end goal unfortunately they

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.600 
and has an end goal unfortunately they
don't<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.410> a<00:02:24.440> mirror<00:02:24.710> faction<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:25.340> civil

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
don't have a mirror faction for civil

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.100 
don't have a mirror faction for civil
wars<00:02:25.790> so<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.090> can<00:02:26.270> never<00:02:26.420> actually<00:02:26.630> have<00:02:26.930> one

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
wars so you can never actually have one

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.020 
wars so you can never actually have one
the<00:02:27.800> guys<00:02:27.950> working<00:02:28.310> on<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.520> all<00:02:28.640> factions

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
the guys working on the all factions

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
the guys working on the all factions
might<00:02:29.270> have<00:02:29.450> told<00:02:29.630> me<00:02:29.870> that<00:02:30.080> it's<00:02:30.230> simple

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
might have told me that it's simple

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.020 
might have told me that it's simple
enough<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.920> add<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> civil<00:02:31.460> war<00:02:31.580> faction

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
enough to add a civil war faction

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.790 
enough to add a civil war faction
however<00:02:32.660> when<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.930> have<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:33.200> do<00:02:33.320> it<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:33.530> over

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
however when you have to do it for over

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.590 
however when you have to do it for over
80<00:02:33.980> factions<00:02:34.550> it<00:02:34.730> becomes<00:02:34.970> difficult<00:02:35.240> and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
80 factions it becomes difficult and

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.100 
80 factions it becomes difficult and
hard<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.170> maintain<00:02:36.320> with<00:02:36.680> updates<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.930> could

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
hard to maintain with updates you could

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.330 
hard to maintain with updates you could
of<00:02:39.200> course<00:02:39.230> just<00:02:39.620> activate<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.040> minor

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
of course just activate the minor

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.770 
of course just activate the minor
