00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey guys!  I'm Karan Brar.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome to the SAG Foundation's Storyline Online

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Today we're reading The Kiss That Missed
written and illustrated by David Melling.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.040
Once upon a Tuesday the King was in a hurry as usual.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.000
"Goodnight," he said and blew his son a royal kiss.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.280
It missed.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.120
The young prince watched it rattle around the room,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.060
then bounce out of the window and into the night.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.400
The prince told the Queen.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.460
The Queen told the King,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.600
and the King had a quick word with his loyal Knight.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.620
"Follow that Kiss!" he squawked.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.780
The Knight mounted his horse...

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.640
Eventually ...

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.960
and galloped off in hot pursuit until they came to the wild wood.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.340
Wild creatures with wild eyes,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.020
too much hair, and very bad manners lived here.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.240
It was dark.  It was smelly.  It was ...

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.100
...snowing.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.270
They were not alone.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.420
There were bears with long claws and growly roars,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.720
swooping owls of all shapes and sizes,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.940
and a pack of hungry wolves with dribbly mouths.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.900
"EEK!" squeaked the Knight.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.700
And then, suddenly ...

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.460
...with a sparkle the Royal Kiss came floating by and,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.820
in turn, said goodnight to everyone.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.660
Bears stopped being growly,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.500
Owls stopped being swoopy,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.680
Wolves stopped being dribbly,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.360
And before you could say "Follow that kiss!"

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.560
They all settled down for a good night's sleep.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.360
After a while they sat down on a wrinkly old tree trunk to rest.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.860
The wrinkly old tree trunk twitched...

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.080
and slowly rose into the air...

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.400
above the woods and into the clouds.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.020
At last they found themselves staring into a pair of very hairy nostrils.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:51.180
A dragon with "this-pair-would-be-nice-on-toast" eyes
leered greedily at them.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.140
Suddenly...
with a sparkle the Royal Kiss came floating by

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.740
and flew right up the dragon's nose.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.040
He sat up, sniffed, and blinked.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.220
Slowly, he opened his mouth, took a deep breath, and...

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.260
Sneezed!

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.080
"Hang on!" he said as they tumbled through the trees.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.260
"Come back!" he puffed as he lumbered after them.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.720
"I want to pick you up and...

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.080
kiss you goodnight."

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.320
Slowly they all made their way back to the castle.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.480
That night the prince was happy,

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.940
the Queen was happy,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.480
and the King promised to stop always being in a hurry.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.300
He made sure everyone was comfortable

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.680
and slowly read them a bedtime story from beginning to end...

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.950
almost.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.190
The end. I'm Karan Brar again 
and thank you guys for checking out Storyline Online.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.810
