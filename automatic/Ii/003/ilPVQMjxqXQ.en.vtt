the natural hair I think now we know so
many<00:01:09.900> people<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.909> natural<00:01:11.909> hair<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you think after a while we'll there just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.820 
you think after a while we'll there just
be<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.060> lot<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> people<00:01:15.900> with<00:01:16.080> natural<00:01:16.440> hair<00:01:16.620> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
anything it's just what looks good and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.290 
anything it's just what looks good and
you<00:01:58.140> know<00:01:58.260> what's<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.370> on<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.060> you

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
you know what's going on at the time you

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.060 
you know what's going on at the time you
know<00:02:00.390> she's<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.690> not<00:02:00.780> becoming<00:02:01.020> actors<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
know she's are not becoming actors and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.540 
know she's are not becoming actors and
models<00:02:02.190> so<00:02:02.550> it's<00:02:03.320> kind<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.350> goes<00:02:04.500> with<00:02:04.710> what's

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
models so it's kind of goes with what's

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.580 
models so it's kind of goes with what's
going<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.750> she<00:02:06.900> liked<00:02:07.080> it

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
going on but she liked it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.320 
going on but she liked it
she<00:02:07.920> does<00:02:08.129> she<00:02:08.159> loves<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:08.970> she<00:02:09.090> can

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
she does she loves it you know she can

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.300 
she does she loves it you know she can
play<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.019> it's<00:02:10.530> longer<00:02:11.099> obviously

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
play in it and it's longer obviously

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.339 
play in it and it's longer obviously
than<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.599> naturally<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
than it would be if it was naturally in

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.350 
than it would be if it was naturally in
tirana<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.700> that's<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.209> what

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
tirana and so I think that's really what

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.330 
tirana and so I think that's really what
she<00:02:15.540> likes<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.230> shake<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.920> stuff<00:02:17.159> like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
she likes and to shake it and stuff like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.510 
she likes and to shake it and stuff like
that<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:18.049> you<00:02:19.049> know

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.510 

but<00:02:21.880> if<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.210> had<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.480> daughter<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.260> probably<00:02:23.890> would

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
but if I had a daughter I probably would

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.370 
but if I had a daughter I probably would
do<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.090> kind<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.480> like<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:25.690> do<00:02:25.750> myself<00:02:26.020> I

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
do you like kind of like I do myself I

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.350 
do you like kind of like I do myself I
go<00:02:26.530> back<00:02:26.770> and<00:02:26.950> forth<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.400> went<00:02:27.580> straight<00:02:27.790> with

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
go back and forth I went straight with

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.360 
go back and forth I went straight with
natural<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.740> know<00:02:29.890> just<00:02:30.130> kind<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
natural so if you know just kind of

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.220 
natural so if you know just kind of
depends<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.970> what<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.270> don't<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:31.990> what<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
depends on what you don't like what you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.500 
depends on what you don't like what you
want<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.500> look<00:02:32.680> like<00:02:32.890> what<00:02:33.190> wardrobe<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.360> know

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
want to look like what wardrobe you know

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.540 
want to look like what wardrobe you know
right<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:37.230> don't<00:02:38.230> have<00:02:38.440> any<00:02:38.620> kids<00:02:38.890> but<00:02:39.010> when<00:02:39.520> I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
right I don't have any kids but when I

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.820 
right I don't have any kids but when I
listen<00:02:40.180> when<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.360> do<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.780> daughter<00:02:41.050> I

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
listen when I do have a daughter I

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.350 
listen when I do have a daughter I
probably<00:02:42.340> would<00:02:42.580> straighten<00:02:42.760> her<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.090> wouldn't

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
probably would straighten her I wouldn't

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.940 
probably would straighten her I wouldn't
put<00:02:43.510> any<00:02:43.660> chemicals<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.290> relaxed<00:02:44.680> or

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950

texturizer<00:02:45.490> any<00:02:45.760> or<00:02:46.000> anything<00:02:46.180> but

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
texturizer any or anything but

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.810 
texturizer any or anything but
definitely<00:02:47.560> like<00:02:47.740> you<00:02:47.800> said<00:02:48.070> it's<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.280> part<00:02:48.520> of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
definitely like you said it's a part of

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.000 
definitely like you said it's a part of
you<00:02:49.330> know<00:02:49.480> growing<00:02:49.810> up<00:02:49.900> socially<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.590> remember

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
you know growing up socially I remember

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.590 
you know growing up socially I remember
as<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.160> young<00:02:51.310> girl<00:02:51.490> was<00:02:51.700> always<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
as a young girl was always you know you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.880 
as a young girl was always you know you
wanted<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.990> wear<00:02:53.050> your<00:02:53.230> hair<00:02:53.440> straight<00:02:53.860> and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
wanted to wear your hair straight and

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.130 
wanted to wear your hair straight and
run<00:02:54.250> down<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:58.420> like<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:58.630> said<00:02:58.930> just

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
run down I think like you said just

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.390 
run down I think like you said just
going<00:02:59.350> back<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.530> forth<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.950> little<00:02:59.980> bit<00:03:00.220> of

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
going back and forth a little bit of

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.310 
going back and forth a little bit of
both<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:01.120> know<00:03:01.240> he's<00:03:01.660> healthy

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
both it you know he's healthy

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.910 
both it you know he's healthy
so<00:03:03.190> why<00:03:04.060> would<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.480> not<00:03:05.050> relax

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920 
so why would you not relax
her<00:03:06.130> hair<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.670> just<00:03:07.240> think<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.420> chemicals<00:03:07.840> are

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
her hair I just think the chemicals are

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.690 
her hair I just think the chemicals are
too<00:03:08.050> strong<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.770> know<00:03:09.070> especially<00:03:09.490> with<00:03:09.610> her

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
too strong you know especially with her

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.010
