00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.650
 so hello everyone today on our review 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.650
 Taiga Varangian 500 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:32.930
 he has no backs allowed 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.930
 other models end up on patrol attacks 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:44.370
 what is here with us 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:50.420
 heated steering wheel or rather pens now he 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:52.670
 off here it turns on here with us 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.609
 emergency stop 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 this brelochek shred does not twitch it 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.069
 decide on the pants this stray 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.530
 if suddenly with not we put the cap 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.530
 I break away 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.240
 so I do not know of course from what but not 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.650
 such as on patrol 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:23.259
 I had a patrol truly before 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.259
 slightly different glass speedometer 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.149
 we have telescopic suspension on it 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.880
 front horseradish she does not work here by 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:42.350
 at least while riding 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:51.670
 work suspension does not feel shorter scrap yes 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.670
 and only he Gusinsky here costs 500 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.500
 one-on-one patrol suspension 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.340
 taillight number we have here with this 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.430
 parties 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.290
 Here are such pribludy 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:24.250
 here he just rolls himself apart 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.250
 instantly look under the hood 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:40.220
 here we actually nothing 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:45.470
 there is no new box variator engine with 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:50.959
 Tyler for 500 600 cubes and 43 horse 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.010
 force versus the same let's say 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:03.680
 potroll with the same under the steering wheel and taiga 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:16.160
 Of course less is not taiga so here 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:23.769
 is cooling to 550 this dash principle 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.769
 to this snowmobile is enough i have 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.690
 big us all exactly the same thing 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.690
 here we didnâ€™t want a carburetor 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.610
 try to get 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.979
 He bought me this year in 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.850
 the fourteenth general and telling me 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.209
 I like a good snowmobile 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.209
 Total 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:38.400
 from cleaner such a snowmobile to fishing on 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.030
 hunting ride behind his technique is excellent 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.030
 all all bye
