 migrate from your windows 7 or the 8.1 to this 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.520
 new version of windows 10 simply 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.520

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.780
 this window will look like 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.180
 we accept the terms and see that 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.770
 we are accepting since microsoft is 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.170
 collecting and transmitting 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.910

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.110
 to proceed with the installation of 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.360
 windows 8 from here is 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.910

 user if we want a password 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.830

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.960
 something that reminds us of the password 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.390

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.790
