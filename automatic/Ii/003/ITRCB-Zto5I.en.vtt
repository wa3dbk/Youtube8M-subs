00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
would have meant change in our physician

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.000 
would have meant change in our physician
say<00:02:38.510> from<00:02:38.690> a<00:02:38.750> month<00:02:38.900> ago<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:39.560> maybe<00:02:39.799> so

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
say from a month ago and then maybe so

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.380

changing<00:02:40.430> somebody<00:02:40.730> into<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> left<00:02:41.209> wing

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
changing somebody into the left wing

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.460 
changing somebody into the left wing

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.199 
have confidence and then playing and you
know<00:02:55.069> with<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.280> way<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:55.549> chop<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:55.910> change<00:02:56.030> a

minute<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.030> I<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.360> that's<00:02:59.390> just

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
minute and I think that that's just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.709
