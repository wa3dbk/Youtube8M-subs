 [Music] 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.279
 hello youtube friends today I bring you 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.849
 this classic egg called the simpsons 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.059
 will remove the game is in Spanish and not 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.520
 you need installation first of all 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.949
 I want to invite you if you have a cell phone 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.350
 with android to visit the website that 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.949
 appears on the screen where they will find 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.050
 totally free games to download 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.530
 they would do him a great favor to share the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.350
 pages with your friends very well we are going to 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.350
 see how to download the game let's start 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.160
 the first thing is to go to the website on 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 link will be in the description once in 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.250
 the page we look for the menu and we click 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.410
 in the button several games once 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.070
 found the game we click on 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:17.290
 download we waited 5 seconds and we give 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.290
 click on remove advertising 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.970
 already on the download page we can 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.009
 do it in two ways the first is 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.009
 by clicking on the download button to your 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.990
 computer and the download will start 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.729
 automatically the second one is with the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.330
 program that I leave in the description 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.729
 called mega download air if you do not know 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.720
 how to download it also I leave the 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.720
 link of a tutorial 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.670
 we click on the button add links and 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.700
 then we go to the download page 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.400
 to copy the link as you see it will be added 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 automatically if this does not happen just what 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.920
 copy manually we click on add 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.410
 links and our download will begin 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.040
 to verify when the 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.690
 verification start our download 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.610
 As you can see, I recommend you use this 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.010
 program because the download speed 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.620
 is much larger than with the browser and 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.890
 therefore the waiting time will be 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.890
 less 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.650
 When the download is finished, 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.920
 there will be a rar file so what 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.170
 we extract will ask for a password that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.170
 is robert de osh game 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.760
 we wait for it to finish extracting 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.840
 It will take a while to pause the video 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.840
 so as not to bore them 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.020
 when they are finished, they will be left 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.120
 a folder will open it and inside 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.300
 many files since it is not necessary 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.640
 install the game you put the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.739
 folder where they want 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.920
 we look for the simpsons file that is the 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.930
 executable of the application if they want 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.940
 they can create direct access to your 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.940
 desk to access more easily 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.790
 and that's all friends can already play the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.950
 simpsons hit and run left them with a 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.459
 tiny gameplay of this wonderful 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.459
 game 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.120
 [Music] 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
 or 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.070
 l 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:53.009
 and that's why they must have been one of 

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:53.009

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.590
