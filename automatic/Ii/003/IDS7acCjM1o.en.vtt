00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.000 

we'll<00:02:50.060> have<00:02:50.180> ourselves<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.720> mini<00:02:50.989> omelet

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.780 

being<00:02:56.110> exciting

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.610 

look<00:03:00.450> at<00:03:00.629> it<00:03:00.810> bubble<00:03:01.290> away<00:03:01.610> getting<00:03:02.610> hot

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
look at it bubble away getting hot

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.960

cooking

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.500 

the<00:03:10.510> first<00:03:10.750> thought<00:03:10.990> of<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:13.180> assume

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the first thought of this I can assume

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.650 
the first thought of this I can assume
that<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.900> egg<00:03:14.050> would<00:03:14.320> cook<00:03:14.560> quicker<00:03:15.100> and<00:03:15.760> be<00:03:16.630> a

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
that the egg would cook quicker and be a

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:37.790 
that the egg would cook quicker and be a
little<00:03:16.780> more<00:03:16.930> dramatic

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.730 

so<00:03:38.400> we're<00:03:38.850> at<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.240> let's<00:03:40.140> have<00:03:40.260> some<00:03:40.440> sausage

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
so we're at it let's have some sausage

00:03:40.740 --> 00:04:00.080 
so we're at it let's have some sausage
and<00:03:41.310> maybe<00:03:43.730> Smashbox

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:14.900 

huh<00:04:01.110> Dickie

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.690 

well<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.810> didn't<00:04:16.709> have<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.830> chance<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.310> look<00:04:17.459> up

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
well I didn't have a chance to look up

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.340 
well I didn't have a chance to look up
on<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.720> Internet

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
on the Internet

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.540 
on the Internet
the<00:04:19.709> glorious<00:04:20.070> invention<00:04:21.290> and<00:04:22.290> I'll<00:04:22.550> what

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
the glorious invention and I'll what

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.160 
the glorious invention and I'll what
temperature<00:04:24.000> Hague<00:04:24.210> needs<00:04:24.540> to<00:04:24.660> be<00:04:24.750> cooked<00:04:24.930> at

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
temperature Hague needs to be cooked at

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.420 
temperature Hague needs to be cooked at
in<00:04:25.290> order<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.500> be<00:04:25.560> considered<00:04:25.890> steak<00:04:28.430> so

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
in order to be considered steak so

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.520 
in order to be considered steak so
happens<00:04:29.790> then<00:04:29.970> it<00:04:30.150> needs<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.420> be<00:04:30.480> cooked<00:04:30.810> to
