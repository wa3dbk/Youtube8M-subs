00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:11.630
 good vi cdh of engines we are on board 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.610
 aresti brida which has a system of 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.100
 infotainment really interesting childbirth 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.410
 drawer open because the usb socket is 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.029
 right here in a drawer a little 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.909
 uncomfortable to reach next there is 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.159
 also the auxiliary input but recognizes 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:26.659
 perfectly if the usb sticks be 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.800
 the ipod we have right now 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.769
 connected 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.859
 this is the interface of the put on a 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.989
 6-inch and half touchscreen display 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:38.840
 business that there is a little or resistive 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.190
 but once the command is taken 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.379
 it's pretty fast 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.379
 I immediately make you hear how you feel 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.020
 and you hear the bass not very well 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.730
 they also distort to the maximum volume in the 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.210
 others feel good so a good one 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.329
 system obviously not obviously 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.690
 because some of the photons don't 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.159
 they do 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.649
 the cover can be viewed 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.509
 of the album you are playing 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.090
 going to use the classics 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.130
 ipod functions then search by artist 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.899
 album song genre composer o 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.270
 go to the lists 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.340
 I tell favorite echoes that 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.000
 they would practically be ours 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.580
 playlist the list of sources lo 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.289
 we can visualize by crushing the 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.820
 button emilia we have the classic 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:34.640
 radio am fm nice because possibility of 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.039
 store four stations but we can 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.130
 also go by pressing this button a 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.289
 view all the stations that you 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.729
 they can receive the area where we are 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.050
 thanks to the king of s 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.100
 with the source button we return 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.159
 to the list of sources we go to al 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.349
 cd disk with mp3 are read 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.119
 perfectly the folders here we can 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.330
 go to the list of all the folders 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.000
 that there are in to the cd and go to 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.580
 listen to what interests us most 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.200
 listen if we always go back to the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.989
 possibility to go to the list of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.180
 sources and ability to listen in 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.920
 bluetooth streaming the music 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.430
 we are connecting to a telephone 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.650
 android from which you can do 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.540
 streaming or music resident on 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.280
 phone as in this case or 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.830
 we can safely go to 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.860
 listen to online radio and stream 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.709
 of online radio or any other 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.819
 multimedia content 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.800
 regarding the other solutions 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.780
 of the infotainment we go on the part 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.330
 car here interesting to see how 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.769
 functions the energy management between 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.660
 electric motor and heat engine 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.120
 battery but we will see it later in the focus 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.940
 infotainment gives us the information of the 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 travel then in the last minutes of 5 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.180
 minutes in five minutes 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.560
 how much gas we are consuming how much 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 energy we are regenerating thanks to 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.109
 energy brake you can go and see 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.269
 past what we have consumed for 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.120
 regarding the navigator function 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.590
 this is definitely good used 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 a lot of this navigator sent 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.689
 always satisfactions 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.019
 only small flaw when we go to 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.959
 enter a destination a little slow 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:21.510
 in the insertion of the street must 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.510
 wait a little while when we go to 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.269
 put letter by letter 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.030
 but nothing dramatic possibility of 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.760
 information thanks to the tmc on the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.959
 traffic obviously the map can be 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.510
 display both in 3d and in 2d 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.310
 let's try going to view mine 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.209
 destinations so we do make a 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.079
 calculation I rightly had not set 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.659
 an address for home we take a 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:55.769
 random address of the last because I have 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:58.680
 frequented we can tell him to avoid 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.669
 highways avoid cars avoid tolls 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:06.659
 or go to preferences and do 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:09.479
 also an ecological path that 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.549
 precedence to motorways and then to 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.109
 the go for to go and start the 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.790
 girl browsing that works a lot 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.039
 good when we use the navigator 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.109
 then you can also switch screens 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.239
 and go for example on infotainment 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.039
 here is the only flaw when we are 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.039
 on infotainment on any other 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.310
 function we can't visualize 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.259
 not even the small information on the 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.830
 navigation would be nice a split 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.090
 screen but there is no last thing 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.009
 that I want to show the part 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.110
 telephone decidedly very well done 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.330
 because in addition to the classic part 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.419
 phone with contacts or who 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.460
 to call it got to do is possible 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:51.060
 view incoming messages on 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:55.070
 on the phone and the nice thing is that i 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.780
 messages are also accompanied by 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.430
 from the photo of the caller quarte qua luca 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.949
 sent me a message you see 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.389
 here is the big face of luca 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.210
 smiles we can call back quickly 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.560
 via the appropriate hands-free button 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.009
 bluetooth that feels very good too 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.400
 at highway speeds 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:17.090
 and of course the phone downloads on 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.479
 on the IFO fears the whole rubric included 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.910
 siro Tuesday 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.979
 then there is how the images of the before says 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.750
 therefore called truly a 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.389
 infotainment is done well for what 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.430
 concerns the steering wheel controls here on the right 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.880
 we have the beginning of the end of the 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.410
 call 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.360
 unfortunately there are no voice commands 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.430
 so to call of an era to use the 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.880
 keypad or use the 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.289
 phone while on the left buttons 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.240
 to raise lower the volume for 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.580
 change the source in a loop between all 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.880
 the available sources and the button 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.380
 to raise and excuse for changing the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.110
 station memory or change 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.610
 more and less musical track for a 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.610
