and then plugged it right into my Bogner

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.329 
and then plugged it right into my Bogner
and<00:00:19.269> I<00:00:19.720> came<00:00:20.499> up<00:00:20.650> with<00:00:20.679> this<00:00:20.859> really<00:00:21.039> nasty

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
and I came up with this really nasty

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:40.400 
and I came up with this really nasty
riff<00:00:21.820> I'm<00:00:22.390> gonna<00:00:22.539> play<00:00:22.720> it<00:00:22.810> for<00:00:22.869> you<00:00:23.050> slowly

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.290 

now<00:00:41.410> what<00:00:41.590> I'm<00:00:41.680> gonna<00:00:41.770> do<00:00:42.010> is<00:00:42.250> play<00:00:42.970> it<00:00:43.000> along

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
now what I'm gonna do is play it along

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.240 
now what I'm gonna do is play it along
with<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.780> bass<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.200> the<00:00:44.260> drums<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.890> layer

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
with the bass and the drums and layer

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.950 
with the bass and the drums and layer
the<00:00:45.460> rest<00:00:45.640> of<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.880> part<00:00:46.120> so<00:00:46.330> that<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.570> can<00:00:46.780> see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
the rest of the part so that you can see

00:00:46.960 --> 00:01:38.469 
the rest of the part so that you can see
how<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.170> compose<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.130> song

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.279 

so<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.780> what<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.289> would<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:42.170> double<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
so now what I would do is double the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.279 
so now what I would do is double the
track<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.210> pan<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.420> track<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.079> did

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
track and pan the track that I just did

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.469 
track and pan the track that I just did
to<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> left<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.159> typically<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.090> would<00:01:48.329> use<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
to the left and typically I would use a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
to the left and typically I would use a
different<00:01:48.990> guitar<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> purposes<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
different guitar but for the purposes of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
different guitar but for the purposes of
this<00:01:50.640> video<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.329> gonna<00:01:51.630> switch<00:01:51.990> pickup

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this video I'm just gonna switch pickup

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130 
this video I'm just gonna switch pickup
settings<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.039> go<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.509> rhythm<00:01:54.750> pickup

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
settings and go to the rhythm pickup

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.510 
settings and go to the rhythm pickup
from<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> lead<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
from the lead so that you can get the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.270 
from the lead so that you can get the
variants<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.329> sound<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.229> hardpan<00:01:58.770> left<00:01:59.069> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
variants of sound when hardpan left and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:53.210 
variants of sound when hardpan left and
right

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.160 

so<00:02:54.220> now<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:55.239> next<00:02:55.480> process<00:02:55.660> would<00:02:56.050> be

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
so now the next process would be

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.520 
so now the next process would be
tracking<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.770> melody<00:02:57.160> over<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.760> riff

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
tracking the melody over that riff

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.460 
tracking the melody over that riff
typically<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.560> will<00:03:00.069> change<00:03:00.760> guitars<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.690> add

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
typically I will change guitars and add

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.620 
typically I will change guitars and add
some<00:03:02.800> effects<00:03:03.190> so<00:03:03.760> first<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.180> want<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.390> tell<00:03:04.540> you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
some effects so first I want to tell you

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.970 
some effects so first I want to tell you
about<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.900> guitar<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.200> I'm<00:03:05.380> using<00:03:05.530> now<00:03:05.770> this

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980

add<00:03:40.989> an<00:03:41.170> overdrive<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.709> some<00:03:41.920> kind<00:03:42.190> when<00:03:42.400> I'm

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
add an overdrive of some kind when I'm

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.640 
add an overdrive of some kind when I'm
to<00:03:43.030> my<00:03:43.150> Bogner<00:03:43.540> blue<00:03:43.720> channel<00:03:44.140> when<00:03:44.470> I'm

recording<00:03:45.370> leads<00:03:45.850> because<00:03:46.329> it<00:03:46.540> gives<00:03:46.720> me<00:03:46.840> a

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
recording leads because it gives me a

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.569 
recording leads because it gives me a
little<00:03:47.019> more<00:03:47.170> sustain<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.070> playability

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
little more sustain and playability

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.460 
little more sustain and playability
you'll<00:03:49.150> also<00:03:49.360> be<00:03:49.630> hearing<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.930> delay<00:03:50.230> in<00:03:50.350> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
you'll also be hearing a delay in the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.770 
you'll also be hearing a delay in the
loop<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.920> that's<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.790> TC<00:03:52.150> Electronics

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
loop and that's just a TC Electronics

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.560 
loop and that's just a TC Electronics
delay<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:54.489> I'm<00:03:54.970> going<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.209> play<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.450> melody

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
delay so I'm going to play the melody

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.380 
delay so I'm going to play the melody
for<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.110> slowly<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.760> get<00:03:57.910> an<00:03:58.000> idea<00:03:58.090> of

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
for you slowly so you get an idea of

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.050 
for you slowly so you get an idea of
what<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.170> but<00:03:59.799> understand<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.459> the

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
what it is and but understand that the

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.330 
what it is and but understand that the
licks<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.510> between<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.320> core<00:04:02.739> of<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:02.950> melody

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
licks in between the core of the melody

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.550 
licks in between the core of the melody
are<00:04:03.489> typically<00:04:03.880> improvise<00:04:04.390> on<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.900> record<00:04:05.410> as

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
are typically improvise on the record as

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.520 
are typically improvise on the record as
well<00:04:05.590> as<00:04:05.950> as<00:04:06.430> well<00:04:06.489> as<00:04:06.730> live<00:04:07.030> so<00:04:07.989> here's<00:04:08.410> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
well as as well as live so here's the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:25.529 
well as as well as live so here's the
melody<00:04:08.829> slow

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:28.990 

so<00:04:26.539> I<00:04:26.840> will<00:04:27.139> now<00:04:27.319> layer<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:28.069> to<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.699> tracks

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
so I will now layer this to the tracks

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.059 
so I will now layer this to the tracks
the<00:04:29.360> rhythm<00:04:29.599> tracks<00:04:29.870> that<00:04:30.139> I<00:04:30.199> had<00:04:30.800> previously

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
the rhythm tracks that I had previously

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.680 
the rhythm tracks that I had previously
played<00:04:31.610> along<00:04:32.030> with<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.270> bass<00:04:32.419> and<00:04:32.569> the<00:04:32.659> drums

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
played along with the bass and the drums

00:04:32.690 --> 00:05:09.999 
played along with the bass and the drums
here<00:04:33.349> we<00:04:33.409> go

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.620 

that<00:05:11.009> concludes<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.610> recording<00:05:12.180> of<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.600> a
