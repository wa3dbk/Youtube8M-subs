00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
correct this is it 12 volt battery this

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.020 
correct this is it 12 volt battery this
is<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.869> filter<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.850> control

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
is the filter and this is the control

panel<00:01:24.340> in<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.670> project<00:01:26.060> these<00:01:26.390> are<00:01:26.570> three

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
panel in the project these are three

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.580 
panel in the project these are three
turrets<00:01:27.970> injector<00:01:28.970> rails<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.509> these<00:01:30.350> are<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
turrets injector rails and these are the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.700 
turrets injector rails and these are the
inductors<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:33.970> this<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.270> fuel<00:01:35.659> tank<00:01:35.930> of

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
inductors and this is the fuel tank of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.380 
inductors and this is the fuel tank of
Mercy<00:01:37.190> 800<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.320> this<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.590> pump<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.390> this

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
Mercy 800 and this is the pump and this

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.660 
Mercy 800 and this is the pump and this
is<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.570> place<00:01:41.810> where<00:01:42.110> we'll<00:01:42.380> take<00:01:42.740> the

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
is the place where we'll take the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.580 
is the place where we'll take the
written<00:01:43.880> supplying<00:01:49.240> now<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.539> saw<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.110> working

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
written supplying now I saw the working

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.749 
written supplying now I saw the working
of<00:01:51.679> this<00:01:51.970> machine<00:01:53.259> firstly<00:01:54.310> via<00:01:55.310> dies<00:01:55.520> with

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
of this machine firstly via dies with

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:03.609 
of this machine firstly via dies with
battery<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.570> 12<00:01:57.020> volt<00:02:01.509> then<00:02:02.509> beyond<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.259> main

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
battery of 12 volt then beyond the main

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.680 
battery of 12 volt then beyond the main
switch<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.630> injectors<00:02:06.229> button<00:02:07.690> and

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
switch and on the injectors button and

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.900 
switch and on the injectors button and
we<00:02:09.289> start<00:02:09.560> the<00:02:10.039> pump<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:11.019> few<00:02:12.019> are<00:02:12.530> coming<00:02:12.910> so

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
we start the pump and few are coming so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.030 
we start the pump and few are coming so
in<00:02:14.030> buren<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.620> now<00:02:15.790> stop<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.000> five<00:02:17.209> seconds

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.630 

now<00:02:22.040> we<00:02:22.940> check<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.049> reading<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.470> fuel<00:02:25.280> on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
now we check the reading of the fuel on

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.850 
now we check the reading of the fuel on
the<00:02:25.820> unit<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.930> scale<00:02:27.140> are<00:02:27.290> stones<00:02:27.560> on<00:02:27.799> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the unit and the scale are stones on the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.580 
the unit and the scale are stones on the
burette

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:50.610 

you

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.559 

and<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:51.980> we<00:02:52.040> compare<00:02:52.610> these<00:02:53.030> readings<00:02:53.270> from

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
and now we compare these readings from

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.040 
and now we compare these readings from
standards<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:54.910> check<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.060> injector<00:02:56.420> closed

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
standards and check the injector closed

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:28.190 
standards and check the injector closed
or<00:02:57.290> node

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.300 

now<00:03:29.200> slowly<00:03:29.920> unix<00:03:31.230> these<00:03:32.230> are<00:03:32.410> upper<00:03:32.980> levels

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
now slowly unix these are upper levels

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.760 
now slowly unix these are upper levels
and<00:03:33.460> these<00:03:33.790> are<00:03:33.910> loaded<00:03:34.180> right<00:03:34.360> then<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.470> say

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
and these are loaded right then I say

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.340 
and these are loaded right then I say
these<00:03:36.040> are<00:03:36.070> closed<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.090> ejector<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:37.990> what's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
these are closed and ejector on what's

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.470 
these are closed and ejector on what's
propelling<00:03:38.620> properly<00:03:39.160> clean<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:39.610> these<00:03:40.300> are

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
propelling properly clean and these are

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.050 
propelling properly clean and these are
trained<00:03:41.050> injectors
