and<00:00:15.730> there's<00:00:16.510> certainly<00:00:17.200> a<00:00:17.260> lot<00:00:18.070> of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
and there's certainly a lot of

and there's certainly a lot of
conditions<00:00:19.300> that<00:00:19.510> we<00:00:19.660> deal<00:00:19.900> with<00:00:20.370> that<00:00:21.370> fall

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
conditions that we deal with that fall

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.930 
conditions that we deal with that fall
into<00:00:21.850> that<00:00:21.970> category<00:00:22.770> some<00:00:23.770> of<00:00:23.890> those<00:00:24.010> would

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
into that category some of those would

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.780 
into that category some of those would
be<00:00:25.090> things<00:00:25.330> like<00:00:25.690> ms<00:00:27.150> headache<00:00:28.440> stroke

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
be things like ms headache stroke

be things like ms headache stroke
seizures<00:00:30.900> those<00:00:31.900> are<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.110> big<00:00:32.290> ones<00:00:32.349> that<00:00:32.829> we

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
seizures those are the big ones that we

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.369 
seizures those are the big ones that we
see<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.570> usually<00:00:34.719> come<00:00:35.019> up<00:00:35.170> with<00:00:35.350> a

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
see you usually come up with a

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.790 
see you usually come up with a
differential<00:00:36.280> diagnosis<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:38.440> know<00:00:38.499> two<00:00:38.769> or

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
differential diagnosis you know two or

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.439 
differential diagnosis you know two or
three<00:00:39.039> things<00:00:39.280> that<00:00:39.579> are<00:00:39.879> the<00:00:40.269> most

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
three things that are the most

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.630 
three things that are the most

potentially likely explanation for
things<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:44.079> history<00:00:44.499> is<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.640> story<00:00:45.699> of<00:00:46.239> the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
things the history is the story of the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.319 
things the history is the story of the
problem<00:00:47.249> to<00:00:48.249> get<00:00:48.429> the<00:00:48.579> neurological

problem to get the neurological
narrative<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:50.019> have<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.319> talk<00:00:50.499> to<00:00:50.559> the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
narrative you have to talk to the

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:51.989 
narrative you have to talk to the
patient<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.249> go<00:00:51.370> back<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.850> beginning

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
patient and go back to the beginning

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.840 
patient and go back to the beginning
when<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.659> symptoms<00:00:53.050> began<00:00:53.649> and<00:00:53.920> how<00:00:53.949> things

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
when the symptoms began and how things

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.389 
when the symptoms began and how things
have<00:00:55.059> evolved<00:00:55.569> up<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.929> this<00:00:56.079> point<00:00:56.469> and<00:00:56.739> it's

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
have evolved up to this point and it's

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.669 
have evolved up to this point and it's
the<00:00:57.609> patient's<00:00:58.089> history<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.780> exam<00:00:59.289> that

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
the patient's history and exam that

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.469 
the patient's history and exam that
allows<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.339> to<00:01:00.550> do<00:01:00.909> what<00:01:01.149> we<00:01:01.300> call

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
allows you to do what we call

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.229 
allows you to do what we call
neurological<00:01:02.519> localization<00:01:03.519> as<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.909> where

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
neurological localization as to where

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.990 
neurological localization as to where
you<00:01:04.420> think<00:01:04.449> their<00:01:04.900> problem<00:01:05.320> is<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:05.890> once<00:01:06.880> you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
you think their problem is and once you

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.580 
you think their problem is and once you
know<00:01:07.149> where<00:01:07.329> you<00:01:07.509> have<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:07.840> look<00:01:08.049> then<00:01:08.409> you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
know where you have to look then you

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.010 
know where you have to look then you
know<00:01:08.799> what<00:01:09.610> diagnostic<00:01:10.390> studies<00:01:10.719> that<00:01:10.899> you

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
know what diagnostic studies that you

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.170 
know what diagnostic studies that you
have<00:01:11.259> to<00:01:11.439> obtain<00:01:11.590> in<00:01:12.040> order<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.880> get<00:01:13.030> the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
have to obtain in order to get the

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.480 
have to obtain in order to get the
answers<00:01:13.540> there<00:01:14.469> usually<00:01:14.740> are<00:01:15.070> no<00:01:15.219> surprises

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
answers there usually are no surprises

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.719 
answers there usually are no surprises
in<00:01:16.329> terms<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.110> what<00:01:17.289> I<00:01:17.320> find<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> exam<00:01:18.460> or

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
in terms of what I find on the exam or

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.420 
in terms of what I find on the exam or
what<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:18.880> don't<00:01:19.149> find<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.710> relationship

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
what I don't find the relationship

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.160 
what I don't find the relationship
between<00:01:22.149> neurology<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.320> neurosurgery<00:01:23.799> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
between neurology and neurosurgery is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.779 
between neurology and neurosurgery is
important<00:01:26.170> for<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.189> patient<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:30.100> both

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
important for the patient because both

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.330 
important for the patient because both
of<00:01:31.060> these<00:01:31.149> specialties<00:01:31.750> may<00:01:32.469> be<00:01:32.530> involved<00:01:33.009> in

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
of these specialties may be involved in

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.950 
of these specialties may be involved in
their<00:01:33.520> care<00:01:34.439> which<00:01:35.439> facilitates<00:01:36.869> getting<00:01:37.869> the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
their care which facilitates getting the

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.170 
their care which facilitates getting the
patient<00:01:38.380> cared<00:01:39.250> for<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.579> way<00:01:39.700> they<00:01:39.850> should<00:01:39.909> be

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
patient cared for the way they should be

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.889 
patient cared for the way they should be
and<00:01:40.859> facilitates<00:01:41.859> communication<00:01:42.899> between

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
and facilitates communication between

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.469 
and facilitates communication between
the<00:01:44.350> two<00:01:44.500> specialties<00:01:45.130> dealing<00:01:45.969> with<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.119> given

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
the two specialties dealing with a given

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.609 
the two specialties dealing with a given
patient<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.219> think<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.969> leads<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.929> much

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
patient and I think that leads to much

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.639 
patient and I think that leads to much
higher<00:01:50.859> quality<00:01:52.649> neurological

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
higher quality neurological

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
neurosurgical care in essence if you

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
neurosurgical care in essence if you
have<00:01:56.560> a<00:01:56.590> neurological<00:01:57.340> issue<00:01:58.799> spectrum
