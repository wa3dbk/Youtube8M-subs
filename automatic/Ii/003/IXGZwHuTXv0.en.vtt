the<00:00:21.300> past<00:00:21.329> couple<00:00:21.749> years<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.199> believe<00:00:22.439> um<00:00:22.679> I

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the past couple years I believe um I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.609 
the past couple years I believe um I
have<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.849> old<00:00:24.060> formula<00:00:24.509> here<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.499> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
have the old formula here this is the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.859 
have the old formula here this is the
one<00:00:25.800> without<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.220> isopropyl<00:00:26.909> alcohol<00:00:27.239> in<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
one without the isopropyl alcohol in it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
one without the isopropyl alcohol in it
so<00:00:28.259> I<00:00:28.289> absolutely<00:00:28.949> love<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.640> conditioner

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
so I absolutely love this conditioner

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
so I absolutely love this conditioner
but<00:00:30.630> they<00:00:30.749> change<00:00:30.989> the<00:00:31.079> formula<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.650> wanted

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
but they change the formula so I wanted

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
but they change the formula so I wanted
to<00:00:32.099> give<00:00:32.310> the<00:00:32.640> new<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> try<00:00:33.290> because<00:00:34.290> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
to give the new one a try because you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.450 
to give the new one a try because you
know<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> great<00:00:35.220> all-around

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
know this is a great all-around

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.250 
know this is a great all-around
conditioner<00:00:36.350> however<00:00:37.460> this<00:00:38.460> new<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:39.020> I'm<00:00:40.020> not

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
conditioner however this new one I'm not

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.570 
conditioner however this new one I'm not
feeling<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.650> at<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:40.980> seriously

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
feeling it at all seriously

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.210 
feeling it at all seriously
so<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.870> conditioner<00:00:43.350> has<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.860> different

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
so this conditioner has a different

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.800 
so this conditioner has a different
company<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.730> back<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.540> sure<00:00:45.600> if

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.900 
company on the back I'm not sure if
they've<00:00:45.930> taken<00:00:46.230> over<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:46.770> company<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.310> not<00:00:47.550> um

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
they've taken over the company or not um

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.810 
they've taken over the company or not um

similar<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> bottle<00:01:06.990> um<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.800> was<00:01:08.100> never

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
similar in the bottle um I was never

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.430 
similar in the bottle um I was never
really<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.550> fan<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.360> smell<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.170> old

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
really a fan of the smell of the old

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.430 
really a fan of the smell of the old
formula<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.730> you<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> kind<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.450> sucked<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
formula but you know I kind of sucked it

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.810 
formula but you know I kind of sucked it
up<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.980> used<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.460> anything

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
up and kind of used it into anything

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120 
up and kind of used it into anything
because<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> fantastic<00:01:16.500> conditioner

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
because it was a fantastic conditioner

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.520 
because it was a fantastic conditioner
so<00:01:17.550> this<00:01:17.909> one<00:01:18.090> smells<00:01:18.390> very<00:01:18.600> similar<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so this one smells very similar to the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.219 
so this one smells very similar to the
old<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> bottle<00:01:20.460> however<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.930> it's

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
old one in the bottle however when it's

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.290 
old one in the bottle however when it's
out<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.040> about<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.580> does<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:23.850> smell<00:01:24.180> like

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
out and about it does not smell like

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.850 
out and about it does not smell like
that<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.690> smells<00:01:25.020> worse<00:01:25.229> than<00:01:25.500> this

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that it actually smells worse than this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.950 
that it actually smells worse than this
one<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.760> that<00:01:26.909> right<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.120> was<00:01:27.390> already<00:01:27.570> kind

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
one so that right there was already kind

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.360 
one so that right there was already kind
of<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.229> oh<00:01:28.409> my<00:01:28.560> gosh<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.010> we<00:01:29.070> go

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
of like oh my gosh here we go

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.390 
of like oh my gosh here we go
so<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.540> consistency<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.409> lot<00:01:31.770> thicker<00:01:32.010> than

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
so the consistency is a lot thicker than

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
so the consistency is a lot thicker than
the<00:01:32.820> old<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.510> I'm<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.930> show<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:36.350> there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550 
the old one so I'm gonna show you there
you<00:01:37.440> go<00:01:37.620> so<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:38.820> creamier<00:01:39.420> than<00:01:39.690> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you go so it's much creamier than the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100 
you go so it's much creamier than the
old<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> glance<00:01:41.760> I<00:01:42.000> was<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.330> okay

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
old one so at a glance I was like okay

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.300 
old one so at a glance I was like okay
you<00:01:43.170> know<00:01:43.440> let's<00:01:43.650> see<00:01:43.799> how<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.100> works

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you know let's see how this works

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
you know let's see how this works

you can take pours out a lot easier and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.590 
you can take pours out a lot easier and
it's<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.310> lot<00:02:02.340> looser<00:02:02.790> it's<00:02:03.150> running<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:03.570> my

different ways on only a couple wash
days<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.319> used<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> rinse<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
days but I used it as a rinse out as a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.720 
days but I used it as a rinse out as a
detangler

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
used to get with the old formula so it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.210

great results with using this
conditioner<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.480> does<00:03:46.660> not<00:03:46.810> mean<00:03:47.019> that<00:03:47.049> it

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
conditioner that does not mean that it

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.250 
conditioner that does not mean that it
will<00:03:47.620> not<00:03:47.769> work<00:03:47.950> for<00:03:48.010> your<00:03:48.250> hair<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.669> do

will not work for your hair I do
encourage<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.410> to<00:03:50.530> give<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.829> try<00:03:51.010> because

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
encourage you to give it a try because

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.830 
encourage you to give it a try because
if<00:03:51.459> you<00:03:51.549> did<00:03:51.760> like<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.120> old<00:03:52.269> formula<00:03:52.690> and

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
if you did like the old formula and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.729 
if you did like the old formula and
you're<00:03:52.930> looking<00:03:53.169> for<00:03:53.290> something<00:03:53.440> a<00:03:53.620> little

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
you're looking for something a little

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.470 
you're looking for something a little
thicker<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.340> things<00:03:54.519> like<00:03:54.639> that<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:55.269> may

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
thicker and things like that this may

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.030 
thicker and things like that this may
work<00:03:55.630> for<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.049> if<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.380> didn't<00:03:56.739> like<00:03:56.859> the<00:03:57.010> old

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
work for you if you didn't like the old

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680 
work for you if you didn't like the old
formula<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.669> might<00:03:57.849> like<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.150> new<00:03:58.269> formula

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
formula you might like the new formula

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.629 
formula you might like the new formula
so<00:03:59.530> again<00:03:59.829> it's<00:03:59.950> just<00:04:00.069> trial<00:04:00.310> and<00:04:00.400> error<00:04:00.519> for

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
so again it's just trial and error for

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.789 
so again it's just trial and error for
everybody<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.389> although<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:02.109> didn't<00:04:02.440> like<00:04:02.590> it

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
everybody and although I didn't like it

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.289 
everybody and although I didn't like it
doesn't<00:04:03.220> mean<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:03.639> won't<00:04:03.760> like<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:03.970> so

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
doesn't mean that you won't like it so

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.610 
doesn't mean that you won't like it so
I'm<00:04:04.389> not<00:04:04.510> going<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.750> say<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.079> don't<00:04:05.290> try<00:04:05.500> it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
I'm not going to say like don't try it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.869 
I'm not going to say like don't try it
don't<00:04:05.829> buy<00:04:06.010> this<00:04:06.069> conditioner<00:04:06.579> or<00:04:06.639> anything

don't buy this conditioner or anything

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
like that because everybody's hair is

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.650 
like that because everybody's hair is
different<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.190> once<00:04:09.730> again<00:04:09.849> just<00:04:10.120> use<00:04:10.329> what

different so once again just use what
works<00:04:10.840> for<00:04:11.109> you<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.470> your<00:04:11.829> hair<00:04:12.040> will<00:04:12.190> let<00:04:12.340> you
