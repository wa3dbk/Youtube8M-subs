00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the old pecan system comes back there is

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.090 
the old pecan system comes back there is
a<00:01:18.780> possibility<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.560> come<00:01:19.799> back<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
a possibility I would come back to this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.370 
a possibility I would come back to this
game<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.369> start<00:01:20.549> playing<00:01:20.580> again<00:01:21.380> because

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
game and start playing again because

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
game and start playing again because
that's<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:23.189> what<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:23.970> I'm

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that's really what can be in it and I'm

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
that's really what can be in it and I'm
not<00:01:24.810> pulling<00:01:25.080> off<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> EOC<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.460> think

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
not pulling off the EOC I don't think

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520 
not pulling off the EOC I don't think
it's<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.759> bad<00:01:26.939> update<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.259> wasn't

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
it's a bad update I just think it wasn't

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
it's a bad update I just think it wasn't
worth<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.509> wasn't<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> right

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
worth it and it just wasn't the right

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.310 
worth it and it just wasn't the right
time<00:01:31.170> um<00:01:32.420> because<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.630> was<00:01:33.750> having<00:01:33.810> sort<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.200> fun
