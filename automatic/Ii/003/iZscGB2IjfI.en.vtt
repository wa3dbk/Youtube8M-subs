00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.309
 decided on another little draw guests 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.300
 there are a lot of people who 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.629
 tried to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.309
 and fuck me and followers who 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.549
 participated in sweepstakes therefore 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.860
 the draw will now be very fast and 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.040
 that was not something that did not connect 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.530

 visor let's start letting a little bit 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.770
 naturally I do not hope that 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:38.000

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:02.960
 It fell on this in principle now 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:09.190
 look at least up fine i feel 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:14.770

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.320

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.710
 keys what are you deposit what is 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.740
 well, at least different things 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.340
 fall out of this cool 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.340
 new touch with on tracks 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.060
 and it seems not much until the price and yes 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.060

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:08.209
 oh what he pokotsany sad sadness 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.480
 it is written in general there are 5 sudachkov 5 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.480
 keys 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.090
 and ump45 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.580
 no single repeat not fallen 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:25.610
 as noticed and most likely factors 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.379
 new test 4 keys 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.510
 I agree that not a single repeat 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:37.310
 fell and so that did not fall out there is no block 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.560
 sad whole block 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:49.799
 you can even use the contract and I 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:51.680
 I think I'll try right now, but if it's 100 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.569
 tracks skylink 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.730
 at least 100 tracks sky of course 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.140
 it does not discourage you understand yourself but 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.549
 Contra chests are not like them either you 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.549
 in the most severe minus 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.810
 either in the excellent pluses that can 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.829
 fall out there let's say the same and right there 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:21.780
 repulse half half of all so 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:24.000
 By the way, well, at least about the flicker 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.800
 yellow even if you don't fall out just 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.840

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.639

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.919

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.660
 me contract and 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:47.940
