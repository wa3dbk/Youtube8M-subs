in the wick is threaded on to the I unit

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.979 
in the wick is threaded on to the I unit
there<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:36.050> has<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.500> be<00:02:36.650> halfway<00:02:37.130> through<00:02:37.989> then

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
there it has to be halfway through then

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.140 
there it has to be halfway through then
we<00:02:39.560> insert<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.640> into<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.269> hole<00:02:41.299> into<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.049> tire

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
we insert it into the hole into the tire

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.220 
we insert it into the hole into the tire
and<00:02:44.950> we<00:02:45.950> need<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.670> about<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.480> third<00:02:47.900> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
and we need to have about a third of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.330 
and we need to have about a third of
that<00:02:48.260> wick<00:02:49.090> poking<00:02:50.090> out<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.540> hole<00:02:51.340> so

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
that wick poking out of the hole so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.920 
that wick poking out of the hole so
we'll<00:02:52.459> get<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.390> like<00:02:53.630> that<00:02:55.930> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
we'll get that in there like that and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.449 
we'll get that in there like that and
you<00:02:57.080> need<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.410> make<00:02:57.560> sure<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.920> at<00:02:58.040> least<00:02:58.250> a

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
you need to make sure it's at least a

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.630 
you need to make sure it's at least a
third<00:02:59.110> sticking<00:03:00.110> out<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.400> when<00:03:01.489> you

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
third sticking out so that when you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.059 
third sticking out so that when you
inflate<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.150> tire<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.930> wick<00:03:03.140> doesn't<00:03:03.799> blow

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
inflate the tire the wick doesn't blow

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.050 
inflate the tire the wick doesn't blow
out<00:03:04.099> with<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.880> tire<00:03:05.090> pressure

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.030 

we've<00:03:11.060> inserted<00:03:11.450> our<00:03:11.720> wick<00:03:11.959> into<00:03:12.319> the<00:03:12.440> tire<00:03:12.709> we

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
we've inserted our wick into the tire we

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.880 
we've inserted our wick into the tire we
cut<00:03:13.280> off<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.610> excess<00:03:14.030> being<00:03:14.870> careful<00:03:15.530> to

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
cut off the excess being careful to

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.140 
cut off the excess being careful to
leave<00:03:16.280> about<00:03:16.670> 5<00:03:17.450> mil<00:03:17.900> poking<00:03:18.620> out<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.310> tire

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.479 

so<00:03:25.150> we'll<00:03:25.330> just<00:03:25.510> cut<00:03:25.840> that<00:03:26.019> off<00:03:26.080> there<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.680> now

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
so we'll just cut that off there and now

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.210 
so we'll just cut that off there and now
we're<00:03:27.730> ready<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:28.000> reinstall<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.860> be<00:03:30.069> on<00:03:30.189> our

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
we're ready to reinstall and be on our

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.339 
we're ready to reinstall and be on our
way<00:03:30.519> or<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.819> adapter<00:03:31.659> onto<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.900> valve<00:03:32.140> of<00:03:32.319> the

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
way or the adapter onto the valve of the

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.830 
way or the adapter onto the valve of the
tire<00:03:32.590> and<00:03:33.519> then<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:33.909> have<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.180> canister<00:03:34.510> which

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
tire and then we have the canister which

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.899 
tire and then we have the canister which
has<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.260> mesh<00:03:35.409> covering<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.040> it<00:03:36.069> because<00:03:36.790> the

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
has the mesh covering on it because the

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.000 
has the mesh covering on it because the
temperature<00:03:37.420> will<00:03:37.599> drop<00:03:37.900> see<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.319> up<00:03:38.439> fingers

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
temperature will drop see it up fingers

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.410 
temperature will drop see it up fingers
don't<00:03:39.189> want<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:39.459> making<00:03:39.640> contact<00:03:39.939> with<00:03:40.239> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
don't want to be making contact with the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.170 
don't want to be making contact with the
metal<00:03:40.569> once<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.530> co2<00:03:42.190> starts<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.940> run<00:03:43.150> out

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
metal once the co2 starts to run out

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.830 
metal once the co2 starts to run out
then<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:43.989> screw<00:03:44.349> our<00:03:44.620> canister<00:03:45.720> into<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
then we screw our canister into the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:04:00.449 
then we screw our canister into the
adapter<00:03:47.379> on<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.680> tire

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:12.070 

now<00:04:01.459> it's<00:04:01.580> going<00:04:01.879> on<00:04:02.769> screw<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:03.980> on

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.490 

screw<00:04:12.710> that<00:04:12.740> adapter<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:14.690> cylinder<00:04:15.140> onto

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
screw that adapter that cylinder onto

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.170 
screw that adapter that cylinder onto
the<00:04:15.800> adapter<00:04:17.350> here<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.470> pressure<00:04:19.000> going<00:04:20.000> into

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
the adapter here the pressure going into

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:35.070 
the adapter here the pressure going into
the<00:04:20.450> toy
