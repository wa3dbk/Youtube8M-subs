I make some mud another way to mix
neighbor<00:01:11.189> might<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:12.799> fusion<00:01:13.799> attack<00:01:14.130> from

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
neighbor might as a fusion attack from

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.330 
neighbor might as a fusion attack from
the<00:01:14.400> surgeon<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:14.850> me<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.420> just<00:01:15.450> camp<00:01:15.930> out

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the surgeon like me then just camp out

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.420 
the surgeon like me then just camp out
since<00:01:17.340> he<00:01:17.460> dies<00:01:17.670> he's<00:01:18.090> gonna<00:01:18.240> spawn<00:01:18.570> no

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
since he dies he's gonna spawn no

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
since he dies he's gonna spawn no
actually<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.600> cancel<00:01:21.840> tax<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.439> scheme

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
actually you can cancel tax in a scheme

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.980 
actually you can cancel tax in a scheme
so<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.659> guess<00:01:24.659> scrap<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:25.950> extent<00:01:26.250> but

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
so I guess scrap that to an extent but

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.920 
so I guess scrap that to an extent but
maybe<00:01:27.990> destroy<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.979> made<00:01:29.130> me<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> mud

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
maybe destroy them that made me the mud

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.990 
maybe destroy them that made me the mud
