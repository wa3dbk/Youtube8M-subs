to shade the coverage right as well by

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
the right stick as we take a look here

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.869 
the right stick as we take a look here
you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:49.920> see<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.340> theory<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you can see that in theory we have a

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.400 
you can see that in theory we have a
defense<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> set<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> cover<00:00:52.050> I'll<00:00:52.199> cut

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
defense that is set up to cover I'll cut

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.470 
defense that is set up to cover I'll cut
inside<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.489> slot<00:00:53.699> corner<00:00:53.969> covers<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> cut

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
inside the slot corner covers the cut

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
inside the slot corner covers the cut
outside<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.500> deep<00:00:55.680> blue<00:00:55.860> safety<00:00:56.100> covers

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
outside and a deep blue safety covers

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.170 
outside and a deep blue safety covers
the<00:00:56.820> zone<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.570> anything<00:00:58.109> deep<00:00:58.609> ok<00:00:59.609> so<00:00:59.670> as<00:01:00.030> we're

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the zone or anything deep ok so as we're

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.250 
the zone or anything deep ok so as we're
checking<00:01:00.390> out<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.539> replays<00:01:00.809> here<00:01:00.989> I'd<00:01:01.079> say

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
checking out the replays here I'd say

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.540 
checking out the replays here I'd say
that<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:01.949> than<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.129> reasonable

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that this is more than a reasonable

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 
that this is more than a reasonable
result<00:01:03.030> aside<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.080> interception<00:01:04.680> here

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
result aside from the interception here

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.780 
result aside from the interception here
you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> coverage<00:01:05.760> was

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
you can see that the coverage was

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.420 
you can see that the coverage was
actually<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> blanket<00:01:07.110> up<00:01:07.740> next<00:01:08.250> we're<00:01:08.340> going

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
actually a blanket up next we're going

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.890 
actually a blanket up next we're going
to<00:01:08.520> run<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.670> streak<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.420> how<00:01:09.540> well<00:01:09.750> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to run a streak and see how well this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:23.070 
to run a streak and see how well this
does<00:01:10.110> against<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> deep<00:01:10.979> ball

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.260 

Wow<00:01:24.080> okay<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:25.220> guess<00:01:25.520> we<00:01:25.790> couldn't<00:01:26.030> find<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
Wow okay so I guess we couldn't find the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.880 
Wow okay so I guess we couldn't find the
right<00:01:26.299> time<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:26.659> let<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.810> ball<00:01:27.020> fly<00:01:27.320> this

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
right time to let the ball fly this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.190 
right time to let the ball fly this
actually<00:01:28.340> resulted<00:01:28.759> in<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.970> coverage<00:01:29.330> sac<00:01:29.600> take

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
actually resulted in a coverage sac take

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.359 
actually resulted in a coverage sac take
a<00:01:30.229> look<00:01:30.380> at<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.500> replay<00:01:30.649> here<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.220> see

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
a look at the replay here just to see

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.950 
a look at the replay here just to see
how<00:01:31.549> well<00:01:31.700> called<00:01:32.000> Calvin<00:01:32.450> Johnson<00:01:32.810> was

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
how well called Calvin Johnson was

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.550 
how well called Calvin Johnson was
covered<00:01:33.970> okay<00:01:34.970> so<00:01:35.080> last<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:36.200> certainly<00:01:36.320> not

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
covered okay so last but certainly not

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.380 
covered okay so last but certainly not
least<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:37.220> let's<00:01:37.700> take<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.850> look<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.119> run<00:01:38.270> an

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
least here let's take a look and run an

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.359 
least here let's take a look and run an
out<00:01:38.600> route<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.020> see<00:01:39.170> how<00:01:39.320> well<00:01:39.470> this<00:01:39.710> does<00:01:40.039> here

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
out route to see how well this does here

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.279 
out route to see how well this does here
out<00:01:40.759> routes<00:01:41.060> are<00:01:41.210> notorious<00:01:41.750> for<00:01:41.780> beating<00:01:42.170> a

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
out routes are notorious for beating a

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.840 
out routes are notorious for beating a
man<00:01:42.560> coverage<00:01:43.009> so<00:01:43.640> let's<00:01:43.789> take<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:43.909> closer<00:01:44.180> look

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.180 

hmm<00:01:49.850> okay<00:01:50.300> well<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.929> was<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.679> best<00:01:51.800> results

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
hmm okay well this was the best results

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.219 
hmm okay well this was the best results
so<00:01:52.310> far<00:01:52.340> like<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:53.300> said<00:01:53.360> out<00:01:53.600> rob's<00:01:53.780> do<00:01:53.960> beat<00:01:54.110> man

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
so far like I said out rob's do beat man

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.240 
so far like I said out rob's do beat man
coverage<00:01:54.259> so<00:01:54.710> this<00:01:54.860> isn't<00:01:55.159> all<00:01:55.220> that

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
coverage so this isn't all that

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.580 
coverage so this isn't all that
surprising<00:01:55.509> in<00:01:56.509> fact<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.810> 5-yard<00:01:57.229> gain<00:01:57.289> for

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
surprising in fact a 5-yard gain for

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.690 
surprising in fact a 5-yard gain for
Calvin<00:01:57.830> Johnson<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.220> actually<00:01:58.520> pretty

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
Calvin Johnson is actually pretty

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.669 
Calvin Johnson is actually pretty
reasonable<00:01:59.080> remember<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.110> said<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.380> Calvin

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
reasonable remember I said the Calvin

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.440 
reasonable remember I said the Calvin
Johnson<00:02:00.920> would<00:02:01.009> get<00:02:01.220> his<00:02:01.399> well<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.270> him

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
Johnson would get his well this is him

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.020 
Johnson would get his well this is him
just<00:02:02.720> getting<00:02:03.080> his<00:02:03.259> butt<00:02:04.009> jobs<00:02:04.250> Yeti<00:02:04.520> that's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
just getting his butt jobs Yeti that's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.620 
just getting his butt jobs Yeti that's
