00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.630
 And you guys, youtube, and apply. 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 Wednesday's helium package is 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 teaching you how to increase your fps 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.669
 and slow down your ping a bit in the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.169
 own father 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:33.120
 we were the first step the first step 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.740
 are you adjusting performance 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.590
 We come here in the start menu and 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:46.320
 type here is to adjust the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:49.500
 performance windows look of you 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 probably in leaving windows 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.990
 choose the best option for the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.900
 computer kill him 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.810
 several marked so you change to 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.140
 adjust for the best performance and 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.250
 and leaves tagged just show thumbnail 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.460
 instead of icons and use screen fonts 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.350
 with rounded corners of applying it 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.439
 will change your windows theme will 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.429
 stay well the kayak will change 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:26.039
 I'm just fine, it'll make your 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:28.469
 fps is to slightly improve this appearance 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.249
 semec band all working mode 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.249
 personalize 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.870
 I chose the option a windows 7 basic can 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.120
 choose the air but also 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.580
 ground floor a little more 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:51.140
 This sucks and your pin does not stay so 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.430
 good the second to the second is is the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.570
 alternative you have to be able to 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.570
 to improve is you see in energy options 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.230
 the power option 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.679
 where you were probably is 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940
 here in balanced or in economy of 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.220
 energy 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.200
 you change to the performance it can 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.209
 pull a little more energy if it is a 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.470
 computer and pull a little more 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:28.090
 battery of your notebook your 11 notebook 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:34.760
 Such an hour he greatly improves his game. 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:39.500
 you can close here is another option is also 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.160
 disco company the disco singles 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.970
 puts it on your to and from the ok does the cleaning 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.970
 do not do because it currently offers it 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.450
 is cleaning will greatly improve 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.560
 much better and considerably fps and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.560
 I'm your ping 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.650
 another option is you and me neither computer 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.370
 that you want us to put on the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:13.010
 right-click hard drive 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.780
 properties tools and fragmentation 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.489
 and squeeze and fragments it will now 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.640
 said it will increase your disk and improve 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.709
 a little more computer performance 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.170
 another tip I give is that if you 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:29.030
 have one with the intel's board 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.950
 probably she has seaweed graphics 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.620
 hd intel in one of the options in the 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.480
 without poison and click on it with 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.900
 the right mouse button comes 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:48.670
 graphic properties 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:50.319
 waiting to load you may see the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.599
 three mode mode advanced mode 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:59.950
 wizard mode you click on a module 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:02.310
 and ok when the Brazilian 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.720
 you see in 3d 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.459
 this three-finger preference I 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.500
 probably be in the middle in the center 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.079
 here balanced you change to 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.310
 performance does not apply to appear 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:18.519
 messages and ok gives the touch and so far 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.320
 is all done now only need 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.810
 inside the game to change some things 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.490
 to improve a little more I will use 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.720
 as an example here for you 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.720
 the crossfire 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.740
 It's one of the games that I really like 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:39.970
 in my favorites look good in this 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:43.780
 fault setting of your game and 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:47.380
 graphics here you put resolution 800 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.960
 x 600 for 16 bits you will put everything 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.650
 at least I do not put a texture in the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.840
 least because it gets a little too ugly 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.430
 and I'd rather be up here on the team. 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.280
 It makes no difference is to select 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.060
 until you can leave the full screen menu 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:12.580
 and full screen effects full screen 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.620
 You put it on the bass and here I got blood. 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.680
 the project and the climatic and 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.060
 can place will not decline a little 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.389
 a colleague of his game 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.020
 Let's see, what's a party hint to? 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.580
 you 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.770
 this possibility of zooming for you 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.990
 to use more in the ep and look that has a game 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.570
 so you can hit your opponent with 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.610
 more accuracy is to put an average of 15 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:42.530
 What you can keep up with is 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:46.169
 popularly raining 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:48.480
 several friends who can help you a lot 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.300
 in cref it has several various plates have 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.750
 three abec type chips 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.880
 the air show point b show their 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.100
 confrontations in the center and type c that I 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.780
 I like to use the dotted ball 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.260
 in the middle is easier than you by 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:07.740
 face your opponent accurately 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.620
 I state it to you has done everything 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.500
 This was here in the video lesson. 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.389
 probably fps will increase and if the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.000
 ping will decrease 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:22.080
 if it does not happen because your computer 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.440
 is a little past and the time it takes 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:31.950
 It's a little let's say a little 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:33.060
 based if that does not work, child only 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:39.390
 new parts 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.800
 This is it, it was good to cut the video if 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.630
 subscribe to my channel 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.630
 thanks the guys for hug
