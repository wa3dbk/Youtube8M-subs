00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
minutes let me know if you think I

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.670 
minutes let me know if you think I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
should take this step out of my

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.939 
should take this step out of my
tutorials<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.820> kind<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.149> obvious

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
tutorials because it is kind of obvious

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
tutorials because it is kind of obvious
next<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.159> am<00:01:05.220> painting<00:01:05.460> each<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.880> my<00:01:06.030> nails<00:01:06.240> with

next I am painting each of my nails with

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.840 
next I am painting each of my nails with
a<00:01:06.479> different<00:01:06.900> pastel<00:01:07.320> color<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.830> use<00:01:08.340> two<00:01:08.610> coats

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
a different pastel color I use two coats

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.789 
a different pastel color I use two coats
and<00:01:09.180> also<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.320> look<00:01:10.530> great<00:01:10.770> with

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and also this look would look great with

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
and also this look would look great with
just<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.790> color<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.630> decided<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.229> all

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
just one color I just decided to do all

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.510 
just one color I just decided to do all
the<00:01:13.560> color<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> could<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.340> what<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the color so you could see what it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.880 
the color so you could see what it
looked<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:18.450> prep<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> speckling<00:01:19.470> area

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
looked like to prep the speckling area

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.010 
looked like to prep the speckling area
just<00:01:20.130> drip<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.790> black<00:01:21.030> nail<00:01:21.240> polish<00:01:21.509> onto<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
just drip some black nail polish onto a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.749 
just drip some black nail polish onto a
piece<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.350> paper<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.460> ready<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
piece of paper and then you're ready to

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
piece of paper and then you're ready to
dip<00:01:24.030> your<00:01:24.240> toothbrush<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> dab

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
dip your toothbrush in and I like to dab

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.920 
dip your toothbrush in and I like to dab
it<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> piece<00:01:26.520> of<00:01:26.700> paper<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.600> isn't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it on a piece of paper just so it isn't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
it on a piece of paper just so it isn't
too<00:01:28.110> much<00:01:28.229> nail<00:01:28.560> polish<00:01:29.150> then<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.329> that's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
too much nail polish then all that's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.510 
too much nail polish then all that's
left<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.290> dab<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> toothbrush<00:01:32.159> onto

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
left to do is dab the toothbrush onto

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
left to do is dab the toothbrush onto
your<00:01:32.670> nails<00:01:32.850> lightly<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.350> do<00:01:34.470> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
your nails lightly and if you do it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
your nails lightly and if you do it
heavier<00:01:34.950> it'll<00:01:35.280> make<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> bigger<00:01:35.790> dot<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
heavier it'll make a bigger dot and the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.510 
heavier it'll make a bigger dot and the
good<00:01:37.110> thing<00:01:37.290> about<00:01:37.409> using<00:01:37.619> an<00:01:37.860> old<00:01:38.040> toothbrush

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
good thing about using an old toothbrush

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.130 
good thing about using an old toothbrush
is<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> bristles<00:01:39.390> are<00:01:39.720> kind<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.020> afraid

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is that the bristles are kind of afraid

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.719 
is that the bristles are kind of afraid
so<00:01:40.799> that's<00:01:40.979> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> give<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> better

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so that's going to give you a better

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.880 
so that's going to give you a better
effect

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
effect

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.860 
effect
after<00:01:44.730> your<00:01:44.850> black<00:01:45.030> nail<00:01:45.240> polish<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.810> dried

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
after your black nail polish has dried

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.470 
after your black nail polish has dried
apply<00:01:46.620> a<00:01:46.650> matte<00:01:46.920> topcoat<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.610> finish<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.030> off<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
apply a matte topcoat to finish it off I

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.900 
apply a matte topcoat to finish it off I
think<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> matte<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.980> transforms<00:01:50.640> this

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
think the matte really transforms this

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.620 
think the matte really transforms this
