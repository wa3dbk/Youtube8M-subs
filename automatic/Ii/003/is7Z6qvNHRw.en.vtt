 Hello everyone in Gazprom according to Mr.

 Today we will review the club Khimki 2 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.710
 Holy war 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.199
 as always happens in such games 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.479
 in the main menu we are with our pretentious 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.909
 hijacker 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.880
 here we select missions we push new groups 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.099
 No, unfortunately, continue on the palm 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.329
 I have already lost the game a little 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.769
 here is the name selection first place 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.679

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.839

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.120
 I already play two games more 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.890
 I play games from five years ago 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340
 so I have great skill 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.610
 veteran

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 in the sense of loading further 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.560
 a few days ago I had a chance 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 participate in forcing the Dnieper 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.800
 during our attacks i was badly injured 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.040
 firing from her german 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.040
 near shore functionality 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.950
 I woke up recruiting felt 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.770
 what rat products are made by boots 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.550
 sector just then such nonsense yet 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.690
 never considered 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.219
 105 download 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:20.450
 that's cool 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.590
 which has never seen 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.330
 there in my lead level was supposed to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.540
 boot up 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.950
 click now clicked 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.750
 break into Slovenia 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.970
 Kiev thasos 48 43 bodies 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.390

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.710

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.010
 here I am as we see 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.600
 dungeons where I probably already have rats 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.780
 may occur 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.360
 apparently progress 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.720
 since you see the sciences at our 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 There are no students about yak 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.530
 where to go 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.530
 the first question is when we play logically 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.710
 I doubt that they made her infinity ward 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.440
 since itâ€™s good that I havenâ€™t been 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.449
 saw 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.879
 here are the same corridors everywhere 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.439
 impossible to navigate 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.980
 everywhere the same thing as I can do 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.499
 can't imagine 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.759
 a person who is far from programming 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.949
 couldn't do that 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.949
 I already do not represent 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.759
 cheer what a crap where to go 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.079

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.859
 three hours later and what agony and finally 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.539
 then found a way out 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.909
