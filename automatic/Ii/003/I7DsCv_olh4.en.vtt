00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
stuff and I've got a little build there

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
your while to stick around so there's a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.450 
your while to stick around so there's a
little<00:01:03.840> weirdness<00:01:04.710> going<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.400> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
little weirdness going on here if you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.000 
little weirdness going on here if you
try<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> place<00:01:05.850> water<00:01:06.119> into<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.049> lava<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.920> an

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
try to place water into or lava into an

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.570 
try to place water into or lava into an
already<00:01:08.159> placed<00:01:08.880> source<00:01:09.090> block<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.630> does<00:01:09.780> this

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
already placed source block it does this

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.219 
already placed source block it does this
it<00:01:11.580> makes<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> sound<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.390> like<00:01:12.600> breaking

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it makes it sound like you like breaking

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
it makes it sound like you like breaking
blocks<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.830> quick<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.549> strange

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
blocks really quick it's really strange

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
blocks really quick it's really strange
same<00:01:15.210> goes<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.600> lava<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> makes<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
same goes with lava and it makes a

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.070 
same goes with lava and it makes a
little<00:01:17.070> particle<00:01:17.430> splash<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.840> very

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
little particle splash so that is very

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.390 
little particle splash so that is very
odd<00:01:19.320> hopefully<00:01:19.770> they'll<00:01:19.920> fix<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.310> before

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
odd hopefully they'll fix that before

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.609 
odd hopefully they'll fix that before
1.6<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> big<00:01:22.110> things<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.439> they

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
1.6 now one of the big things that they

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
1.6 now one of the big things that they
did<00:01:22.830> change<00:01:23.040> though<00:01:23.340> they're<00:01:24.180> working<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
did change though they're working on the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.840 
did change though they're working on the
new<00:01:24.750> launcher<00:01:25.320> even<00:01:25.710> more<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.220> Dinnerbone

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
new launcher even more and Dinnerbone

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.730 
new launcher even more and Dinnerbone
added<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.299> new<00:01:27.509> profile<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.049> edit<00:01:28.380> profile

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
added a new profile and edit profile

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
added a new profile and edit profile
button<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.909> hopefully<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> new

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
button to that so hopefully the new

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.200 
button to that so hopefully the new
launcher<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.310> fully<00:01:32.880> running

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
launcher is going to be fully running

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
launcher is going to be fully running
when<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.960> 1.6<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:35.939> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
when we get 1.6 but because we have a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
when we get 1.6 but because we have a
second<00:01:36.420> week<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.900> these<00:01:37.229> bugs<00:01:37.680> or<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> second

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
second week of these bugs or a second

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
second week of these bugs or a second
day<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.790> row<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.090> bug<00:01:39.299> fixes<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.960> gonna

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
day in a row of bug fixes I'm gonna

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319 
day in a row of bug fixes I'm gonna
guess<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.130> pre-release<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.759> probably

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
guess that the pre-release is probably

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.350 
guess that the pre-release is probably
coming<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.920> Thursday<00:01:44.090> getting<00:01:45.090> pretty

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
coming out Thursday getting pretty

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.109 
coming out Thursday getting pretty
pretty<00:01:46.170> certain<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.310> point<00:01:47.579> now

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
pretty certain now at this point now

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
pretty certain now at this point now
this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:49.229> thing<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.380> showed<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.770> guys
