closer so I wasn't able to use a closure
but<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.250> used<00:02:14.540> IVs<00:02:15.540> flip<00:02:15.780> over<00:02:16.050> method<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.710> this

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.630 
think you need four bundles to be
completely<00:03:40.170> honest<00:03:40.590> four<00:03:41.040> bundles<00:03:41.250> is<00:03:41.459> not

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
completely honest four bundles is not

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.740 
completely honest four bundles is not
necessary<00:03:42.090> you<00:03:42.150> could<00:03:42.330> probably<00:03:42.480> get<00:03:42.720> away

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
necessary you could probably get away

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.339 
necessary you could probably get away

much<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.269> shed<00:03:52.730> okay<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:54.360> i'm<00:03:54.510> taking<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:54.900> all

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
much it shed okay see i'm taking out all

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.580 
much it shed okay see i'm taking out all
the<00:03:55.500> hair<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:57.000> brush<00:03:57.269> was<00:03:57.480> completely<00:03:58.380> empty

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
the hair this brush was completely empty

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.140 
the hair this brush was completely empty
before<00:03:59.040> i<00:03:59.690> detangled<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.549> this<00:04:02.549> is<00:04:02.910> how

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
before i detangled it and this is how

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.890 
before i detangled it and this is how
much<00:04:03.859> it<00:04:04.859> shed

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
much it shed

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.240 
much it shed
so<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.590> mean<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.220> could<00:04:08.400> deal<00:04:08.549> with<00:04:08.700> that

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
so I mean if you could deal with that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.860 
so I mean if you could deal with that
hey<00:04:11.250> then<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.879> guess<00:04:12.060> this<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.360> hair<00:04:12.659> for

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
hey then I guess this is the hair for

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.410 
hey then I guess this is the hair for
you<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.349> that<00:04:14.069> is<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> lot<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.579> hair<00:04:14.879> it's<00:04:15.239> like

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
you but that is a lot of hair it's like

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.870 
you but that is a lot of hair it's like
when<00:04:15.900> I<00:04:15.930> detangle<00:04:16.500> my<00:04:16.530> natural<00:04:17.100> hair<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.579> get

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
when I detangle my natural hair I get

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.729 
when I detangle my natural hair I get
just<00:04:18.030> about<00:04:18.209> just<00:04:18.750> about<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:19.199> much<00:04:19.259> hair<00:04:19.709> you

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
know what I mean after I wash it and I

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.590 
know what I mean after I wash it and I
detangle<00:04:22.919> it<00:04:22.949> with<00:04:23.250> conditioner<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.570> that

much<00:04:24.930> hair<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.740> like<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:26.190> kind<00:04:26.910> of

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
much hair so it's like I kind of

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.029

expected<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.630> when<00:04:27.900> i<00:04:27.960> got<00:04:28.229> when<00:04:28.560> i<00:04:28.590> received

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
expected that when i got when i received

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.830 
expected that when i got when i received
this<00:04:29.160> curly<00:04:29.490> hair<00:04:29.639> I<00:04:29.940> expected<00:04:30.449> shedding<00:04:30.780> I

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
this curly hair I expected shedding I

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.590 
this curly hair I expected shedding I
expectancy<00:04:31.350> angling<00:04:32.120> so<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.150> wasn't<00:04:33.479> too

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
expectancy angling so I wasn't too

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.540 
expectancy angling so I wasn't too
disappointed<00:04:33.780> it's<00:04:34.350> not<00:04:34.470> like<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:35.250> know<00:04:35.370> when

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
disappointed it's not like you know when

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.980 
disappointed it's not like you know when
you<00:04:35.610> go<00:04:35.729> like<00:04:35.880> this<00:04:36.150> you<00:04:36.330> get<00:04:36.449> in<00:04:36.600> Billy's<00:04:36.870> of

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
you go like this you get in Billy's of

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.689 
you go like this you get in Billy's of
strings<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.350> only<00:04:37.530> got<00:04:37.680> one<00:04:37.979> train<00:04:38.280> when<00:04:38.460> I<00:04:38.490> did

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
strings I only got one train when I did

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.120 
strings I only got one train when I did
that<00:04:38.729> so<00:04:39.270> it's<00:04:39.510> not<00:04:39.660> even<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.440> bad<00:04:40.710> honestly

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
that so it's not even that bad honestly

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.770 
that so it's not even that bad honestly
like<00:04:41.639> when<00:04:41.820> you<00:04:41.910> get<00:04:42.060> curly<00:04:42.360> here<00:04:42.479> you<00:04:42.539> have<00:04:42.690> to

like when you get curly here you have to

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.590 
like when you get curly here you have to
expect<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> shed<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.300> tangle<00:04:45.300> that's<00:04:45.449> just

expect it to shed and tangle that's just

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.659

it is but overall I really like the curl
pattern<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:52.139> pattern<00:04:52.169> is<00:04:52.800> small<00:04:53.310> but<00:04:53.580> pretty

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
pattern the pattern is small but pretty

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.500 
pattern the pattern is small but pretty

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
and to define the curls is actually not

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.240 
and to define the curls is actually not
