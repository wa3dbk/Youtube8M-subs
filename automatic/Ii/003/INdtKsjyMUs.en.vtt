00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
fight they did and it was like one of

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.830 
fight they did and it was like one of
those<00:01:19.770> awesome<00:01:20.340> energy<00:01:20.970> waves<00:01:21.509> the

Kamehameha<00:01:22.350> wave<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.759> thought<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> was<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
Kamehameha wave and I thought it was a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
Kamehameha wave and I thought it was a
Cali<00:01:24.689> good<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> was<00:01:25.470> completely<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.979> off

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
apparently cuz this game doesn't call it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.060 
apparently cuz this game doesn't call it
a<00:01:27.720> Galligan<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.770> completely

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
a Galligan and because it completely

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.870 
a Galligan and because it completely
