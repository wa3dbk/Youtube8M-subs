soaked<00:02:13.390> back<00:02:13.780> into<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> plant<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.130> a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
soaked back into the plant this is a

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.520 
soaked back into the plant this is a
great<00:02:15.400> way<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.580> conserve<00:02:15.940> water<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.019> this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
great way to conserve water this is this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.680 
great way to conserve water this is this
is<00:02:17.680> almost<00:02:18.100> completely<00:02:18.730> dry<00:02:19.000> here<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
is almost completely dry here and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.870 
is almost completely dry here and
there's<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.709> lot<00:02:20.890> more<00:02:21.070> water<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.550> some<00:02:21.760> of

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
there's a lot more water in some of

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.870 
there's a lot more water in some of
these<00:02:22.000> others<00:02:22.800> certain<00:02:23.800> plants<00:02:24.310> use<00:02:24.580> more

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
these others certain plants use more

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.390 
these others certain plants use more
than<00:02:25.090> others<00:02:25.390> and<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:26.530> where<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> moisture

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
than others and that's where a moisture

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.550 
than others and that's where a moisture
meter<00:02:27.550> comes<00:02:27.910> in<00:02:28.090> handy<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:31.840> now<00:02:31.959> I'll<00:02:32.320> try

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
meter comes in handy so for now I'll try

irrigation and hose wrangling are my

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.160 
irrigation and hose wrangling are my
least<00:03:29.370> favorite<00:03:30.120> jobs<00:03:30.420> in<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> garden<00:03:31.349> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
least favorite jobs in the garden and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.080 
least favorite jobs in the garden and
I'm<00:03:34.170> also<00:03:34.379> concerned<00:03:35.010> about<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.489> chemicals

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
I'm also concerned about the chemicals

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.110 
I'm also concerned about the chemicals
in<00:03:36.329> tap<00:03:36.780> water<00:03:37.489> negating<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.609> positive

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
in tap water negating the positive

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.949 
in tap water negating the positive
effects<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.079> microbes<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.799> soil<00:03:41.689> so<00:03:42.689> a

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
effects of the microbes in soil so a

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.009 
effects of the microbes in soil so a
week<00:03:43.169> ago<00:03:43.439> I<00:03:43.650> bought<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.280> finally<00:03:45.209> a<00:03:45.419> water

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
week ago I bought a finally a water

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.490 
week ago I bought a finally a water
filter<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.530> my<00:03:46.799> hose<00:03:47.269> however<00:03:48.349> while<00:03:49.349> I'm

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
filter for my hose however while I'm

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.800 
filter for my hose however while I'm
excited<00:03:50.129> about<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.519> chemicals<00:03:51.030> not<00:03:51.329> going

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
excited about the chemicals not going

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.649 
excited about the chemicals not going
into<00:03:52.109> the<00:03:52.200> plans<00:03:53.000> there's<00:03:54.000> no<00:03:54.180> water<00:03:54.419> pressure

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
into the plans there's no water pressure

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.050 
into the plans there's no water pressure
so<00:03:55.109> it<00:03:55.470> takes<00:03:55.709> forever<00:03:55.919> to<00:03:56.189> hand<00:03:56.489> water<00:03:56.700> all<00:03:57.030> of

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
so it takes forever to hand water all of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.670 
so it takes forever to hand water all of
my<00:03:57.389> stuff<00:03:59.810> don't<00:04:00.810> forget<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.260> leave<00:04:01.409> fresh

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
my stuff don't forget to leave fresh

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.280 
my stuff don't forget to leave fresh
water<00:04:01.949> for<00:04:02.220> birds<00:04:02.519> butterflies<00:04:03.150> and<00:04:03.930> bees<00:04:06.290> of

water for birds butterflies and bees of

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.140 
water for birds butterflies and bees of
course<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.769> next<00:04:08.010> step<00:04:08.129> is<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.970> buy<00:04:09.120> a

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
course the next step is to buy a

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.809 
course the next step is to buy a
filtration<00:04:09.780> system<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:11.220> put<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.639> main

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
filtration system to put on the main

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.110 
filtration system to put on the main
gauge<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:13.680> that's<00:04:13.889> very<00:04:14.190> expensive<00:04:14.519> and

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
gauge but that's very expensive and

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.509 
gauge but that's very expensive and
complicated<00:04:15.569> because<00:04:16.530> my<00:04:16.979> gauges<00:04:17.250> are

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
complicated because my gauges are

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.539 
complicated because my gauges are
antiquated<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:18.479> the<00:04:19.019> whole<00:04:19.229> thing<00:04:19.739> needs<00:04:20.190> to
