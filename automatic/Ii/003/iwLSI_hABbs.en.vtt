like fearing them and respect them so
much<00:01:04.780> where<00:01:05.590> you<00:01:06.010> will<00:01:06.400> not<00:01:06.670> do<00:01:06.909> something

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
much where you will not do something

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.610 
much where you will not do something
that<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:07.659> were<00:01:07.720> probably<00:01:07.900> doing<00:01:08.080> a<00:01:08.260> casual
