I<00:00:21.830> tied<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.570> hotline<00:00:24.570> it's<00:00:24.960> hard<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.439> but

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
I tied in a hotline it's hard to see but

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.349 
I tied in a hotline it's hard to see but
I<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.890> added<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.670> outside<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I just added it to the outside of it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.710 
I just added it to the outside of it
because<00:00:27.660> his<00:00:28.590> terminals<00:00:29.070> don't<00:00:29.310> look<00:00:29.609> very

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
because his terminals don't look very

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.790 
because his terminals don't look very
you<00:00:30.720> know<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.990> didn't<00:00:31.199> want<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> disrupt<00:00:31.619> them

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
too much so this stuff was long enough I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
too much so this stuff was long enough I
just<00:00:33.899> put<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.370> plain<00:00:35.579> old<00:00:35.610> lawnmower

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
me some got me some power to this

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.850 
me some got me some power to this
distribution<00:00:45.090> box<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> added<00:00:46.110> right

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
distribution box that I added right

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
distribution box that I added right
there<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:48.140> added<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.260> box<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.059> then<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.149> ran

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there I added that box and then I ran

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.610 
there I added that box and then I ran
the<00:00:51.750> hot<00:00:51.989> line<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:54.140> then<00:00:55.140> hooked<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the hot line up and then hooked it to a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.770 
the hot line up and then hooked it to a
switch<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.520> actually<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.539> two

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
switch right here I actually have two

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.029 
switch right here I actually have two
switches<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.350> we're<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.739> put<00:00:58.890> more

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
switches because we're going to put more

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
switches because we're going to put more
stuff<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.670> headliner<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
stuff up in the headliner up there that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.330 
stuff up in the headliner up there that
are<00:01:01.230> going<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.469> powered<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.070> switch

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
are going to be powered off this switch

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
are going to be powered off this switch
but<00:01:03.149> nobody<00:01:03.629> no<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.199> there<00:01:04.350> yet<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
but nobody no do so there yet but this

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.760 
but nobody no do so there yet but this
is<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> heated<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.150> heated<00:01:06.450> switch<00:01:06.770> kick

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is the heated the heated switch kick

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.039 
is the heated the heated switch kick
that<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:09.270> will<00:01:09.420> turn<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> heat<00:01:09.780> I'll<00:01:09.930> get

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that on that will turn the heat I'll get

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.710 
that on that will turn the heat I'll get
to<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> mirror<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> second<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.729> right<00:01:12.420> and

can<00:01:58.229> tie<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.270> there's<00:02:00.270> two<00:02:00.329> for

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
can tie it in there and there's two for

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.469 
can tie it in there and there's two for
each<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:01.159> there's<00:02:02.159> two<00:02:02.399> green<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.180> white

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
each one there's two green with a white

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.029 
each one there's two green with a white
stripe<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.399> two<00:02:05.399> white<00:02:06.299> with<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> blue<00:02:06.810> stripe

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
stripe and two white with a blue stripe

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
stripe and two white with a blue stripe
but<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.220> what<00:02:08.369> we're<00:02:08.520> getting<00:02:08.610> juice<00:02:09.509> from

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
but that's what we're getting juice from

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.750 
but that's what we're getting juice from
I<00:02:11.360> tied<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.599> here

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
I tied it in here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.130 
I tied it in here
it's<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.239> white<00:02:15.420> wire<00:02:15.720> with<00:02:16.019> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's going to be the white wire with the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.140 
it's going to be the white wire with the
red<00:02:16.290> stripe<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.829> second<00:02:17.220> pin<00:02:17.400> as<00:02:17.610> you're

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
red stripe the second pin as you're

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.699 
red stripe the second pin as you're
looking<00:02:18.299> at<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.599> right<00:02:18.900> here<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> second<00:02:19.560> pin

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
looking at it right here the second pin

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.050 
looking at it right here the second pin
you<00:02:19.829> see<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> white<00:02:20.280> wire<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.849> into

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
you see the white wire going up into

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.119 
you see the white wire going up into
there<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> tied<00:02:22.799> it<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:22.950> for

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
there that's where I tied it in for

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.220 
there that's where I tied it in for
running<00:02:23.400> lights<00:02:23.579> now<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.420> only<00:02:24.629> reason<00:02:24.930> why

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
running lights now the only reason why

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.270 
running lights now the only reason why
this<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.340> okay<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:27.200> because<00:02:28.200> we're<00:02:29.099> going<00:02:29.220> to

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
this is okay is because we're going to

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.460 
this is okay is because we're going to
there's<00:02:29.970> going<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.180> be<00:02:30.239> LED<00:02:30.780> lights<00:02:30.989> inside<00:02:31.200> of

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
there's going to be LED lights inside of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.649 
there's going to be LED lights inside of
there<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.799> they're<00:02:31.950> amp<00:02:32.220> draw<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:33.000> nothing

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
there and they're amp draw is nothing

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.110 
there and they're amp draw is nothing
and<00:02:33.870> there's<00:02:34.590> only<00:02:34.829> two<00:02:35.040> lights<00:02:35.519> on<00:02:35.879> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and there's only two lights on this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.910 
and there's only two lights on this
entire<00:02:36.540> circuit<00:02:37.140> I'll<00:02:37.230> make<00:02:37.439> sure<00:02:37.470> until<00:02:37.799> the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
entire circuit I'll make sure until the

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.399 
entire circuit I'll make sure until the
customer<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:39.180> cannot<00:02:39.689> add<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:39.989> this

customer that you cannot add to this
anymore<00:02:40.769> we<00:02:41.099> do<00:02:41.250> not<00:02:41.400> want<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.670> overload<00:02:41.909> the

anymore we do not want to overload the
circuit<00:02:42.510> or<00:02:42.569> fry<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.810> switch<00:02:43.079> out<00:02:43.400> but<00:02:44.400> we<00:02:44.609> can

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
circuit or fry the switch out but we can

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.660 
circuit or fry the switch out but we can
tie<00:02:44.939> in<00:02:45.150> right<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:46.069> just<00:02:47.069> for<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.310> mean<00:02:47.549> there

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
tie in right there just for I mean there

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.750 
tie in right there just for I mean there
to<00:02:47.849> 194<00:02:48.720> style<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.409> mean<00:02:49.500> they<00:02:49.889> might<00:02:50.069> draw<00:02:50.370> who

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
to 194 style I mean they might draw who

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.030 
to 194 style I mean they might draw who
knows<00:02:50.970> how<00:02:51.150> many<00:02:51.389> freakin<00:02:52.109> little<00:02:52.829> bitty

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
knows how many freakin little bitty

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.309 
knows how many freakin little bitty
amount<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.450> where<00:02:54.599> I<00:02:54.629> got<00:02:54.840> light<00:02:55.079> from

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
amount but that's where I got light from

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.140 
amount but that's where I got light from
light<00:02:55.590> turn<00:02:56.579> signals<00:02:57.439> now<00:02:58.970> ran<00:02:59.970> them<00:03:00.120> through

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
light turn signals now ran them through

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.599 
light turn signals now ran them through
the<00:03:00.389> loom<00:03:00.599> that's<00:03:01.379> pretty<00:03:01.650> fun<00:03:01.859> you'll<00:03:02.400> figure

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
the loom that's pretty fun you'll figure

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.830 
the loom that's pretty fun you'll figure
it<00:03:02.730> out<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:04.849> once<00:03:05.849> you<00:03:05.970> get<00:03:06.180> over<00:03:06.299> here

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
it out and once you get over here

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.009 
it out and once you get over here
this<00:03:07.319> is<00:03:07.500> where<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.799> mirrors<00:03:08.129> are<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:09.510> coming

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
this is where the mirrors are now coming

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.670 
this is where the mirrors are now coming
out<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.560> mirror<00:03:11.599> give<00:03:12.599> you<00:03:12.900> these<00:03:13.409> code

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
out of the mirror give you these code

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.229 
out of the mirror give you these code
they<00:03:13.829> come<00:03:14.010> with<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.250> adapters<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
they come with the adapters this is the

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.559 
they come with the adapters this is the
little<00:03:15.450> plug<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:16.260> goes<00:03:16.500> for<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.010> 99202<00:03:17.760> o3

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
little plug that goes for the 99202 o3

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.979 
little plug that goes for the 99202 o3
this<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.709> only<00:03:20.010> power<00:03:20.370> adjust<00:03:21.030> for<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:21.720> glass

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
this is only power adjust for the glass

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.250 
this is only power adjust for the glass
to<00:03:22.669> adjust<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.449> cut<00:03:24.780> them<00:03:24.840> off<00:03:24.989> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
to adjust it I just cut them off you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.990 
to adjust it I just cut them off you
don't<00:03:25.590> need<00:03:25.739> them<00:03:25.859> on<00:03:26.010> there<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.280> didn't<00:03:26.879> know<00:03:26.970> I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
don't need them on there I didn't know I

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.550 
don't need them on there I didn't know I
thought<00:03:27.030> about<00:03:27.419> leaving<00:03:27.599> some<00:03:27.959> slack<00:03:28.319> but

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
thought about leaving some slack but

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.180 
thought about leaving some slack but
there's<00:03:28.919> no<00:03:29.099> use<00:03:29.310> forget<00:03:30.269> that<00:03:30.449> now<00:03:30.599> this<00:03:31.190> door

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
there's no use forget that now this door

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.039 
there's no use forget that now this door
can<00:03:32.519> get<00:03:32.699> kind<00:03:32.909> of<00:03:33.000> wet<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.449> mean<00:03:33.659> it<00:03:33.780> shouldn't

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
can get kind of wet I mean it shouldn't

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.789 
can get kind of wet I mean it shouldn't
but<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.500> could<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.220> he<00:03:35.790> shrunk<00:03:36.090> these<00:03:36.840> now

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
but it could so he shrunk these now

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.180 
but it could so he shrunk these now
coming<00:03:38.250> out<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.879> mirror<00:03:39.419> itself<00:03:40.159> when<00:03:41.159> you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
coming out of the mirror itself when you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.280 
coming out of the mirror itself when you
come<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.609> of<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:41.790> mirror<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.269> black<00:03:42.870> with

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
come out of the mirror the black with

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.860 
come out of the mirror the black with
the<00:03:43.409> white<00:03:43.650> stripe<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:45.030> heat<00:03:45.269> function

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
the white stripe is the heat function

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.710 
the white stripe is the heat function
that's<00:03:46.560> heat<00:03:47.099> so<00:03:47.699> that's<00:03:48.000> what<00:03:48.209> we<00:03:48.359> hooked<00:03:48.599> to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that's heat so that's what we hooked to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.589 
that's heat so that's what we hooked to
this<00:03:48.870> switch<00:03:49.199> right<00:03:49.229> here<00:03:49.819> because<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.150> you

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
this switch right here because the you

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.879 
this switch right here because the you
know<00:03:51.720> there's<00:03:51.900> no<00:03:52.019> use<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.199> having<00:03:52.470> heat<00:03:52.769> on

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
know there's no use in having heat on
