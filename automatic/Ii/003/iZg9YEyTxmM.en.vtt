and let's just give you a shot of the

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.690 
and let's just give you a shot of the
hours<00:01:08.440> you're<00:01:09.440> gonna<00:01:09.560> adjust<00:01:10.040> for<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:10.460> there

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
hours you're gonna adjust for you there

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.440 
hours you're gonna adjust for you there
but<00:01:11.300> it's<00:01:11.450> 282<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:14.110> 282<00:01:15.110> on<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.440> other<00:01:15.560> one

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
but it's 282 and 282 on the other one

you<00:01:31.010> have<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.430> depth<00:01:31.700> gauge<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:33.290> I'll<00:01:33.620> just

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
you have a depth gauge and I'll just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.820 
you have a depth gauge and I'll just
kind<00:01:34.040> of<00:01:34.190> see<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:34.580> off

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
kind of see that off

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.060 
kind of see that off
move<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.400> around<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:36.880> can<00:01:37.090> see<00:01:37.120> it<00:01:38.070> well

of your instruments all working and next
we'll<00:01:49.390> do<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.540> speed<00:01:49.840> trials<00:01:50.320> hold<00:01:51.160> on<00:01:51.280> start

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
we'll do the speed trials hold on start

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.150 
we'll do the speed trials hold on start
over<00:01:51.850> go<00:01:52.420> George<00:01:53.320> we've<00:01:53.530> already<00:01:53.710> got<00:01:54.010> the
