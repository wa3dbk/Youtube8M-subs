00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
asleep at that point and I woke up and

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.990 
asleep at that point and I woke up and
I'm<00:05:36.830> like<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.070> game<00:05:37.220> is<00:05:37.370> over<00:05:37.490> and<00:05:37.640> I'm

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
I'm like the game is over and I'm

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.880 
I'm like the game is over and I'm
talking<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.360> all<00:05:38.450> my<00:05:38.630> heat<00:05:38.780> friends<00:05:39.170> and<00:05:39.350> then

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
talking to all my heat friends and then

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.060 
talking to all my heat friends and then
I'm<00:05:40.790> tellin<00:05:41.300> history<00:05:41.630> corner<00:05:41.990> bang<00:05:42.260> and<00:05:42.830> I'm

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
I'm tellin history corner bang and I'm

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.580 
I'm tellin history corner bang and I'm
sitting<00:05:43.430> near<00:05:43.610> like

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
sitting near like

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.530 
sitting near like
so<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.620> think<00:05:46.950> if<00:05:47.340> you're<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.580> bosch<00:05:47.910> fan<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:48.420> is

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
so I think if you're a bosch fan this is

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.960 
so I think if you're a bosch fan this is
definitely<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:48.990> card<00:05:49.350> to<00:05:49.530> go<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.800> pick<00:05:49.950> up<00:05:50.100> in

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
definitely a card to go and pick up in

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.970 
definitely a card to go and pick up in
comparison<00:05:51.570> to<00:05:51.600> the<00:05:51.750> Onyx<00:05:52.050> card<00:05:52.320> onyx<00:05:52.620> card<00:05:52.890> is

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
comparison to the Onyx card onyx card is

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.850 
comparison to the Onyx card onyx card is
about<00:05:53.070> 40,000<00:05:54.060> probably<00:05:54.450> about<00:05:54.600> 20<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.230> 30<00:05:55.500> on

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
about 40,000 probably about 20 to 30 on

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.650 
about 40,000 probably about 20 to 30 on
throwback<00:05:56.460> Thursdays<00:05:56.850> when<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.180> you<00:05:57.630> know

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
throwback Thursdays when the you know

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.650 
throwback Thursdays when the you know
the<00:05:57.870> price<00:05:58.080> drops<00:05:58.610> so<00:05:59.610> I<00:05:59.910> would<00:06:00.180> say<00:06:00.360> if<00:06:00.540> you

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
the price drops so I would say if you

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.410 
the price drops so I would say if you
want<00:06:00.930> the<00:06:00.990> Onyx<00:06:01.320> card<00:06:01.620> but<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.640> basically<00:06:03.240> if

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
want the Onyx card but is basically if

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.300 
want the Onyx card but is basically if
you<00:06:03.510> just<00:06:03.660> want<00:06:03.840> a<00:06:03.960> more<00:06:04.170> athletic<00:06:04.320> rebounding

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
you just want a more athletic rebounding

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.730 
you just want a more athletic rebounding
version<00:06:05.640> of<00:06:05.790> Bosh<00:06:06.030> but<00:06:06.690> offensively<00:06:07.200> you

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
version of Bosh but offensively you

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.920
