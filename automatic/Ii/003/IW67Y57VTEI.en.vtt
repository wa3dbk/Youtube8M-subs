pond engine enough it was a lot more

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.800 
pond engine enough it was a lot more
faster<00:02:18.100> but<00:02:19.100> then<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:20.150> got<00:02:20.299> used<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.780> it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810

and

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
and

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.179 
and
immediately<00:02:22.909> I<00:02:22.969> just<00:02:23.409> started<00:02:24.409> going<00:02:24.709> faster

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
immediately I just started going faster

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.489 
immediately I just started going faster
and<00:02:25.219> faster<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:26.030> want<00:02:26.749> to<00:02:26.810> try<00:02:26.900> out<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.200> year

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:27.499 
and faster I want to try out this year
