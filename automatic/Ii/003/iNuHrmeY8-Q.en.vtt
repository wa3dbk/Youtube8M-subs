00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello guys let's talk a little bit 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.720
 about interior landscapes but 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 first of all you have to know that it is a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.070
 landscape a landscape is the whole area that 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.980
 we see from a place of agreement by 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.300
 example there are artificial landscapes made 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.850
 by man as can be the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.970
 cities and natural landscapes as you can 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.029
 be a forest 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.789
 the landscapes of the interior are the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.609
 landscapes that are located far from the 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.169
 sea ​​and coastal landscapes are those 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.629
 they are close 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.670
 let's see the interior and those of 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.650
 interior can be either mountain or 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.160
 plain according to what surrounds them 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.860
 look 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.400
 a mountain landscape its landscape of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.120
 inside 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.800
 the mountains are elevations of the terrain 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 They are usually made of stones 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.640
 mountains have three legs 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.820
 they have the upper part 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.320
 the ader to the little one that goes down and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.510
 they have and 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.950
 in agreement the foot is the bottom 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.170
 of the mountain 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 I repeat the top of the mountain 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.220
 it is called the hill that goes down the slope and 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.220
 other 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:20.190
 when we join the many mountains 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.040
 we call sierra 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.940
 of understood several mountains together is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.860
 a saw 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.010
 and then there's something else that is 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.280
 they call valleys valleys are land 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.970
 smooth flat land that are located 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.030
 between several mountains we imagine that there 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.750
 a mountain range that is surrounding 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.940
 something and the bottom part is a valley of 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.460
 agreement is not only the foot the foot is 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.800
 right where it starts where the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.150
 mountain according to how you look at it the valley is 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.720
 as if they were 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.520
 in agreement 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.820
 the landscapes of plain are lands that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.460
 They are smooth and are apart very large one 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.149
 valley is tiny and a landscape of 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.150
 plain is a large smooth terrain of 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.360
 agreement and then apart in the landscapes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.610
 of plain sometimes there are hills the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.900
 hills are tiny mountains and that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.989
 apart they have little inclination 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.689
 and the landscapes of plains are very 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.430
 good to cultivate like all 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.319
 terrain is smooth there can be cultivated 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.310
 pretty good and you can do fields 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.730
 of cultivation 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.330
 let's do an activity write a 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.080
 m if it's mountain scenery or a l if the 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.730
 landscape of plain this terrain that is 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.920
 landscape of mountain or plain 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.130
 of plain because it is quite ellison 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.320
 true 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.780
 smooth plain and this terrain that is 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:00.700
 mountain or plain 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.250
 the truth here we have the foot 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.600
 the slope and apart above will be the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.520
 top s for example has no valley 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.610
 and these vegetation landscapes we are going to 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.970
 see them this will be mountain or 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.970
 plain 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.760
 a bit difficult but if you look 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.920
 here 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.470
 a lot of climbing trees go up 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.470
 they go up and when they go up there is mountain 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.760
 and this landscape of vegetation that is 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.330
 mountain or plain 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.549
 natural is quite smooth and also in the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.590
 plain landscapes is where you can 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.390
 cultivate 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.790
 mountain landscapes are good for 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.350
 trees and the plain landscapes are 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.040
 good ones 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.560
 we quickly review the landscapes 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.080
 of mountains have mountains that is to say they are 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.120
 very high the mountains have three 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.640
 parts top slope and foot sometimes between 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.310
 several mountains there are valleys that are 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.470
 smooth terrains more or less small and if 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.170
 we put together several mountains 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.070
 we got a saw the landscapes of 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.230
 plain are big smooth from time to time 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.449
 when they have hills empty mountains 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.250
 and they are good to grow as the 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.370
 terrain is smooth they are good to cultivate 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.590
 and where you live in a landscape 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.150
 mountain in one of plain or in another 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.150
 different until soon
