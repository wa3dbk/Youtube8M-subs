00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
facilities on all five continents we

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.320 
facilities on all five continents we
think<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> ocean<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.500> best<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.330> we

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
think the ocean is the best and we

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.879 
think the ocean is the best and we
cannot<00:04:24.660> replace<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.290> ocean

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
cannot replace the ocean

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.100

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
but we can we can bring ways where there

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.110 
but we can we can bring ways where there
is<00:04:31.260> no<00:04:31.410> waves<00:04:31.650> and<00:04:31.950> then<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.370> think<00:04:32.729> that's<00:04:32.910> a

is no waves and then I think that's a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.450
