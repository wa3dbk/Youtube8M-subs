however<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.399> bipolar<00:00:52.880> you'll<00:00:53.120> get<00:00:53.300> actually

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
however with bipolar you'll get actually

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.020 
however with bipolar you'll get actually
more<00:00:53.899> torque<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:55.579> way<00:00:55.700> we're<00:00:55.850> going<00:00:55.940> to

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
more torque and the way we're going to

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.910 
more torque and the way we're going to
be<00:00:56.090> hooking<00:00:56.270> it<00:00:56.450> up<00:00:56.570> with<00:00:56.870> parallel<00:00:57.410> it's

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
be hooking it up with parallel it's

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.970 
be hooking it up with parallel it's
going<00:00:58.309> to<00:00:58.370> be<00:00:58.489> for<00:00:58.880> point<00:00:59.300> 17<00:00:59.809> volts<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.320> we'll

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
going to be for point 17 volts and we'll

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.490 
going to be for point 17 volts and we'll
draw<00:01:01.190> two<00:01:01.399> point<00:01:01.640> eight<00:01:01.730> amps<00:01:01.940> however<00:01:02.780> we're

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
draw two point eight amps however we're

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.370 
draw two point eight amps however we're
going<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.710> be<00:01:03.829> pushing<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.670> motor<00:01:05.570> with<00:01:06.020> much

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
going to be pushing the motor with much

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.800 
going to be pushing the motor with much
more<00:01:06.649> than<00:01:06.829> four<00:01:07.100> point<00:01:07.369> 17<00:01:07.820> volts<00:01:08.060> and<00:01:08.360> you'll

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
more than four point 17 volts and you'll

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.480 
more than four point 17 volts and you'll
also<00:01:09.020> notice<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.470> in<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.830> series<00:01:10.220> it

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
also notice that in the series it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.370 
also notice that in the series it
requires<00:01:10.820> more<00:01:11.090> voltage<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:11.810> would<00:01:12.229> have

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
requires more voltage so you would have

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.910 
requires more voltage so you would have
to<00:01:12.530> have<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:13.010> much<00:01:13.640> larger<00:01:14.030> power<00:01:14.570> supply<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:14.960> to

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
to have a much larger power supply to to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.010 
to have a much larger power supply to to
run<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.280> in<00:01:16.400> series<00:01:16.670> mode<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.150> that's<00:01:17.780> why

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
run it in series mode so that's why

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.210 
run it in series mode so that's why
we're<00:01:18.200> going<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.350> be<00:01:18.409> running<00:01:18.650> in<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.860> parallel

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
we're going to be running in a parallel

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.880 
we're going to be running in a parallel
mode<00:01:19.400> it<00:01:19.700> will<00:01:19.909> require<00:01:20.420> less<00:01:21.080> voltage<00:01:21.350> but<00:01:21.830> it

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
mode it will require less voltage but it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.070 
mode it will require less voltage but it
will<00:01:21.950> require<00:01:22.220> more<00:01:22.310> amps<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.390> be<00:01:23.840> able<00:01:23.990> to

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
will require more amps to be able to

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.810 
will require more amps to be able to
drive<00:01:24.229> it<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:24.950> also<00:01:25.100> consideration

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
drive it and this is also consideration

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.539 
drive it and this is also consideration

if you're going to be setting it up in
series<00:01:31.010> you<00:01:31.040> probably<00:01:31.190> want<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.820> much<00:01:32.030> larger

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
