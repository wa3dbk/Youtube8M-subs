 what the scrutiny record says 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.610
 Sir

 sumo mal 700 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.260
 17 votes 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.140
 and it turns out that the figure that the candidate 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.760
 or former candidate gives 717 valid votes 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.830
 is the one that results from the sum of the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.020
 votes consigned in the two tables 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.040
 they took the information from just one 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.460
 table are two are two tables in this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.730

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:53.040
 of what the scrutiny record says 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.310
 sir there are 712 valid votes and one thousand 66 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.470
 voters if you see only one table 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.820
 and compares it to the number of the sum of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.060
 the two tables obviously going to give 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.060
 plus 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.270
 one thousand 66 voters 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:14.480

 here and to all citizens and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.480
 Venezuelas citizens who see me to 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.130
 enter on the council's website 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.930
 national electoral this are in the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.940
 National Council website 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 electoral or in the words of Jimmy Carter 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 the best electoral system in the world 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.880
 but to give proof that it is a 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.470
 coup d'etat and that is no 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.970
 fraud complaint and they do not care 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.890
 even the truth this is not a 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.010
 confusion of here that has difficulties 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.590
 with the math 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.810
 the table that you are denouncing 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.920
 won that is to say that there was a louis fraud 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.010
 you this is the most naughty manipulation 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.990
 of the truth to justify what 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.060
 unjustifiable 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.360
 we have learned a lot these 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.360
 years
