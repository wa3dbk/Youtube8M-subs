00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
pending on which side is the cardigan

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.340 
pending on which side is the cardigan
and<00:04:26.160> thinking<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:27.270> might<00:04:27.600> do<00:04:27.990> it<00:04:28.229> two<00:04:29.070> times

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
all the way to the end and then you

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.110 
all the way to the end and then you
weave<00:05:08.660> in<00:05:08.960> your<00:05:08.990> ends<00:05:09.379> which<00:05:09.979> all<00:05:10.430> you<00:05:10.699> do<00:05:10.879> is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
weave in your ends which all you do is

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.930 
weave in your ends which all you do is
you<00:05:11.330> get<00:05:11.509> a<00:05:11.990> needle<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:13.129> you<00:05:13.340> put<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:13.759> yarn

you get a needle and you put the yarn
and<00:05:14.449> you<00:05:14.569> kind<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.020> put<00:05:15.470> it<00:05:15.590> through<00:05:15.949> the<00:05:16.810> okay

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
and you kind of put it through the okay

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.610 
and you kind of put it through the okay
remember<00:05:19.340> try<00:05:19.759> to<00:05:19.819> do<00:05:20.060> it<00:05:20.210> loosely

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.550

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
literally just picking it up and it

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.310 
literally just picking it up and it

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.990 
okay and if I wasn't doing the magic
loop<00:05:52.180> method<00:05:52.470> you<00:05:53.470> need<00:05:53.620> to<00:05:53.889> get<00:05:54.220> a<00:05:54.250> marker<00:05:54.790> and

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
loop method you need to get a marker and

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.820 
loop method you need to get a marker and
place<00:05:55.360> it<00:05:55.570> in<00:05:55.690> between<00:05:56.110> those<00:05:56.350> two<00:05:56.530> stitches

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
so now we knit four and that two

00:06:45.730 --> 00:07:12.399 
so now we knit four and that two
together<00:06:46.500> six<00:06:47.500> times

times and then you bind off all the
stitches<00:08:00.980> knitwise<00:08:02.680> repeat<00:08:03.680> for<00:08:03.890> a<00:08:03.920> second

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280
