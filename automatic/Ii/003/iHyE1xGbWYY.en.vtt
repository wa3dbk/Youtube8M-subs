00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
close to a fire source so so this will

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.809 
close to a fire source so so this will
work<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.720> will<00:02:18.870> warm<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.349> up<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:20.489> well<00:02:20.670> as

entering the tent will serve the same

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.619 
entering the tent will serve the same
purpose<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:23.370> it's<00:02:23.580> raining<00:02:23.790> at<00:02:24.120> or<00:02:24.269> snowing

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
through the model so I'm sure most of

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.570 
through the model so I'm sure most of
you<00:02:30.930> are<00:02:31.110> clever<00:02:31.349> enough<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.620> know<00:02:31.769> that's<00:02:31.890> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
you are clever enough to know that's the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.339 
you are clever enough to know that's the
Festa<00:02:33.000> obviously<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.599> knew<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.170> way<00:02:34.200> to

Festa obviously if I knew of a way to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.259 
Festa obviously if I knew of a way to
make<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.799> stop<00:02:35.129> raining<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.760> inside<00:02:36.030> like

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
make it stop raining on the inside like

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.759 
make it stop raining on the inside like
how<00:02:36.420> other<00:02:36.599> games<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:37.049> I<00:02:37.260> would<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.620> taken

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
how other games do I would have taken

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.410 
how other games do I would have taken
care<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.549> it's<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:39.299> know<00:02:39.330> it's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.330 
obviously you won't see any rain alright
so<00:02:45.989> if<00:02:46.079> I<00:02:46.110> click<00:02:46.170> my<00:02:46.349> bedroll<00:02:46.829> it'll<00:02:47.220> actually

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
so if I click my bedroll it'll actually

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.220 
so if I click my bedroll it'll actually
unroll<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.090> become<00:02:48.390> a<00:02:48.420> bedroll<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:49.049> I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
unroll to become a bedroll if I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.350 
unroll to become a bedroll if I
reposition<00:02:50.099> it<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.549> roll<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.849> back<00:02:50.940> up<00:02:51.000> and

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
reposition it I can roll it back up and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.910 
reposition it I can roll it back up and
move<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.780> around<00:02:51.870> somewhere<00:02:52.349> else<00:02:52.470> as<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.799> can

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
move it around somewhere else as you can

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.130 
move it around somewhere else as you can
see<00:02:53.239> once<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.329> click<00:02:54.569> that<00:02:54.599> it'll<00:02:54.989> actually

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
see once you click that it'll actually

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.890 
see once you click that it'll actually
fold<00:02:55.620> out<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:56.069> could<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:56.519> rotate<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.090> raise<00:02:57.870> it

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
fold out I could then rotate it raise it

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.229 
fold out I could then rotate it raise it
or<00:02:58.140> lower<00:02:58.200> just<00:02:58.799> like<00:02:58.890> everything<00:02:59.129> else<00:02:59.340> when

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
or lower just like everything else when

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.449

between<00:05:14.630> realism<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.650> you<00:05:16.580> know<00:05:16.700> what's<00:05:17.210> cool

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
between realism and you know what's cool

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.300 
between realism and you know what's cool
and<00:05:17.630> then<00:05:18.260> the<00:05:18.350> Imperial<00:05:18.800> version<00:05:19.100> has<00:05:19.280> a

and then the Imperial version has a
couple<00:05:19.580> less<00:05:19.820> but<00:05:20.120> you<00:05:20.270> get<00:05:20.420> the<00:05:20.480> idea<00:05:20.570> to

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
couple less but you get the idea to

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.310 
couple less but you get the idea to
screen<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.560> blocks<00:05:21.920> out<00:05:22.130> the<00:05:22.460> fire<00:05:23.320> people

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
screen it blocks out the fire people

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.890 
screen it blocks out the fire people
can't<00:05:24.530> see<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:25.010> kind<00:05:25.160> of<00:05:25.190> thing<00:05:25.400> and

can't see you that kind of thing and

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.720 
can't see you that kind of thing and
then<00:05:26.900> there<00:05:27.140> is<00:05:27.170> a<00:05:27.350> pelt<00:05:27.770> or<00:05:27.950> a<00:05:28.040> rug<00:05:28.280> that's

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
then there is a pelt or a rug that's

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.870 
then there is a pelt or a rug that's
just<00:05:28.940> for<00:05:29.330> aesthetics<00:05:30.220> it's<00:05:31.220> actually<00:05:31.370> you

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
just for aesthetics it's actually you

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.700 
just for aesthetics it's actually you
can<00:05:32.030> unroll<00:05:32.420> this<00:05:32.840> big<00:05:33.080> Pelt<00:05:33.380> into<00:05:33.950> your<00:05:34.100> tent

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
so if I click it it becomes felt I could

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.370 
so if I click it it becomes felt I could
raise<00:05:39.590> it<00:05:39.770> slightly<00:05:40.120> lift<00:05:41.120> it<00:05:41.240> up<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.540> then<00:05:42.290> i

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
raise it slightly lift it up and then i

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.220 
raise it slightly lift it up and then i
can<00:05:43.210> confirm<00:05:44.210> it<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:45.160> it<00:05:46.160> will
