what<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.500> bouncing<00:02:15.770> Betties<00:02:16.010> are<00:02:16.100> going<00:02:16.220> to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
what the bouncing Betties are going to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.890 
what the bouncing Betties are going to
work<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.580> they<00:02:16.700> did<00:02:16.880> modern<00:02:17.120> warfare<00:02:17.270> 3<00:02:17.420> but

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
work like they did modern warfare 3 but

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.690 
work like they did modern warfare 3 but
you<00:02:18.140> know<00:02:18.560> these<00:02:18.710> are<00:02:18.770> just<00:02:18.980> ideas<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.580> I'm

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
you know these are just ideas that I'm

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.960 
you know these are just ideas that I'm
free<00:02:19.910> balling<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.650> mean<00:02:21.650> it's<00:02:22.610> probably<00:02:22.850> going

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
free balling I mean it's probably going

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.110 
free balling I mean it's probably going
to<00:02:23.030> make<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.530> attack<00:02:24.530> math<00:02:24.740> perk<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.850> much

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
to make the attack math perk so much

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.060 
to make the attack math perk so much
more<00:02:26.390> viable<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.110> game<00:02:27.320> but<00:02:27.500> i<00:02:27.680> like<00:02:28.040> it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
more viable in this game but i like it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.830 
more viable in this game but i like it
and<00:02:28.340> i<00:02:28.550> asked<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:28.970> question<00:02:29.300> of<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.570> how
