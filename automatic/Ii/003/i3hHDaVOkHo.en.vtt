00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.190 
rounds of this remote ball here on this
side<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:29.030> here<00:02:30.030> we've<00:02:30.209> got<00:02:30.359> the<00:02:30.600> connection

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
side and here we've got the connection

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.129 
side and here we've got the connection
for<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.650> adapter<00:02:32.130> cable<00:02:32.519> now<00:02:33.419> this<00:02:33.690> adapter

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
for this adapter cable now this adapter

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.070 
for this adapter cable now this adapter
cable

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
cable

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.730 
cable
simply<00:02:35.440> plug<00:02:35.680> things<00:02:36.010> with<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.340> side<00:02:36.550> port

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
simply plug things with the side port

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.180 
simply plug things with the side port
like<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.570> then<00:02:40.570> it's<00:02:40.720> a<00:02:40.840> simple<00:02:41.050> matter<00:02:41.260> of

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
like so and then it's a simple matter of

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.690 
like so and then it's a simple matter of
connecting<00:02:42.730> these<00:02:43.540> two<00:02:43.840> sections<00:02:44.290> together

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
connecting these two sections together

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.460 
connecting these two sections together
now<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.880> obviously<00:02:46.030> handy<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:47.320> they've

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
now is obviously handy that they've

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.310 
now is obviously handy that they've
included<00:02:47.830> some<00:02:48.760> instructions<00:02:49.420> for<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:50.170> as

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
included some instructions for you as

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.770 
included some instructions for you as
well<00:02:50.500> but<00:02:51.280> it's<00:02:51.760> not<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:52.060> difficult<00:02:52.300> to

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
well but it's not that difficult to

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.710 
well but it's not that difficult to
actually<00:02:53.320> get<00:02:53.680> things<00:02:53.950> set<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.480> running

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
actually get things set up and running

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.660 
actually get things set up and running
you<00:02:56.410> can<00:02:56.500> obviously<00:02:56.800> tuck<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.310> out<00:02:57.520> of<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
you can obviously tuck this out of the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.240 
you can obviously tuck this out of the
way<00:02:57.820> of<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.600> lens<00:02:58.810> if<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.110> want<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.740> you

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
way of the lens if you want to and you

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.240 
way of the lens if you want to and you
can<00:03:00.460> of<00:03:00.610> course<00:03:00.640> delve<00:03:01.510> into<00:03:01.780> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
can of course delve into the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.440 
can of course delve into the
instructions<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:03.400> you<00:03:03.550> want<00:03:03.760> to<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.030> well<00:03:04.240> but

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
instructions if you want to as well but

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.380 
instructions if you want to as well but
basically<00:03:05.440> once<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.180> camera

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
basically once that is on the camera

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.320 
basically once that is on the camera
let's<00:03:08.020> just<00:03:08.230> switch<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.590> camera<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:10.150> can

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
let's just switch the camera on we can

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.820 
let's just switch the camera on we can
actually<00:03:10.360> use<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.050> remote<00:03:11.350> we've<00:03:11.680> got<00:03:11.800> a

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
actually use the remote we've got a

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.130 
actually use the remote we've got a
little<00:03:12.040> extendable<00:03:12.670> aerial<00:03:13.209> here<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.990> give

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
little extendable aerial here to give

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.890 
little extendable aerial here to give
you<00:03:14.260> that<00:03:14.440> better<00:03:15.070> range<00:03:15.459> we've<00:03:16.420> also<00:03:16.570> got

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900

that we can actually focus in on and

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.199 
that we can actually focus in on and
then<00:03:41.440> we've<00:03:41.590> got<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:42.160> remote<00:03:42.430> control<00:03:42.459> which

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209

then we've got the remote control which
as<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:43.510> can<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:44.590> actually<00:03:44.769> controlling

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
as you can see is actually controlling

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.520 
as you can see is actually controlling
the<00:03:45.519> camera<00:03:45.730> there's<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.600> very<00:03:46.780> simple<00:03:47.110> affair
