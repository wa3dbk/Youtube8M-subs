into the later rounds this is the nice
thing<00:02:23.870> about<00:02:23.900> being<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:24.500> room<00:02:24.739> is<00:02:24.950> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
thing about being in this room is you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.949 
thing about being in this room is you
can<00:02:25.430> activate<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.880> barrier<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.750> can

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
can activate the barrier and you can

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.949 
can activate the barrier and you can
save<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:28.310> ammo<00:02:28.700> maybe<00:02:29.389> we<00:02:29.480> don't<00:02:29.569> need<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> do

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
save your ammo maybe we don't need to do

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.870 
save your ammo maybe we don't need to do
it<00:02:30.139> during<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.799> one<00:02:31.010> hour<00:02:31.130> challenge<00:02:31.430> series

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
it during this one hour challenge series

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.240 
it during this one hour challenge series
but<00:02:32.060> once<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.329> get<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.569> you<00:02:32.870> know<00:02:33.319> 30<00:02:33.829> plus

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
but once you get up you know 30 plus

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.740 
but once you get up you know 30 plus
level<00:02:35.000> 30<00:02:35.239> plus<00:02:36.760> then<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:38.060> mole<00:02:38.329> conservation

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
level 30 plus then a mole conservation

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.200 
level 30 plus then a mole conservation
is<00:02:39.440> critical

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.950 

okay<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.140> barriers<00:02:45.560> down<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.070> then<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:47.870> know

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
okay so barriers down and then you know

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.360 
okay so barriers down and then you know
what<00:02:48.140> we'll<00:02:48.260> end<00:02:48.380> up<00:02:48.500> doing<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:48.920> switching<00:02:49.340> to

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
what we'll end up doing is switching to

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.150 
what we'll end up doing is switching to
RFD<00:02:49.760> because<00:02:50.210> we<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.510> upgraded<00:02:50.840> ammo<00:02:51.170> when

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
RFD because we have upgraded ammo when

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.100 
RFD because we have upgraded ammo when
the<00:02:52.250> barriers<00:02:52.610> down<00:02:52.640> we'll<00:02:53.300> be<00:02:53.420> switching<00:02:53.690> to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
the barriers down we'll be switching to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.800 
the barriers down we'll be switching to
our<00:02:54.590> FG<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:55.520> we<00:02:56.000> can<00:02:56.150> mow<00:02:56.270> him<00:02:56.390> down<00:02:56.420> pretty

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
our FG and we can mow him down pretty

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.870 
our FG and we can mow him down pretty
good<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.620> don't<00:02:57.710> know<00:02:57.890> maybe<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.640> thought

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
good and I don't know maybe I thought

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.640 
good and I don't know maybe I thought
the<00:02:59.030> barrier<00:02:59.360> was<00:02:59.600> available<00:03:00.020> again<00:03:00.410> there

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
the barrier was available again there

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.770 
the barrier was available again there
that's<00:03:01.400> kind<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.700> fail<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:05.420> it's<00:03:05.690> available

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
that's kind of a fail and it's available

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.110 
that's kind of a fail and it's available
now<00:03:06.110> but<00:03:06.530> we're<00:03:07.520> at<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> end<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.970> round

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
now but we're at the end of the round

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.580 
now but we're at the end of the round
and<00:03:08.420> that's<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.080> it<00:03:09.320> doesn't<00:03:09.530> really

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
and that's it so it doesn't really

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.340 
and that's it so it doesn't really
matter<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.850> it's<00:03:10.970> around<00:03:11.150> 15<00:03:11.540> it's<00:03:12.140> pretty

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
matter so it's around 15 it's pretty

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.680 
matter so it's around 15 it's pretty
quick<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.880> don't<00:03:14.030> really<00:03:14.150> need<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.480> hold

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
quick and you don't really need to hold

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.530 
quick and you don't really need to hold
zombies<00:03:15.230> from<00:03:15.890> here<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.250> in<00:03:16.430> at<00:03:17.120> any<00:03:17.360> of<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
zombies from here on in at any of the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.990 
zombies from here on in at any of the
windows<00:03:17.690> because<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:19.580> know<00:03:19.670> unless<00:03:19.850> you

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
windows because you know unless you

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.290 
windows because you know unless you
really<00:03:20.300> need<00:03:20.540> FG<00:03:21.020> ammo<00:03:21.980> but<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.850> know<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.060> can

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
really need FG ammo but you know you can

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.470 
really need FG ammo but you know you can
usually<00:03:23.480> run<00:03:24.140> around<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.740> grabbed<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.070> ammo

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
usually run around and grabbed the ammo

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.390 
usually run around and grabbed the ammo
in<00:03:26.480> between<00:03:26.660> rounds<00:03:26.870> without<00:03:27.320> having<00:03:27.800> to<00:03:27.950> hold

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
in between rounds without having to hold

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.700 
in between rounds without having to hold
the<00:03:28.580> zombie<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.720> we're<00:03:32.840> at<00:03:32.900> about<00:03:32.990> 30<00:03:33.350> minutes

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
the zombie so we're at about 30 minutes

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.950 
the zombie so we're at about 30 minutes
now<00:03:33.800> we're<00:03:34.130> just<00:03:34.280> getting<00:03:34.550> a<00:03:34.960> notification

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
now we're just getting a notification

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.450 
now we're just getting a notification
from<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.980> guys<00:03:37.310> keeping<00:03:37.700> track<00:03:38.140> for<00:03:39.140> us<00:03:39.460> so

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
from the guys keeping track for us so

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.300 
from the guys keeping track for us so
there's<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> barrier<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:42.650> got<00:03:42.770> low<00:03:42.890> ammo<00:03:43.190> so

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
there's the barrier we got low ammo so

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.940 
there's the barrier we got low ammo so
get<00:03:43.520> a<00:03:43.550> grip<00:03:43.640> some<00:03:44.060> more<00:03:44.500> Thompson<00:03:45.500> ammo<00:03:45.680> and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
get a grip some more Thompson ammo and

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.470 
get a grip some more Thompson ammo and
that's<00:03:46.460> really<00:03:46.730> when<00:03:46.970> you<00:03:47.090> want<00:03:47.240> to<00:03:47.330> get<00:03:47.390> your

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
that's really when you want to get your

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.250 
that's really when you want to get your
ammo<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:48.730> obviously<00:03:49.730> when<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.090> barrier<00:03:50.390> is<00:03:50.450> up

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.810 

Nikolai<00:03:57.260> is<00:03:57.320> in<00:03:57.710> deep<00:03:57.950> shit<00:03:59.500> nice<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.820> you

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
Nikolai is in deep shit nice and you

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.790 
Nikolai is in deep shit nice and you
know<00:04:01.940> i<00:04:02.210> mean<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.510> zombies<00:04:02.900> they<00:04:03.470> go<00:04:03.590> through

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
know i mean the zombies they go through

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.830 
know i mean the zombies they go through
the<00:04:03.890> barrier<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:05.150> takes<00:04:05.360> them<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.660> few

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
the barrier and it takes them a few

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.380 
the barrier and it takes them a few
seconds<00:04:06.260> before<00:04:06.410> they<00:04:06.740> die<00:04:06.920> so<00:04:07.400> it's<00:04:08.120> got<00:04:08.360> to

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
seconds before they die so it's got to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.820 
seconds before they die so it's got to
be<00:04:08.540> careful<00:04:08.690> that<00:04:09.050> you<00:04:09.170> don't<00:04:09.260> stand<00:04:09.590> up<00:04:09.770> too

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
be careful that you don't stand up too

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.479 
be careful that you don't stand up too
close<00:04:10.220> like<00:04:10.520> i<00:04:10.610> did<00:04:10.790> a<00:04:11.060> few<00:04:11.810> seconds<00:04:12.230> ago

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.979 

and<00:04:16.489> we<00:04:16.550> actually<00:04:16.700> haven't<00:04:16.970> figured<00:04:17.420> out<00:04:17.540> that

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
and we actually haven't figured out that

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.300 
and we actually haven't figured out that
we<00:04:18.170> have<00:04:18.350> there's<00:04:18.769> actually<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.160> better

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
we have there's actually a better

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.940 
we have there's actually a better
strategy<00:04:19.640> for<00:04:20.150> up<00:04:20.239> front<00:04:20.680> that's<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.830> little

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
strategy for up front that's a little

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.080 
strategy for up front that's a little
easier<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.670> we<00:04:22.700> end<00:04:23.240> up<00:04:23.360> doing<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.810> I<00:04:23.900> believe

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
easier and we end up doing it I believe

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.580 
easier and we end up doing it I believe
but<00:04:26.090> right<00:04:26.270> now<00:04:26.420> we're<00:04:26.690> still<00:04:26.960> sticking<00:04:27.290> on

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
but right now we're still sticking on

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.530 
but right now we're still sticking on
the<00:04:27.620> left<00:04:27.890> right<00:04:28.130> side<00:04:28.400> left<00:04:28.670> side<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.420> right

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
the left right side left side and right

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.090 
the left right side left side and right
side<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:32.660> looks<00:04:33.020> like<00:04:33.170> how<00:04:33.350> insta-kill<00:04:33.830> damn

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
side and looks like how insta-kill damn

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.370 
side and looks like how insta-kill damn
as<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.820> waste<00:04:36.640> didn't<00:04:37.640> have<00:04:37.790> to<00:04:38.140> put<00:04:39.140> up<00:04:39.260> the

wasted a few seconds there but otherwise
it's<00:06:25.370> been<00:06:25.490> pretty<00:06:25.700> tight<00:06:25.970> like<00:06:26.330> we<00:06:26.480> haven't<00:06:26.780> i

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100

we've<00:06:31.040> wasted<00:06:31.630> several<00:06:32.630> minutes<00:06:33.110> up<00:06:33.890> to<00:06:34.100> this

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
we've wasted several minutes up to this

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.719 
we've wasted several minutes up to this
point<00:06:34.340> i<00:06:34.730> don't<00:06:34.880> think<00:06:35.120> we<00:06:35.210> have

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.510 

I<00:06:37.819> think<00:06:38.419> there's<00:06:38.599> been<00:06:38.659> you<00:06:39.169> know<00:06:39.309> 10<00:06:40.309> 15

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
I think there's been you know 10 15

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.820 
I think there's been you know 10 15
seconds<00:06:41.240> here<00:06:41.449> there<00:06:41.689> may<00:06:41.930> be<00:06:41.960> you<00:06:42.439> know<00:06:42.529> three

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
seconds here there may be you know three

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.679 
seconds here there may be you know three
or<00:06:42.860> four<00:06:43.069> times<00:06:43.309> what<00:06:43.729> that's<00:06:43.909> cool<00:06:44.120> did<00:06:44.270> so

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 
or four times what that's cool did so

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.670 
or four times what that's cool did so
maybe<00:06:44.870> a<00:06:44.960> minute<00:06:45.349> that<00:06:46.219> we<00:06:46.339> could<00:06:46.550> have<00:06:47.680> we

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
maybe a minute that we could have we

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.989 
maybe a minute that we could have we
could<00:06:48.710> have<00:06:48.949> improved<00:06:49.339> upon<00:06:49.610> there<00:06:49.939> Oh<00:06:52.210> dougie

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:54.999 
could have improved upon there Oh dougie

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.760 
could have improved upon there Oh dougie
so<00:06:55.999> we<00:06:56.089> usually<00:06:56.539> fall<00:06:56.870> back<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.349> this<00:06:57.499> area

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
so we usually fall back to this area

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.500 
so we usually fall back to this area
when<00:06:58.159> their<00:06:58.279> dogs

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.170 

and<00:07:03.350> just<00:07:03.560> use<00:07:03.740> your<00:07:03.950> longest<00:07:04.730> of<00:07:04.940> the<00:07:04.970> matter

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
and just use your longest of the matter

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.610 
and just use your longest of the matter
because<00:07:05.420> you<00:07:05.540> get<00:07:05.660> ammo<00:07:05.840> at<00:07:06.080> the<00:07:06.200> end<00:07:06.320> of<00:07:06.380> every
