00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
you probably want to do because you're

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.730 
you probably want to do because you're
going<00:01:56.210> to<00:01:56.299> have<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.509> dig<00:01:56.719> deep<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.530> at<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.710> end

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
going to have to dig deep but at the end

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.370 
going to have to dig deep but at the end
of<00:01:57.950> each<00:01:58.069> day<00:01:58.240> of<00:01:59.240> sense<00:01:59.569> of<00:01:59.750> elation<00:01:59.990> to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
of each day of sense of elation to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.620 
of each day of sense of elation to
finish<00:02:00.679> each<00:02:00.860> stage<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:01.579> you<00:02:02.240> know<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.390> was

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
finish each stage so you know I was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.240 
finish each stage so you know I was
saying<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:02.990> want<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.259> do<00:02:03.380> it<00:02:03.469> again<00:02:03.530> before<00:02:03.920> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
saying I want to do it again before the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.889 
saying I want to do it again before the
end<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.520> the<00:02:04.610> race<00:02:04.759> last<00:02:05.060> year<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.569> that's<00:02:05.750> a

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
end of the race last year so that's a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:12.880 
end of the race last year so that's a
good<00:02:06.020> sign<00:02:10.150> well<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.450> route<00:02:11.599> is<00:02:11.739> starts<00:02:12.739> in

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
good sign well the route is starts in

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.650 
good sign well the route is starts in
Buena<00:02:13.099> Vista<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.730> ends<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.060> beavercreek

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
Buena Vista and ends in beavercreek

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.479 
Buena Vista and ends in beavercreek
along<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.200> way<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:15.380> got<00:02:15.739> some<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.430> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
along the way you got some of the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.160 
along the way you got some of the
highlights<00:02:16.670> are<00:02:17.000> hope<00:02:17.209> paths<00:02:17.510> which<00:02:17.900> goes

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
highlights are hope paths which goes

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.740 
highlights are hope paths which goes
from<00:02:18.200> victorville<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.579> twin<00:02:19.880> lakes<00:02:20.120> which<00:02:20.510> is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
from victorville to twin lakes which is

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.500 
from victorville to twin lakes which is
over<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> 13,000<00:02:22.190> foot<00:02:22.310> paths<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:23.239> probably

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
over a 13,000 foot paths it's probably

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.390 
over a 13,000 foot paths it's probably
the<00:02:23.780> one<00:02:24.019> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> steepest<00:02:24.440> days<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.220> race

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
the one of the steepest days of the race

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.660 
the one of the steepest days of the race
and<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:26.209> there's<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.900> shorter<00:02:26.930> stage<00:02:27.670> from

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
and then there's a shorter stage from

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.089 
and then there's a shorter stage from
camp<00:02:29.030> hale<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.750> red<00:02:30.349> cliff<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.950> that's

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
camp hale to red cliff and that's

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.039 
camp hale to red cliff and that's
running<00:02:31.430> involves<00:02:32.180> running<00:02:32.329> up<00:02:32.599> some<00:02:32.810> really

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
running involves running up some really

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.050 
running involves running up some really
steep<00:02:33.379> terrain<00:02:33.799> and<00:02:34.069> through<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> bunch<00:02:34.849> of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
steep terrain and through a bunch of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.440 
steep terrain and through a bunch of
rivers<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.140> those<00:02:36.860> are<00:02:37.040> two<00:02:37.069> two<00:02:38.060> pretty

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
rivers so those are two two pretty

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.380 
rivers so those are two two pretty
incredible<00:02:39.230> stages<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:40.400> probably<00:02:40.849> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
incredible stages and then probably the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.809 
incredible stages and then probably the
last<00:02:41.599> stage<00:02:41.959> from<00:02:42.349> Vail<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:43.099> Beaver<00:02:43.370> Creek<00:02:43.610> is

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
last stage from Vail to Beaver Creek is

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.640 
last stage from Vail to Beaver Creek is
really<00:02:44.180> scenic<00:02:44.480> running<00:02:44.900> through<00:02:45.140> beautiful
