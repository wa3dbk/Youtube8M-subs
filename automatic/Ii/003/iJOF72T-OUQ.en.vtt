00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:51.769 
is a home this is their habitat and then

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:53.459 
is a home this is their habitat and then
go<00:00:51.890> pollinate<00:00:52.309> everything<00:00:52.730> in<00:00:52.850> this<00:00:53.000> area

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469

what<00:00:54.469> you<00:00:54.590> want<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.890> do<00:00:55.040> is<00:00:55.250> make<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.520> so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
what you want to do is make it so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.010 
what you want to do is make it so
they're<00:00:55.940> convenient<00:00:56.510> so<00:00:56.600> they<00:00:56.690> don't<00:00:56.840> have<00:00:56.930> to

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
they're convenient so they don't have to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.410 
they're convenient so they don't have to
go<00:00:57.110> very<00:00:57.290> far<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:57.770> they<00:00:57.890> will<00:00:58.070> stay<00:00:58.340> here<00:00:58.640> we're

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
go very far so they will stay here we're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.000 
go very far so they will stay here we're
gonna<00:00:59.539> put<00:00:59.660> clover<00:01:00.079> in<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.320> middle<00:01:00.620> out<00:01:00.770> there

gonna put clover in the middle out there

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.889 
gonna put clover in the middle out there
so<00:01:01.219> they'll<00:01:01.370> pollinate<00:01:01.610> that<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.329> use<00:01:02.660> that

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
so they'll pollinate that and use that

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.150 
so they'll pollinate that and use that
and<00:01:03.320> they'll<00:01:03.469> be<00:01:03.590> right<00:01:03.739> there<00:01:03.890> in<00:01:03.950> front<00:01:04.070> of

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
and they'll be right there in front of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.260 
and they'll be right there in front of
the<00:01:04.280> hive<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:04.460> they<00:01:04.699> don't<00:01:04.850> have<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.000> go<00:01:05.119> very

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
the hive so they don't have to go very

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.570 
the hive so they don't have to go very
far<00:01:05.509> if<00:01:06.140> they<00:01:06.380> are<00:01:06.560> not<00:01:06.710> overworked<00:01:07.220> they'll
