00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.310
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.180
 abc rural 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:13.370
 when we talk about milk quality 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:16.910
 many times we think that it is only 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.390
 in the processing plants not the point 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.480
 fundamental is the hygiene with which 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.580
 get the milk from the cows and how it 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.859
 get so that the quality is 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.230
 excellent something very interesting that the 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.840
 sixth roller doctor do not talk about the 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.010
 importance of the control of the chain of 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.010
 milk in the fields 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.980
 the controls that must be carried out 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.609
 inside the chaff as our problem 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.739
 principal is let's say some cows 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.659
 many times they are unproductive of 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.629
 point of view of the production of the 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:59.059
 milk for example mastitis picture 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.809
 then our main control is seen 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.239
 let's say focus on producing a milk 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.520
 as I had said is to certify that is 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.860
 a healthy milk then like us 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.960
 how to produce a healthy milk justly 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.539
 taking care of the health aspect that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.090
 we had said and taking care of the aspect of 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.380
 managing the order as the producer can 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.390
 identify if your animal has mastitis 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.520
 preserve the milk factory that is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.929
 the udder then we can 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.130
 We can do strict control 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.530
 respecting the steps of the routine 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.979
 milk can we have, let's say 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.069
 success in the operation of the tambo and 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.439
 do let's say a routine control of 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.629
 possible mastitis pictures how 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.620
 can do simply can be done 

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:49.010
 with 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.680
 let's say a the test the first jet was 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.920
 flame is now the dark background that is to say 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.650
 one that the cow is praised the work is 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.370
 can for example do make the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.650
 first jets 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.600
 and see if there are no lumps inside a 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.300
 bottle with black surface of this 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.900
 way to see if they exist or do not exist 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.520
 some groups that can say 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.480
 direct not to a possible entity 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.480
 mastitis which is subclinical mastitis and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.060
 how clinical mastitis is identified 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.340
 it is a mastitis that due to the symptoms 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.720
 it looks like it's a mastitis 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.760
 Asymptomatic but can be detected 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.940
 with a simple test that is called 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.870
 california mastitis test is the third 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.490
 california then we have mixed 2 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.900
 ml of milk with 2 ml of active value and 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.230
 already at the foot of the cow can be detected 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.760
 let's say the possible problems of the 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.090
 about the cows 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.739
 it's a simple job you can not perform 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.439
 the tambero can do it 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.030
 computer is trained there is no 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.819
 kind of drama and you can go recording 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.610
 the forms because it is important to have 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.640
 a record of mastitis in cows that 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.760
 they suffered the problem and those that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.890
 they have evil because just the tip 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.530
 of the iceberg the tip of the air is 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.560
 just what you do to us 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.220
 we see in a clinical mastitis without 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.950
 But the biggest problem is what 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.780
 called mastitis his clinic is saying 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.409
 if we have a clinical mastitis 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.560
 we probably have many cases of 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.260
 subclinical mastitis from the important thing 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.730
 detect in time that to give you say 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.870
 the proper treatment and do the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.609
 necessary therapeutic corrections 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.739
 finally the technician invited those 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.109
 producers interested in making their 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.510
 consultations on the management and care of 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.940
 dairy cattle to reach the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.790
 dairy department faculty 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.269
 of veterinary sciences in san lorenzo 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.240
 from her we here in the tambo in the 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.770
 cattle division 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.150
 or came here the department of 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.510
 animal production of the faculty of 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.120
 veterinary sciences 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.390
 We are open to the entire population to 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.400
 all interested to all 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.470
 dairy farmers to all producers who 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.000
 may they want to come and consult 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.980
 let's say gladly we will receive it 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.390
 we are going to direct and indicate all the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.350
 questions that can be evacuated from 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.350
 our vision this department
