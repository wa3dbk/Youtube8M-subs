00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.140
 the two braids of today come out super 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.390
 different and fun 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.460
 you can add them to any hairstyle 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.270
 that you like or use them alone as I do 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.270
 me in this video 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.320
 for the first braid untangle the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.130
 hair that you want to braid and divide it 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.130
 in three parts 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 with these sections you are going to make a 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.390
 regular braid 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.600
 when you run out of hair 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 braid you will hold the section of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.740
 hair that was in the middle and you're going to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.440
 pull up the other two 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.860
 sections always holding the section 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.860
 half 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.600
 ah 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.200
 if the more or less always 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200
 you can adjust it again 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.710
 when you like it as you see it joins all the 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.840
 sections with a league and to finish 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.170
 subject to everything with hooks where else you 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.170
 like 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.850
 i 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.350
 why 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.150
 the second braid is a little more 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.010
 complex this time we are going to divide the 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.010
 hair that you want to braid in four 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.840
 equal parts and in this braid always 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.560
 we will work with the sections of 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.560
 the corners 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.799
 The first thing you are going to do is take the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.840
 section of one of the two corners and 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.060
 you will go over the section 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.019
 which is next to and below the 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.019
 section that follows 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.540
 now you're going to take the section from the other 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.480
 corner and this time you're going to do it 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.519
 you will first pass it underneath 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.220
 section next to it and 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.080
 above which this process follows 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.900
 you'll repeat until you run out 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.010
 hair to braid you pass the section 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.010
 above and below 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.950
 and then the other section below and by 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.950
 above 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.120
 Always remember to work in two stages 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.120
 above and below 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.269
 ah 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.150
 below and above 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.650
 so it sounds silly helps a lot that what 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.190
 say we have high while you go 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.190
 doing 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.740
 Y 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.430
 Y 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.190
 ah 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.460
 i 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:33.290
 ah 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.290
 ah 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.380
 Y 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.540
 when you finish braiding you go to 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.420
 hold the third lock of left to 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.000
 right and with the other hand you're going to talk 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.160
 the other sections up 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.990
 if you look at the section that you hold 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.410
 it always goes through the middle of the 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.410
 braid 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.719
 ah 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.960
 ah 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.950
 when you like how it looks, it unites everything with 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.460
 a league and fix it with hooks where 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.460
 you prefer 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.210
 sometimes 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.470
 i 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.260
 the 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.830
 and that was all for this week if you 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.600
 encourage to do either of these two 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.820
 braids do not forget to use them 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.440
