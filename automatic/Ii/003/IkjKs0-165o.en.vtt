00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.560 
turning on for a while now and I checked
the<00:00:15.740> voltage<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.980> battery<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.699> we<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.539> a

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the voltage on the battery and we get a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.420 
the voltage on the battery and we get a
twelve<00:00:18.990> point<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.529> reading<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> kind

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
twelve point for reading which is kind

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.800 
twelve point for reading which is kind
of<00:00:20.460> low<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:20.670> it's<00:00:21.029> still<00:00:21.270> okay

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810

of low but it's still okay
I<00:00:22.550> checked<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> reading<00:00:24.230> from<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> battery

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I checked the reading from the battery

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
I checked the reading from the battery
to<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> engine<00:00:26.910> okay

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to the engine okay

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.509 
to the engine okay
battery<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> alternators<00:00:28.650> okay<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.369> can

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
battery to alternators okay and you can

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.730 
battery to alternators okay and you can
tell<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> brand<00:00:30.000> new<00:00:30.090> battery<00:00:30.650> brand<00:00:31.650> new

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
tell a brand new battery brand new

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.530 
tell a brand new battery brand new
alternator<00:00:32.160> everything<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.149> fine<00:00:35.300> but<00:00:36.300> the

instance I'm gonna push the brake and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
instance I'm gonna push the brake and
it's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> turn<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.479> light<00:01:15.689> off<00:01:15.920> but<00:01:16.920> I

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
it's going to turn that light off but I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:33.820 
it's going to turn that light off but I
didn't<00:01:17.159> hear<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> clicking<00:01:17.549> sound

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.320 

and<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.160> clicking<00:01:35.490> sound<00:01:35.730> won't<00:01:35.850> go<00:01:36.030> away<00:01:36.210> as

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
and the clicking sound won't go away as

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.170 
and the clicking sound won't go away as
I<00:01:36.570> only<00:01:36.750> leave<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.470> light<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:38.120> so<00:01:39.120> I'm

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
I only leave one light on so I'm

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
I only leave one light on so I'm
guessing<00:01:39.600> there's<00:01:40.050> not<00:01:40.200> enough<00:01:40.410> juice<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
guessing there's not enough juice to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
guessing there's not enough juice to
power<00:01:41.190> both<00:01:41.580> lights<00:01:41.910> but<00:01:42.300> there<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.540> enough<00:01:42.900> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
power both lights but there is enough to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
power both lights but there is enough to
power<00:01:43.290> one<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.320> kind<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.680> stuck<00:01:47.400> here<00:01:47.580> guys
