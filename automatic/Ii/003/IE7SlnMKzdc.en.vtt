00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.639
 there all added the camp of a 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.639
 match expected to be fought 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.110
 we dreamed was going to have then the 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.150
 to the desire to be in the first 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.800
 moment so they played a juan 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.610
 Aurich who was looking to get out of the middle 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.110
 table ratify the level that the 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.760
 equipment investment and 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.739
 transcendence that has this Juan Aurich 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.860
 and university sport that quality of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.080
 visit and has achieved excellent 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.200
 results that came from a doubt that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.150
 he came to draw precisely at home and 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.320
 that now ratifying that great moment 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.270
 as a visitor, he found 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.850
 the formula as in this case for 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.220
 by a tomasevish put one to zero 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.480
 up and force a juan aurich that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.760
 until that moment it did not appear in juan 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.350
 carlos well I want to summarize in a 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.390
 word what I have been talking about 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.229
 university student a little while back 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.149
 a time ago that efficiency when in 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.620
 this meeting seemed like things 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.190
 they finished 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.080
 tied like that is it has a play 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.810
 very good individual of the team 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.910
 university a passivity a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 tremendous tremendous passivity of the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.210
 audis defense that is really of 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.370
 bad and effectiveness is charged effectiveness 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.710
 is there and that is what is happening 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.720
 with university student who maybe if not 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.610
 I would have lost so many points in 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.110
 local condition at this time the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 daily sun adaptive would be like this the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.310
 trigger 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.079
 now there is a question with those of the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.549
 effectively count them to define the 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.409
 matches like now that the taken out to 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.630
 one college sports but has 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.219
 that also have efficiency behind me 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.840
 I think today Galiquio gave him the 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.020
 solvency gave him the solidity he gave the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.200
 tranquility and was accompanied very 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.780
 well accompanied I would say yo for by yulia 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.649
 so he did a very good job a 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.840
 very good work 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.729
 after that I think the changes 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.250
 they gave him a result that I imagine 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.840
 I was waiting for the technician with my or in a 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.450
 moment we said that the tie was 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.910
 signed until a play occurs 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.200
 of against in which university 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.760
 find the answer is through the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.140
 association here he but bailÃ³n 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.269
 guastavino and the quality to define 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.799
 how I had to define in those 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.450
 conditions not waiting for movement 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.910
 of the goalkeeper and placing the one below 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.200
 of which we have seen some parties 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.700
 we have not seen some games of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.220
 university or defining in this way 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.500
 what do you think of enabling new 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.110
 commission or wedding because many many 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.930
 variants many variants and look mira 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.640
 if it comes with a rudder with a key triumph 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.129
 when one puts on the commission of the umh 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.469
 here there is no continuity what is important 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:54.409
 is that everyone comes out with the same 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.060
 mentality of looking for matches good 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.950
 it's a really comforting trick for 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.209
 university of a consideration that 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.040
 this weekend will face his 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.889
 classic rival alliance lima now all the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.859
 result does not change men the system 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.959
 it's still the same and the way how 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:10.519
 tactically execute what the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.370
 university technical command sport a 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.650
 through permission is equal this 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.510
 man that this one and they arrive in optimal 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.799
 conditions face the classic rival 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.879
 this weekend let's review the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.980
 Match statistics has won 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.810
 university for two seconds to Juan 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.810
