and<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.970> know<00:04:19.120> people<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.109> epic<00:04:20.440> maybe<00:04:20.620> they

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
and you know people in epic maybe they

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.630 
and you know people in epic maybe they
shouldn't<00:04:21.250> really<00:04:21.430> just<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.930> know<00:04:23.340> seen<00:04:24.340> that

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
shouldn't really just you know seen that

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.180 
shouldn't really just you know seen that
you<00:04:24.940> know

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
you know

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.330 
you know
instead<00:04:25.850> of<00:04:25.880> making<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.300> easier<00:04:26.750> for<00:04:26.960> people

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.040 
instead of making it easier for people
that's<00:04:28.340> why<00:04:28.490> they<00:04:28.610> had<00:04:28.790> game<00:04:29.030> types<00:04:29.360> like<00:04:29.630> you

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050

that's why they had game types like you
know<00:04:30.200> annex<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:30.980> stuff<00:04:31.190> like<00:04:31.370> that<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.640> you
