00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.619
 good afternoon dear viewers of this video 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.810
 I want to give you an experiment in 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.679
 which will show the advantage 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.179
 cells 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:27.669
 over high board this is done with that 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.980
 the goal is that some car owners 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.059
 believe that the rubber chord should 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.350
 have a board and the higher the better it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:44.800
 absolutely delusion and so take a glass 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:49.600
 water pour for example half 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.590
 cup and pour inside 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.520
 carpet 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.830
 we see 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.660
 water survivor she stayed anywhere 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.940
 because have no restrictions 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 absolutely at the demonstration 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.390
 experimental dynamics if 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 car left and right tilt forward 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.650
 back we see that she is absolutely running 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.420
 anywhere and barely held 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.820
 board height yes indeed when 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:25.320
 no cell board plays a role 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 but starting to get this carpet out 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.280
 car interior we inevitably come 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.460
 to the fact that the word breaks on the sides 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 set out 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.530
 and the water is also going to them and strives 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 pour out and need to show remarkable 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.800
 ability to get it out of the cabin 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.800
 Are not you too 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.730
 taking the height of the board 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.910
 average value which is quite enough in 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:05.360
 this situation take the same glass 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.360
 water we pour half yes somewhere else 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.369
 were there 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.420
 and what we see is that it immediately stands 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.820
 not even getting to the side 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.970
 demonstrated driving dynamics we see 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:23.420
 that she is completely all gathered even 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.270
 enduring more bias and you see what 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.330
 this water is rather than 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.600
 withstanding even more biases ahead 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.240
 back it stands completely blocked 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.060
 in this way 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.400
 we can somehow easier get it out 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.760
 salon 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.680
 distribute you evenly again 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.200
 manhattan does not break as us 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.470
 trophic as if leading food and therefore 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.080
 that the port is not high and has 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.370
 additional protective grip 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.989
 change steps such tricks 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.379
 here are some models being developed 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.379
 special bill spherical had time
