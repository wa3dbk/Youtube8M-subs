00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.210 
you can hear me a well or alright so i
created<00:00:16.859> instant<00:00:17.460> wire<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:18.859> sponges<00:00:19.859> I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
created instant wire with sponges I

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310 
created instant wire with sponges I
don't<00:00:20.699> know<00:00:20.789> if<00:00:20.850> there's<00:00:21.029> any<00:00:21.270> major<00:00:21.720> use<00:00:22.050> with

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
don't know if there's any major use with

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.099 
don't know if there's any major use with
this<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.369> still<00:00:24.090> pretty<00:00:24.150> cool<00:00:24.539> it's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
this but it's still pretty cool it's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.170 
this but it's still pretty cool it's
only<00:00:25.320> truly<00:00:25.619> instant<00:00:26.160> though<00:00:26.310> instant<00:00:27.029> though

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
only truly instant though instant though

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.929 
only truly instant though instant though
when<00:00:27.539> inverted<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.800> as<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.699> if<00:00:29.820> i

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
when inverted so as you can see if i

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.810 
when inverted so as you can see if i
push<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.359> button<00:00:30.529> those<00:00:31.529> pistons<00:00:32.099> should<00:00:32.399> go

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
push this button those pistons should go

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.810 
push this button those pistons should go
out<00:00:33.030> instantly<00:00:33.840> at<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> same<00:00:34.469> time<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.100> can

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
out instantly at the same time and can

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
out instantly at the same time and can
actually<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:39.690> yeah<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.020> only<00:00:40.140> truly

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
actually but yeah it's only truly

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.389 
actually but yeah it's only truly
instant<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.960> signal<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.680> inverted<00:00:44.280> at

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
instant when the signal is inverted at

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.910 
instant when the signal is inverted at
the<00:00:44.550> end<00:00:45.350> but<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.100> wasn't<00:00:47.309> inverted<00:00:47.879> then

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
the end but if it wasn't inverted then

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.720 
the end but if it wasn't inverted then
it<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.969> tick<00:00:51.239> delay<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.989> um

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
it there would be one tick delay so um

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.220 
it there would be one tick delay so um
it<00:00:53.730> should<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.360> off<00:00:54.480> instantly<00:00:54.960> every

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it should be going off instantly every

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.869 
it should be going off instantly every
time<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> push<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> button<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
time I push the button this one will go

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.709 
time I push the button this one will go
up<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.480> should<00:00:57.719> come<00:00:58.559> down<00:00:58.590> instantly

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
up and this should come down instantly

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.819 
up and this should come down instantly
well<00:01:00.719> let's<00:01:00.899> get<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.260> actually<00:01:01.590> how<00:01:01.649> this

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
well let's get on to actually how this

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.060 
well let's get on to actually how this
works<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.820> when<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> push<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.719> button<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.379> will

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
works so when I push this button it will

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
works so when I push this button it will
move<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.270> um<00:01:06.600> piston<00:01:07.560> back<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.979> a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
move this um piston back I have a

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.580 
move this um piston back I have a
redstone<00:01:08.369> torch<00:01:08.640> or<00:01:09.420> guess<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.560> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
redstone torch or guess I don't have a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.609 
redstone torch or guess I don't have a
redstone<00:01:10.950> torch<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.580> actually<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:12.619> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
redstone torch I actually have a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
redstone torch I actually have a
redstone<00:01:14.520> torch<00:01:14.610> under<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.360> one<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.720> here

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
redstone torch under this one right here

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.980 
redstone torch under this one right here
as<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.280> once<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.420> retracts

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
as you can see so once this retracts

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.219 
as you can see so once this retracts
back<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.970> will<00:01:21.150> also<00:01:21.299> cause<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.869> one<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
back in it will also cause this one to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
back in it will also cause this one to
retract<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:23.520> into<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.330> right<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
retract back into and right when the

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
retract back into and right when the
sponges<00:01:25.560> moves<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.930> will<00:01:28.259> update<00:01:28.799> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
sponges moves that it will update in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.050 
sponges moves that it will update in
five<00:01:30.509> by<00:01:30.720> five<00:01:30.930> area<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.460> sponges<00:01:32.880> will

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
five by five area because sponges will

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.020 
five by five area because sponges will
update<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.570> five<00:01:33.960> by<00:01:34.140> five<00:01:34.350> by<00:01:34.860> five<00:01:35.100> area<00:01:35.610> when

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
update a five by five by five area when

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
update a five by five by five area when
changed<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.780> moved<00:01:37.880> or<00:01:38.880> removed<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.990> from<00:01:40.650> here

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
changed or moved or removed so from here

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
changed or moved or removed so from here
it<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.070> update<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.759> bud<00:01:42.030> switch<00:01:42.180> detector

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it will update this bud switch detector

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.179 
it will update this bud switch detector
and<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.079> this<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.500> gets<00:01:43.680> moved<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> will

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
and when this one gets moved it will

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.889 
and when this one gets moved it will
update<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.549> bud<00:01:47.549> switch

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
update this and this and this bud switch

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.499 
update this and this and this bud switch
because<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> change<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> wire<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
because also if you change the wire it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
because also if you change the wire it
will<00:01:51.689> also<00:01:51.869> update<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.680> block<00:01:53.130> around<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:54.180> in

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
will also update the block around it in

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.569 
will also update the block around it in
t<00:01:54.570> formation<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.950> don't<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.250> if<00:01:56.369> there's<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
t formation so I don't know if there's a

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.450 
t formation so I don't know if there's a
major<00:01:56.759> use<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:58.799> might<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.280> able<00:01:59.340> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
major use with this you might be able to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.010 
major use with this you might be able to
make<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.820> type<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.149> decoder<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.689> don't<00:02:00.930> know

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
make some type of a decoder I don't know

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.719 
make some type of a decoder I don't know
because<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.399> anything

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
because I don't know if this is anything

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.279 
because I don't know if this is anything
major<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.689> from<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:05.630> two<00:02:07.700> three

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
major but I can go from one two three

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.280 
major but I can go from one two three
four<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.310> select<00:02:11.520> how<00:02:11.849> many<00:02:12.290> bud

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
four so I can select how many bud

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.970 
four so I can select how many bud
switches

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
switches

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.690 
switches
or<00:02:14.099> how<00:02:14.909> many<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.870> these<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.739> go<00:02:16.890> off<00:02:17.099> so

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
or how many of these I want to go off so

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
or how many of these I want to go off so
I<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:18.180> go<00:02:18.330> from<00:02:18.629> one<00:02:19.409> to<00:02:19.650> four<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.549> four<00:02:21.209> to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
I can go from one to four and four to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.210 
I can go from one to four and four to
three<00:02:23.120> two<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.959> down<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.409> one<00:02:25.709> here

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
three two and then back down to one here

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.880 
three two and then back down to one here
and<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.659> said<00:02:27.720> if<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.049> didn't<00:02:28.319> don't<00:02:28.709> want

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and like I said if you didn't don't want

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.070 
and like I said if you didn't don't want
this<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.849> output<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.450> inverted<00:02:30.989> you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
this that output to be inverted you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.050 
this that output to be inverted you
would<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.470> add<00:02:31.650> red<00:02:32.340> stone<00:02:32.610> under<00:02:32.910> this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
would have to add red stone under this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.780 
would have to add red stone under this
and<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.420> redstone<00:02:34.019> torch<00:02:34.230> like<00:02:35.129> that<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.640> have

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and a redstone torch like that then have

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610 
and a redstone torch like that then have
the<00:02:36.030> signal<00:02:36.390> go<00:02:36.510> out<00:02:36.780> through<00:02:37.019> this<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.470> when

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the signal go out through this so when

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.089 
the signal go out through this so when
this<00:02:38.190> piston<00:02:38.670> contracts<00:02:39.120> back<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.950> will

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
this piston contracts back in it will

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.640 
this piston contracts back in it will
allow<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> redstone<00:02:41.940> signal<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.959> kind<00:02:43.500> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
allow the redstone signal to kind of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.030 
allow the redstone signal to kind of
flow<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.310> what<00:02:45.060> did<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.269> add<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.659> did<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.680> so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
flow so what did I add I did that so

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.869 
flow so what did I add I did that so
then<00:02:47.579> there'd<00:02:47.910> be<00:02:48.030> one<00:02:48.299> tick<00:02:48.569> delay<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:50.760> you

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
then there'd be one tick delay as you

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.110 
then there'd be one tick delay as you
can<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.180> right<00:02:51.209> there<00:02:52.370> but<00:02:53.370> that's<00:02:53.940> basically

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
can see right there but that's basically

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.300 
can see right there but that's basically
it<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.720> just<00:02:55.079> created<00:02:55.319> instant<00:02:55.859> wire<00:02:56.040> using

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
it I just created instant wire using

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.449 
it I just created instant wire using
some<00:02:56.640> sponges<00:02:57.739> do<00:02:58.739> something<00:02:59.069> with<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.310> I

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
some sponges do something with this I

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.400 
some sponges do something with this I
don't<00:02:59.609> really<00:02:59.730> care<00:03:00.000> thanks<00:03:00.750> for<00:03:00.870> watching<00:03:00.900> be
