what<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.310> hell's<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> point<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:46.280> so

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
what the hell's the point of that and so

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.460 
what the hell's the point of that and so
just<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.939> guy<00:01:48.090> plank<00:01:48.420> maker<00:01:48.630> which<00:01:49.290> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
just go to this guy plank maker which is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.139 
just go to this guy plank maker which is
right<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.920> here<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:50.729> low<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:50.880> like

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
right out here that I really low so like

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.910 
right out here that I really low so like
I<00:01:51.240> said<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.540> guys<00:01:51.659> could<00:01:52.290> also<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.710> star

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
I said you guys could also use a star

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
I said you guys could also use a star
really<00:01:53.070> low<00:01:53.159> stone<00:01:53.340> chip<00:01:53.579> out<00:01:53.960> but<00:01:54.960> i'm<00:01:55.079> using

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
really low stone chip out but i'm using

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
really low stone chip out but i'm using
the<00:01:55.350> house<00:01:55.470> teleports<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.579> then<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.090> by

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the house teleports and then just by

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.429 
the house teleports and then just by
Planck's<00:01:57.689> by<00:01:58.500> these<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.040> then<00:01:59.159> again<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.869> use

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
Planck's by these and then again go use

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.789 
Planck's by these and then again go use
your<00:02:01.469> what's<00:02:02.340> called<00:02:02.579> your<00:02:02.759> number<00:02:02.909> two<00:02:03.210> key

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
your what's called your number two key

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.200 
your what's called your number two key
click<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> twice<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> guys<00:02:06.090> could

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
click it twice so you guys could

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.760 
click it twice so you guys could
teleport<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.750> castle<00:02:07.200> wars<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.500> away<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
teleport to castle wars right away so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
teleport to castle wars right away so
make<00:02:08.429> sure<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> have<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.000> helps<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
make sure to have it there it helps a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.630 
make sure to have it there it helps a
lot<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.509> then<00:02:09.780> again<00:02:10.020> press<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.770> bank<00:02:11.430> piece

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
lot and then again press the bank piece

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.820 
lot and then again press the bank piece
of<00:02:11.790> wine

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
of wine

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.160 
of wine
press<00:02:13.550> the<00:02:13.670> wine<00:02:13.850> and<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:14.060> again<00:02:14.390> click<00:02:15.020> on

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
press the wine and then again click on

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.550 
press the wine and then again click on
one<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:17.450> we'll<00:02:17.570> take<00:02:17.600> you<00:02:17.870> into<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.170> guy

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
one and then we'll take you into the guy

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.510 
one and then we'll take you into the guy
and<00:02:18.890> then<00:02:19.550> by<00:02:20.270> Planck's<00:02:20.890> make<00:02:21.890> planks<00:02:22.310> or

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
and then by Planck's make planks or

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.430 
and then by Planck's make planks or
whatever<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.210> then<00:02:23.330> just<00:02:23.540> click<00:02:23.750> the<00:02:24.230> keep

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
whatever and then just click the keep

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.780 
whatever and then just click the keep
the<00:02:24.500> two<00:02:24.950> twice<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.690> yeah<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.950> that's<00:02:28.640> pretty

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
the two twice and yeah so that's pretty

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.980 
the two twice and yeah so that's pretty
much<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:29.240> money<00:02:29.540> we<00:02:29.630> can<00:02:29.720> guide<00:02:29.840> you

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
much it for this money we can guide you

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.840 
much it for this money we can guide you
guys<00:02:30.110> could<00:02:30.290> easily<00:02:30.680> make<00:02:30.830> around<00:02:31.250> 1000<00:02:33.850> 1802

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
guys could easily make around 1000 1802

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.560 
guys could easily make around 1000 1802
to<00:02:35.000> two<00:02:35.300> mil<00:02:35.860> what<00:02:36.860> am<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.010> saying<00:02:37.160> 1.7<00:02:38.120> mil<00:02:38.270> to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
to two mil what am I saying 1.7 mil to

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.930 
to two mil what am I saying 1.7 mil to
two<00:02:38.960> mil<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.350> now<00:02:39.470> we're<00:02:39.650> easily<00:02:40.400> guys<00:02:40.640> if<00:02:40.850> you

two mil and now we're easily guys if you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.280 
two mil and now we're easily guys if you
guys<00:02:40.970> are<00:02:41.180> faster<00:02:41.540> cuz<00:02:41.660> probably<00:02:42.020> could<00:02:42.170> even

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
guys are faster cuz probably could even

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.460 
guys are faster cuz probably could even
make<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.500> line<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:43.430> point<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.880> 2.1<00:02:44.540> mill<00:02:44.720> if<00:02:45.380> you

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
make a line to point to 2.1 mill if you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.110 
make a line to point to 2.1 mill if you
guys<00:02:45.560> are<00:02:45.710> fast<00:02:45.920> enough<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:46.970> pretty

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
guys are fast enough so this is pretty

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.460 
guys are fast enough so this is pretty
much<00:02:47.210> it<00:02:47.330> guys<00:02:47.450> hopefully<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.020> guys<00:02:48.110> enjoyed
