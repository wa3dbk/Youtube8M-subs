00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 from the way we draw the stain will 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.450
 whether the viewer will know that object 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.360
 which we tried to draw each 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.049
 the object can be represented as a set 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.700
 the main elements of which it consists 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.180
 items or parts here in this 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.039
 case for example we have a little man and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.550
 we know that little man has his 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:28.529
 salient features is the head 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.840
 torso arms and legs here's a bird not from 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.100
 trunk head-tail 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.850
 and paws here that we have a spot or 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.250
 our object which consists formed 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 from here these details or elements it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 hands torso head and legs in order 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 make our stain look like that 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.770
 the object that we portray for this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.010
 need to be located 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.109
 relative sizes and directions here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 these parts or elements or parts 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 corresponded to the object that we 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.110
 portray for example if I am now 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.770
 I swap these parts here that is 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.619
 will break 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 their relative positions then I'll get not 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.820
 man and do not understand that for example here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:26.180
 here I'll draw the torso right here 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.180
 people's head let's say an arm or a leg 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:38.380
 there is one more arm or leg 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 one leg or arm and here's another one 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.549
 the hand is purple here in this picture i 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.100
 just changed the elements here these 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.310
 details there arms and legs head torso 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.170
 in places that is, changed them 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.149
 interposition and now we already have 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.100
 this stain has ceased to be recognized as 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.810
 man that is it turned out some 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.710
 aliens there or something like that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.720
 strange if i break the part sizes 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.490
 Relative to each other, I can already 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.490
 get no human monkey 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.500
 Here in this picture it turns out that I 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.660
 only 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.760
 lengthened arms and torso in relation to 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.350
 legs i made short legs and i have 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.080
 Immediately get some kind of image 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.380
 monkeys are probably not human but that's what 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.910
 will be if we just change 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:44.700
 parts direction relative to each other 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:46.470
 friend if we draw like this then we 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.400
 most likely find out this is some kind of tree 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.620
 or a branch rather a tree probably yes if 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.620
 we take done so 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.440
 then it will be something strange already 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.510
 something less like a tree this one 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.020
 the drawing is different from this drawing by 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.010
 Essentially, only here 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.260
 detail direction changed 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.810
 here are the tags 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.610
 they are perceived as branches these details 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.320
 and now upward relative 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.540
 this is how the trunk 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.780
 but here these parts are aimed 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.150
 down relative to this detail here 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.490
 this is so extreme very sketchy 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.380
 example is really here in life when 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.600
 we draw some complex objects 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.760
 something small change even small 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.100
 changing directions she already entails 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.020
 our own and significant consequences 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.920
 the subject may no longer be recognized 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.920
 on the picture 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.230
 here is another example of changing parts 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.470
 relatively each other and relatively 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.870
 In general, the whole is now with us 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.970
 perceived image for example here 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.590
 this bird can be interpreted well there as 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.209
 some kind of hunger bird 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.239
 some kind of there or something like that 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.639
 but this is more like an ostrich 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.350
 although actually changing here 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.320
 what actually happened here 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.290
 neck stretched and legs extended well and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.880
 tail took a slightly different shape tail 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.840
 here here to a lesser extent play a role 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.190
 of course the main role is played here 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.680
 relative dimensions of parts in general 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.780
 and interposition that is head 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.780
 became higher relative to the body pancake 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.150
 ears and legs lengthened too now i 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.760
 told you and showed by example 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.729
 such schematic images 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.800
 but in general it is important in principle for 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.860
 any images of any complexity 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.530
 Now I will draw such more here. 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.400
 realistic spots that look more like 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:07.410
 on the real you look how does that 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.410
 what I told on the image 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.470
