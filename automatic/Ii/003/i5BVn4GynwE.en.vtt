00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 and the truth is that it's a pleasure when there 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.220
 a lot of good painting paint these 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.019
 incredible colors in these clowns 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.900
 harlequins with claudia with I know we're going 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.059
 to paint because claudia really how 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.220
 handling the color is awesome to me 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.260
 I love the contrasts of color 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 it's a strong bet the blue is very 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.510
 electric and yellow good too 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.240
 this fort also for children but 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 it's something super cute your number that what 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.949
 we can put in a short of a boy is 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.770
 an elena city of man up more 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.590
 great the truth that goes that wide 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.149
 spectrum and then a guy from that role 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.890
 chopped we're seeing that I can not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.140
 believe how you did it that falls if you're 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 all 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 there are many little things we are going to do some 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.570
 The theme of the boys has always 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.520
 liked a lot 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.520
 I enjoy myself 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.510
 good for fabrics I start from bases 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.489
 flat butter very clear so that for 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 paint up the rhombuses in black and here 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.740
 for the yellow bases I'm going to do 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.240
 just a row of the rhombuses the truth 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.190
 What I did was look at the fabric 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.940
 like falling from a photo or is it not a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.909
 my invention as the fabric falls there is always 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.280
 to do flat everything flat I'm not 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.009
 making volume I'm not doing lights 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.340
 I'm not doing shadows I paint the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:30.330
 rhombs like that with a black liner on a 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.429
 clear butter flat and there I decide after 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.160
 how am I going to make the folds of this 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:36.810
 cloth what I did was grab a pencil 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.840
 let's grab a pencil that looks like a 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.420
 blue color something that looks good and according to 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.119
 As the fabrics come I decide to do the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.979
 folds I'll mark strong for 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.539
 see them and so they can be seen but the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.600
 reality is that we do it directly 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.330
 here where there are half diamonds means 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.490
 that there's a clamp if there's half a diamond there 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.670
 a clamp if there is half a diamond there 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.399
 click and there I will get lights and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.490
 shadows I will do first by means 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.239
 of the float let's go to the paddle with 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.000
 paint gray start doing the load 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.209
 half load I'm going to twist a little bit 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.970
 and start to take out the folds the truth 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.390
 that there is neither more nor less than lights and 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.510
 shadows I'm taking out folds that would be 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.849
 the tables if they are surfers like 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.700
 folds and gathers let's do more 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.200
 up the truth that it is a subtle work 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.630
 It is not difficult but you have to have 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.239
 attention to where the fabric changed me 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.310
 the drawing i what I did was first see 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.890
 the drawing where is it going there I'm taking out 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.799
 planes I'm taking out plans I'm taking out 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.620
 planes and what I do is see shadows 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.450
 the moment I just make shadows and now I'm going 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.220
 to start taking out the lights the lights 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.099
 they can be either butter or white and there 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.860
 start to draw lights I'm taking out the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.230
 lights over the diamonds because that's 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.640
 the idea when I pass the target by 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.350
 about the diamonds 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.870
 and there the folds start to come out 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.940
 let's make the bottom the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.430
 it's not difficult, there's only 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 to observe the drawing well I'm not from 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.620
 look too much attention to the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.660
 drawings and I made the fabric and nothing else I'm going to 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.540
 Now spend a little while on the other pants 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.550
 the other yellow here I put tapes of 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.010
 mask because I brought painted 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.350
 the moles that's good there are zones 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.170
 where the division ends the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.000
 pant division I worked with 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.880
 masking tape so polka dots 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.180
 were half bone I was in the middle of 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.489
 pants and here on the edges too 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.100
 because if it is not unrealistic to do all 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.390
 the even moles we will do the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:50.640
 shades of the yellow pants the 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.370
 Actually , I worked with East 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.320
 grade of colors I'm going to the palette a 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.959
 primary yellow that covers very well 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.110
 on a butter a yellow a little 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.110
 lighter and one of light 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.920
 light in addition to being lighter has white 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 then it starts to come out it's very subtle 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.350
 until all this comes out takes two or 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.330
 three hands let's start to take out and 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:18.079
 it may be that in the end I put him 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.230
 a droplet of white let's start 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.870
 put shadows to separate and that does not 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.090
 perfect perfect perfect the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.120
 yellow the idea is that when there 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.340
 polka dots or squares or rhombuses or whatever 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.530
 you have to go over and if you 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.540
 modify the colors is very well 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.040
 modify the colors and let's go 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.569
 make this fold here 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.139
 which is where they separate 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.839
 the pants and now I'm going to go to the paper 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.649
 Chopped and brush is very important for 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:55.639
 do the slips is new square 

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:58.849
 good and only white and weak to the 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.849
 paint not so thick as to paint and 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.270
 only frame I make squares in the 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.509
 just flat are some more flat but 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.339
 The idea is that they are small squares that 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.379
 they are falling in a sense if it is 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:15.379
 important that all the senses have 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:18.289
 to be noticed that fall once 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:22.330
 I did all that good decided the colors 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:26.659
 primary green red blue yellow 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:30.499
 weak and let's paint on some 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.899
 I can go through even the brushstroke of 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:34.849
 white from below because on the white 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.889
 because otherwise they would not see each other 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:41.069
 change the color red 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.680
 and some left them blank some 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.319
 he reviewed in white some he went through 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.569
 above others the awÃ¡ crossed and the 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:52.400
 true that the idea is that the summation 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.400
 it's funny 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.840
 and how good it is when the guys 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.840
 they can also learn to paint 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.830
 the boys love to paint the theme 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.900
 is that they give modern things that have the 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.490
 color palettes of now designs 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.830
 now that they do what they want 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.449
 or what moms want there are many 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.370
 there are many here and there is a lot of material 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:25.490
 there are also many products for boys 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.440
 divine divine so good to paint 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.020
 well I lost the child for all
