 what else 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.699
 the components that have that then 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.740
 can you give me the description I've been 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 talking about color of component fish and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.620
 Well, they are going to make a dedicated link and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.060
 that so you can see him 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.880
 the computer and all its components 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.730
 directly I will put the pieces or if 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.980
 not a computer that is very similar to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.600
 I'll put it here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 holy hand for what 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.510
 the shit is that they always attract him

 to protect us protects nothing but good 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.050
 I am you 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.080

 very important and good so here is not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.050
 it's really something that you do not have to 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.050
 point to the power supply 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.570
 they are 750 more than the wine came 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.310
 continue with the fort of the strong 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:32.729
 of the computer is the processor here what 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.130
 habeis sub and 74 thousand 770 k 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.020
 let's see how this 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.020
 it is totally sa and the penis of the computer 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.180
 clean for the whole week 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.680
 i 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.140
 more things 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.800
 these are pieces of the operating system 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.510
 hand in here I leave it manet 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:02:00.090
 collaborative analyzed very important 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:04.430
 for the tip fuck good another of the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.430
 strong computer 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:12.540
 is the graphics card that you see it is from 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.050
 2 gigas our bad but has power 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.050
 to get bored 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.190
 and good that you have known 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 there's the box and that 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.830
 inside that is super reinforced 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.220
 the king's strong graphics card does not 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.220
 fuck 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.830
 Very comes here and this is important 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.290
 truth is important to him 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.690
 for the design development and videogames 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.170
 what I am studying now is 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:53.620
 so important is the hard drive ssd's 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.620
 120 gigas which is where more 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.380
 there is really no where they will submit 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.600
 I take advantage I have to do the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.130
 university a video game and we have 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.300
 an official twitter and such only 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.690
 the sounds of the channel 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.060
 but still 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.200
 I will put the twitter link of the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.200
 video game down here 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.220
 we'll talk 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.000
 the extra 30 cooler counts payments 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.670
 Cooler is not nothing special but 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 Come on, it's all air to give and to give is 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.060
 penis 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.060
 here is the motherboard where manager is 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.250
 when the components of a arrives byte 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.290
 I do not know if it cost 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.360
 a hundred and some you already know that the plates 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.280
 bases that know how to degrade are not usually 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.170
 be very expensive but this one is not 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.890
 so expensive that I think they were not tail or the 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:57.270
 true finally the ram and it does not have 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.360
 many does not have much to do is a 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:05.260
 bone that are called network 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.770
 ring two cojones or as it is said I do not know if 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.770
 are 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.560
 are two of eight gigs in total 16 gigas 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.269
 but what we have is the designer 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.539
 and video game developer that 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.910
 you need and it's not very powerful 16 gigas 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:23.030
 I would really need 32 but that's what 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.100
 there is what the partner does not give us 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.169
 We cheat the bale did not even give to whores 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.030
 and finally the house he threw himself watch 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.580
 that where all the little things get 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.110
 that I'm not going to teach it because it's a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.930
 box that is bigger than my room 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.930
 I will not take 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.929
 and it is already 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.689
 I'm fine and well there's not much more than 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:49.699
 I will teach them how they have been taught 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.099
 all mounted so that you see it a 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.049
 little bit and that so that the components 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:58.369
 so let's not go to it good as 

00:04:54.049 --> 00:05:00.830
 you see there is worth there is he the tower and that 

00:04:58.369 --> 00:05:03.620
 here 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.710
 coolermaster etc. blah blah blah good 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.820
 here it does not look good but there are some unions 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.500
 and such that when it is turned on they are 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.450
 pretty cool abc cbs form cooler 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.670
 master etcetera look at it there is for 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.620
 inside is a window for you 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.080
 knock and see the bullshit that 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.680
 your computer is worth it, we are already 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.680
 inside guys 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.400
 here is the cooler that I taught you to 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.180
 link extra to the background you will not see those 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.410
 two things that are there are the ram where 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.280
 everything is plugged in, obviously it's the 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.380
 base plate and this little thing here this 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.150
 which is super wide you can see here 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.820
 all this is worth the graphic card 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.370
 here is the power source 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.550
 he does not see a shit not really not 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.010
 I know never gao and every time you see less this 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.990
 it's a 2-hard hard drive and this is the 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:05.540
 ssd that is not seen but let's go there is the 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:08.500
 ssd to work and walker hard and that and 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.500
 the processor 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.370
 where the pussy is processed 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.590
 well that's why it's not very good I do not know 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.180
 where is the fear of all the best 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.220
 well here is what I taught you the 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.630
 2GB disk here is the SSD in the 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.800
 power supply etc. not good 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.180
 I have no fucking idea where is the 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.610
 processor if someone knows that I would 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.910
 say because I do not have even the most remote 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.920
 idea I do not know if this was out there or out there 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.660
 but well there are the components and 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.660
 so so nothing 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.050
 you have already seen very rich is good 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.550
 Well it is now already the 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.950
 computer components I hope that you 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.430
 have liked the video that we like 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.430
 favorites 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.389
 now that I have a more powerful computer 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.389
 not sure, play some game 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.070
 fear that has enough graphics for 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.660
 pimps and such to charge me quite 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.410
 hardcore if you know any game of 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:14.200
 terror so there is quite a change and I 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.030
 a change of it you can leave it for the 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.250
 comments 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.650
 and we will play it I will play it for the channel and 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.720
 it's so perfect low if it's great 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.760
 we are very close to achieving 13 thousand 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.070
 subscribers so as soon as we get there 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.720
 follow me on twitter because as soon as 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.510
 we arrive on the same day or the day 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.060
 next deal 2 game cases for 

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.920
 steam that I do not usually do every certain 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.870
 so he's not going to follow me for the 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.870
 twitter and little else 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.870
 good guys see you in the next 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.870
 video
