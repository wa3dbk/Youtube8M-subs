how does pmm injections actually work

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.140 
how does pmm injections actually work
well<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.170> requires<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.890> form<00:04:52.190> of<00:04:52.310> collagen<00:04:52.730> and

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
well it requires a form of collagen and

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.980 
well it requires a form of collagen and
in<00:04:53.560> encapsulating<00:04:54.790> PMMA<00:04:55.790> microspheres<00:04:56.690> or

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.890 
things are going to come out especially
on<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:34.010> internet<00:06:34.490> but<00:06:34.729> it's<00:06:35.419> really

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
on the internet but it's really

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.780 
on the internet but it's really
interesting<00:06:36.200> to<00:06:36.560> know<00:06:36.860> what<00:06:37.280> people<00:06:37.490> are
