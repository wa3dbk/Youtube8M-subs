00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right after their evidence we

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.849 
all right after their evidence we
thought<00:00:03.149> we<00:00:03.300> had<00:00:03.449> just<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.720> little<00:00:04.020> bit<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.290> foam

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
thought we had just a little bit of foam

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.210 
thought we had just a little bit of foam
separation<00:00:05.810> there<00:00:06.810> was<00:00:06.960> no<00:00:07.109> DAP<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.859> final

the<00:00:18.270> on<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> closest<00:00:18.960> layer<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:20.340> can

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the on the closest layer but as you can

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.420 
the on the closest layer but as you can
see<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:21.720> no<00:00:21.840> cap<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.470> rips<00:00:22.769> right<00:00:23.160> through

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
see there's no cap it rips right through

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.990 
see there's no cap it rips right through
it<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.760> then<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:24.810> there's<00:00:24.960> movement

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
it and then when there's movement

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.820 
it and then when there's movement
there's<00:00:27.000> damage<00:00:29.750> there's<00:00:30.750> separation<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.650> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
there's damage there's separation here I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.590 
there's damage there's separation here I
don't<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.450> was

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
don't know what that was because it was

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
don't know what that was because it was
loose<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> when<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.160> shake<00:00:35.940> free

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
loose here and when we got to shake free

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.869 
loose here and when we got to shake free
or<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.680> not<00:00:37.829> sufficient<00:00:40.879> tapping

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
or there just was not sufficient tapping

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.380 
or there just was not sufficient tapping
up<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:43.190> don't<00:00:44.190> know<00:00:44.250> would<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.149> just

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
up there I don't know would you just

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
up there I don't know would you just
sand<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> little<00:00:46.800> bit<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
sand it or that a little bit to make it

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.950 
sand it or that a little bit to make it
a<00:00:47.309> little<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.520> porous<00:00:47.879> yeah<00:00:48.120> yeah<00:00:48.719> there

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
a little more porous yeah yeah there

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
a little more porous yeah yeah there
wasn't<00:00:49.110> enough<00:00:50.090> core<00:00:51.090> preparation<00:00:52.399> not

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
wasn't enough core preparation not

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090 
wasn't enough core preparation not
porous<00:00:53.879> enough<00:00:54.090> surface<00:00:54.329> adapt<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.770> further

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
porous enough surface adapt like further

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
porous enough surface adapt like further
down<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:57.030> probably<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.480> good<00:00:57.750> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
down here it's probably pretty good but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.310 
down here it's probably pretty good but
this<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.730> most<00:00:59.969> crucial<00:01:00.359> we're<00:01:01.109> talking

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
this is the most crucial we're talking

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
this is the most crucial we're talking
about<00:01:01.469> how<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> make<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> weapon<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
about how to make a weapon or how not to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.260 
about how to make a weapon or how not to
make<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> weapon<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:04.850> part<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.000> most

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
make a weapon this part is the most

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.649 
make a weapon this part is the most
crucial<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> most<00:01:08.659> damage

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
crucial it's gonna take the most damage

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
crucial it's gonna take the most damage
and<00:01:10.409> yeah<00:01:10.979> there's<00:01:11.250> even<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
and yeah there's even a little on the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.170 
and yeah there's even a little on the
back<00:01:12.270> side<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.909> had<00:01:15.090> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
back side and I do not think that had to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.850 
back side and I do not think that had to
do<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.409> us<00:01:16.409> removing<00:01:16.890> no<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.680> painters<00:01:19.680> tape

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
do with us removing no and painters tape

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.270 
do with us removing no and painters tape
it's<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:20.939> bad<00:01:21.509> at<00:01:21.780> all<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.770> using<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.130> weapon

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it's not bad at all to using a weapon

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.570 
it's not bad at all to using a weapon
why<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.030> drying<00:01:24.409> hold<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.650> together<00:01:25.799> so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
why it's drying hold it together so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.030 
why it's drying hold it together so
incidental<00:01:27.240> moving<00:01:27.570> doesn't<00:01:28.229> separate<00:01:28.590> seams

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
incidental moving doesn't separate seams

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
incidental moving doesn't separate seams
this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.759> gonna<00:01:29.850> hold<00:01:30.030> anything<00:01:30.180> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this is not gonna hold anything it

doesn't do anything except that take it

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.120 
doesn't do anything except that take it
