even if he was being dead serious though

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.350 
even if he was being dead serious though
there's<00:03:55.530> absolutely<00:03:55.950> 100%<00:03:56.459> in<00:03:56.760> no<00:03:56.940> way<00:03:57.120> that

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
there's absolutely 100% in no way that

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.750 
there's absolutely 100% in no way that
can<00:03:57.510> happen<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:58.049> this<00:03:58.530> film<00:03:58.799> franchise<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.610> he

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
can happen in this film franchise and he

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.460 
can happen in this film franchise and he
knows<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.540> director<00:04:00.930> knows<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.290> and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
knows it and the director knows it and

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
so it's irrelevant regardless but he

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.039 
so it's irrelevant regardless but he
wasn't<00:04:06.690> even<00:04:07.160> being<00:04:08.180> serious<00:04:09.180> they're<00:04:09.540> people
