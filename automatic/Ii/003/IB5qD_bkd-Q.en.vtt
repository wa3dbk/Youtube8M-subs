00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 for all I'm danica can maybe 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.000
 remember movies like gala is 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.040
 cornered 3 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.250
 carols like marÃ­a seco the franco 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.099
 that I'm going to be good to everyone 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.609
 kids today I'm going to make a video 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:20.730
 explanatory explanatory I say because I'm going 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.320
 to try to explain vote some advice 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.420
 I do not like to give any advice every 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 you play as you want, I'm not for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 explain why I am no any 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.150
 phenomenon but I will explain my way 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.369
 personal from my point of view of my 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 way to play in each mode and with each 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.270
 weapon with each class a little shared 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.860
 a little bit, we're all going to try 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.500
 comment if anyone can catch some 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.620
 counseling and serves something for my 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.579
 way to play or my way of seeing how 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.840
 unfold on each map 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.310
 Welcome be, but like it there 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.300
 come on let's go with the operator class g36 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.020
 over here I have nothing to add 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.020
 that we go there 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 well we started badly we have stopped 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.890
 there to the bearer of the bag but we have 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.670
 killed we are on the map of the block 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.040
 here is preferably to attack very 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.320
 fast to your spawn outlet or 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.930
 they press very fast forward to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.710
 that I do not have a chance to leave 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.180
 because this map is a soccer roll 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.409
 American have to take us underground 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.240
 meter to the bag 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.370
 and you have to try to stop it as soon 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.670
 possible 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.140
 we have stopped the carriers with the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.250
 operator class 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.980
 lage 36 because they are assault rifles that 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.280
 they arrive brand that the possible that the 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.280
 submachine guns 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.030
 I 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.790
 You can shoot from Manilines and go to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.770
 do more damage 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.440
 but from close you have the handicap that 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.730
 they do not have or can not shoot if you're 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.810
 of career I think they kill more 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.640
 submachine guns not the assault rifles 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.180
 they do not kill just as fast they do not have the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.180
 same cadence 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.050
 and then they take longer but good 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.270
 of which we are in a very position 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
 advantageous 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.040
 because the truth 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.040
 we have arrived a little 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.720
 to see if we could stop these people and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.400
 a person does it saleh thing that I doubt 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.610
 a lot because the team is already 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.610
 behind 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.390
 I do not want to explain it because if 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.390
 it would have been 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.239
 as I like it we would have gone to 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.680
 press up at the beginning of the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.640
 departure 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.640
 and from there they would not have left 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.370
 when people 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.940
 d 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.460
 we are for the carrier always 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.170
 guarding the carrier whenever it does not 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.760
 escape do not do not stay looking at the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.270
 others there are the two together we have 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.270
 what to take advantage 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.550
 ok they have seen us when trying to remove or 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.600
 whether it falls into the bag as soon as 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.600
 possible and cover it 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.319
 I already tell you that in my way of seeing what 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.670
 we are doing quite badly because if 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.670
 we would have gone up 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.569
 well we fall again but so much we go 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.569
 10-4 our hand 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.600
 nothing 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.050
 here in the once they have broken the 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.390
 first defense which is what I say of 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.200
 press up because the best is 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.230
 get into a 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.019
 in a building and try to cover every in 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.220
 each store and right so they can not 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.560
 climb there in mass 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.120
 since it's metro by metro to try 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.120
 take the bag and we 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.400
 on this map just that 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.370
 it is quite difficult to carry the bags 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.840
 it's because they have to spend all our 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.720
 defense have to move on to the other side 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.830
 of the map and we will be showing up 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.540
 continuously before I get to 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.540
 base 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.940
 it is one of the most difficult maps of 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.800
 in this mode 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.800
 in their coverage there are many games 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.590
 how it comes out pretty hard 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.590
 take the bags to the company 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.300
 sorry I will try to get to where they are 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.650
 at least the packages because if not 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.020
 they are already caught and there is no one 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.910
 defending there either according 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.380
 we retrieve the package and she comes 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.949
 waiting there to pick it up and go back 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.949
 forward 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.960
 so let's try not to do much 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.940
 noise does not shoot much so as not to give away 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.400
 our position and try to reach the 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.030
 it's not that it's full of time 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.030
 bad, bad 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.250
 let's move on from him let's try 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.689
 get to the bottom of the map and try 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.219
 protect the bag detail to see if the 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.550
 team could be in the network take 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.550
 forward 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.690
 nothing happens 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.860
 let's come here and let's try 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.160
 defend the stock market before 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.160
 deliver 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.259
 and we are in advantageous position 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.050
 they have killed us we take with us 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:05.270
 I do not know if it was the 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.270
 package but you have delivered 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.960
 let's see let's continue if it has 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.120
 delivered a package already 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.550
 and I want to get to the bottom of the map or 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.550
 let's see if it can be please 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.950
 is very motivated 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.730
 good good with the peace of eagle 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.300
 deadly as well as only also 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.340
 we will explain a little bit of the bacrim and 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.430
 also say of the ahe 36 ce 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.690
 what is a weapon that would stay between 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.830
 submachine guns and assault rifles 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:46.650
 neither is a pure assault rifle like 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.650
 the 16 30 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.910
 good good good 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:07:01.310
 it does not go as far as 416 3 but 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:05.110
 I think it has a little more rate of 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.639
 shot faster than jumping the bullets that 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:10.749
 16 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:10.749
 when the site 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:21.719
 there is no way to catch a cover 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:24.539
 well I would have liked to explain it 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:27.949
 another way but good I think that here 

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:27.949
 You can also take some advice 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.039
 and nothing this is going to end up being already 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.409
 zero and the more we give the bearer of 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:36.720
 the bag you have to go to the director 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:40.970
 nothing outside it's game over 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.970
 many grenades everything we have 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.010
 in love there is hunger 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.840
 straight for him I'll play why 

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:53.689
 it's not because of killing the girl of 

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.699
 good knife 

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:58.909
 as it has thus far reached this first 

00:07:55.699 --> 00:08:00.769
 video explaining my way of playing not 

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:02.269
 they have been good and it has been bad 

00:08:00.769 --> 00:08:05.210
 leave it to me in the comments 

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:07.460
 subscribe if you like to like 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.590
 and nothing until the next video I hope 

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.889
 that you like it a lot and until next time 

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.889
 bye
