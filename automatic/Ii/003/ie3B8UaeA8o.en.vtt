00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 good morning, be evenings welcome to the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.700
 channel I am jose and today we are here in a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.580
 strategy for a man order 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.290
 competitive, it's worth it guys 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.220
 to see how is this man worth 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.490
 we'll explain a bit so 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.260
 what can you have that you can do it 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.450
 and as always a short strategy and 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.570
 well detailed it's worth it so let's go 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.640
 with it to start has some stats 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.509
 pretty good defensively speaking 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.640
 it's worth a few states in 95 in ps 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.820
 65 in attack that good is a little 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.480
 yellow 110 in defense that with his 95 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.790
 ps is very respectable 60 in attack 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.710
 special that is box office and also not what 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:50.390
 let's use 130 in special defense that 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.010
 eye 65 in speed that good well no 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.740
 was the voucher is not the worst 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.560
 defensively in equal speed 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.640
 then we will have a skill 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.870
 that is going to be synchrony that consists of 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:10.910
 that if they poison us they paralyze or burn 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:14.000
 I think this is going to pass your state 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.220
 altered and the opponent is worth in plan 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.730
 have a chance and you intoxicate your 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.000
 intoxicated at chance and it's worth something like that 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.040
 put a chance and for an example 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.030
 could be worth any other pokemon that 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:31.120
 have toxic for everything that is worth and 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.370
 good of objects we could take rests 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.270
 I think it is the best option 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.460
 more viable although good I do not know what 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.970
 I would leave so I would always carry remains 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.160
 with a verve cure ps free every turn 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 Besides, he does not have bad ps, they are 95 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.210
 fish bases that the truth is very well 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.950
 and with its defenses and such will resist 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.780
 quite so we're going to heal a 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.780
 little that is not bad either 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.429
 of nature we are going to take a 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.469
 cautious nature because it goes up 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.210
 the special defense and lowers the attack 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.710
 special as a special attack not what 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.360
 let's use it because now let's see your 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.970
 box set 'we will not use it at all 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.860
 and the special defense for how are we going to 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.840
 take curse is worth going up 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.130
 the defense because we maximize the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.160
 special defense so that when we 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.730
 let's show the defense, be it something 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.260
 very difficult to throw the sets worth 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.990
 they will be more or less the same as 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.060
 defense is worth 252 in ps to increase 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.850
 we life cure ourselves a little more with 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.040
 straight the remaining six we're going to 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.360
 take in defense is good for good 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.459
 They are six and we leave them worth and 252 eps in 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.530
 special defense for the same thing 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.240
 because when we have a curse or 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.459
 two curses that we are going to be 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.930
 practically integrable is worth 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.390
 I practically say because always 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.910
 the typical one will come good 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.130
 I shot that with a swirl uncle 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.020
 I will tell you, well, you have to 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.970
 take it worth 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.709
 then the boxer that we are going to take is 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.380
 very simple voucher 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.020
 look there are several options worth we have 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.970
 Cure hood or carry toxic to me 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.489
 it seems very very good campa the cradle 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.840
 besides that it supports the rest of the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.269
 team 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.530
 healing all the altered problems of 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.440
 your team 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 but apart is that being a wall 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.780
 defensive by both defenses is worth it if 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.989
 first thing they're going to try to do is 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.799
 intoxicate what intoxicate what is most 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.870
 feasible or burn it to go receiving 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.090
 damage all shifts that the truth is 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.040
 that fuck quite then if you get 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.140
 camps to the cure when you go two turns 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.830
 of toxic from throwing bell cures and you 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.800
 you're so hot 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.900
 ok then we can take toxic 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.740
 to intoxicate other walls is worth 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.320
 will be difficult to throw but it is that 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:57.200
 bring synchrony worth the walls then to 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.740
 sometimes they throw you toxic and things like that 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.750
 then you will intoxicate them and then 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.430
 you heal with bell heals me 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.680
 like much more bell cures than tops and 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.230
 global but good is another option worth 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.660
 it's viable I'm not saying it's impossible or 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.450
 anything like that so nothing there 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.580
 is left after we can bring lunar light or 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.750
 I wish I forgot to put it 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:24.260
 I wish it can be more support to the team 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.690
 but there are there can be shifts in the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.000
 that we need to heal ourselves right in that 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.570
 turn and we can not wait for me I like 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.060
 more more moonlight is worth that desire but 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.550
 good for tastes the colors and here 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.650
 everyone uses what they want afterwards 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.289
 we have a curse, it's a 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.680
 dessert we attack the attack 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:48.889
 to plus one in the defense plus 1 and we 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.099
 slow down to minus 1 is worth what 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.559
 happen with this this is very good because 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:57.619
 because to see a veron has kaka of 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:59.539
 speed is good , but attack poop 

00:04:57.619 --> 00:05:03.289
 good if we show the attack three 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.779
 Sometimes it if you do not 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.149
 we raise the defense three times or two 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:11.809
 couple that we are going to be practically 

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:13.789
 integrable for nothing or you already have to 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:16.249
 do to us there is something weird like the 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.949
 intoxicate us that we can not throw them 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:21.409
 bell cures because if they do not kill us with 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.419
 light I do not know weird things are worth it 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:25.879
 they have captives we are losing a lot 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.189
 toxic life I do not know are very 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:30.169
 random or they do not already have us swirl or 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.669
 things like that, we like a couple 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.529
 of neighbors have a new link or if we 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:35.180
 we stayed but the truth is that it is a 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:36.979
 pokÃ©mon very good and then we can 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.129
 carry or vendetta or played dirty 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.430
 I recommend very coarse vendetta vale 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:45.289
 because because he sells this is what 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.759
 better you can find since 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.480
 As you lower your speed you are going to hit 

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:52.090
 the last good 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.580
 you're going to hit a lot later and you're going to 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.640
 hit very hard because if they hit you 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.860
 sells both doubles its power and hits 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.110
 very curious cakes and also receives this 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:05.410
 that has this mouth good with respect to 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.320
 other pokemon with this kind of stuff 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.060
 It is worth for example that this is good 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.850
 pokemon regarding a mega slow brovales 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.700
 with sleepwalking breaks and all that 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.830
 you see everything ugly there that is the best 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.540
 has to sell is given to all 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.170
 types of what is better for example if 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:26.170
 even be a mega is you managed to get him a 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:28.720
 trace where the castro based in its 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.880
 face is worth it because he can not 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.070
 do absolutely nothing the battery of 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.650
 climb is going to throw collector and goes to 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.900
 do parties valences and good guys 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.610
 well nothing and basically this is the 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.920
 analysis that I wanted to make of this 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.200
 man is worth an analysis the truth that 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.300
 a good one because it's a normal analysis and 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.340
 current is to say that man 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:52.270
 has few weaknesses since only 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.940
 I would have frost and in a fight, and the 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.169
 bug but the fairy fight and the bug but 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.029
 good they are guys 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.460
 you do not see much at the best either 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:03.729
 wearing a fairy and ugly pokÃ©mon 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.710
 because it covers perfectly so nothing 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.120
 guys I hope you liked the 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.159
 analysis you already know if you liked 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.860
 you can give a like to subscribe for more 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:14.169
 analysis and random things are worth and that we 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.039
 we see in the next video pity up 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:17.039
 then take care
