the<00:01:47.040> actor<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.759> sort<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.060> see<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.509> we

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
the actor so you can sort of see how we

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.219 
the actor so you can sort of see how we
store<00:01:49.740> our<00:01:49.770> toys<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.579> organize<00:01:51.060> them<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.899> as

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
store our toys and organize them so as

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
store our toys and organize them so as
you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.470> see<00:01:52.619> behind<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:53.040> these<00:01:53.670> are<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you can see behind me these are the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
you can see behind me these are the
shelves<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.540> had<00:01:54.840> put<00:01:54.990> together<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.649> think

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
shelves that I had put together I think

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.499 
shelves that I had put together I think
two<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> half<00:01:56.340> years<00:01:56.579> ago<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.820> our<00:01:57.119> basement

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
two and a half years ago in our basement

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.190 
two and a half years ago in our basement
to<00:01:58.110> try<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> attempt<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.070> begin<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> process

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
to try to attempt to begin the process

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.499 
to try to attempt to begin the process
but<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.500> looking<00:02:01.979> pretty<00:02:02.430> messy<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.270> I'm

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
but it's looking pretty messy so I'm

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
but it's looking pretty messy so I'm
going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.079> back<00:02:04.500> up<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.890> show<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
going to kind of back up and show the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
going to kind of back up and show the
whole<00:02:05.520> wall<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> see<00:02:06.930> what<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
whole wall to you so you can see what it

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.109 
whole wall to you so you can see what it
looks<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.950> hopefully<00:02:08.640> it'll<00:02:09.030> be

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
looks like and hopefully it'll be

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.059 
looks like and hopefully it'll be
looking<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.479> whole<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.959> better<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.920> done

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
looking a whole lot better when I'm done

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.890 
looking a whole lot better when I'm done
okay

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
okay

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.300 
okay
so<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:16.879> all<00:02:17.879> the<00:02:18.180> shelves<00:02:18.629> here

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
so as you can see all the shelves here

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.339 
so as you can see all the shelves here
are<00:02:20.310> where<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.819> try<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> house<00:02:21.480> all<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.959> toys

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
are where we try to house all the toys

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.550 
are where we try to house all the toys
and<00:02:22.739> then<00:02:23.010> moving<00:02:23.760> around<00:02:24.260> we<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.379> air

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and then moving around we have air

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680 
and then moving around we have air
conditioners<00:02:26.010> down<00:02:26.220> here<00:02:26.549> chairs<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
conditioners down here chairs and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.720 
conditioners down here chairs and
there's<00:02:27.840> our<00:02:27.959> steps<00:02:28.319> going<00:02:28.650> upstairs<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.370> our

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.729 
there's our steps going upstairs to our
living<00:02:30.209> area<00:02:30.409> so<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.970> pretty<00:02:33.690> darn<00:02:33.959> messy<00:02:34.260> as

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
living area so it's pretty darn messy as

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.949 
living area so it's pretty darn messy as
you<00:02:35.159> can<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:37.670> if<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:39.360> can<00:02:39.510> definitely<00:02:39.870> do
