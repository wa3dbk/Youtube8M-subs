00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.559
 Hi guys all good 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.670
 Hi, what are you doing? 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.850
 It's more of a challenge that is delayed but 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 we recorded in the afternoon than never before 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.560
 it's because I recorded another video in the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.289
 But finally, let's go now and for who 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.539
 Asked for the challenge, girlfriend Vecci girlfriend. 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.180
 kiss to her and asked it is 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.160
 understood but this is going to be the party 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.200
 so as not to roll over into many challenges 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.820
 but we'll split because the last one 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.140
 challenge that is the challenge of the egg the people 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 is thinking of increasing the quantity 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 of the egg then only the egg that will not have 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.700
 in that only from the next to nothing and not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 You'll just be listening, so it's not going to be lonely. 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.710
 six eggs I believe it's going to be eight 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.719
 eggs and do not know if you will have questions and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.520
 everything else but it was not our thing 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.469
 so let's start the challenge the people 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.359
 will make friends like this the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.629
 People liked it better, we'll go then. 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.060

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.549
 scheduled and placed with 30 seconds 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.259
 that putting more with 30 seconds takes 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.259
 So let's go to the first challenge. 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.010
