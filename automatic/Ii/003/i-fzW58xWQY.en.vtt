00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.719 
lap but i think the rap looks okay too i
think<00:02:09.050> if<00:02:09.319> i<00:02:09.440> did<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.709> again<00:02:09.800> i<00:02:10.039> wouldn't<00:02:10.550> put

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
think if i did it again i wouldn't put

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.720 
think if i did it again i wouldn't put
the<00:02:10.789> not<00:02:11.150> here<00:02:11.540> i<00:02:11.720> would<00:02:12.459> go<00:02:13.459> through<00:02:13.640> the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the not here i would go through the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.550 
the not here i would go through the
handle<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.090> i<00:02:14.360> did<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.780> then<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.319> back

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
handle like i did and then go back

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.830 
handle like i did and then go back
through<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.069> handle<00:02:16.400> again<00:02:16.660> which<00:02:17.660> would

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
through the handle again which would

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.460 
through the handle again which would
secure<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.470> at<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.830> end<00:02:19.000> without<00:02:20.000> or<00:02:20.269> not<00:02:20.470> and

secure it at the end without or not and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
secure it at the end without or not and
then<00:02:21.560> i<00:02:21.650> would<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.040> start<00:02:22.370> with<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.790> two
