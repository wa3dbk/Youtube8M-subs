me<00:00:31.050> myself<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.650> was<00:00:32.160> trying<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.430> hit<00:00:32.520> 20,000<00:00:33.120> but

now I think it would be a stretch to

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.709 
now I think it would be a stretch to
even<00:00:35.309> make<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> eighteen<00:00:36.149> thousand<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:36.630> if

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
even make it eighteen thousand but if

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.850 
even make it eighteen thousand but if
you<00:00:36.780> guys<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.110> leave<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:37.469> leave<00:00:37.500> some

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
one bullet would kill you in that game

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.870 
one bullet would kill you in that game
before<00:03:05.230> all<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.770> stuff<00:03:06.070> was<00:03:06.220> really<00:03:06.550> found

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
before all that stuff was really found

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.130 
before all that stuff was really found
out<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.210> really<00:03:07.630> could<00:03:07.780> get<00:03:07.930> under<00:03:08.080> people's

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
out and really could get under people's

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.190 
out and really could get under people's
skin<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.740> thought<00:03:09.370> mw3<00:03:09.880> was<00:03:10.150> tremendously<00:03:10.900> fun

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
skin I thought mw3 was tremendously fun

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.260 
skin I thought mw3 was tremendously fun
I<00:03:11.410> thought<00:03:11.620> that<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.890> game<00:03:12.070> was<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:13.030> me<00:03:13.150> it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
I thought that that game was to me it

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.760 
I thought that that game was to me it
felt<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.600> throwback<00:03:13.900> almost<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.560> cod4

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
felt like a throwback almost the cod4

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.130 
felt like a throwback almost the cod4
because<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.430> felt<00:03:15.640> simple<00:03:16.120> enough<00:03:16.390> uh<00:03:17.670> yet<00:03:18.670> it

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
because it felt simple enough uh yet it

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
because it felt simple enough uh yet it
was<00:03:20.140> interesting<00:03:20.560> enough<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.770> keep<00:03:21.010> my

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
was interesting enough to keep my

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.220 
was interesting enough to keep my

at first it was very fun to me after
about<00:03:39.640> three<00:03:39.910> or<00:03:39.940> four<00:03:40.030> months<00:03:40.180> I've<00:03:40.510> really

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
about three or four months I've really

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.510 
about three or four months I've really
got<00:03:40.959> sick<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.290> very<00:03:41.620> very<00:03:41.860> super<00:03:42.310> quickly

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
got sick of it very very super quickly

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.430 
got sick of it very very super quickly
and<00:03:42.880> it's<00:03:43.150> one<00:03:43.600> of<00:03:43.690> my<00:03:43.750> least<00:03:43.989> favorite<00:03:44.290> call

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
and it's one of my least favorite call

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.850 
and it's one of my least favorite call
of<00:03:44.530> duty's<00:03:44.940> right<00:03:45.940> after<00:03:46.540> mw2<00:03:47.050> mw2<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.739> my

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
of duty's right after mw2 mw2 is my

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.680 
of duty's right after mw2 mw2 is my
least<00:03:48.070> favorite<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:49.090> that's<00:03:49.239> just<00:03:49.360> me<00:03:49.540> you

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
least favorite and that's just me you

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.300 
least favorite and that's just me you
know<00:03:49.720> i<00:03:49.810> think<00:03:50.260> that<00:03:50.380> mw2<00:03:50.800> could<00:03:51.130> have<00:03:51.220> been

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
know i think that mw2 could have been

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.920 
know i think that mw2 could have been
great<00:03:51.489> had<00:03:51.880> they<00:03:52.030> not<00:03:52.180> implemented<00:03:52.690> some<00:03:52.840> of

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
great had they not implemented some of

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.600 
great had they not implemented some of
the<00:03:53.020> cheap<00:03:53.230> things<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.680> they<00:03:53.770> did<00:03:53.980> but

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
the cheap things that they did but

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.000 
the cheap things that they did but
anyways<00:03:54.970> this<00:03:55.510> leads<00:03:55.750> us<00:03:55.840> into<00:03:56.080> ghosts<00:03:56.650> do<00:03:56.980> I

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
anyways this leads us into ghosts do I

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.280 
anyways this leads us into ghosts do I
think<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.370> goes<00:03:57.580> can<00:03:57.760> be<00:03:57.880> great<00:03:58.060> well<00:03:58.290> some

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
think that goes can be great well some

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.780 
think that goes can be great well some
people<00:03:59.500> say<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.770> looks<00:03:59.980> feel<00:04:00.310> sort<00:04:00.670> of<00:04:00.730> like

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
people say it looks feel sort of like

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.420 
people say it looks feel sort of like
mw3<00:04:01.270> but<00:04:01.570> for<00:04:01.720> me<00:04:01.870> if<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:02.500> take<00:04:02.980> em<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.340> be

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
mw3 but for me if you take em to be

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.280 
mw3 but for me if you take em to be
three<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.760> take<00:04:04.000> out<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.510> Deaf<00:04:04.690> streaks<00:04:05.110> and

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
three you take out the Deaf streaks and

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.050 
three you take out the Deaf streaks and
you<00:04:05.770> implement<00:04:06.220> bigger<00:04:06.400> maps<00:04:06.640> like<00:04:06.850> the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
you implement bigger maps like the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.180 
you implement bigger maps like the
developers<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:07.840> stuff<00:04:07.959> has<00:04:08.140> have<00:04:08.770> claims

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
developers and stuff has have claims

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.500 
developers and stuff has have claims
that<00:04:09.310> they're<00:04:09.489> doing<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:10.000> call<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.239> duty

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
that they're doing with call of duty

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.910 
that they're doing with call of duty
ghosts<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.840> way<00:04:10.959> every<00:04:11.230> place<00:04:11.410> I<00:04:11.560> was<00:04:11.709> viable

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
ghosts that way every place I was viable

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.370 
ghosts that way every place I was viable
if<00:04:12.190> they<00:04:12.340> can<00:04:12.550> do<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.820> so<00:04:13.720> basically<00:04:14.230> you

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
if they can do that so basically you

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.979 
if they can do that so basically you
take<00:04:14.500> mu<00:04:14.739> 3<00:04:14.980> n<00:04:15.250> mw3<00:04:15.910> oh<00:04:16.239> my<00:04:16.450> gosh<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.690> can't<00:04:16.870> talk

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
take mu 3 n mw3 oh my gosh I can't talk

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.080 
take mu 3 n mw3 oh my gosh I can't talk
I<00:04:17.109> just<00:04:17.290> won't<00:04:17.410> go<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.370> take<00:04:18.549> em<00:04:18.669> DUP<00:04:18.850> three

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
I just won't go if you take em DUP three

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.810 
I just won't go if you take em DUP three
take<00:04:19.450> out<00:04:19.600> all<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.169> BS<00:04:20.410> put<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.580> a<00:04:21.669> little

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
take out all the BS put it in a little

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.250 
take out all the BS put it in a little
bit<00:04:22.000> bigger<00:04:22.180> maps<00:04:22.419> I<00:04:22.600> think<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.110> would

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
bit bigger maps I think that that would

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.690 
bit bigger maps I think that that would
actually<00:04:23.440> be<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.710> relatively<00:04:24.669> fun<00:04:24.970> game<00:04:25.180> to<00:04:25.210> be

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
actually be a relatively fun game to be

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.860 
actually be a relatively fun game to be
with<00:04:25.910> you<00:04:26.000> guys<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.270> I<00:04:26.360> wouldn't<00:04:26.630> even<00:04:26.720> be

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
with you guys and I wouldn't even be

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.870 
with you guys and I wouldn't even be
hating<00:04:27.200> on<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:27.470> I'm<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.340> if<00:04:28.460> they<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.760> do<00:04:28.850> that

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
hating on it I'm so if they can do that

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.760 
hating on it I'm so if they can do that
with<00:04:29.150> ghosts<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:29.570> even<00:04:29.900> implement<00:04:30.290> greater

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
with ghosts and even implement greater
