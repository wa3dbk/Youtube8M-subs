just using it for storage it's not going

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.109 
just using it for storage it's not going
to<00:01:06.650> have<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:06.890> buildup<00:01:07.189> of<00:01:07.280> condensation<00:01:08.090> so

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
to have that buildup of condensation so

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.510 
to have that buildup of condensation so
you<00:01:08.299> don't<00:01:08.479> have<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.810> worry<00:01:09.080> about<00:01:09.650> everything

you don't have to worry about everything

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.550 
you don't have to worry about everything
that<00:01:10.549> you're<00:01:10.760> storing<00:01:11.090> inside<00:01:11.420> having<00:01:12.350> that

that you're storing inside having that
buildup<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.860> condensation<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:13.820> all<00:01:14.030> a

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
buildup of condensation so it's all a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.320 
buildup of condensation so it's all a
taken<00:01:14.720> care<00:01:14.990> of<00:01:15.020> now<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.010> steel<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.729> actually

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
taken care of now the steel is actually

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.359 
taken care of now the steel is actually
galvanized<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.409> that's<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.710> very<00:01:18.920> special

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
galvanized and that's a very special

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.460 
galvanized and that's a very special
technique<00:01:19.520> so<00:01:19.909> basically<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:20.570> coated<00:01:20.840> with

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
technique so basically it's coated with

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.530 
technique so basically it's coated with
zinc<00:01:21.500> and<00:01:22.189> that<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.729> going<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.030> protect<00:01:23.240> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
zinc and that is going to protect the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.090 
zinc and that is going to protect the
Shared<00:01:23.900> it's<00:01:24.170> just<00:01:24.350> going<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.590> help<00:01:24.799> with<00:01:24.920> its

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
Shared it's just going to help with its

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.310 
Shared it's just going to help with its
stability<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:26.000> just<00:01:26.630> protect<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
stability and just protect the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.350
