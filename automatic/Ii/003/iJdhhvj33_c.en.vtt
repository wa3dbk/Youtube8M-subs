00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.300 

I<00:02:49.900> don't<00:02:50.900> think<00:02:50.989> that<00:02:51.380> was<00:02:51.530> all<00:02:51.800> of<00:02:52.010> them<00:02:52.130> but

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I don't think that was all of them but

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.610 
I don't think that was all of them but
somehow<00:02:52.670> one<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.599> the<00:02:53.660> stragglers<00:02:54.200> actually

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
somehow one of the stragglers actually

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.150 
somehow one of the stragglers actually
escaped

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
escaped

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.100 
escaped
we<00:02:55.430> had<00:02:55.520> a<00:02:55.550> coolest<00:02:55.940> part<00:02:56.150> about<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.599> was<00:02:56.630> to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
we had a coolest part about that was to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.350 
we had a coolest part about that was to
actually<00:02:57.349> see<00:02:57.620> well<00:02:58.430> see<00:02:58.880> some<00:02:59.180> of<00:02:59.270> the

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
actually see well see some of the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.330 
actually see well see some of the
stragglers<00:02:59.900> really<00:03:00.380> struggled<00:03:00.800> to<00:03:00.920> be<00:03:01.190> like

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
stragglers really struggled to be like

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.949 
stragglers really struggled to be like
what<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.670> hell<00:03:01.850> is<00:03:01.970> this<00:03:02.060> guy<00:03:02.239> using<00:03:02.569> against

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
what the hell is this guy using against

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.250 
what the hell is this guy using against
us

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
us

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.930 
us
anyway<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.860> think<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.489> we<00:03:04.640> didn't

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
anyway I think because we didn't

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.340 
anyway I think because we didn't
officially<00:03:05.030> get<00:03:05.480> like<00:03:05.660> oh<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.840> defeated<00:03:06.200> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
officially get like oh you defeated the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.260 
officially get like oh you defeated the
boss<00:03:06.610> notification<00:03:07.610> I<00:03:07.700> want<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.940> do<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.090> again

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
boss notification I want to do it again

00:03:08.270 --> 00:04:08.890 
boss notification I want to do it again
so<00:03:08.480> let's<00:03:08.660> go

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.420 

you

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.479 

and<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.479> think<00:04:18.840> they<00:04:19.019> escaped<00:04:19.380> again<00:04:19.680> for<00:04:20.250> some

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and I think they escaped again for some

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.879 
and I think they escaped again for some
reason<00:04:20.720> even<00:04:21.720> though<00:04:21.810> we<00:04:21.989> look<00:04:22.259> we<00:04:22.500> officially

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
reason even though we look we officially

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.409 
reason even though we look we officially
won<00:04:23.130> okay<00:04:23.430> Eva<00:04:23.699> we're<00:04:24.060> not<00:04:24.210> getting

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.480 
won okay Eva we're not getting
notification<00:04:25.139> for<00:04:25.530> some<00:04:25.740> reason<00:04:26.070> some<00:04:26.280> of<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
notification for some reason some of the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.730 
notification for some reason some of the
stragglers<00:04:27.030> display<00:04:27.449> because<00:04:28.080> they<00:04:28.350> are<00:04:28.500> done

look at it's kind of a beautiful process
as<00:04:47.130> well<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:47.610> so<00:04:48.210> there<00:04:48.419> you<00:04:48.509> have<00:04:48.539> it<00:04:48.720> for<00:04:49.199> now

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
as well and so there you have it for now

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.200 
as well and so there you have it for now
that<00:04:50.100> is<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.340> power<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.729> short-sword

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
that is the power of the short-sword

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.180 
that is the power of the short-sword
only<00:04:51.660> when<00:04:51.840> you<00:04:51.960> puff<00:04:52.199> it<00:04:52.350> up<00:04:52.440> with<00:04:52.680> endgame

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
only when you puff it up with endgame

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.520 
only when you puff it up with endgame
stuff<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.789> specifically<00:04:54.720> chose<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:55.289> frost

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
stuff and I specifically chose the frost

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.110 
stuff and I specifically chose the frost
armor<00:04:55.770> but<00:04:56.010> why<00:04:56.130> not<00:04:56.310> beetle<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:56.760> stuff<00:04:56.970> like

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
armor but why not beetle and stuff like

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.080 
armor but why not beetle and stuff like
that<00:04:57.300> because<00:04:57.960> while<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.620> said<00:04:58.979> it<00:04:59.070> before<00:04:59.370> we

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
that because while I said it before we

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.330 
that because while I said it before we
get<00:05:00.240> the<00:05:00.419> frost<00:05:00.750> dot<00:05:01.470> we<00:05:01.770> get<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:02.010> damage<00:05:02.280> over

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
get the frost dot we get the damage over

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.189 
get the frost dot we get the damage over
time<00:05:02.490> on<00:05:02.789> our<00:05:02.910> enemies<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:03.720> we<00:05:03.840> could<00:05:03.960> frost

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
time on our enemies so we could frost

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.750 
time on our enemies so we could frost
fire<00:05:04.440> burning<00:05:04.830> or<00:05:04.919> enemies<00:05:05.160> but<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:05.430> also<00:05:05.550> have

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
fire burning or enemies but we also have

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.219

normal<00:05:06.060> fire<00:05:06.210> from<00:05:06.539> our<00:05:06.630> fire<00:05:06.810> gauntlet

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
normal fire from our fire gauntlet

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.320 
normal fire from our fire gauntlet
burning<00:05:07.470> our<00:05:07.530> enemies<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:07.979> in<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.729> case<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:08.970> a
