00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
realize now that I'm going to have to

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.839 
realize now that I'm going to have to
rethink<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.210> back<00:00:09.900> up<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.320> punt<00:00:10.710> looks<00:00:11.670> like

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
rethink and back up and punt looks like

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.459 
rethink and back up and punt looks like
we're<00:00:12.059> going<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.540> go<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.719> plan<00:00:12.809> B

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
we're going to have to go to plan B

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.709 
we're going to have to go to plan B
because<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:14.370> inside<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.179> refrigerator

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
because the inside of the refrigerator

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.140 
because the inside of the refrigerator
is<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:17.010> going<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:18.140> like<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.350> thought<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.619> was

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
is not going to be like I thought it was

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.720 
is not going to be like I thought it was
I<00:00:21.230> grabbed<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.500> bottom<00:00:22.859> side<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.460> freezer

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
I grabbed the bottom side of the freezer

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
I grabbed the bottom side of the freezer
unit<00:00:24.240> here<00:00:25.010> like<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.340> started<00:00:27.269> sliding

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
unit here like this and started sliding

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.680 
unit here like this and started sliding
it<00:00:27.840> out<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.580> now<00:00:29.580> i<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:30.260> found<00:00:31.260> out<00:00:31.619> that

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
it out and now i have found out that

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.069 
it out and now i have found out that
there<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.989> no<00:00:34.320> metal<00:00:35.100> sides<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.969> extend<00:00:36.750> up

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
there is no metal sides that extend up

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.030 
there is no metal sides that extend up
beyond<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.190> bottom<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.180> freezer<00:00:39.390> unit

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
beyond the bottom of the freezer unit

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.389 
beyond the bottom of the freezer unit
the<00:00:41.040> freezer<00:00:41.460> unit<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.059> up<00:00:42.450> against<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
the freezer unit was up against the

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.760 
the freezer unit was up against the
fiberglass<00:00:44.399> insulation<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:47.180> the<00:00:48.180> other

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
fiberglass insulation so the other

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.290 
fiberglass insulation so the other
freezers<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> refrigerator<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.789> i<00:00:50.969> saw

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
freezers or a refrigerator that i saw

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.939 
freezers or a refrigerator that i saw
made<00:00:51.660> into<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.579> smoker<00:00:54.530> actually<00:00:55.530> had<00:00:55.739> i<00:00:55.770> think

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
made into a smoker actually had i think

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.610 
made into a smoker actually had i think
like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> smaller<00:00:57.030> freezer<00:00:57.750> unit<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.559> i

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
like a smaller freezer unit that was i

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
like a smaller freezer unit that was i
add<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.820> or<00:01:00.000> less<00:01:00.230> up<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.760> top<00:01:02.760> right

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
add on more or less up in the top right

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.960 
add on more or less up in the top right
corner<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.460> though<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> whole

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
corner of it this one though the whole

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.620 
corner of it this one though the whole
top<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:07.229> freezer<00:01:07.710> unit<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.400> as<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
top of it is a freezer unit and as you

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.620 
top of it is a freezer unit and as you
can<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.520> there<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> couple<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> wires<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
can see there is a couple of wires that

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.760 
can see there is a couple of wires that
I<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> cut<00:01:13.740> here<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:15.320> now<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I need to cut here but now I'm going to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
I need to cut here but now I'm going to
have<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> figure<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.869> i'm<00:01:18.990> going<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.200> do

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
have to figure out what i'm going to do

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.030 
have to figure out what i'm going to do
as<00:01:19.710> far<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.509> attaching<00:01:21.509> metal<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
as far as attaching metal around to the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.109 
as far as attaching metal around to the
insides<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.200> to<00:01:25.200> seal<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.650> off<00:01:26.119> I'm

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
insides of it to seal it off I'm

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.999 
insides of it to seal it off I'm
thinking<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> may<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
thinking now that what I may do is

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
thinking now that what I may do is
there's<00:01:32.009> another<00:01:32.579> shot<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> lines<00:01:33.479> up

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
there's another shot of the lines up

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.520 
there's another shot of the lines up
above<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:36.689> will<00:01:36.780> also<00:01:37.140> need<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.350> be

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
above there that will also need to be

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.109 
above there that will also need to be
cut<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.070> sure<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.670> they're<00:01:38.850> still<00:01:39.060> under

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
cut not sure if they're still under

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.140 
cut not sure if they're still under
pressure<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.560> but<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.490> guess<00:01:41.939> I'll<00:01:42.119> find

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
pressure or not but I guess I'll find

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.929 
pressure or not but I guess I'll find
out<00:01:42.630> when<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.860> put<00:01:44.070> some<00:01:44.220> side<00:01:44.490> cutters

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
out when I when I put some side cutters

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.889 
out when I when I put some side cutters
on<00:01:45.119> them<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:47.390> what<00:01:48.390> I'm<00:01:48.509> thinking<00:01:48.810> about

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
on them but what I'm thinking about

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.399 
on them but what I'm thinking about
doing<00:01:49.049> now<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.890> getting<00:01:50.310> some<00:01:50.790> sheet<00:01:51.090> metal

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
doing now is getting some sheet metal

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.170 
doing now is getting some sheet metal
and<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.740> attaching<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> from<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> bottom

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and just attaching it from the bottom

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.010 
and just attaching it from the bottom
all<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> way<00:01:54.600> up<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.079> top<00:01:55.549> use<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.020> side

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
all the way up to the top use the side

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.249 
all the way up to the top use the side
pieces<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.890> right<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.990> drill

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
pieces that are right here to drill

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.830 
pieces that are right here to drill
holes<00:02:01.469> through<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.310> pop<00:02:02.700> rivet<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.540> sheet

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
holes through and pop rivet the sheet

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.389 
holes through and pop rivet the sheet
metal<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.290> let<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> sheet<00:02:04.710> metal<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.159> went

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
metal and let the sheet metal all went

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.960 
metal and let the sheet metal all went
to<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.700> top<00:02:07.190> also<00:02:08.190> probably<00:02:08.580> what<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:08.819> going

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
to the top also probably what I'm going

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
to the top also probably what I'm going
to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.360> cut<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.750> piece<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.560> sheet

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to do is just cut one piece of sheet

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.900 
to do is just cut one piece of sheet
metal

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
metal

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.710 
metal
that<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.410> wrap<00:02:13.410> around<00:02:14.150> wrap<00:02:15.150> around<00:02:15.540> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
that will wrap around wrap around the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.210 
that will wrap around wrap around the
top<00:02:15.990> up<00:02:16.320> there<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:17.090> fold<00:02:18.090> down<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:19.350> either

top up there and fold down and on either
side<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.970> here<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.450> I'll<00:02:22.140> pop<00:02:22.950> rivet<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.490> to

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
side up here and I'll pop rivet it to
