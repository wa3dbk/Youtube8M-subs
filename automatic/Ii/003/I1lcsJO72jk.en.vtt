our door frame mounts I pre-measured

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.059 
our door frame mounts I pre-measured
from<00:00:06.089> each<00:00:06.330> side<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.080> door<00:00:07.259> frame<00:00:07.290> 8

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.580 
from each side of the door frame 8
inches<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:08.760> that'd<00:00:09.000> be<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> minimum<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:10.469> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
inches and that'd be a minimum from the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.070 
inches and that'd be a minimum from the
side<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.250> door<00:00:11.429> frame<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> center<00:00:12.870> of

side of the door frame to the center of
where<00:00:13.530> your<00:00:13.650> mount<00:00:13.860> wants<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.280> go<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.639> 8<00:00:15.000> inches

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
where your mount wants to go is 8 inches

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.000 
where your mount wants to go is 8 inches
it<00:00:15.599> could<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:16.020> more<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> had<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> bigger

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it could be more if you had a bigger

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.970 
it could be more if you had a bigger
frame<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.359> sighs<00:00:18.570> door<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.830> would

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
frame but on this sighs door that would

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.910 
frame but on this sighs door that would
be<00:00:20.100> our<00:00:20.250> minimum<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.689> measure<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
be our minimum and so you measure to the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
be our minimum and so you measure to the
center<00:00:23.600> hold<00:00:24.600> up<00:00:24.810> your<00:00:25.019> door<00:00:25.170> mount<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:27.289> you

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
center hold up your door mount and you

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.950 
center hold up your door mount and you
want<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.619> centered<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:30.179> door<00:00:30.390> frame<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
want it centered in your door frame in

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.229 
want it centered in your door frame in
the<00:00:31.230> width<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> frame<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.550> then<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.030> can

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
the width of the frame and then you can

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.410 
the width of the frame and then you can
mark<00:00:33.540> where<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.980> pre-drill<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
mark where you have to pre-drill for the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.500 
mark where you have to pre-drill for the
bolts<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.410> goes<00:00:37.739> there<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:39.300> goes<00:00:40.110> there

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
bolts one goes there and one goes there

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.110 
bolts one goes there and one goes there
drillbit<00:00:42.510> needs<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:44.219> size<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
drillbit needs to be the size of the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.319 
drillbit needs to be the size of the
shank<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> bolt<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> size<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
shank of the bolt not the size of the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.000 
shank of the bolt not the size of the
threads<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.110> then<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> threads<00:00:49.860> will

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
threads because then the threads will

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
threads because then the threads will
have<00:00:50.129> nothing<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.550> stick<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
have nothing to stick to so you the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
have nothing to stick to so you the
drill<00:00:52.530> bit<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.129> size<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> shank<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
drill bit is the size of the shank of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
drill bit is the size of the shank of
the<00:00:54.690> bolt<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> length<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.930> need<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the bolt the length that you need is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.729 
the bolt the length that you need is
about<00:00:59.430> half<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.149> length<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.960> total<00:01:01.500> drill

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
about half the length of my total drill

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.549 
about half the length of my total drill
bit<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> can<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.730> drill<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.539> half<00:01:04.049> way<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
bit so I can just drill in half way and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.240 
bit so I can just drill in half way and
I<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> go<00:01:05.960> okay<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.979> go<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
I should be good to go okay so you go to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
I should be good to go okay so you go to
set<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.760> mount<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.570> top<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.140> door

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.700 
set the mount on the top of the door
frame<00:01:10.610> you<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> set<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> name<00:01:13.409> tag

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
frame you want to set it so the name tag

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
frame you want to set it so the name tag
where<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> says<00:01:14.280> human<00:01:14.640> trainer<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
where it says human trainer is

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.929 
where it says human trainer is
perpendicular<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> top<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:17.700> door

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
perpendicular to the top of your door

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.590 
perpendicular to the top of your door
frame<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.380> when<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.430> hook<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
frame that way when you hook on the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.719 
frame that way when you hook on the
strap<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.600> actual<00:01:24.960> strap<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.650> facing<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
strap the actual strap is facing you and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.510 
strap the actual strap is facing you and
that's<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> way<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.840> using<00:01:28.200> you

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's the way you want to be using you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
that's the way you want to be using you
it<00:01:29.520> could<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.360> other<00:01:30.600> way<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it could be put on the other way it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.940 
it could be put on the other way it
still<00:01:31.799> works<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.280> way<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.930> optimal<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
still works that way but it's optimal to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.749 
still works that way but it's optimal to
have<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> nameplate<00:01:37.500> perpendicular<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
have the nameplate perpendicular to the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.480 
have the nameplate perpendicular to the
air<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.659> that's<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> way<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.710> mark<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
air so that's the way that I mark the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:53.289 
air so that's the way that I mark the
holes

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.109 

actually<00:01:54.299> install<00:01:54.780> our<00:01:55.159> mouths<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.970> there's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
actually install our mouths so there's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.080 
actually install our mouths so there's
two<00:01:57.299> washers<00:01:57.720> to<00:01:57.900> use<00:01:58.159> one<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> flat<00:01:59.610> washer

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
two washers to use one is a flat washer

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.480 
two washers to use one is a flat washer
and<00:02:00.409> one<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.799> bit<00:02:01.890> smaller<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
and one is a little bit smaller and

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.060 
and one is a little bit smaller and
that's<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.820> lock<00:02:03.030> washer<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> flat<00:02:04.590> washer

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's a lock washer so the flat washer

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.180 
that's a lock washer so the flat washer
would<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.700> first<00:02:06.030> up<00:02:06.299> against<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
would go first up against them out and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.410 
would go first up against them out and
then<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.030> lock<00:02:09.209> washer<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.130> bowl

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
then the lock washer and then the bowl

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:26.270 
then the lock washer and then the bowl
that's<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.600> assembly<00:02:24.140> flat<00:02:25.140> washer<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:26.100> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
that's the assembly flat washer then the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.220 
that's the assembly flat washer then the
small<00:02:26.519> lock<00:02:26.730> washer<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.900> head<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
small lock washer and the head of the

we're bolted into our door frame and the
reason<00:03:25.090> i<00:03:25.150> chose<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.630> door<00:03:25.780> afraid<00:03:26.080> to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
reason i chose the door afraid to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.500 
reason i chose the door afraid to
install<00:03:27.010> this<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.459> could<00:03:27.700> go<00:03:27.910> in<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> ceiling

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510
