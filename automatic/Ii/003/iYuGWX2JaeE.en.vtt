and it is a plant but what we know about

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.380 
and it is a plant but what we know about
plants<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:02.160> plant<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.699> green<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
plants like this plant is green and

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.479 
plants like this plant is green and
plants<00:01:04.379> are<00:01:04.470> green<00:01:04.619> because<00:01:04.979> their<00:01:05.159> photo

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
plants are green because their photo

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.950 
plants are green because their photo
site<00:01:05.729> photosynthesizing<00:01:06.720> they<00:01:06.810> have

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
site photosynthesizing they have

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
site photosynthesizing they have
chloroplasts<00:01:07.530> chlorophyll<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.520> they<00:01:09.119> catch

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
chloroplasts chlorophyll and they catch

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
chloroplasts chlorophyll and they catch
sunlight<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.869> they<00:01:09.960> turn<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.229> sugar<00:01:10.400> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
sunlight and they turn into sugar but

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.570 
sunlight and they turn into sugar but
daughter<00:01:11.960> doesn't<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.680> how<00:01:14.369> does

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
daughter doesn't have that how does

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640 
daughter doesn't have that how does
daughter<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.210> its<00:01:15.360> food<00:01:15.630> Michele<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
daughter get its food Michele the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
daughter get its food Michele the
daughter<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.369> does<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.479> wraps<00:01:18.750> itself

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
daughter what it does it wraps itself

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
daughter what it does it wraps itself
around<00:01:19.470> another<00:01:20.159> plant<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.060> way<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
around another plant so that way it

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
around another plant so that way it
could<00:01:22.080> feed<00:01:22.380> off<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.799> plant<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.909> much

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
could feed off this plant pretty much

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.109 
could feed off this plant pretty much
strangling<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.990> print<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.590> um<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:27.000> so

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
strangling in this print and um just so

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
strangling in this print and um just so
like<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.330> drink<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.750> juices<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.530> blood

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
like a drink as juices and it's blood

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.649 
like a drink as juices and it's blood
and<00:01:29.400> all<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.210> look<00:01:30.360> closely

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and all right here if you look closely

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499 
and all right here if you look closely
on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.829> edges<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.520> plant<00:01:32.880> its<00:01:33.150> teeth

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
on the edges of this plant its teeth

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
on the edges of this plant its teeth
we're<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.650> bison<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.400> another<00:01:35.700> plant<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
we're actually bison to another plant so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.300 
we're actually bison to another plant so
that<00:01:36.390> way<00:01:36.509> calf<00:01:36.750> eat<00:01:36.990> off<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.829> plant

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that way calf eat off of the other plant

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.170 
that way calf eat off of the other plant
so<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.780> kill<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.229> plant<00:01:40.490> if<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.850> too

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so it can kill this plant if it's too

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.440 
so it can kill this plant if it's too
wrapped<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:43.159> what<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> pretty<00:01:44.520> much<00:01:44.670> does<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
wrapped but what it pretty much does it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.420 
wrapped but what it pretty much does it
just<00:01:45.750> tries<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> stay<00:01:46.320> alive<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.619> its<00:01:46.920> own<00:01:47.100> from

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
just tries to stay alive on its own from

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.819 
just tries to stay alive on its own from
another<00:01:47.700> plant<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:49.020> interesting<00:01:49.500> most

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
another plant that's interesting most

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.770 
another plant that's interesting most
people<00:01:50.100> don't<00:01:50.189> even<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.640> there's<00:01:51.270> parasitic

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
people don't even know there's parasitic

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.210 
people don't even know there's parasitic
plants<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.140> didn't<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.530> either<00:01:52.740> until<00:01:53.070> one

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
plants I didn't know either until one

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.410 
plants I didn't know either until one
day<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> saw<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> thought<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.030> weed<00:01:54.240> eater

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
day I saw I thought of a weed eater

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.030 
day I saw I thought of a weed eater
string<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> ground

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.740 

and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.400> looked<00:01:59.730> it<00:01:59.850> up<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.150> I<00:02:00.240> found<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.630> that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
and I looked it up and I found out that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.000 
and I looked it up and I found out that
it's<00:02:00.930> actually<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.350> parasitic<00:02:02.190> plant<00:02:06.950> it's<00:02:07.950> a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
it's actually a parasitic plant it's a

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's actually a parasitic plant it's a
parasitic<00:02:08.310> plant<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.760> girls<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.180> ground

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
parasitic plant so girls on the ground

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.740 
parasitic plant so girls on the ground
there's<00:02:09.630> actually<00:02:10.170> time-lapse<00:02:11.060> video<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
there's actually time-lapse video on the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.960 
there's actually time-lapse video on the
web<00:02:13.070> where<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.310> see<00:02:14.520> come<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.880> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
web where you can see come out of the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.670 
web where you can see come out of the
ground<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.540> actually<00:02:15.720> moves<00:02:16.170> around<00:02:16.380> like

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
ground and it actually moves around like

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.930 
ground and it actually moves around like
a<00:02:16.710> little<00:02:16.950> snake<00:02:17.190> because<00:02:17.430> they<00:02:17.550> speeded<00:02:17.910> up

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
a little snake because they speeded up

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.550 
a little snake because they speeded up
things<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.420> moves<00:02:18.690> around<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.140> it's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
things so it moves around and it's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
things so it moves around and it's
trying<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.830> sense<00:02:20.070> gases<00:02:20.520> from<00:02:20.730> another<00:02:20.940> plant

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
trying to sense gases from another plant

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.370 
trying to sense gases from another plant
and<00:02:21.360> once<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> finds<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.870> plant<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.170> grows

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
and once it finds a plant it grows

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.650 
and once it finds a plant it grows
towards<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.920> plant<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.820> climbs<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.450> plant

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
towards that plant it climbs the plant

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.850 
towards that plant it climbs the plant
it<00:02:24.840> sticks<00:02:25.080> its<00:02:25.230> little<00:02:25.410> teeth<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.770> like

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it sticks its little teeth and like

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.230 
it sticks its little teeth and like
they'll<00:02:26.040> call<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:26.610> called<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.850> stereo

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
they'll call and get called a stereo

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.130 
they'll call and get called a stereo
austoria<00:02:27.720> they<00:02:28.350> look<00:02:28.500> better<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.090> um<00:02:30.140> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
austoria they look better and um and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.480 
austoria they look better and um and
then<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.440> drinks<00:02:31.710> the<00:02:31.770> plants<00:02:32.040> blood<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.400> a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
then it drinks the plants blood it's a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.310 
then it drinks the plants blood it's a
parasitic<00:02:32.910> plant<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.600> actually<00:02:33.810> hunts

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
parasitic plant and it actually hunts

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.110 
parasitic plant and it actually hunts
and<00:02:34.530> finds<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.920> plant<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.700> eats<00:02:35.850> it

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and finds a plant and then it eats it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.080 
and finds a plant and then it eats it
and<00:02:36.150> drinks<00:02:37.020> its<00:02:37.830> blood<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> found<00:02:38.910> its

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and drinks its blood and so it found its

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.020 
and drinks its blood and so it found its
little<00:02:39.270> way<00:02:39.470> into<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:41.100> ecological<00:02:41.850> web

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
little way into the ecological web

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.730 
little way into the ecological web
pretty<00:02:42.690> fascinating<00:02:43.500> way<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:45.740> pretty

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
pretty fascinating way to do it pretty

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.020 
pretty fascinating way to do it pretty
awesome<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.250> there's<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.430> lot<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> don't

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
awesome and there's a lot of it I don't

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.130 
awesome and there's a lot of it I don't
know<00:02:48.090> if<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.240> cameras<00:02:48.510> picking<00:02:48.690> it<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:48.930> but

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
know if the cameras picking it up but

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.180 
know if the cameras picking it up but
we're<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.160> patch<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:51.740> daughter<00:02:54.050> DoD<00:02:55.190> video

we're in a patch of daughter DoD video
diner<00:02:56.670> er<00:02:57.300> daughter<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.050> there's<00:02:58.200> native<00:02:58.590> and

non-native daughter here in California
and<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.890> know<00:03:02.130> parasitic<00:03:02.850> hunting<00:03:03.180> plant

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and now you know parasitic hunting plant

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.100 
and now you know parasitic hunting plant
crazy<00:03:04.350> Thank<00:03:04.770> You<00:03:04.830> Michelle
