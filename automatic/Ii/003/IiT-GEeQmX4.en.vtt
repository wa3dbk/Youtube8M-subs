00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.449
 hello everyone and welcome to retro 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.800
 well trainer today we bring you a video 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.890
 normal and current I bring you a video 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.410
 of the channel treated with pokemon or rather 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.160
 this video is an apology video a 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.740
 apology day some xx 099 for the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.449
 people who are xxl then down here 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.550
 from your YouTube channel that is also 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.780
 related to pokemon and thus for the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.610
 people who know a little bit about what the topic is 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.949
 it turns out that yesterday when we were 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.640
 doing the live green hopefully part 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.979
 8 if I'm not wrong if part 8 and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.659
 there was a moment in the kilometer I read 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.970
 called by phone and direct traction and 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:52.570
 I got a little bit of the joke it says 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.479
 that he was a pedophile because when 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.949
 It has to be a girl of 16 and it's good 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.570
 a little war that we have in the 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.150
 group of friends what happens is that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.010
 it went out of hand and many writers 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.199
 many people started commenting and saying 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.320
 comments and insulting a bit some 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.540
 let's say and of course and I did not at the time 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.740
 I thought I did not think of a plan to criticize her and 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.530
 see how to name cabinets we see the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.299
 group of our friends 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.850
 it went a lot out of hand and from here 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.040
 who sends an apology to the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.540
 one hundred percent truth one will not be expected 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 that went so much out of hand and I 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.450
 I regretted a lot at the end of the night 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.940
 when I finish the live because I know that you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 he sat badly I know that then what you do not have 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.640
 to have said nothing about that then 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 they started with the anthem and so on 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.430
 people who know it and it has never been good 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.210
 apologizing has never been good to 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.220
 Petter a little idea and as we say 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 18 years ago and the girls I think 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 I had 16 well to prove that it does not happen 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 nothing that we were going with relationships that are 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.860
 more beasts let's say and with that are the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.630
 most beautiful in the world today for 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.190
 excuse me they do not exist and I know they bring me 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.850
 a boxing that has nothing to do with 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:03.020
 PokÃ©mon eat in a boxing 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.530
 titanic nations of titanic tanis the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.140
 special version of two discs I bought it 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.789
 bought today 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.440
 which also includes our wind 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.500
 finished alternative function is the 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.840
 best edition exists now and 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.910
 remember that for the people who are the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.200
 only one that has not seen it is the same is a 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.420
 relationship between a boy who is called 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.810
 jack that has the jack list that has 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.910
 23 years old and rose that has 17 the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.209
 age difference apart is the greatest is 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.760
 of 4 years 90 are 23 years old having to 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.440
 said 17 aggravation 6 years that is 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.390
 a much more beast relationship them 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.950
 minor but also now that 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.010
 it seems the most beautiful romantic movie 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.420
 the same film may be the best 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.640
 movie that exists is the same movie 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.260
 that I 've seen two hundred thousand times and 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.760
 now they bring a boxing this channel is 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.280
 pokemon apart from that they will excuse me 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.930
 is from pokemon and if not content with the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.260
 people insult me that I also know 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.260
 so 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.080
 already this video has contents of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.260
 pokemon boxing as you see here is the 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.940
 movie we do not have anything well shared 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.520
 seen the back cover that you already have 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.460
 parapente pica 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:18.840
 boxing and you shut up like he says 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.840
 as the house says I'm so sorry 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.640
 let the father take the clock 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.640
 because right now I can not 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.770
 boxing 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:40.520
 and two discs besides well here in our 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.770
 store has an avatar role of the 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.640
 buy plants but that has nothing not 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.020
 there is nothing else has more than what here 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.600
 has the first disc 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.040
 what is the movie no movie part 2 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.390
 with 3 additional there are two parts 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.010
 movie ok of view the movie part 1 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.570
 I do not understand this, so they went through 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.240
 the attic with one pull all with two discs 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.240
 How strong does it seem good to him here? 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.680
 is this this is the titanic movie 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.630
 part 1 part of which extractions 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.640
 eliminated I suppose it also came 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.210
 for here I will put a comment to 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.210
 the proponents 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.570
 nothing else provided for the one who has 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.620
 comments from the director and several others 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.850
 things that you do not know about the movie 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:33.820
 original that is already and now the movie 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:36.400
 titanic and 99 I hope the writers 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.410
 also said things yesterday about 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.690
 moon and now apologizing the comments 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.930
 because the truth is we do not spend much 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.930
 as well 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:55.480
 many more things to subscribe because it is 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.500
 my friend and that I know that happens to me and of 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.450
 busy life from here but that 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.250
 also to you documentaries all 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.419
 it's already titanic to see so 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.700
 I always tell them they liked this 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.050
 subscribe video for more time because 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.110
 it makes very little sense because if not the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.110
 people 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.910
 and the next one until next time
