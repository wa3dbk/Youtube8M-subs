00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.600
 hi to all the guys in this video 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.570
 I'll show you how to level up i 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.300
 your pokémon without using 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.730
 rare candies I make you immediately present 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.180
 which is a somewhat lengthy procedure though 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.600
 it works great then as you see me 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.990
 I find myself the pokémon pension and how to 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.510
 first thing 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:35.270
 decide to entrust a pokémon to the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.270
 pension here decide which type this 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.230
 and now 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:01:00.510
 now that we have entrusted it we must 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:07.950
 bring us to lu minopoli and you all know 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:13.140
 where and more precisely to the tower 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 prisma here is the super cool animation 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:29.150
 flight and here we are 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:36.450
 and here is the prism tower now you see 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:39.830
 you must put yourself in a position there 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 allow to run around the square 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.590
 without bumping into anyone you see 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.380
 as I do 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.090
 this because because the pokémon alla 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.119
 board 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.539
 they level up based on how much 1 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:03.479
 walk in the game understand and then if ad 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:05.819
 example let go that is continue 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.490
 to do this around for example 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.160
 whole night and the next morning go 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.290
 at the pokemon pension you can see 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.100
 that your pokémon have risen by a 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:25.350
 casino I'm not fucking with you 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:28.770
 which is for example my hook and to 79 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.819
 I had left the pension when he was 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.030
 still at 60 I let it go for 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:40.770
 one night and to it ritual in 79 and 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.810
 obviously you will ask me how to do it 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.560
 to make him go all night because 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.959
 obviously we won't break the fuck of 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.650
 hold down then just simply 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.049
 that you take a tool something from 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.730
 place on the button of the ds and that 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.370
 so let it go 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.599
 and also without your need ie 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.090
 without you rewarding, in short, I have 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.599
 done so like for example I put a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.840
 dictionary on the button of the movement 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.459
 and I let him go for a night e 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.920
 the next morning I returned to the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:25.620
 board the gaucho rose to 79 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.299
 this method is highly recommended for 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:33.900
 those who have not slammed it 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:37.170
 train their pokemon and then 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.379
 I hope I have been helpful 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.569
 see you in the next video and hello e 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.569
