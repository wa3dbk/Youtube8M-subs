00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
than he did he would have looked like an

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.570 
than he did he would have looked like an
n64<00:00:18.270> character<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> sprites<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.430> all

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
n64 character like a sprites just all

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.429 
n64 character like a sprites just all
polygons<00:00:21.119> yeah<00:00:21.330> all<00:00:21.449> polygons<00:00:21.900> he's<00:00:22.020> facing

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
polygons yeah all polygons he's facing

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.560 
polygons yeah all polygons he's facing
four<00:00:22.529> Sergey<00:00:22.800> Mario<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.699> he<00:00:23.880> himself<00:00:24.090> looked

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
four Sergey Mario but he himself looked

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.990 
four Sergey Mario but he himself looked
incredible<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.050> think<00:00:25.080> what<00:00:25.380> helped<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.310> lot

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
incredible I think what helped was a lot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.880 
incredible I think what helped was a lot
of<00:00:27.090> time<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.539> see<00:00:27.720> him<00:00:27.930> from<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
of time you would see him from the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.560 
of time you would see him from the
ground<00:00:29.160> perspective<00:00:29.340> or<00:00:29.880> where<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> humans

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
ground perspective or where the humans

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.939 
ground perspective or where the humans
were<00:00:30.630> standing<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.500> wasn't<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.769> lot<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
were standing like there wasn't a lot of

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310 
were standing like there wasn't a lot of
until<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> end<00:00:32.550> shots<00:00:33.480> where<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.840> pull<00:00:34.079> right

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
until the end shots where you pull right

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.620 
until the end shots where you pull right
back<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:34.890> see<00:00:35.130> him<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.480> got<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
back and you see him so you really got a

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.510 
back and you see him so you really got a
sense<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:37.020> scale<00:00:37.140> yep<00:00:37.770> yeah<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.219> he<00:00:38.370> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
sense of scale yep yeah like he is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.030 
sense of scale yep yeah like he is
enormous<00:00:39.059> uh-huh<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> other

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
enormous uh-huh like in the other

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.069 
enormous uh-huh like in the other
Godzilla<00:00:41.430> who<00:00:41.489> seemed<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.760> change<00:00:42.000> size<00:00:42.360> he

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Godzilla who seemed to change size he

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.630 
Godzilla who seemed to change size he
did<00:00:43.320> yeah<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> he<00:00:43.829> probably<00:00:44.010> didn't<00:00:44.430> change

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
did yeah and he probably didn't change

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.979 
did yeah and he probably didn't change
size<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> felt<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.480> way<00:00:45.750> because

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
size but it felt that way because

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
size but it felt that way because
sometimes<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:46.950> pull<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.280> back<00:00:47.430> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
sometimes they pull right back and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.920 
sometimes they pull right back and
sometimes<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.300> sometimes<00:00:48.629> he's<00:00:48.780> right

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
sometimes is in and sometimes he's right

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
sometimes is in and sometimes he's right

I<00:01:05.729> didn't<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.360> design<00:01:06.689> was<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
I didn't think that design was that

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.740 
I didn't think that design was that
interesting<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.770> them<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> monster<00:01:08.909> but<00:01:09.720> I

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
interesting of them on the monster but I

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.270 
interesting of them on the monster but I
privately<00:01:10.229> he<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.470> less<00:01:10.680> impressive<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
privately he was less impressive that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.770 
privately he was less impressive that
yeah<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.820> guess<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> idea<00:01:12.299> he

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
yeah but I guess that's the idea he

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.880 
yeah but I guess that's the idea he
struck<00:01:13.049> me<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.290> combination<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
struck me as a combination of the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.300 
struck me as a combination of the
Cloverfield<00:01:14.400> monster<00:01:14.490> yeah<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:16.189> well<00:01:17.189> we've

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
Cloverfield monster yeah and well we've

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
Cloverfield monster yeah and well we've
just<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.610> Pacific<00:01:17.970> Rim<00:01:18.180> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.650> was

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
just at Pacific Rim we have and it was

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
just at Pacific Rim we have and it was
odd<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.189> thought<00:01:20.420> that<00:01:21.420> he<00:01:21.750> had<00:01:21.900> an

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
odd I thought that he had an

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.429 
odd I thought that he had an
electromagnetic<00:01:22.770> pulse<00:01:22.950> weapon<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.439> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
electromagnetic pulse weapon and that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.960 
electromagnetic pulse weapon and that
was<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> huge<00:01:25.890> plot<00:01:26.070> point<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> last<00:01:26.640> one

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
was a huge plot point of the last one

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.670 
was a huge plot point of the last one
yeah<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.540> Pacific<00:01:27.960> Rim<00:01:28.140> yeah<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
yeah of Pacific Rim yeah one of the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.170 
yeah of Pacific Rim yeah one of the
monsters<00:01:29.040> developed<00:01:29.400> an<00:01:29.490> electromagnetic

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
monsters developed an electromagnetic

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.880 
monsters developed an electromagnetic
pulse<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.630> right<00:01:30.930> yeah<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.710> exactly

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
pulse that's right yeah that's exactly

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.980 
pulse that's right yeah that's exactly
and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.520> did<00:01:32.670> discuss<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.630> don't

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and I think we did discuss this I don't

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
and I think we did discuss this I don't
you<00:01:34.049> gonna<00:01:34.170> say<00:01:34.350> yeah<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.220> first<00:01:35.520> it's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you gonna say yeah it's the first it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.289 
you gonna say yeah it's the first it's
one<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> first<00:01:36.600> movies<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.229> where

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
one of the first movies I think where

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
one of the first movies I think where
somebody<00:01:39.299> hasn't<00:01:39.509> employed<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:40.140> employed<00:01:40.409> an

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
somebody hasn't employed has employed an

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.340 
somebody hasn't employed has employed an
EMP<00:01:41.070> yeah<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.729> nobody<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:42.720> had<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> explain

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
EMP yeah and nobody has had to explain

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.800 
EMP yeah and nobody has had to explain
to<00:01:43.590> us<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.159> dum-dum<00:01:44.700> audience<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.299> an<00:01:45.420> EMP

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
to us the dum-dum audience what an EMP

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.649 
to us the dum-dum audience what an EMP
is<00:01:45.840> yeah<00:01:46.320> oh<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.950> an<00:01:47.040> Electra<00:01:47.509> mental<00:01:48.509> echt

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is yeah oh it's an Electra mental echt

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
is yeah oh it's an Electra mental echt
romantic<00:01:49.079> pulse<00:01:49.290> within<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> certain<00:01:49.979> radius

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
romantic pulse within a certain radius

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
romantic pulse within a certain radius
is<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.640> radius<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.360> disrupts<00:01:51.840> all

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is the radius that disrupts all

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.080 
is the radius that disrupts all
electronic<00:01:52.530> devices<00:01:52.560> within<00:01:53.220> us<00:01:53.549> oh<00:01:53.729> no<00:01:53.790> right

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
electronic devices within us oh no right

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.850 
electronic devices within us oh no right
right<00:01:54.119> you're<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.110> may<00:01:55.290> would<00:01:55.500> lose<00:01:55.710> all

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
right you're that one may would lose all

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.010 
right you're that one may would lose all
the<00:01:56.040> computers<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.640> communication<00:01:57.420> yeah<00:01:57.570> yes

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
the computers and communication yeah yes

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
the computers and communication yeah yes
that's<00:01:58.200> why<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> problem<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.009> us<00:01:59.250> yes<00:01:59.700> we

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that's why it's a problem for us yes we

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.200 
that's why it's a problem for us yes we
know<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.990> we<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.950> thing<00:02:02.219> now<00:02:02.250> we

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
know it we know that's a thing now we

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
know it we know that's a thing now we
know<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.930> does<00:02:04.110> because<00:02:04.619> we've

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
know that's what it does because we've

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.069 
know that's what it does because we've
seen<00:02:05.460> dozens<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.030> movies<00:02:06.390> well<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
seen dozens of movies well I think the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
seen dozens of movies well I think the
first<00:02:07.290> time<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:07.680> exposed<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.550> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
first time I was exposed to that in a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.119 
first time I was exposed to that in a
movie<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.090> Ocean's<00:02:09.479> eleven<00:02:09.929> yep<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.830> went

movie with Ocean's eleven yep and I went
I<00:02:11.310> immediately<00:02:11.700> get<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.209> yeah

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
I immediately get that yeah

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.510 
I immediately get that yeah
I'll<00:02:12.959> never<00:02:13.500> need<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.830> have<00:02:14.100> that<00:02:14.190> explained

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
I'll never need to have that explained

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.610 
I'll never need to have that explained
to<00:02:14.610> me<00:02:14.730> ever<00:02:14.850> again<00:02:15.420> if<00:02:16.319> they're<00:02:16.440> going<00:02:16.560> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
to me ever again if they're going to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.140 
to me ever again if they're going to
explain<00:02:16.920> an<00:02:17.069> EMP<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.550> movie<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:18.000> should

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
explain an EMP in a movie they should

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.400 
explain an EMP in a movie they should
say<00:02:18.300> look<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.660> an<00:02:18.780> electromagnetic<00:02:19.319> pulse

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
say look it's an electromagnetic pulse

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.800 
say look it's an electromagnetic pulse
and<00:02:19.740> it<00:02:19.980> shuts<00:02:20.550> down<00:02:20.640> computer<00:02:21.060> systems<00:02:21.390> like

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
and it shuts down computer systems like

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.780 
and it shuts down computer systems like
in<00:02:21.840> all<00:02:22.140> those<00:02:22.350> movies<00:02:22.590> you've<00:02:22.980> seen<00:02:23.250> where

in all those movies you've seen where
somebody<00:02:24.150> uses<00:02:24.450> an<00:02:24.540> EMP<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> people

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
somebody uses an EMP and then the people

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.620 
somebody uses an EMP and then the people
in<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.040> movie<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.400> go<00:02:26.520> oh<00:02:26.730> that's<00:02:27.090> right<00:02:27.420> I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630

caused our extinction right we get it
yeah<00:02:57.630> we<00:02:57.870> see<00:02:58.110> how<00:02:58.769> much<00:02:58.890> damage<00:02:59.180> three

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
yeah we see how much damage three

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.960 
yeah we see how much damage three
monsters<00:03:00.630> can<00:03:00.810> do<00:03:00.959> yeah<00:03:01.459> we<00:03:02.459> know<00:03:02.640> we've<00:03:02.819> seen

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
monsters can do yeah we know we've seen

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.820 
monsters can do yeah we know we've seen
aliens<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:03.660> know<00:03:03.780> what<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> nest<00:03:04.319> of<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.680> know

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
aliens we know what a nest of we know

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.680 
aliens we know what a nest of we know
what<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.980> mess<00:03:05.130> once<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.790> we<00:03:06.209> know<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.600> if

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
what a mess once it is we know that if

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.580 
what a mess once it is we know that if
there<00:03:06.870> were<00:03:06.930> hundreds<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.350> them<00:03:07.470> they

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
there were hundreds of them they

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.650 
there were hundreds of them they
probably<00:03:07.769> destroy<00:03:08.370> us<00:03:08.519> all<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.480> we

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
probably destroy us all so we get it we

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.779 
what I thought that was good where we
physics<00:04:46.500> took<00:04:46.650> effect<00:04:47.009> where<00:04:47.190> he<00:04:47.280> got<00:04:47.400> out<00:04:47.580> he

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
physics took effect where he got out he

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.879 
physics took effect where he got out he
came<00:04:48.240> out<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.509> the<00:04:48.569> ocean<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.590> calls<00:04:49.770> a

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
came out of the ocean and it calls a

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.760 
came out of the ocean and it calls a
title<00:04:50.220> one<00:04:50.370> yeah<00:04:50.580> but<00:04:51.020> it<00:04:52.020> was<00:04:52.199> interesting<00:04:52.650> I

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
title one yeah but it was interesting I

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.400 
title one yeah but it was interesting I
thought<00:04:52.800> that<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:54.030> little<00:04:54.330> girl<00:04:54.630> sees<00:04:54.990> that

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
thought that the little girl sees that

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.839 
thought that the little girl sees that
the<00:04:55.620> monsters<00:04:56.039> you<00:04:56.069> know<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.400> Godzilla's

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
the monsters you know the Godzilla's

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:00.110 
the monsters you know the Godzilla's
arriving<00:04:57.360> yeah<00:04:57.720> they<00:04:58.319> her<00:04:58.650> mom<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.490> dad<00:04:59.639> run

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
arriving yeah they her mom and dad run

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.059 
arriving yeah they her mom and dad run
away<00:05:00.389> yeah<00:05:00.840> they<00:05:01.080> get<00:05:01.289> in<00:05:01.349> like<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.650> hope<00:05:01.919> they

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:02.069 
away yeah they get in like a hope they

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.800 
away yeah they get in like a hope they
get<00:05:02.190> in<00:05:02.340> like<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.520> store<00:05:02.880> they<00:05:03.090> close<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.569> door

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
get in like a store they close the door

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.659 
get in like a store they close the door
and<00:05:04.050> then<00:05:04.380> we<00:05:04.470> just<00:05:04.620> see<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.860> tidal<00:05:05.310> wave<00:05:05.460> just

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
and then we just see the tidal wave just

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.240 
and then we just see the tidal wave just
batter<00:05:06.449> hundreds<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.229> people<00:05:07.530> presumably<00:05:08.039> to

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
batter hundreds of people presumably to

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.279 
batter hundreds of people presumably to
death<00:05:08.490> like<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.360> there's<00:05:09.720> no<00:05:09.900> way<00:05:10.110> always

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
death like you there's no way always

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:12.710 
death like you there's no way always
been<00:05:10.590> like<00:05:10.800> you<00:05:10.889> know<00:05:10.919> this<00:05:11.490> swooshes<00:05:12.449> past

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
been like you know this swooshes past

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.260 
been like you know this swooshes past
this<00:05:12.990> tidal<00:05:13.229> wave<00:05:13.380> just<00:05:14.099> and<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.669> gathers

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
this tidal wave just and it just gathers

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.480 
this tidal wave just and it just gathers
hundreds<00:05:15.720> of<00:05:15.810> people<00:05:16.110> up<00:05:16.199> in<00:05:16.319> its<00:05:16.440> wake<00:05:16.680> they

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
hundreds of people up in its wake they

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.939 
hundreds of people up in its wake they
alter<00:05:17.849> round<00:05:18.060> or<00:05:18.389> crush<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.960> death<00:05:19.199> there's<00:05:19.710> no

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
alter round or crush to death there's no

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.980 
alter round or crush to death there's no

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
has sort of an atomic fire laser breath

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.580 
has sort of an atomic fire laser breath
yeah<00:05:38.880> like<00:05:39.389> that's<00:05:39.599> an<00:05:39.719> iconic<00:05:40.050> part<00:05:40.320> of<00:05:40.440> him

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
yeah like that's an iconic part of him

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.510 
all the spines on his back light up yeah
and<00:05:42.870> then<00:05:42.960> he<00:05:42.990> breathes<00:05:43.320> this<00:05:43.530> fire<00:05:43.830> yeah<00:05:44.280> and

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
and then he breathes this fire yeah and

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.170 
and then he breathes this fire yeah and
in<00:05:45.000> the<00:05:45.419> 1998<00:05:46.080> Godzilla<00:05:46.669> we<00:05:47.669> were<00:05:47.820> sort<00:05:48.120> of

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
in the 1998 Godzilla we were sort of

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.879 
in the 1998 Godzilla we were sort of
probably<00:05:48.599> seeing<00:05:48.840> breathe<00:05:49.199> fire<00:05:49.560> in<00:05:49.800> the

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
probably seeing breathe fire in the

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.469 
probably seeing breathe fire in the
trailer<00:05:50.250> yeah<00:05:50.699> and<00:05:50.849> then<00:05:50.940> when<00:05:51.060> we<00:05:51.120> go<00:05:51.270> in

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
trailer yeah and then when we go in

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.620 
trailer yeah and then when we go in
there's<00:05:51.990> no<00:05:52.199> fire<00:05:52.469> breath<00:05:52.770> he<00:05:53.250> just<00:05:53.630> screams

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:54.630

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
really hard near a gas main and it

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
does it I think next time if they do a

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:20.899 
does it I think next time if they do a
sequel<00:06:20.039> they're<00:06:20.159> gonna<00:06:20.250> have<00:06:20.430> to<00:06:20.460> speed<00:06:20.759> that

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
sequel they're gonna have to speed that

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:23.390 
sequel they're gonna have to speed that
up<00:06:21.110> because<00:06:22.110> they've<00:06:22.440> now<00:06:22.650> revealed<00:06:23.130> what<00:06:23.370> he

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
up because they've now revealed what he

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.459 
up because they've now revealed what he
can<00:06:23.639> do<00:06:23.819> and<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.599> battles<00:06:24.900> or<00:06:25.020> whatever<00:06:25.259> and
