 he said he takes them to Hindu to be in 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.930
 the finals of the urba top 14 taking in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.639
 account that there are highs or lows all 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.550
 teams suffer them but what formula 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.730
 use hindus to get here I think 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.789
 what 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.160
 is a way of trying to play is a 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.840
 way of trying to pose a game of 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.119
 rugby that with the continuity and the desire 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.169
 of passes with very large commitments to 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.160
 base of players the truth that is 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.410
 keeps because there are guys with 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.270
 experience and boy more guys that he 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.250
 they are always coupled well because 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.110
 well there will be the first know what 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.390
 we do and when they come they try 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.150
 do it I think the defense that we have 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.530
 is the best we have and maybe the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:45.309
 top 14 I saw and play the ball well 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 let's say the third line and talk and not 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.280
 come here let's go forward we have 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.010
 anthony de la vega that has Cuba for 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.870
 be in the finals of the urba top 14 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.750
 eggs 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:03.640
 how you live the week prior to these 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.409
 decisive matches quiet of 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.320
 lash out at madness when you start 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.759
 difficult match sometimes now that is a 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.020
 nice week just to be in the club 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.550
 of the people is like crazy everything you 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.680
 greet you congratulate you have to try a 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.750
 little bit of controlling that madness and I 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.550
 table the game pressed after game 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
 shortly before, wait for the weather is the weather 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.560
 It is the best climate I ever lived in my life 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.899
 this week first final action the area 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.290
 more my life and I think it's going to be even 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:34.929
 higher 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:37.360
 I think I can not say who is squid 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.580
 calamaro is a spongebob character 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.130
 I am told that I am not like 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.649
 I understand why but good half of 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.200
 the guys how we spent it in the night 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:52.240
 prior to matches of this importance 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:54.610
 I usually have a good time not only sleeping like that 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.560
 that I can sleep for my quiet that the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.210
 party is counted at 80 minutes is not 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.409
 play in bed at home so I 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.000
 I slept peacefully knowing that I'm not going there 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.950
 to be able to do anything if not here in the 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.259
 court where you can be all sleep 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 very much very much I sleep comfortably if not 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.950
 closes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.709
 nothing or very quiet in support of my 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.670
 friends that speaks to me distracts me a little 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.060
 we sleep all together the grace we 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.530
 helped playing the playstation to the trick 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.080
 so by the way we reassure between 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.440
 all yesterday fifteen there was a little bit of 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.840
 I wanted to see the movie troll but 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.070
 I did not hooked anything I fell asleep to 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.750
 One and a half I took the guitar a little 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.820
 and I slept like a little angel until the tenth 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.680
 and the truth that thank God no no 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.210
 better the match before and I sleep a lot 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.160
 I also got up and I realized 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.110
 I had to play 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.700
 to 15 that break it for 80 minutes a 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.300
 little with changes who break 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300
 in the third time 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.579
 the tone was very good and it was a great 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.010
 value but now he's not living much 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.650
 and nothing 90 goes very well all the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.540
 camera 93 the one that breaks it third time 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.299
 reach stones you do not know what it is 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.299
 but broken and nothing is the show of the party 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.069
 in German and in German it's time 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 and
