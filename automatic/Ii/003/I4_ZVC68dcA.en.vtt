00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.120
 that's why they had 126 and they were 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.749
 I will be showing another mode more than 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.329
 minecraft today we have the necropsy 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.730
 that allows you to make your own 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:17.280
 slave soldiers with preferences 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.550
 the monsters made of parts of the 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.030
 mobiles that are in the game good this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.860
 mode can have several things that 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.150
 there was the game for example we have 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.420
 this altar to make creations 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:37.170
 then we have the needle 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.980
 look at the needle nails that reminds a lot 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.280
 pure billy bone and mandy voice 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.980
 then we have 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.610
 the blood bottle that contains blood 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.570
 of demos in other ways the bottle of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.870
 soul that has 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.150
 the soul of said love and the necronomicon 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.040
 or book of the dead good let's start 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.680
 let us begin 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.879
 let's start like as kraft and har 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.060
 things 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.979
 well here we have the needle come on 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.780
 we grab juicy ground and put it there 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:20.030
 just and there we take out a needle 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.560
 now what we need for this would come 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.390
 to be the voice 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.510
 we need 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.240
 with what will be done on the earth the job 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.940
 locks and jan to draw a jar of 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.430
 blood well should show a thing like 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.730
 how good blood is made 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.240
 we need to click on a mode with a 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.030
 needle we see ibex blood forms 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.150
 but now you have to have a bottle of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.950
 glass in our environmental we see them and 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.659
 it is filling with blood 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.659
 we already have 6 well 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:02.030
 we grab the blood we hold craft 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.360
 We went a few sticks we put the sticks 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.080
 we grab the blood we look for a blockade 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.080
 follow 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.730
 if it is not very good we put the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.330
 obsidian 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:23.650
 and we put is to create the osx 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.960
 in the ready pump we have good sides 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.840
 Now what good is the good voice for us? 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.740
 to get the soul of the mods that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.200
 let's kill we will also need the 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.830
 bottles do not forget do not forget is 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.830
 very important 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.230
 we bring a mod and we hit it up 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.490
 kill him this there is half his soul like 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.490
 come on let's go again 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.569
 2 2 and 3 dead and he gave me again his 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.390
 soul 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.990
 we 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.930
 let's get more soul 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.830
 well we have soul now that we need 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.510
 a necronomicon or book of the dead 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.950
 finish the recipe we need a book 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.410
 leather ink sack do not get blood 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.910
 a pen and a fridge be going to 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.940
 start are four memories the tips 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.540
 the ink 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.319
 to be 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:32.220
 the pen the blood bottle 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.100
 and obviously 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.040
 book that we do not need in the middle 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.740
 to create a book of the dead 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.310
 very clear we have 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:47.610
 now what is next in our 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.990
 our step to be the altar well we have 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.660
 two stone 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.060
 and one of wooden boards of any 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.310
 material we do not squeeze let's do more 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.800
 so and we press right button on the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.800
 wood with the book of the dead is 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.480
 became a high 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.790
 Now the important thing is to create a mini 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.420
 mixed let's end up lose lots 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:18.030
 right and we will show this interface 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:21.139
 good and right to go soul and 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.879
 on the left would be the blood 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.630
 now we have a pretty subject 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:27.550
 interesting 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.190
 because look at this 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.660
 each of these things represents a 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.780
 bug powder represents crime 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:42.310
 the bones to the skeleton and the thread to the 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.590
 alania and the rotten meat to the zombie we go 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.430
 to put together our own I'm going to put 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.430
 body the keeper 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:55.840
 spider head skeleton legs and 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.840
 arms of 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.169
 the succession and we are 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.550
 but in a minute like you can see there 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.040
 is showing us how it is 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.530
 Now we have to do what you feel 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.190
 we speak shift or the button that they have 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.090
 to bend down and right button to 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.670
 invoke our servant 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:26.470
 we can put this one that feels 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:29.810
 he is sitting supposedly sitting well 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.590
 And if not, do not follow 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.280
 I was not following look 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.280
 we go 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.129
 Now let's see an advantage of having 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.770
 a child 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:44.490
 we are hypothetically looking for us 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:48.150
 is attacking another mode 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:52.950
 like for example a zombie 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:56.310
 let's see the zombie and our plane comes and 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.980
 what is going to be very good is going to be called 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.040
 juan our friend juan very well juan 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.170
 cristian good that was basically everything 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.860
