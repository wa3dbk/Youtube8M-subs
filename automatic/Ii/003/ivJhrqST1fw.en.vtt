00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
it's important to work not chip to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.479 
it's important to work not chip to
understanding<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> punching<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:05.950> kicking

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
it's got to make sure knowing no way of

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.250 
it's got to make sure knowing no way of
this<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.150> much<00:03:10.300> work<00:03:10.600> something<00:03:10.959> you<00:03:11.080> do

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
this so much work something you do

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:21.410 
this so much work something you do
something<00:03:11.440> together<00:03:11.680> one<00:03:12.100> again<00:03:12.630> keep<00:03:13.980> coming

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.430 

so<00:03:22.420> when<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.690> walk<00:03:22.900> like<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.230> you're<00:03:23.350> gonna

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
so when you walk like this you're gonna

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.560 
so when you walk like this you're gonna
have<00:03:23.560> a<00:03:23.590> lot<00:03:23.830> of<00:03:23.950> movement<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.760> lot<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.269> fun<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
have a lot of movement a lot of fun a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.990 
have a lot of movement a lot of fun a
lot<00:03:25.720> of<00:03:25.870> exercise<00:03:26.410> out<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.769> moment<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.250> you

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
lot of exercise out of moment that you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.820 
lot of exercise out of moment that you
want<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.360> do<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:29.049> you<00:03:29.200> got<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.440> express

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
want to do but you got to express

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.190 
want to do but you got to express
yourself<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:30.700> they<00:03:30.910> can<00:03:31.120> making<00:03:31.450> little<00:03:31.989> more

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
yourself so they can making little more

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.140 
yourself so they can making little more
interesting<00:03:33.160> when<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:33.400> work<00:03:33.580> together<00:03:33.730> and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
interesting when you work together and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.210 
interesting when you work together and
when<00:03:34.780> you're<00:03:34.900> working<00:03:35.200> like<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.920> can<00:03:36.100> do

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
when you're working like that you can do

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.860 
when you're working like that you can do
it<00:03:36.310> long<00:03:36.580> what<00:03:36.700> you<00:03:36.820> want<00:03:37.000> okay<00:03:37.420> getting<00:03:37.750> the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
right and then you swap for instant

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.850 
right and then you swap for instant
you're<00:03:39.910> under<00:03:40.180> people<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.959> other<00:03:41.140> side

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
you're under people to the other side

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.070 
you're under people to the other side
can<00:03:42.070> do<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.549> other<00:03:42.580> side<00:03:42.940> rest<00:03:43.180> but

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
can do it and the other side rest but

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.479 
can do it and the other side rest but
later<00:03:44.320> on<00:03:44.500> when<00:03:44.680> you<00:03:44.769> started<00:03:45.070> getting<00:03:45.160> quite

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
later on when you started getting quite

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.270 
later on when you started getting quite
good<00:03:45.519> at<00:03:45.760> this<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.390> two<00:03:46.660> can<00:03:46.840> work<00:03:46.989> together

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
good at this you two can work together

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.759 
good at this you two can work together
to<00:03:48.280> make<00:03:48.459> sure<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.700> movement<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.299> be<00:03:49.360> right

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
to make sure the movement can be right

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.160 
to make sure the movement can be right
spend<00:03:50.769> little<00:03:50.950> bit<00:03:51.100> time<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.970> practice<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.720> will

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
spend little bit time to practice I will

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.489 
spend little bit time to practice I will
see<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.560> until<00:03:53.890> next<00:03:53.950> lesson
