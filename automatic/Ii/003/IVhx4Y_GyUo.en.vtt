00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.330
 after the victory in the first leg of the 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.830
 quarterfinals of the king's cup the 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.400
 Real Madrid captain iker boxes 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.510
 analyzed if the match against Valencia 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.190
 I think we have to be almost a 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.600
 difficult match ourselves 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.519
 let's cheat like this building the 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.840
 Valencia plays well has had its 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.190
 occasions or we have also had the 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.250
 ours that we are going to sentence even 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.570
 with Christian proclamation in the last in 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.760
 the last minutes but it's fine 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.560
 back and good to know that the match of 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.420
 turn will be difficult I do not think that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.130
 we have achieved one thing our favor 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.810
 that is to leave the goal to zero points 0 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 it's a good result but before a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.899
 valence as shown in the 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.690
 bernabéu because I think you can not 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.360
 relax and just the opposite do not think about 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.880
 that the return is going to be difficult that is 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.230
 that you have to clench your teeth too 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.880
 a good arbitration apart from muñiz 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.829
 fernandez I do not think there has been 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.899
 yellow for both teams 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.700
 missing decisions but in general I think 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.600
 that has been a game of much shock 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:58.300
 of a lot of physicist and I think that both of 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.620
 valencia for their interests not as 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.270
 we look at all 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.640
 we have also left a 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.040
 couple of days of much controversy 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.570
 now it also touches the same at the end 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.670
 well then let's hope that the whole balance 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.310
 sign up for all teams and that 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.560
 somehow 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.060
 do not feel hurt the next 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.159
 Wednesday will be when you decide what 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.869
 team passes semifinals but the real 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.829
 Madrid will travel to Valencia with the advantage 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.850
 of 2-0 in the first leg if the 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:26.619
 home game I think what 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.560
 important was not to fit goals I think that 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.450
 we have had a pretty good result 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.799
 but we know that Valencia is a 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.869
 difficult team that has planted us face 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.850
 here at santiago bernabéu and I'm 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.579
 convinced that the return is going to be 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.170
 very very complicated and we will have to 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.250
 surely you have to suffer but what 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.399
 important is that we have reaped a 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.560
 match and the result very optimal and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.789
 let's go with the whole joy event 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.709
 what can this tie go through? 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.569
 I think for ourselves by the 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.770
 players that we went this team for the 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.240
 hobby that we have behind but the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.400
 shield we wear the shirt I think 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.600
 you have to keep fighting until the end 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.490
 it's true that we have two competitions 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.170
 both the cup of we are up to the king as 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.240
 the champions that are for us 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.890
 vitals should not be obsessed 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.080
 because I believe that any excess of 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.310
 obsession can create you such an upset 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.050
 that I think we have to go as 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.280
 we are doing right now know 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.520
 differentiate one competition from others 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.230
 but the same compare to us is 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.480
 very important and I think that also the 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.520
 team is mentalized and know that 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.530
 this competition well it is good that 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.880
 can already decide the two teams that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.760
 reach the end of the month of May and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.590
 well we have a way right now 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.370
 complicated because we have to defend 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.480
 to the valence in mestalla and also 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.070
 possible against Barcelona against 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.380
 that are playing very well and I think that 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.910
 It also gives you a lot of moral to follow a 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.840
 little and take away that thorn we have 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.840
 in the reality
