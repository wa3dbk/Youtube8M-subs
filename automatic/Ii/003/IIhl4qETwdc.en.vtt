00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.049
 and youtube I knew in the ips this here to 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.260
 one more video that same now one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:14.570
 comparison between motorola moto and 2015 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.400
 announced today by Motorola for the right 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.410
 February 25 , 2015 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 by the 24th he had already put a video 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.230
 talking about some characteristics and 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 here you have the most 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:32.099
 complete in relation to the bike and 2014 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 so come on personal firsthand 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.870
 It's what I see is that the bike looks like 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.360
 that he left that place in 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.940
 low end and depending on the configuration of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.860
 come to a mid range and also with 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 you also go emídio rangel prices 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.559
 see soon there that another showing né 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.920
 for example as 2015 support 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.699
 it has support 4G network it will have the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:04.350
 3g 4g models while motorcycle and only the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:10.430
 2014 is only 3g until the right trailer 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.380
 so come on the weight almost does not change is the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.759
 2015 and only as micro sim but if not 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.420
 I'm wrong, he's from Chipita and the motorcycle. 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.090
 and 2014 is also dual chip what we 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.549
 we have a bike here and 2015 as an ipss 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.210
 and of visiting helmet, right? 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:34.380
 and only capacitive touch pro 2014 but 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.259
 certainly also the right ips and the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.659
 difference starts already here for example 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.979
 2015 is 46 inches and 2014 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.850
 4.3 inches have a moment 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.899
 It's meaningful, but it's good. 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 right sign 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.500
 both have protection runs on goash clash and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 2015 already comes with android 5 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.560
 currently the otto it comes in 442 nene and 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.950
 when it was released after updated 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.140
 to 444 and is also planned to 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.959
 version 5 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.410
 the big change now comes personal 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.120
 he has the 3g model he accompanies the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.060
 same 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.500
 savior 2014 to 2015 today in the cathedral 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.799
 1 200 certain it is a quad core here and 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.730
 speak cornea code but 2014 or cut 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.670
 folks 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.480
 it is one by one quad core of 1.2 ie 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.829
 increase in two more cuts 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.950
 is the drain 302 and has a model that oo 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.840
 4g that it will see with the snapdragon 410 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 That's why I say that basically 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.370
 transform seems to want to become 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.739
 in a mini hand né 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.650
 with adriano 306 4 the idea is the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.480
 low cost processor and pros me the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.829
 64-bit handset is personal micro card 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 sd for both 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.190
 it comes here already the differential also that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.459
 it comes with 8 GB of storage 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:10.040
 while 2014 it has 4 gb of 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:14.120
 storage or motorola 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.299
 really gave a considerable up there and 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.700
 no cell phone did not move the camera 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.750
 continues with 5 megapixels I've already ted 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.930
 the panorama hr and gave an improvement in the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.989
 480-to-720p video recording 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.030
 before there was no 2014 had not here 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.099
 the front camera now that has 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.310
 At least one VGA camera should be 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.519
 3 megapixels're 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:45.199
 We have here for both hit bgn hotspot wi 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:48.829
 fi bluetooth 4.0 gps and glonass radio 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:53.660
 with rds micro-usb it does not say if it has 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:57.590
 tg the iml certain staff and the battery was 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.879
 something that they also improved from 1980 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.599
 from him and that the 2014 battery for a 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:08.410
 it a pace also 2391 feet 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.930
 only that he did not speak removable or not 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.400
 That's right, the more people I have 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.400
 Here to show you. 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.849
 another detail that I forgot the bike and 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:26.970
 2015 it comes with existing ones that are 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:30.870
 type a bench next to it has 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.590
 models there is going so see the bike 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.290
 and 2015 and recording in four versions maybe 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.510
 you can see here by the processor already 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:41.670
 we have two different processors 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.890
 we have a model 3g or 4g 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.020
 I'll show you now the price of each 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:53.070
 model is personal for example the bike and 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:58.020
 3g and this is the 569 bike and 4g and eight gigs 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:01.050
 of memory he leaves at 649 the bike and 4g 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.760
 dual sim sure the model I made here 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.550
 he was not of the help is 55 yes or yes 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.770
 16 gigas and 3 well discolored né 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.800
 martin band flashes should not have spoken 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.700
 huh 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.840
 three thugs who is like a bank, right 699 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:26.760
 and 16 gigabyte 4 gigabyte three-band model 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:31.440
 colored and digital tv 729 or 30 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.630
 the real difference here is $ 50 right and the 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.060
 greater value even stay here comes the 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.110
 model 3g and 4g 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.030
 it has less processor then it is by 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.890
 this is what it is costing cheaper 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.050
 understand the people who have less 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.540
 processor and less ram is has 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.330
 eight in relation to the other having 16 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.630
 so basically you can see that the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.120
 the cell phone and if that category he already 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.770
 becomes basically a me 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.080
 end but it's a cell phone inside the cell phone 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:07.850
 entry is being here for the model 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:10.290
 3g that has is is a memory of 8 gb and 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.440
 also has a processor that is a 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.650
 snapdragon 200 but it's an even code 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.460
 so by what is specified aquino 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.930
 in the comparative certain personal or else 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.380
 that the great change was also 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.530
 existing in those the smart smart pad 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:33.120
 smart well would be bracelet, I put it 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:37.349
 smart too well will be the assistant or 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.479
 band nor eat and that is very cool it 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.970
 around here I do not know if it will have a cover 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:42.200
 for him 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.220
 another important detail that he did not 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:49.880
 Speak here, folks, the following is not 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.880
 has led flash and it has a second 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.700
 microphone is back here in're here 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.610
 hidden behind the camera cannula one 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:01.880
 second microphone for noise reduction 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:05.300
 he lost that track he had here 

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:08.810
 're seeing won the front camera and 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.850
 sensors in the front then the motorola 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.280
 she was able to make an up and also 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:17.600
 handsome as she did on the moto gp 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.310
 projectors and now the bike and 2014 that I 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.380
 I rode first generation pro moto and 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:24.380
 second generation 2015 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.020
 very interesting this upgrade that the 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:31.340
 motorola did announcing today 25 of 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.960
 February and 2014 2015 with 2014 the head 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.580
 2015 personal touch 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.260
 so this is what I hope you have
