 larger the smaller the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.580
 we wanted to leave whole so that

 I lost the shape 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.870
 here we have then we have the garlic 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.610
 and the carrot we pepper 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.010
 add the paprika and the

 onion we have red peppers and 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:45.470
 green here I am incorporating the chicken 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.370
 remember that it has absolutely 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.620
 no salt 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:02:02.550
 the cut could also be done in 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:02:04.320
 there is no problem here and that 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.600
 although I have here of the marinade 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.490
 then incorporate these peas were 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.770
 previously cooked and already what we are going to 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.780
 do is let a little seal 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.660
 start at the bottom because we have 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.230
 good quantity and at the end of it 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.760
 we have fed let's incorporate 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.350
 simply the tomato because I do not 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.840
 we want to incorporate at the beginning so that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.320
 do not get undone by the amount of water and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.350
 the background the background as the neighbors 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.080
 we know a little onion bones 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.090
 we put him carrot we put him 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.069
 laurel and a little white wine 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.800
 until we simply incorporate the 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.560
 I'm going to put it then the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.470
 cover and we want you to rest 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.050
 resting is with the same power to begin 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.879
 to obviously release all its flavor and 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.500
 all your liquids as they are ideal 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.900
 is that we see that the liquid at all 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.400
 but have texture many times we 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.470
 it is necessary to apply a procedure that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.150
 call flirt what is flirt what is not 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.760
 they have played at all which is what 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.670
 touch one is to resort a little flour or 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.190
 of starch but in little quantity I take 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.079
 I have it here obviously by itself and in case 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.599
 the help we will have then 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.329
 present as we are going to mix one what 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.250
 could incorporate immediately but the 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.260
 grace is that we do not have lumps for 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.209
 that did not come out were together with the sauce 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.160
 because it would not be nice we can 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.099
 extract a little liquid when cooking 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.349
 and mix it very well and put it in the 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.299
 same heat we will incorporate a 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.690
 little of the tomatoes to let him loose 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.690
 the background 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:54.810
 here we are going to serve our plate 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.030
 here we have then our stew 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.160
 we can finish it with a little bit of 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.160
 dried rosemary rosemary leaves 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.820
