if you don't really care about
organization<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.219> want<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> place<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
organization you just want a place to

because it's huge and big and easy to
carry<00:02:00.719> around<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> don't<00:02:01.469> really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
carry around because you don't really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050

need a backpack you can just carry
around<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> binder<00:02:04.460> there's<00:02:05.460> ways<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
around the binder there's ways to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.999 
around the binder there's ways to
organize<00:02:06.210> those<00:02:06.810> big<00:02:07.079> binders<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.829> can

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
organize those big binders like you can

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.279 
organize those big binders like you can
put<00:02:08.129> dividers<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> can

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
put dividers and you can

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.170 
put dividers and you can
Genda<00:02:09.860> but<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.009> still<00:02:10.340> feel<00:02:10.580> like<00:02:10.610> everything's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
Genda but I still feel like everything's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.699 
Genda but I still feel like everything's
all<00:02:11.450> together<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.230> feel<00:02:12.409> like<00:02:12.530> it's<00:02:12.650> just

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
all together and I feel like it's just

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.369 
all together and I feel like it's just
too<00:02:13.549> clustered<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.450> everything<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.170> you'd

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
too clustered and everything so you'd

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.140 
too clustered and everything so you'd
have<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.739> clean<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.010> out<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.489> every<00:02:16.939> week

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
have to clean it out like every week

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.699 
have to clean it out like every week
every<00:02:17.360> week<00:02:17.629> every<00:02:17.959> week<00:02:18.079> you'd<00:02:18.290> have<00:02:18.439> to<00:02:18.560> get

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
every week every week you'd have to get

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.110 
every week every week you'd have to get
rid<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.920> stuff<00:02:19.099> and<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.610> feel<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.849> that's<00:02:20.030> just

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
rid of stuff and I feel like that's just

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.449 
rid of stuff and I feel like that's just
too<00:02:20.299> much<00:02:20.659> so<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.900> decided<00:02:21.019> not<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.250> with<00:02:22.370> a

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
too much so I decided not to go with a

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.479 
too much so I decided not to go with a
big<00:02:22.670> binder<00:02:22.909> the<00:02:23.180> first<00:02:23.390> time<00:02:24.099> so<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.310> other

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
big binder the first time so the other

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.430 
big binder the first time so the other
thing<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:26.030> has<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.870> do<00:02:26.989> with<00:02:27.079> this<00:02:27.230> is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
thing that has to do with this is

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.069 
thing that has to do with this is
notebooks<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.040> folders<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:29.269> notebooks<00:02:29.930> and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
notebooks and folders so notebooks and

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.339 
notebooks and folders so notebooks and
folders<00:02:30.140> are<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.250> great<00:02:31.730> idea<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.540> people<00:02:32.720> who

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
folders are a great idea for people who

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.839 
folders are a great idea for people who
want<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.010> pack<00:02:34.250> light

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
want to pack light

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.990 
want to pack light
so<00:02:35.390> if<00:02:35.950> sewing<00:02:36.950> for<00:02:37.129> instance<00:02:37.430> high<00:02:37.670> school<00:02:37.970> I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
so if sewing for instance high school I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
so if sewing for instance high school I
feel<00:02:38.329> like<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:38.720> not<00:02:39.079> gonna<00:02:39.290> do<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.500> binder<00:02:39.859> for

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
feel like I'm not gonna do a binder for

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.559 
feel like I'm not gonna do a binder for
every<00:02:40.189> class<00:02:40.370> I'm<00:02:40.579> only<00:02:40.700> doing<00:02:40.939> binders<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.540> a

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
every class I'm only doing binders for a

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.420 
every class I'm only doing binders for a
few<00:02:41.750> classes<00:02:41.989> and<00:02:42.680> there<00:02:42.799> are<00:02:42.890> still<00:02:43.010> classes

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
few classes and there are still classes

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.699 
few classes and there are still classes
I'll<00:02:43.549> just<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:43.909> notebooks<00:02:44.269> and<00:02:44.450> folders<00:02:44.709> but

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
I'll just do notebooks and folders but

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.099 
I'll just do notebooks and folders but
um<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:47.090> only<00:02:47.299> problem<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:48.079> with

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
um the only problem I have with

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.170 
um the only problem I have with
notebooks<00:02:48.889> and<00:02:49.040> folders<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.670> folders

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
notebooks and folders of that folders

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.629 
notebooks and folders of that folders
need<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.900> be<00:02:51.019> cleaned<00:02:51.349> out<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.739> lot<00:02:52.040> because<00:02:52.280> it

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
need to be cleaned out a lot because it

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.910 
need to be cleaned out a lot because it
obviously<00:02:53.000> can't<00:02:53.329> fit<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.690> entire<00:02:54.230> year's

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
obviously can't fit the entire year's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.670 
obviously can't fit the entire year's
stuff<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.670> one<00:02:55.879> folder<00:02:56.359> so<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.109> uh<00:02:57.379> you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
stuff in one folder so you uh you

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.680 
stuff in one folder so you uh you
probably<00:02:58.099> need<00:02:58.310> one<00:02:58.340> folder<00:02:58.909> for<00:02:58.940> each<00:02:59.269> unit

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
probably need one folder for each unit

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.210 
probably need one folder for each unit
so<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.900> need<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.170> go<00:03:00.260> shopping<00:03:00.500> quite<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:00.980> lot

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
so you need to go shopping quite a lot

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.649 
so you need to go shopping quite a lot
for<00:03:01.430> stuff<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.849> that<00:03:02.000> can<00:03:02.180> get<00:03:02.299> expensive

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
for stuff and that can get expensive

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.490 
for stuff and that can get expensive
depending<00:03:03.500> on<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:03.950> what<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> dealio<00:03:04.639> is<00:03:05.500> but

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
depending on and what the dealio is but

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.530 
depending on and what the dealio is but
there's<00:03:06.739> usually<00:03:07.099> only<00:03:07.489> three<00:03:07.790> terms<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.389> you

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
there's usually only three terms so you

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.289 
there's usually only three terms so you
can<00:03:08.629> get<00:03:08.959> probably<00:03:09.650> like<00:03:10.069> a<00:03:10.250> dollar<00:03:10.549> per<00:03:10.970> term

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
can get probably like a dollar per term

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.830 
can get probably like a dollar per term
spent<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.290> each<00:03:12.440> class<00:03:12.859> on<00:03:13.639> folders<00:03:14.269> alone

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
spent for each class on folders alone

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.379 
spent for each class on folders alone
which<00:03:15.199> is<00:03:15.230> pretty<00:03:15.739> nice<00:03:15.949> but<00:03:16.879> then<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.239> also

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
which is pretty nice but then you also

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.199 
which is pretty nice but then you also
have<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.780> add<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.169> fee<00:03:18.319> of<00:03:18.470> notebooks<00:03:19.209> which

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
have to add the fee of notebooks which

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.879 
have to add the fee of notebooks which
you<00:03:20.359> have<00:03:20.449> to<00:03:20.599> buy<00:03:20.720> one<00:03:20.930> for<00:03:21.139> each<00:03:21.230> class<00:03:21.560> and

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
you have to buy one for each class and

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.589 
you have to buy one for each class and
most<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.459> them<00:03:22.579> probably<00:03:22.879> have<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.209> be<00:03:23.359> five

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
most of them probably have to be five

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.009 
most of them probably have to be five
subject<00:03:24.169> one<00:03:24.410> for<00:03:24.680> each<00:03:24.799> unit<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.549> do<00:03:26.019> so

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
subject one for each unit that you do so

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.360 
subject one for each unit that you do so
my<00:03:27.139> overall<00:03:27.440> feeling<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.829> those<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.340> I

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
my overall feeling of those is that I

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.650 
my overall feeling of those is that I
think<00:03:28.639> they're<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.819> great<00:03:29.060> idea<00:03:29.389> I<00:03:29.480> don't

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
think they're a great idea I don't

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.780 
think they're a great idea I don't

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
downsides to them but you do have to go

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
they'll be too much to carry around but

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.140

binders for middle school were perfect

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.699 
binders for middle school were perfect
because<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.750> had<00:03:57.930> your<00:03:58.109> locker<00:03:58.319> that<00:03:58.620> you

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
because you had your locker that you

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.280 
because you had your locker that you
went<00:03:58.859> back<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.069> every<00:03:59.639> 10<00:04:00.030> minutes<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:01.139> grab

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
went back to every 10 minutes to grab

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.309 
went back to every 10 minutes to grab
something<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.480> binders<00:04:03.480> kept<00:04:03.840> everything

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
something and binders kept everything

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:05.750 
something and binders kept everything
super<00:04:04.560> organized<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.400> knew<00:04:05.579> where

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
super organized and you knew where

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.979 
super organized and you knew where
everything<00:04:05.969> was<00:04:06.180> because<00:04:06.599> they<00:04:06.689> had<00:04:06.719> the

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
everything was because they had the

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.720 
everything was because they had the
dividers<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.739> had<00:04:08.010> everything<00:04:08.310> you<00:04:08.549> needed

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.810 
thing I wanted to talk about was
backpacks<00:05:22.560> versus<00:05:23.070> purses<00:05:23.550> and<00:05:23.729> hint

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
backpacks versus purses and hint

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.630 
backpacks versus purses and hint
so<00:05:25.820> I'm<00:05:26.750> using<00:05:26.960> this<00:05:27.560> backpack<00:05:27.890> which<00:05:28.460> is<00:05:28.610> a

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
so I'm using this backpack which is a

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.450 
so I'm using this backpack which is a
mix<00:05:29.000> between<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.780> handbag<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.650> backpack<00:05:30.890> I'm

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
mix between a handbag and a backpack I'm

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520 
mix between a handbag and a backpack I'm
using<00:05:31.790> this<00:05:32.330> backpack<00:05:32.660> which<00:05:33.110> is<00:05:33.230> a<00:05:33.260> mix

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
using this backpack which is a mix

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.770 
using this backpack which is a mix
between<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:34.220> handbag<00:05:34.670> and<00:05:34.910> a<00:05:35.000> backpack<00:05:35.480> but

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
between a handbag and a backpack but

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.510 
between a handbag and a backpack but
it's<00:05:36.140> more<00:05:36.350> of<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.500> backpack<00:05:36.920> than<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.160> handbag

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
it's more of a backpack than a handbag

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.400 
it's more of a backpack than a handbag
but<00:05:37.550> it's<00:05:37.790> super<00:05:38.000> fashionable<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.050> love<00:05:39.290> it

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
but it's super fashionable and I love it

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.460 
but it's super fashionable and I love it
so<00:05:39.440> much<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:40.700> this<00:05:40.970> is<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> great<00:05:41.480> compromise<00:05:41.990> if

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
so much so this is a great compromise if

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.680 
so much so this is a great compromise if
you<00:05:42.590> don't<00:05:42.770> know<00:05:42.980> whether<00:05:43.280> to<00:05:43.400> get<00:05:43.850> a<00:05:44.120> backpack

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
you don't know whether to get a backpack

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
you don't know whether to get a backpack
or<00:05:45.350> a<00:05:45.410> handbag<00:05:46.900> so<00:05:47.900> he<00:05:48.080> handbags<00:05:48.410> I<00:05:48.560> would

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
or a handbag so he handbags I would

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.440 
or a handbag so he handbags I would
think<00:05:48.950> like<00:05:49.160> go<00:05:49.340> over<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.910> shoulder<00:05:50.300> and

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
think like go over the shoulder and

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.760 
think like go over the shoulder and
they're<00:05:50.540> just<00:05:50.720> big<00:05:50.960> and<00:05:51.200> you<00:05:51.260> can<00:05:51.440> carry<00:05:51.650> all

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.200

are<00:05:57.320> more<00:05:57.560> like<00:05:57.800> sporty<00:05:58.430> or<00:05:58.460> they're<00:05:59.030> just

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
are more like sporty or they're just

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.120

they're<00:06:01.700> just<00:06:01.940> easier<00:06:02.360> overall<00:06:04.240> but<00:06:05.240> I<00:06:05.570> feel

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
they're just easier overall but I feel
