00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.590
 I read everything right here and I said I already had 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 If we're back here, I'm here. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.070
 treating you guys one more 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 critical an online game for weak pc eu 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.210
 I hope you like it so let's go there 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.789
 personal tip today is a game of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.470
 third person cool legal style 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 it is clear that from the old 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 call me okay, smile benesse 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.310
 I think they do not even talk that door is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.349
 Difficult to speak in English appears more 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.170
 finally with personnel it was produced by 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.420
 crystal dynamics and was distributed by 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.920
 interactive waterway is always the idea is 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.360
 always from others 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.190
 it 's a really fun game like me 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.750
 I said at the beginning it is similar to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.610
 agreement was actually well in advance of the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.079
 flower goal but when I say so 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.190
 like personal'm not saying that 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.559
 he 's the same has nothing to do with 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.809
 ideology grid until the commands do not have 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 Nothing to see, I say the same for your gender. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.399
 is the goal off is an action game and 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.050
 adventure and the league only who is also a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.640
 action and adventure game with bed in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.800
 third person where the character goes 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.120
 running so it is similar to that of the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 google phone so i said he is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.430
 Looks like he is a game like that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.740
 that has to do with capiroto spirits 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.479
 this bagga turn good protagonist 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.549
 The main reason the game is that it is a 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.220
 vampire in fact he was a vampire right 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.409
 then he is thrown into the underworld he 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.299
 A reaper is what I can do is a 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.610
 The faces that stayed were on the wave of others. 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.990
 so he's going to do it but the story 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 has a whole set up is not 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.610
 possible was thrown there by a guy and the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.770
 empty he wants revenge then a hellder 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.869
 gotti will help the island this revenge 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 then this is the droid transform the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.799
 brazil in a certifier giving him 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 powers are that you are seeing that 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.970
 kill animals and absorb their souls right 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.790
 So you have to go to the guy who 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.460
 the rafael played in the darkness in the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 depth of the capiroto and will have revenge 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.180
 of course this game will not have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 this in a single game in this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.860
 I was going to stay at 2 is also for the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.899
 playstation 2 and for pc 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 only it takes stronger in either 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.180
 realize roh2 video card but this one 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 It's 11 is lighter. 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.780
 I particularly like to play 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.300
 I played a lot on playstation I found 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.200
 well cool is he has a gameplay 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.410
 half locked but for the season 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.459
 It was fucking fucking gameplay and I 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.560
 I recommend to him if you are one of those 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.540
 guys that does not care about the graph and 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.340
 like the plot so you should test 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.260
 I arrived because he's very kind, man. 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.190
 who likes old games there is worth 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.810
 Worth your while to test 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.280
 You are the youngest and you will never 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.110
 played this shock of this kind you 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 should also paint a play 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.040
 opportunity there because if you were not the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.360
 case of graphic guy coming out losing a lot 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.980
 Good thing and go for me. 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.049
 so a good thing and I want to talk to 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.510
 you here you can find a 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.099
 translation where double the whole game 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.080
 so the game is going to cloud you 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.000
 can search and I'll make a video 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.430
 then after a while he said no 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.410
 you install the translation and dubbing of the 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.569
 game to stay all Portuguese goes 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.099
 understand the story completely to 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.540
 You're still in the game, it's because 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.310
 there's nothing better than playing a 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.049
 I play in Portuguese in our language, right? 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.480
 It's cooler to play is more 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.560
 fun to understand the story but I will 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.180
 do more forward who want 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.709
 search google and the translation you go 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.780
 find yourself signed up for the game and put 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.400
 Behind the saint they'll find it quickly, right? 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.170
 as you can see the graphics not be 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.180
 very good staff but worth it 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.549
 let scure test the game itself 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.040
 so it's a half gloomy game try 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.560
 If you are the first game, you have capeta. 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.120
 These things can not go down I do not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.549
 I'm afraid to leave if it's for me, it's all 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.280
 Stunning capiroto good then is the game 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:30.100
 even without damn crazy meter bush bonnie 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.930
