00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.750

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 twenty -one bag human farm types 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.869

 family from there going to the roof to the roof 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.970
 mano is time to complete this video 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.340
 You'll learn but you fuck yourself. 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.230
 because we are telling you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.210
 would not survive but aluminum foil 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.210
 Maybe today maybe a drawing board will help 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.530
 seventh place was an invasion that 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.910
 you might not even notice yes because she was 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.620
 covered by the state government 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 united like all others than the best 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 is that the state government will use and 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.410
 hi all good talk there is legal'll 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.359
 Jewish joy to him speak oie 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.090
 Presidents is a crazy bitch ticona 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.339
 works does not know he can do 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.020
 the aliens the perfect dark 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.970
 the life of the president is only that but 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.470
 you were cool and that way it was a 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.479
 loss to mankind 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 not only because it creates an ugly type it 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.100
 it seems very good that they earn little 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.740
 prominent space one thing will see the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.509
 avenue in fact they did nothing 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.790
 nothing he nodded 11 and has a strength of 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.140
 arrival until we destroy everything easy 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.189
 You Do not Give Me Blues President 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.430
 Old pity a guy is a guy it was clear 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.040
 I 'm here the present is from another account 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.049
 account against the shooting game and count 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.869
 nobody remembers that against an invasion 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.759
 This love is the hawk's alien , but 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.890
 in fact it is an alien that is already 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.540
 here for a long time and then you think 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.850
 in the option humans are not human is 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.579
 fighting an alien who can 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.250
 do and did not he is already here one 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.540
 good good point and father of guys here you 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.360
 could not reach 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.369
 he can use scenery and fire helicopter 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.200
 and the coast the botafogo is a threat 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 potential and this is why 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 be judged but in the case of invasions 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.649
 aliens and it may only be showing 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 easier to write the step has changed 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.099
 This is good if you're gay but you 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.480
 to survive this alien invasion 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.319
 that means the world would be very 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.489
 happier 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.110
 so we actually hope she 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.890
 happens that not everyone is born dies 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.890
 about the numbers 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.930
 fifth king or why 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.159
 convenient attacked a lot and colony 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.569
 but never managed to invade the 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.239
 earth that invaded mankind 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.980
 our space so they are difficult 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.200
 are powerful have excluded that I think 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.290
 which are the worst part of them so and the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.780
 energy surge slice apps you are equal or 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.920
 butter and then maybe 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.280
 You would die if you had one. 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.409
 colony but hers has a way of 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.239
 solve this invasion with a single face 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.760
 You do not know until today because the morning 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.769
 It was, I'm not in a way 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.480
 hand cut of the beast caught in the person of 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.659
 boot of the clothes of the master team 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.659
 chief 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.269
 we all figure out the emotion that the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.269
 people already know that I do not want 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.519
 fourthly we have the schutter 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.040
 nuclear malocão 17 have a business that 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.889
 I'm afraid so quietly to think 61 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.159
 It all kills where it was at here it 's because 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.829
 if there where the enemy there kills a 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.530
 all know where a human was kill 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.389
 people saw a million young people where they saw 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.909
 and you can only use it on your radio. 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.909
 then humanity split application 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.159
 scattered on the ground and dead 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.019
 Do you have clothes that make you visible? 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:36.199
 only clothes that make you super strong do not 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.180
 So you're the friend and the craziest thing to 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.379
 besides creating for errors in space 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.349
 they will come with the ships past him 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.780
 very crazy green crisis has also weapons 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.370
 if the guy throws a gun 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.829
 biological that does not play and manato year 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.299
 I played in the crash, the agent died 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.870
 week after twist fell and third 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.519
 place 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.680
 the groom already exists a worse thing than 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.120
 hand that comes from somewhere else but already 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.349
 are in place of size 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.720
 gilson for the freaks of the earth but 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.810
 not an intra-terrestrial invasion, not a 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.989
 business that wanted to be 100 but because 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.699
 has electric saw bayonetta only 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.489
 So I get it, it's cool, but it 's not 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:18.349
 by the second step just because he is 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.389
 very wrong because it's the following if you 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.250
 is marcus fenix's best friend 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.940
 of marcus fenix the squadron of the neighborhood 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.590
 Phoenix 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.940
 the father of marcus fenix the commander of 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.289
 marcus fenix the president of marketing 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.469
 or marketing 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.699
 You will survive for no reason but you. 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.080
 is friend with max and emme 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.380
 unfortunately did not die the second is a 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.960
 game I doubt that 10% of the crew is 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.490
 play what is good but is very cool if 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.020
 You did not play what you're doing. 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.479
 life your crazy crazy hand 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.610
 the eband has a villain named sagas who is 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.590
 kind of the most evil thing in the universe 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.790
 the evil things of evil VAT 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.840
 string 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.150
 I will not talk to the woman in every 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.570
 tabu sport but ultimately keeps them 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.970
 Earth 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.590
 Yes, they only control the galley. 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.590
 body invaders know that the team will give 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.120
 finances and I adore financial 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.410
 just do not need morning if they 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.510
 control people people people 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.389
 animals people objects what they say 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.310
 you all everything everything everything to your spoon 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.289
 It's started the soup can with your face 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.360
 of killing said that not only did they 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.120
 have alien technology like them 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.669
 can control the gelatine spoons 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.590
 so focus ab or co guy and do not want 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.870
 finish until he wants to control the mind 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.180
 it is easy for him he wants with a 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.020
 1 bi army 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:36.590
 you'd be in the wrong gays up 0.32 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.590
 seconds 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.660
 in the first place the most massive invasion 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.210
 But you 'll be sicker than you. 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.910
 die faster are the badoque bi 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.410
 it had more effect is like 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.479
 the first rodeo in the face after 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.210
 have already cleaned the galaxy or several 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:57.720
 times before they are 50 trillion 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.030
 400 million of 455 thousand years doing this 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.130
 they do not even catch people talking to us 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.440
 Let's turn these into a zombie and get 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.110
 We 're going to kill, that's it, it's not. 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:14.280
 nothing you can do because they are 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:18.389
 I do not care, Roman man. 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.340
 in the beginning everything even breathe with God 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.650
 and your boss does not believe a 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.389
 ghost story 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.520
 no one would have stopped the spirit vehicle 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.770
 attack by three games 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.139
 In fact, the beginning of the 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.639
 books really appear neon business is 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.050
 bring down his face and then all the law 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.930
 world tells lies 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.030
 this is not happening here and the worst is obvious 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.159
 is that technology that you use your 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.250
 stand your bar boninho sérgio so 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:49.889
 is not my favor no moron is a 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.180
 machine in favor of hyper and they have a 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.490
 eternal return that they return several and 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.870
 several times I think an invasion of 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.460
 I would rather die soon in the hipers. 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.990
 first day if it was not already commander 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.289
 for the clear not forget in the new guinea 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.509
 and and what to come that our zombie hamsik 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.759
 do not wanna hear back 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:07.379
 the note of good words then the more in 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.240
 home but if she really happened she 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.340
 came to earth exploded everybody killed 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.690
 everybody practically and you go 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.210
 prefer to die there will be a bingo option 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.069
 Do you know any other zombie invasion? 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.360
 alien or anything that is 

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:23.280
 who invaded the hotel and a world cup 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.139
 Do you like to talk to us more? 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.759
