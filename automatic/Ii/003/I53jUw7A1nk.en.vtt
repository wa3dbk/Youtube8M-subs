a strip club for a friend's thing or

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.270 
a strip club for a friend's thing or
because<00:01:59.140> we<00:01:59.260> were<00:01:59.350> really<00:01:59.530> drunk<00:01:59.710> in<00:01:59.920> Vegas<00:02:00.190> I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
because we were really drunk in Vegas I

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.260 
because we were really drunk in Vegas I

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
myself I want to do this this had a big

myself I want to do this this had a big
impact<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.780> my<00:03:42.840> life<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.260> think<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.620> reason

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
impact in my life I think the reason

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.440 
impact in my life I think the reason
this<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.280> probably<00:03:44.640> based<00:03:44.790> off<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.299> other

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
this is probably based off of the other

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.360 
this is probably based off of the other
the<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.019> answer<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.350> gave<00:03:46.470> last<00:03:46.799> week<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
the the answer I gave last week that I

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.300 
the the answer I gave last week that I
think<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.239> might<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.959> tattoo<00:03:49.620> put<00:03:50.160> on

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
think that I might have a tattoo put on

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.849 
think that I might have a tattoo put on
my<00:03:50.459> body<00:03:50.670> with<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.090> birthday<00:03:51.329> of<00:03:51.750> my<00:03:51.840> son<00:03:52.560> and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
my body with the birthday of my son and

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.590 
my body with the birthday of my son and
I<00:03:52.950> think<00:03:53.400> it's<00:03:53.519> just<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.510> always

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
I think it's just so that I always

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.680 
I think it's just so that I always
remember<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.500> I<00:03:55.680> have<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.310> something<00:03:56.820> to

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
remember that I have like something to

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.479 
remember that I have like something to
live<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.350> work<00:03:58.470> hard<00:03:58.799> for<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.130> so<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.370> think

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
live and work hard for it so I think

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.330 
live and work hard for it so I think
that<00:03:59.700> like<00:04:00.150> that's<00:04:00.510> my<00:04:00.810> personal<00:04:01.410> reason<00:04:02.220> and

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
that like that's my personal reason and

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.560 
that like that's my personal reason and
so<00:04:02.430> that's<00:04:02.549> just<00:04:02.609> my<00:04:02.790> pending<00:04:03.180> on<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.299> think

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
so that's just my pending on I think

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.569 
so that's just my pending on I think
body<00:04:03.750> modification<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.769> sort<00:04:05.070> like<00:04:05.220> it's

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
body modification of that sort like it's

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.699

that's also there and I do believe that

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.650 
that's also there and I do believe that
there<00:06:46.009> are<00:06:46.039> parts<00:06:46.370> of<00:06:46.490> a<00:06:46.610> person's<00:06:47.000> life<00:06:47.090> that

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:50.389 
can be shared afterwards and through a

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.629 
can be shared afterwards and through a
different<00:06:50.900> kind<00:06:51.199> of<00:06:51.440> lens<00:06:51.800> but<00:06:52.130> I<00:06:52.190> think<00:06:52.490> that

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
different kind of lens but I think that

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.790 
different kind of lens but I think that
the<00:06:52.789> you<00:06:52.910> know<00:06:52.940> privacy<00:06:53.570> is<00:06:53.780> important<00:06:54.590> here

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
the you know privacy is important here

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.050 
the you know privacy is important here
in<00:06:54.889> there<00:06:55.039> and<00:06:55.190> it's<00:06:55.280> not<00:06:55.430> this<00:06:55.580> stone<00:06:55.820> wall<00:06:56.000> I

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
ago I wasn't really comfortable with

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.510 
ago I wasn't really comfortable with
doing<00:07:02.570> the<00:07:03.110> vlogs<00:07:03.380> again<00:07:03.800> but<00:07:04.070> you<00:07:04.160> guys<00:07:04.280> have

like<00:07:04.669> made<00:07:04.940> me<00:07:05.120> realize<00:07:05.449> like<00:07:05.660> what<00:07:05.870> the<00:07:06.110> fun

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
like made me realize like what the fun

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.230 
like made me realize like what the fun
of<00:07:06.560> that<00:07:06.710> was<00:07:06.949> but<00:07:07.280> maybe<00:07:07.370> even<00:07:07.699> less<00:07:07.849> so<00:07:08.060> than

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
of that was but maybe even less so than

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.270 
of that was but maybe even less so than
