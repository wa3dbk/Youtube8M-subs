just open it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
just open it
and<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.860> definitely<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.400> jail<00:01:05.910> if<00:01:06.180> you're

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and it's definitely a jail if you're

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.110 
and it's definitely a jail if you're
looking<00:01:06.660> for<00:01:07.040> something<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.840> more<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
looking for something that is more of a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.710 
looking for something that is more of a
polish<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:14.610> consistency<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
polish this is not it the consistency is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:38.859 
polish this is not it the consistency is
much<00:01:16.380> thicker

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.160 

and<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> goes<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.469> blue<00:01:41.179> but<00:01:42.179> the<00:01:42.420> package<00:01:42.869> says

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and it goes on blue but the package says

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.550 
and it goes on blue but the package says
it<00:01:43.469> dries<00:01:43.770> clear<00:01:44.249> so<00:01:44.460> we're<00:01:44.999> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.270> see<00:01:46.159> if

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
it dries clear so we're going to see if

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.910 
it dries clear so we're going to see if
that<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.799> correct<00:01:50.280> or<00:01:50.460> not<00:01:51.259> I'm<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.319> sure<00:01:52.500> if

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that is correct or not I'm not sure if

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
that is correct or not I'm not sure if
you<00:01:53.039> can<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.969> it<00:01:54.119> definitely<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
you can see that but it definitely is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.849 
you can see that but it definitely is
blue<00:01:55.969> right<00:01:56.969> now

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
so that's just a quick tip just to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.039 
so that's just a quick tip just to
remember<00:03:25.919> that<00:03:26.180> since<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.510> gel<00:03:27.870> it's

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
remember that since it is a gel it's

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.860 
remember that since it is a gel it's
going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.290> take<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.560> while<00:03:29.060> okay<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.120> my<00:03:30.660> nails

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
going to take a while okay so my nails

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.229 
going to take a while okay so my nails
have<00:03:31.109> finally<00:03:31.680> dried<00:03:32.359> it<00:03:33.359> has<00:03:34.349> taken<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:35.069> while

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
have finally dried it has taken a while

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.759 
have finally dried it has taken a while
like<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.389> explained<00:03:36.870> before<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.709> applied<00:03:38.609> it<00:03:39.769> in

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
like I explained before I applied it in

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.920 
like I explained before I applied it in
a<00:03:40.919> thick<00:03:41.220> coat<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.910> took<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.150> while<00:03:42.419> to<00:03:42.450> dry

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
a thick coat so it took a while to dry

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.249 
a thick coat so it took a while to dry
since<00:03:43.829> it<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.220> gel<00:03:44.639> but<00:03:45.569> they<00:03:45.720> have<00:03:45.930> dried

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:46.259 
since it is a gel but they have dried

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:50.680 
since it is a gel but they have dried
and<00:03:46.590> they<00:03:46.709> feel<00:03:46.979> a<00:03:47.009> little<00:03:47.280> bit<00:03:47.430> sticky

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.810 

which<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.840> don't<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.350> necessarily<00:03:52.860> but<00:03:53.700> I'm

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
which I don't like necessarily but I'm

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.420 
which I don't like necessarily but I'm
going<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.090> keep<00:03:54.390> with<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.990> I'm<00:03:55.080> going<00:03:55.260> to

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
going to keep with it and I'm going to

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.490 
going to keep with it and I'm going to
apply<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.550> for<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.060> five<00:03:57.330> days<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.960> see<00:03:58.140> if<00:03:58.290> I

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
apply it for the five days and see if I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.300 
apply it for the five days and see if I
don't<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.460> difference

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
don't see a difference

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.670 
don't see a difference
judging<00:04:02.310> from<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.790> first<00:04:03.150> try<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:04.080> will

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
judging from the first try I will

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.250 
judging from the first try I will
probably<00:04:04.980> just<00:04:05.670> stick<00:04:05.910> with<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.840> Sally
