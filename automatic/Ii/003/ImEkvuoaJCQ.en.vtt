against in the first round of the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.170 
against in the first round of the
playoffs<00:01:26.040> um<00:01:27.470> actually<00:01:28.470> anybody<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> West

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
playoffs um actually anybody in the West

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.149 
playoffs um actually anybody in the West
would<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.540> very<00:01:30.750> tough<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.110> compete<00:01:31.799> against

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
would be very tough to compete against

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
would be very tough to compete against
but<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.030> probably<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.780> with<00:01:33.930> Phoenix

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
but I probably have to go with Phoenix

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.530 
but I probably have to go with Phoenix
because<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.460> just<00:01:35.729> put<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> whooping<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.299> them

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because we just put a whooping on them

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.230 
because we just put a whooping on them
about<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> few<00:01:37.259> days<00:01:37.409> ago<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:38.939> we

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
about a few days ago and so I think we

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.899 
about a few days ago and so I think we
can<00:01:39.360> run<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.140> long<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.979> I'm<00:01:41.159> our<00:01:41.610> big
