00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.760
 hello and welcome to the guide of 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.950
 Proteins for a new test product 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.650
 in this video I introduced you to 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.539
 down to 1500 on the same side so he 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.270
 500 why simply because 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.750
 these are tablets dosed at 1.5 g of 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.610
 bca 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.679
 so here it's all tablets 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.210
 simple and with a ratio of bca that is 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.609
 classic which is 2 1 1 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.140
 that is two portions of the sign 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.089
 for a portion of a suitcase and a 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.689
 portion of iso the aids so all that 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.849
 is more classic 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.130
 so we call him pca to have 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.750
 as an advantage to improve your 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.130
 energy during your room 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.530
 of training and also to limit the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.580
 catabolism training plan so in 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.360
 exit you will also have a 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.060
 best recovery 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.600
 so when you have bca capsules or 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.580
 in tablets 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.860
 we take the full dose entirely 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.000
 before the weight training session at height 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.980
 from 5 to 10 grams 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.410
 so here the strong point of these products 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.540
 maybe they are dosed at 1500 mg of 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 bca which means that you will take 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.230
 between four and seven capsules to your 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.510
 bodybuilding session 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.730
 so it's a good dosage on the other hand 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.159
 attention they do not want to swallow and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.410
 progress of the big understood but that makes 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.210
 anyway tablets so been so 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.310
 to see you have here more do not 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.330
 to have with a bca powder that is 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.910
 really bad when it's 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.060
 nature by cons it's tablets 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.260
 Ah it's beautiful but it goes boggling 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.380
 and his little port we did not say that this 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.380
 what 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.800
 it goes very well so I remember the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.120
 highlights for this type of weird 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.340
 it's just tablets 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.020
 so it's more convenient to swallow for 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 those who do not like pc powder 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.850
 and those there are in addition dosed to 1.5 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.470
 gram from down to what is having to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.040
 take 20 jules before your session 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.810
 bodybuilding 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.800
 now I give an appointment on a 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.720
 protein list strong points of the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.770
 section tests and reviews to have more 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.360
