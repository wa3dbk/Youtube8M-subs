it's pretty awesome now only these

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
it's pretty awesome now only these
projections<00:02:42.510> would<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:42.930> embedded<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.620> gaming

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
projections would get embedded in gaming

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.890 
projections would get embedded in gaming
devices<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.760> wouldn't<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.390> jerry-rig<00:02:45.720> it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
like this and if companies like Apple

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.150 
like this and if companies like Apple
could<00:02:48.750> allow<00:02:49.739> video<00:02:50.489> out<00:02:50.760> more<00:02:51.390> easily<00:02:52.160> on

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
could allow video out more easily on
