00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
gamma blue on the inside and yeah let's

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
gamma blue on the inside and yeah let's
talk<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.090> upper<00:00:33.300> shall<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.690> um<00:00:33.899> we

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just as much but hey you know gamma blue

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.550 
just as much but hey you know gamma blue
because<00:01:19.259> color<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> season<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.119> know
