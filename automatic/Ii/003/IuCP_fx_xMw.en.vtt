00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.060
 traveling in the deserts of the world michael 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.160
 martin fotograf and weltenbummler has 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.630
 she traveled with her for five years 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.880
 motorcycle of a bmw gs in africa 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.130
 australia or asia he was on the way 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 always on two wheels always in the middle 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 but always extremely weather and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.279
 exposed to the elements 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:42.510
 a kind of travel that is exhausting 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:44.300
 but also has many advantages 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.930
 people on the landscape with 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.089
 support the locals more 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.470
 reliant 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.620
 for example if you are in the middle of the 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.239
 Desert must refuel around a gas station 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.030
 no gasoline have always goes any 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.420
 guys prefer the petrol yes 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.860
 sucked any and what about it 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.780
 Rhine flows into tank do not want to know 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.489
 yes of course we had somewhere in the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.479
 world at free gasoline the catalyst 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.049
 was then immediately devotion he came because 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.049
 drive well 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.410
 without local help often goes here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410
 nothing at all 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.420
 and what the adventurer needs on that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.420
 is simply luck 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.950
 today are really definitely never been 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.450
 total never be the absolute 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.710
 project information you can also do a lot 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.250
 improvise even with one 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.929
 hi-tech motorcycle and the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.149
 works even with one 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.210
 tire in the middle of the desert if you can 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.979
 knows as lucky then then today 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.479
 made the deal with the trouble 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:00.829
 could and would then really 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:02.810
 with the tank arrow is sewn, so to speak 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.189
 then it could pump up 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.189
 actually go on 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.870
 All in all, maybe I am now 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.150
 250,000 kilometers driven and I think 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.270
 already the motorcycle for long-distance travel about 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.490
 the combination of payload what you get 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.290
 take with you can take a certain measure 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.660
 comfort of safety 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.819
 yes, but also tradability although the 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.959
 I am a heavy nut 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.560
 So too heavy sand 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.560
 passed through 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.970
 the machine ends up under gas 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.780
 then you can do a lot better 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.970
 affairs 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.320
 if you are hesitant and slow 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.720
 is on the fieldrain or 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.700
 slowing down in the event of obstacles or then 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.710
 forgive in the sand then not immediately on 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.300
 the nose and then it is just uncomfortable 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.070
 hard it is the machine up again 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.070
 to get alone chance 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.380
 also the meetings with the 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.180
 locals in the desert are for 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.490
 an adventurer like michael martin 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.650
 always something special because here bounce 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.650
 worlds and views on each other 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.910
 Africans are somehow fatalists 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.980
 yes economically catch air pump 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.590
 drove off the broken batteries the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.690
 talk to the micros as thought so what 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:43.200
 then fascinated and think about something 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:44.519
 she wolf then a solution then on 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.470
 my own fist then just my motorcycle 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.330
 extended battery one has dismantled 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.959
 let go and he was extremely unpopular 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.390
 because, so to speak, the moms travel then 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.280
 to establish and then stop 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.970
 an hour since then i had his 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.910
 biggest power 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.400
 but not only in africa in the 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.400
 heights of south america are deserts 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.010
 were on top of 4000 meters under water 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.010
 under minus 20 degrees cold in the morning 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.230
 a problem is that any solution 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.860
 there is the hot water that we have 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.600
 made 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.430
 in the pot and then so long over the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.360
 poured cylinder and before the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.980
 Partie also with towels 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.360
 packed and the hot water on the 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.920
 towels have been fully vacuumed and im 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.300
 we have the hot water 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.300
 abandoned and run away as well 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:39.410
 but the German feels much better 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.960
 photographer anyway in africa though 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.740
 here completely different dirty 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.740
 challenges await him 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:55.439
 but sahara is and always will be 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:58.560
 absolute favorite is the queen all 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.779
 deserts 9 million square kilometers 25 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.919
 times bronze Germany and I would be 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.919
 always drive to the sahara 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.919
 Michael will be back in the desert 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.509
 Germany very fast from ours 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.620
 law enforcement officers on the floor of the 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.620
 brought back facts 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.300
 The police shocked at first yes 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:33.130
 but they heard where we came from, what we got 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.130
 have made cyclists 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.390
 The photographer was 250,000 kilometers 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.910
 traveling under extreme conditions and 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.750
 the bmw gs has everything reliable 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.220
 survived 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.220
 so must arise 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.560
 the myth bmw stands for over 90 years 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.620
 the name for quality reliability 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.620
 and also for sporty offroad successes 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.340
 what is behind what is the brand 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.170
 bmw really work out how well 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.060
 the bavarian motorcycles and why 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.460
 are just the gs models for 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.640
 adventure travel the world over 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.640
 choice
