00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello everyone with you vazovski and today i 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.530
 I want to express my opinion about the cartoon 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.990
 fox and dog 2 yes yes fox and dog 2 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
 I think everyone watched a sad story 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 cartoon fox and dog 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.460
 released in 1981 and if not watched 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.380
 surely look but today 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.670
 will talk about the American cartoon 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.529
 Fox and Dog 2 of 2006 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.489
 the director of this cartoon is Jim Cameron 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.430
 Now I want to tell you the story fox 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.950
 he and the puppy operas went to the fair 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 where they heard doggie groups in the foam 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.750
 drinking tramps 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 The team consists of five participants. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.219
 udpxy grandma rose cash and twins are bad 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.559
 well 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.500
 Soon, he threw it at all 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.219
 unexpected turn and group required 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.219
 replacement 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:09.270
 Of course, this replacement has become a puppy operas and 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:12.390
 further the dream came and so on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.270
 Of course , not everyone was happy to write 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.150
 so they tried to push him out of the group 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.400
 but the poor who missed his friend because 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.520
 pile driver forgot then yes cooper is so 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.460
 imbued with fame and my success that I forgot 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.700
 about your only and best friend 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 I think that the plot is enough for you in this 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 there is betrayal in the cartoon 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.470
 our time is a lot of people who are ready 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.729
 for the sake of money and glory forget everything than they are 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.250
 Alas cherished but this harsh life 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.580
 fox and dog 2 amazing and fascinating 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.310
 american animation created in 2006 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.310
 year is a continuation of the cartoon fox and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.830
 dog as here is the same story but isn 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.649
 slightly altered as well as the same hero 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.470
 Of course, I would not call it a second 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.990
 part of the action takes place in the small 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.289
 age and in the first part they already 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.440
 have grown so I would refer this part to 1 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.349
 well, or would call a fox and dog childhood 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 cartoon filmed in the best traditions here 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.459
 have all laughter tears love loyalty and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.120
 betrayal and of course friendship in 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.670
 this cartoon has no clear separation 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.160
 bad and good heroes how can we 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.260
 usually observed in other cartoons 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.970
 each character has its merits 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.160
 and disadvantages 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.860
 but unless I see no flaws in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.040
 lovely old women of course this cartoon 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.620
 can not be compared with the first part I do not 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.680
 I want to talk about the shortcomings of the second part 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.870
 probably out of respect for 1 of course in 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.080
 the first part is more tense moments 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.390
 and of course nothing will replace it 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.090
 probably due to the fact that I am very well 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.090
 I like the first part very much 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.140
 childhood, I enjoyed watching 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.660
 the second part and the plot was interesting to me 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.810
 although the essence is in my opinion that in the first one 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.690
 its 2 1 and even of course it's a pity that 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.660
 this cartoon came out 25 years after 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.840
 the appearance of the first part I think that he 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.240
 late somewhere well for 15 years when I 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.390
 watched this cartoon me little what 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.550
 touched i didn't worry about the heroes to 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.740
 Unfortunately, this cartoon could not 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.709
 make as soulful as 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.930
 the first part is yes I think that no one and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.260
 can not in this cartoon all 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.910
 predictable and I felt myself 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.520
 psychics while it watched what they 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.250
 say about the first part when there is no longer 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.380
 hopes of happening some kind of miracle in 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.040
 overall I advise you to watch this 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.200
 a cartoon 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.019
 Well, if someone did not watch the first part 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.450
 then cut everything down and start watching 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.790
 although the table put your finger up 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.440
 subscribe to the channel with you was 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.440
 VAZ and all for now
