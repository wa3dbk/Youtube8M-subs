00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
much lunch one via an out as well if

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.660 
much lunch one via an out as well if
there<00:01:33.780> was<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.899> guy<00:01:34.140> there<00:01:34.500> he<00:01:35.310> would've<00:01:35.460> died

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
there was a guy there he would've died

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.029 
there was a guy there he would've died
yeah<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.350> had<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.469> get<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> end

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
yeah so now I just had to get to the end

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.270 
yeah so now I just had to get to the end
of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.590> thing

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
of the thing

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.220 
of the thing
stairway

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.790 

and<00:01:45.000> floor<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.300> obtain<00:01:46.660> shows<00:01:47.020> your<00:01:47.230> goal<00:01:47.410> to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
and floor to obtain shows your goal to

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.050 
and floor to obtain shows your goal to
go<00:01:47.920> down<00:01:48.070> 10<00:01:48.990> um<00:01:50.610> yes<00:01:52.350> sure<00:01:53.350> when<00:01:53.850> got<00:01:54.850> me<00:01:54.970> off

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
go down 10 um yes sure when got me off

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.710 
go down 10 um yes sure when got me off
guard<00:01:55.270> there<00:01:55.480> okay<00:01:55.990> um<00:01:56.550> so<00:01:57.550> the<00:01:57.940> slimes<00:01:58.240> and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
guard there okay um so the slimes and

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.020 
guard there okay um so the slimes and
the<00:01:58.780> fire<00:01:58.960> guys<00:01:59.170> then<00:01:59.470> there's<00:01:59.650> yet<00:01:59.980> easy

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.370 

I<00:02:03.119> think<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.690> highest<00:02:04.350> i've<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.710> 20<00:02:06.049> you<00:02:07.049> die

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
I think the highest i've got 20 you die

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.630 
I think the highest i've got 20 you die
I<00:02:07.560> think<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.890> game<00:02:08.039> would<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.310> really<00:02:08.490> well

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I think this game would do really well

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.570 
I think this game would do really well
if<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.240> was<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> lie<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.289> add<00:02:10.590> based<00:02:10.920> free<00:02:11.400> game

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
if it was a lie can add based free game

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.449 
if it was a lie can add based free game
