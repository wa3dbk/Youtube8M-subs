00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
we can check out the building animation

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:28.070 
we can check out the building animation
and<00:05:23.910> as<00:05:25.250> obvious<00:05:26.250> as<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.639> was<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.539> building

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
and as obvious as it was the building

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.890 
and as obvious as it was the building
animation<00:05:28.560> is<00:05:28.710> just<00:05:28.950> flags<00:05:29.510> blowing<00:05:30.510> in<00:05:30.840> the

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
animation is just flags blowing in the

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.110 
animation is just flags blowing in the
wind<00:05:31.110> so<00:05:31.470> she<00:05:31.680> can<00:05:31.889> sit<00:05:32.070> outside<00:05:32.220> and<00:05:32.639> write<00:05:33.090> a

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
wind so she can sit outside and write a

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.820 
wind so she can sit outside and write a
book<00:05:33.360> or<00:05:33.660> read<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:33.870> book<00:05:33.990> or<00:05:34.320> whatever<00:05:34.470> she's
