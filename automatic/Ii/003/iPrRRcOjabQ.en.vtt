00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.610
 All the world now existed and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.260
 welcome to my second channel and 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.390
 Welcome to a trick mode 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.309
 multiplayer of call of duty ghosts and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.250
 this trick is to get it maverick 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.860
 free for playstation3 good as ya 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.930
 you know this weapon went out for xbox in the 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.449
 tlc and well then I'll show you how 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.820
 get it only for games 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.400
 Custom group in a game 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.100
 local then we have to log out 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.930
 in our play it our own and 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.910
 this is the bad thing we can not have them 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.339
 free for online but good something is 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.589
 something not and I think it's pretty good 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.570
 to at least try it a little bit until 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.059
 come out you'll see if you want to buy it or 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 not this basically because it would serve then 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.780
 to test it not for the just version and 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600
 so well then let's start with 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.490
 the tutorial and so well then everything 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.890
 first thing we'll have to do is 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.590
 enter the game's multiplayer mode 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.960
 we have to close the session we can not 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.000
 have the open online vale we are going to 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.010
 play local we create a profile or what 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.380
 we load directly because I give to 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.090
 create but you canceled and directly what 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.550
 I will continue without saving this 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.190
 do 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.440
 you want and well then here 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.330
 we put the enemy bots in which 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.400
 We want in my case for about five the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.200
 that you want is not necessary that you put the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.360
 map that you want works in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 all maps put the game mode 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.020
 What do you want in my case? 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.670
 team is this same put the time 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.800
 what do you want, I put ten minutes because 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.510
 it will not last long the video is worth and 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.030
 good in games a few options 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.100
 departure we go to the restrictions of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.620
 armament and we will have to put in 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.110
 main thing in everything it goes that we have to 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.820
 mark everything in yellow is worth all the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.350
 weapons in yellow because this is for 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.540
 remove all weapons then at 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.149
 remove all weapons what will happen is 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.010
 that we will have the combat knife and 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.020
 when killing an enemy then this enemy 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.910
 that will have the maverick weapon worth 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.920
 then thanks to this we can 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.330
 take it from the ground and try the one 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.890
 we are seeing we are also removing 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.440
 the secondary ones we have to remove everything 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.020
 and the accessories all this is not necessary 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 directly only the principal and the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.190
 secondary and then when we already have 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.620
 this is going to create the soldier this 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.600
 and here we will have to remove it in a 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.120
 armament we remove everything we have 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.920
 just in case I recommend removing it all 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.599
 the weapon 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.950
 or directly are the main and the 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.930
 secondary but just in case here I 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.489
 I think remove everything in case it did not work 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.470
 because you can try it many times 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.640
 because at the beginning I was not going to be worth 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.310
 good as we have this then 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.530
 we directly give you start game 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.840
 and when the game starts we look for 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.690
 an enemy and killing him by taking him 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.700
 the weapon keeping square then 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.310
 you see we have the maverick this trick 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.750
 I do not know if it works on xbox because 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.970
 I already tell you directly that I do not have 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.250
 xbox and that's why I can not but I can not 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.340
 try it but many people because I know 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.400
 will have bought in the case that as already 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.049
 is the position of this post for xbox because 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.000
 people have already bought it, others have not 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.769
 then I do not know if it works for xbox 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.670
 but directly is recommended for 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.620
 play because we take no delay 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.019
 this a month when things get out of 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.630
 Stage is good and well , that's what it is 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.910
