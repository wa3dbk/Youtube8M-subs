 So 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.589
 in memory of what we experienced 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.480

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.250
 human 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.780
 the apparatus which we flew is reflected

 last six years and only after that 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.400
 theater them 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.750
 response to the fee run the program 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.940
 return 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.720
 what 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.660
 it's just

 Shekel culture 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.730
 however the situation is different 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.130
 Polykarpov 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.730
 Well, it became 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.660
 to become an outpost of humanity our 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.330
 first besides this prevented the area 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.630
 space exploration 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.050
 I personally saw the land and saw 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.710
 all humanity is completely new 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.030
 negative 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.050
 we leave the hit than incredibly 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.720
 beautiful nude all artificial 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.580
 craters moon surface 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.419
 we were there we saw what it was 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.979
 hard we fly home where we lived by 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.449
 face value true on this planet we 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.329
 have left 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.509
 our city by selected abode and 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.069
 I had a little home 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.209
 but still we leave it quickly and 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.439
 feeling himself 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.669
 burned out with whom we torture and gave land 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.669

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.519
 from the orbital station 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.459
 it did not say Kuzmuk party wants 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.159
 manage this thing output on the end 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.819
 the countdown of fourteen center I said g. 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.409
 captain danilkin of course may not 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.449
 like so 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.489
 he had a lot to do and bath 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.229
 from the negative side I never have this 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.229
 don't know not even visible 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.669
 on the screen of Gagarin 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.969
 it's easier to hide the fact that if before 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:25.050
 4 6 times 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 I'm glad to hear that you come home 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:33.120
 feel 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.150
 what about 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.910
 criminal captain returning his 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.309
 country ship 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:39.809
 we flew home now we 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:40.599
 heading 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.599
 in the direction of Kiev 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.069
 fabrics 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.880
 l am feeling involving 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.199
 all the same due to 4 3 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:17.349
 years five as we went to 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.059
 swimming is therefore quite rare 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:20.580
 exceeds 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.199
 we can and acquire new knowledge and 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.520
 and again win new rights and rights 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.249
 the sick must be conquered trust 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.479
 be acquired for the progress of everything 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.349
 of humanity 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.559
 across the field into frames 

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:36.929
 national agency for 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:38.449
 space research 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:40.059
 now men and women who 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.319
 died 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.430
 over the years of his life space exploration 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.430
 for six months one union one union 2 challenger 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.270
 and if we go time and i start 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.960
 believe producer director capital 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.729
 equals 14 subconscious 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.699
 level all the fact that it will pour out as 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.350
 it was lookin back to earth 105 4 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.759
 turned bodies and rites turned into 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.659
 USA 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.659
 but also here in space montage all records 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.360
 the composer wandered and now when i look 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.899
 but the third is abstract 

00:06:18.899 --> 00:06:21.009
 Romantic Ossetia is absolutely real 

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.749
 arch thing 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:25.749
 the stars are my home 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:41.809
 up to 1 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.710
 at 

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:54.809
 Yes Yes 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.449
 oracle 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.979
 date 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:09.979
 n 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.050
 but in 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:26.740
 you 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.740
 Prices 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:35.509
 So 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:49.009
 his percentage 

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:56.979
