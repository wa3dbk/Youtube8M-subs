00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello, that you found this page 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.990
 have and interest in your 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.790
 own quadrocopter to build 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 my name is michael hogan and me 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.120
 would like to tell you first how 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.799
 I arrived to this head 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 It started as a smaller one at that time 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.199
 young with model cars and were as me 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.699
 then the electrical engineering studies in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.710
 direction automation technology and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.570
 won robotics I 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.580
 someday the love for the quadrocopter 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.720
 found 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.609
 while studying electrical engineering 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.480
 I was able to get a lot of work on that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 take care of hardware 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.969
 and more hardware the control electronics 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.460
 to take a closer look at all the sensors 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.040
 after you electrical engineering bachelor studies 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.800
 the media masters master there is 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.180
 rather in the software direction that is 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.670
 Developers also own software for 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.280
 Such a head I think for mine 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.570
 Laboratory operation need 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.789
 During my studies, I became involved 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.309
 Countless questions on the subject of headbuilding 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.949
 holes in the topic of remote control 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.879
 chopping motors and so on to everything 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.710
 which belongs to it 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.180
 because people said they would not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.439
 I found my guide 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.850
 that hannover be 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.740
 I am looking for myself 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.200
 gone and found it there 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.270
 really no detailed instructions 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.010
 which treats all topics like this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.630
 really not a family open at 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.790
 Then I started this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.100
 to gather all around one 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.020
 really detailed instructions for one 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.300
 to create a quadrocopter 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.340
 The result is this video tutorial 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.110
 where I explain everything you do 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.890
 you need your own patrol 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.140
 to build kopftor 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.930
 from the first screw the first cable 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.770
 via the remote control to the flight ferry 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.300
 against the priest kopp before I make myself 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.220
 give this manual to hand 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.560
 Of course I wanted one hundred percent 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.540
 be sure that everyone really 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.880
 each of these instructions one 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.350
 airworthy quadrocopter here and there 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.660
 Can my sisters just right 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.610
 she does not have any model building experience yet 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.780
 He has never had a soldering iron in his hand 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.890
 and programming will have it that way too 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 So had to be based on Peter 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.660
 construction manual your own quadrocopter 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.390
 had to build all the plugs and 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.459
 cable itself lives and on the changes 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.040
 software of this probably is yourself 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.670
 make and the result is a flight 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.470
 capable optimal quadrocopter was there 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.410
 I 'm sure that this guide 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.300
 really for everyone in the construction manual 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.220
 I really value it 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.730
 that put everything step by step 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.400
 is explained 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.709
 you get from start to finish 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.569
 detailed information and many 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.450
 tips and tricks you the construction 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.950
 facilitate 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 every single tree step was made for it 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.480
 captured in a separate video 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.549
 so you can watch what live 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.550
 what needs to be done and it happens 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.560
 can replicate directly 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.210
 Of course, you also get one 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.520
 extensive knowledge about yours 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.500
 quadrocopter to expand it later 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.440
 or repair in the event of a claim 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.760
 can 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.560
 Of course you also get a list 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.710
 with all of me used 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:08.020
 components but beyond that as well 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.020
 alternatives for various components 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.520
 the most important thing in the site management is 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.360
 but that you have a lot of fun with his 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.360
 have new hobby 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.160
 so if you always have one 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.650
 Build your own quadrocopter 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.660
 this wonderful robin model 1000 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.920
 wanted to log in once and you 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.330
 receive in the next five minutes 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.460
 no access data 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.980
 You can still start with the first one today 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.750
 videos start and i hope for them 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.750
 must be the same and if he returns
