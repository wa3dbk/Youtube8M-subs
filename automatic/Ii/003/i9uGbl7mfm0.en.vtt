00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.930
 hi we all had some channel 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.790
 of the arts happy today a video tutorial 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.160
 dedicated to Valentine's Day 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.410
 I to be obviously faster I have 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.820
 already spread the nail polish on my nails there 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.520
 I show immediately and products 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.099
 reused at oratio as a base 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.399
 used this one of the color club e 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.989
 it's called vita bass and it's a base 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.300
 reinforcing and nourishing that I am trying 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.800
 for some time I will obviously write one 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 review on the blog but in the meantime vi 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.360
 advance that I am finding myself very well 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.949
 because already with a few applications or bis 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
 excellent nail results 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.600
 then obviously you will read the review 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 calmly then on all long except 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.559
 who study the area used this 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.539
 red lead enamel and this is one 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 very special red enamel because 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.429
 inside contains all these faxes 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.429
 that create an effect almost exactly 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.690
 three-dimensional of the beautiful enamel 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:08.010
 I like it to death 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.590
 this is the equal and absolute decree 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.710
 nicer red nail polish than I don't 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 own because it is something 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.560
 extraordinary state light is here 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.000
 beautiful work then on the ring finger 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.940
 used this here which has a white 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.070
 a very simple white lacquered almost 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.130
 in chalk white but unlike the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.810
 classic white chalk this is not a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.210
 that unpleasant undertone effect 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.700
 yellowish this remains very white 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.800
 just a pure white and above all yes 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.140
 extends very well covering with one 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.140
 past is very fast drying 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.090
 this is miss marilyn fantastic 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.700
 truly this is also a white glaze 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.600
 great then I will use this glaze 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.620
 red 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.940
 This beautiful and charming even this 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.920
 red tone 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.820
 nice looking then after the flower like 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.110
 then use as totti instead 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.910
 used and we will use again 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.430
 this one from the color club 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.679
 this is 0 60 and is a color and is a 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.970
 a fantastic top coat I'm trying 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.820
 already for a week if I'm not mistaken and it is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.590
 wonderful because we say it has everyone 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.410
 the advantages of the secit without having the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.930
 disadvantages therefore to an incident it does not create 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.640
 I don't know the effect in quotation marks step 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 if he did it for whose base there is life a 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.770
 me type on let's say on the outside 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.060
 where are the cuticles created me a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.980
 step effect 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.500
 so if you didn't feel perfectly 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.240
 he had this very bad defect and then there 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.010
 it also created a little enamel on the tips 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.190
 instead this one has no effect 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 negative is really good there 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.989
 advice but then of course I'll do too 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.450
 an article on the blog then we will use 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.580
 acrylics I need white and 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.370
 red these are of the crystalline and there 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.890
 know xkÃ¨ abelli his always then 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.660
 this is the powder of death this is 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.510
 always of the mini always gets on 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.940
 site after the dry references 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.000
 then this brush here of the mine and is 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.970
 this one instead of the pupa always 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.090
 thin then a thin point night 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.450
 that is small and then this brush a 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.580
 fan that is without brand because on the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.530
 aesthetic supply store and now 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.530
 I'll show you how to proceed 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.340
 well 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.040
 but I 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.090
 of course 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.090
 or not 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.360
 ok 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.810
 7 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.810
 I do not know 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.260
 in a zapping 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.060
 in conclusion 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.500
 but I 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.500
 well 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.210
 well 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.350
 is clear 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.470
 6 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.470
 but 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 maiori 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.320
 in Italy 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.710
 but I 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.169
 good in art is over this is the 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.629
 result is exactly as you have seen it is 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.449
 very simple maybe the only thing one 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.759
 a little more articulate we say is 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.849
 outline the little heart perfectly already 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.439
 designed to go and put on the 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:24.059
 dust is death maybe that 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.569
 really the only part a little more 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.459
 then difficult for the rest really 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.439
 very easy and also very fast I hope 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:33.270
