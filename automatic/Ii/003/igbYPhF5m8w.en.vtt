00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.910
 for a duo of goddesses I read all and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.370
 each one of the books that they two 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 written separately and most of me 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 they've loved it so it's only because 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.930
 imagine the great and beautiful and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.539
 devastating that this book is going to be 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.120
 because knowing the two I know that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.739
 the book is going to kill me I have not read much 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.949
 about what this book is about because 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.300
 I want to enter with an open mind without 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.920
 things that other people have said like this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 that it's just that a book of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.930
 romance between two best friends and already the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 original publication date was 11 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.280
 January but they beautiful and beautiful 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.049
 they published on January 8 so 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.180
 you can go read it in the next 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.400

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.299
 trying more is the author of the books of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.770
 troll or glass so you can 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.540
 say that I'm waiting for a book of 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.460
 epic proportions because apart from being 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.920
 a fantasy book is also going to be a 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.659
 book inspired by history from the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.009
 beautiful and the beast 'so really not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 have no idea so I'm 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.190
 excited by the book the date of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.810

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.570
 May the next book on my list is 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.520
 think style for great is the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.530
 continuation of the book where you can 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.990
 do the tics for a book that loves 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.130
 totally in 2014 this series continues 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 the story of a girl who likes 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.119
 write love letters but in reality 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.330
 he only does it as therapy 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.240
 never send them but one day it happens that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.850
 those letters are sent mysteriously 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.229
 then we see from the point of view 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.060
 of her as she already has to deal with 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.830
 guys approaching to ask them about 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.229
 these letters is too cute and 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.789
 too beautiful so if I'm more 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.100
 excited the publication date of 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.900

 totally loved it in 2014 so 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 I'm more excited the only thing I know about 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.060
 book is that it will follow the story of the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.950
 main character along another 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.690
 secondary year so I'm just 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.000
 waiting for a lot of laughter 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.230
 and a lot of fun because that was all 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.390
 that winkler gave me the date of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.460
 publication of being estimated 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.600
 for September of this year the following 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.690
 book you can mention is 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.150
 surprisingly carrion by renault 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.430
 wow I say surprisingly because in 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.380
 actually it cost me a lot of fans but 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
 yes I am quite excited because 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.150
 airplane this book is going to follow the story 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.260
 about two male characters that are 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.750
 archenemies but they still have 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.400
 sexual tension then you could say 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.530
 that concept called me quite the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.880
 attention so yes I'm pretty 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.740
 excited to read it the special 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.420

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.820
 October the next book by which 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.460
 I'm too excited it's winter x 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.740
 nation that is the conclusion for 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.720
 the dollar sagas published this book 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.030

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.500
 really epic I can not wait to see 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.640

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.400
 what are happening in the books 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.410
 before and I'm really rolling by

 a happy ending so there is more 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.430
 emotion too much emotion how little 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.990
 we live on winter in the book 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.790
 previous I was too struck 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.920
 apart since the protagonist 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.510
 male in winter is going to be too much 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.790
 and to me seriously 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.080
 pello winter is going to be published on 24 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.430
 November now I will spend with the 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.710
 books that do not have a date yet 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.810
 publication and I'll start with the roux 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.400
 portal on twitter I have no idea 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.740
 who is going to treat this book itself 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.630
 because I mean, I only know it 's about 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.360
 a mystery book with a little bit of 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.920
 ski lift maybe I do not know I do not know in this 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.890
 book is not something that would have called me 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.440
 the attention normally but as it is 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.120
 written by me you dare fisher I'm going 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.770
 to read this I assumed that this book had 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.500
 application date for December 2014 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.500
 but the public still has no date 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.240
 publication and I die for that so if 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.370
 you will see me family I am on the day 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.780
 can read marrow the next me what 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.530
 I 'm going to mention you do not even have 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.780
 Title 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.209
 is the fourth book of the saga of men 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.790
 just like that by maggie stiefvater my viruses 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.290
 with this series they are very big because 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.150
 apart from the story that is a 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.460
 too good story and too much 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.230
 different from what you usually see 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.020
 characters have me in love with them 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.150
 I really want to see more of wood already 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.940
 cannes and together because those children together 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.200
 they kill me with emotion so if you also 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.270
 has been excited to see what the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.100
 cover because the previous covers 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.740
 They have been beautiful the only thing I expect from 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.780
 this book is that nobody dies that so 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.550
 difficult can you do these and the last 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.820
 book that I'm going to mention in gaming is 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.680
 weak by scabbard marcheta a new book 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.060
 of feline marcheta finally I ni 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.380
 you can not even see the existence of this 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.330
 book until I started looking in 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.040
 google the application date of the others 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.190
 books that I mentioned the shock that I 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.590
 I suffered I would commit this book 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.360
 but I almost got something because I look 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.670
 Marcheta has not been for years 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.560
 posting anything new then a new 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.820
 book of them is not so happy 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.550
 this book does not even have a 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.960
 description yet but simply the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.110
 fact that it's going to be written by a 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.820
 marcheta instantly makes one 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.260
 vibrates most anticipated of the year only 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.630
 I know it's not going to be a fantasy book 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.310
 which depresses me a bit but it's 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.600
 important I know there will be more for her 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.890
 and those are all the same as 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.270
 I wanted to mention in today's video 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.560
 I hope you have really enjoyed the 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.510
 video because he did it with a lot of love and 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.890
 with a lot of spam and then I would love it 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.170
 will share with me what their 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.700
 more anticipated readings this year like this 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.800
 I do expect clients that all the video 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.270
 that's it for today's video I'm 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.270
 looked and we'll see you soon chao
