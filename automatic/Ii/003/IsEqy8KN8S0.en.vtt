00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 so how come to the new video of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.610
 Games was called yunus and I want you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.280
 very recently a new size 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.289
 introduce and hardware built into it 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.449
 yes many videos 2 seen about that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.000
 housing but what really me 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.939
 noticed that no one be 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.279
 hardware ring as presented and 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.910
 as the system only looks like if the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.219
 computer is turned on so that's what you want 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:39.570
 I show you today and the first one 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:42.809
 so the start button is lit orange 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:55.500
 because the design also has something here too 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 orange is just here 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.409
 make that our drive in there and there 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:11.720
 top again we have twice usb 3.0 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:14.970
 headphones micro m2 usb 2.0 a gateway to 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.090
 part of the housing and thus too 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.320
 my hardware so I have one so 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.770
 597 mainboard installed one can indeed 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.770
 not seen 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:35.250
 So I have cooler on the cpu 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.090
 from be quiet 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.170
 the dark rock pro 3 with two fans and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 We'll see you there too soon 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.409
 memory of me so at least 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.520
 one and he there again the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:57.860
 second that a two by four gigabyte 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.689
 RAM with great 800 megahertz 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.570
 yes, what else she pretty much all my 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.119
 in practice this is such a castle 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.599
 There are drives in drive right 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.080
 push out the cavalli drive and 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.709
 After Linz, the whole thing is already 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.290
 firmly 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:27.980
 so very handy otherwise power supply 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:31.450
 80plus bronze at least 530 valcom off 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.310
 so what we forbid here we see mine 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:42.620
 the thing is never in it means that is part 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:46.190
 the msi geforce gtx 470 gaming 4g 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.920
 version so it was called I believe me 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.790
 is especially like that here 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.980
 thing is lit here but the housing is 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.900
 yes everywhere but continue on it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.670
 promised that such a window out 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.030
 bring that extra to me 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.010
 can buy if I quite cool so 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:16.430
 otherwise finished hard disk 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.730
 western digital 1 terabyte and above 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.540
 is just samsung first topic 20 left 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:31.700
 stay around a windows in there is see 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:34.989
 the cool one time 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.989
 go ahead 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:42.910
 that's where it comes in , so I was 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.349
 twice at cooler and explore 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.660
 dust protection you can do that too 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.790
 reject 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.980
 The thing only a few so very convenient 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.650
 made from the way far is their first 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.669
 housing but i find it pretty 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:04.239
 succeeded is what we still show 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.239
 Maybe we can go back 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:23.540
 the cover of long actually like that 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.480
 far from the housing made of very chic find 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.840
 So I can only recommend 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.800
 I have made it today 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.450
 the assembling has a bit 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.360
 It took but it has definitely 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.260
 worth 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.720
 thanks to look up 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.910
 I'll do that for the first time, of course 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.820
 complete hardware number 1 at the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.169

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.000
 also shortly after the passage of the housing 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.510
