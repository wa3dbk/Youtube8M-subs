00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:05.330
 also the sporty component does not have on the German derivatives times 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.280
 we missed out on the investment strategy over its 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.250
 Investment strategy with the 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.190
 current coach and manager of FC Schalke 04 and do not keep him 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.220
 Felix Magath 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.529
 Magath my player pleasures of my strategy my investments also in the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.960
 At the moment, the station is a little tricky 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.799
 Dossiers are better off right now 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.370
 There I am quite so good percent 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.630
 I am happy 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.620
 the moment percent more about the situation though there too 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.160
 Naturally 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.730
 the overall they are a difficult one 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.250
 but it is not a comparison to the athletic situation 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220
 but Brunner expected 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.100
 has become problematic 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.380
 they all now notice in football that the defense is very important as 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.920
 important because then the defensive in their investments so 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.170
 how do you see their return they are per profile rather that they say 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.110
 Again, having a schnapps more risk one or more is 18 rather 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.750
 that I do not take the big risk for that 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.070
 Holder of making a profit on the return 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 smelling like that will be silent to all 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.730
 Naturally 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.340
 most of the time I have security 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.750
 I have around part 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.730
 Voigt certainly 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.120
 willing to take a risk and find out about it right now 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.290
 what the scenes or where is actually the risk 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.100
 at the times 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.500
 I believe that 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.890
 at least that's the way it is in soccer, too 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.260
 AIG to assess them on the situation 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.729
 the lower the risk is the worse in situations 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 you stop 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.550
 not right 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.020
 gets under control 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.560
 Saving percent I think the risk is outrageous 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.470
 and percent of, therefore, there are also phases in the stock market 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.930
 Bures 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.919
 is risky 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.919
 like for example now or just too 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.659
 us president of the depth 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.949
 risk-free is to invest 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.310
 An investment strategy is very 1 is long 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.510
 what you are and you have already said you can of course be a small part 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.449
 then put it riskier 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:29.429
 Now that you look back, you already have yourself 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:34.889
 Footballer accordingly financially I think well deserved and now 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.219
 if she also has her as a coach accordingly 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.999
 Strategy Gera investment strategy changed 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:45.069
 They have noticed that they have made ever since poorer change at all 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.169
 or has she been the same before? 

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.700
 No of course, of course, saves 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.989
 initially percent 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.470
 when I started not to engage in the capital market risk 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.729
 been richer and 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.469
 he believed 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.699
 that's already in Kriftel 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:07.980
 can get on very briefly because they started 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.959
 Educators at the financial market 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.289
 yes that was still 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.659
 At the beginning of the 80s about 80 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.269
 have a lot to do as I speak on the capital market to engage in the stock market 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.659
 and 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.919
 ruler 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.989
 Dr 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 With Iraq, a successful investment was the same 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:33.960
 by virtue of 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.270
 Of course, this success remained with Böhler after that 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.380
 I then met the dark side 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.779
 at 7 80 the Tanner wants crisis and 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:47.619
 but what all came in spite of the duty brought no crisis 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:52.959
 Percent not from the capital market and thread Mahlich is testifies that beside plants 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.990
 in the park 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.419
 and bonds 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.240
 % fib coat whose fortune has 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.019
 Gentle is very useful and the weather 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.190
 Breaks in the middle one 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.959
 Percent lower risk 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.669
 and can achieve good returns 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.849
 what did she do the most in the time they have already mentioned 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.749
 a successful investment is certainly 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:17.219
 what do you remember about their financial assets they just said 

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:20.659
 nice as a one as mentioned but what is left hanging there 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.379
 what was most memorable for her? 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.059
 July Schopper 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.870
 yes then too 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.189
 in the hand in the early years 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.630
 Options traded 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.580
 I got away from that in the meantime Forest is 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.059
 Percent Suri Zico Empire percent is and percent 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:39.529
 Percent of that, therefore 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.479
 I already believe that I am also negotiating Neumann Lage behavior 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.319
 Percent have developed 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.939
 hear that as open now longer term 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.939
 For the most part, APA is mostly bin-oriented 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.939
 for from there 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.400
 the things 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.819
 often more strategic 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:03.199
 Formation of a team and the establishment of a depot he is 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.920
 in certain because of EHEC certainly Schorn 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.510
 the installation of their depot 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.510
 pointed Hochtief out overall picture 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.089
 yes I'm there 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:17.559
 various take-two depots 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:18.780
 I'm driving there too 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.960
 different strategies 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.449
 Percent in part 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.189
 Do you know them? 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:27.349
 large companies 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:28.710
 long-term 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.710
 I think this action for years 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.800
 and on the other side 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.629
 I also have percent in the depot where I am now 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.560
 increased certificates trade and 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.189
 as well as short 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.469
 Eats Digger run and where I just then fast and history under 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:48.669
 the 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.309
 he is at the moment 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.330
 quite successful 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.189
 I hope that's great, too 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:59.800
 They are considered as trainers. Yes, they are also called very disciplined 

00:05:59.799 --> 00:06:02.229
 footballing circles Quälix opens 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.259
 So as I said the discipline is a top priority for a speed test 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.789
 In the financial investments they lived just as disciplined in football 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.139
 little profit and 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.900
 I have internalized that discipline Egan disciplines 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.439
 Percent bring success 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.779
 Percent and percent at mine 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.150
 elsewhere and capital market 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.650
 I have to admit that unfortunately I do not manage the crowd 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.720
 therefore 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.159
 Percent happily but even then my indiscipline often cost money 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.419
 One last question on what would they be to investors looking at the financial market 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.419
 operate fair acts 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:43.669
 What would they give their archenemy? 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.770
 does it come to the starting position I would generally say 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.339
 Percent are today's uncertain time 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:53.869
 Per cent you should act a bit more cautious and poche 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.310
 Certificates are in the moment 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.229
 a very good one 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.610
 I can thank many of them and of course offered to have them
