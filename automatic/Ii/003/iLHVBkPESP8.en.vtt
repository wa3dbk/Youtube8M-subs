00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.659
 ah 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:30.260
 Organic banana work to improve 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.260
 quality of the fruit and harvest 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.700
 when the banana plantation starts to 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.460
 simultaneously to fruition 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.010
 cultural work we must carry out 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 other tasks that allow us to improve 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:50.570
 the quality of the fruit 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.570
 These tasks are the following 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 in 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.120
 is the work that is done when the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.660
 mother plant has fructified for it 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.790
 bags or covers are placed covering the 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.440
 cluster in acorn is intended 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.150
 protect the cluster from the attack of 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.510
 insects birds and bats that could 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.050
 cause damage that would decrease the quality 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.050
 of the fruit 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.740
 in je 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.540
 allows to hold the cover on the part 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.150
 top of the spine preferably over 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.480
 a knot that always presents 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.930
 this on tape that is made with ribbons 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.490
 of colors what allows to identify the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.430
 age of the fruit 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.210
 part of the tape should be visible 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.330
 to facilitate harvesting 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.729
 in this way you can have a record 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.310
 of ages and schedule so 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.310
 efficient harvest 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.519
 Acorn removal 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.050
 this is a job that must be done 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:14.480
 when the last hand is formed 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.080
 consists of manually cutting the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.600
 Acorn to 20 centimeters from the last 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.520
 hand 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.610
 avoiding the use of tools 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.010
 its effect is manifested in a better 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.520
 filling of the fruits that make up the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.390
 cluster 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:37.530
 and an increase in its weight 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.530
 you see flowers 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.690
 It is done after sleep and ty 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.290
 consists of removing the flowers that are 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.690
 at the ends of each finger using 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.500
 the palm of the hand 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.180
 of not doing this practice the flowers 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:03.430
 they dry and hardens 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.430
 causing damage to the upper fingers 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.340
 finger and hand removal 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.020
 is the removal of the lateral fingers 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.660
 of the main hands and also the 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.060
 last bunch hands with the 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.350
 purpose that the remaining hands 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.950
 gain more size and weight 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.380
 thus improving the quality of the fruit 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.380
 destined to export markets 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.439
 harvest 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.010
 the harvest criterion depends on several 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.370
 factors such as for example 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.780
 the age of the fruit the caliber of the 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.660
 fingers and the demand for fruit 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.110
 the harvest must be done with much 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.990
 care in order not to mistreat fruit 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.560
 a chisel is used to cut the 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.020
 cluster rachis 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.480
 which is received in a table 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.050
 padded for transport to the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.050
 baler 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.230
 postharvest 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.880
 the harvested fruits are hung in the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.290
 cluster area of the packer 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.440
 then proceed to disassemble 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.670
 using the desman worships 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.710
 these hands of five or six fruits are 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.300
 will be placing in the first tub 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:46.600
 containing water 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:49.720
 for sponge washing and copying 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.660
 then the hands of the first 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.170
 tub are removed and placed in the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.529
 second tub after elimination of the 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:02.829
 fruit that presents damage 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:07.180
 this tub contains a solution of al 

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:10.240
 man for the healing of the crown 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:13.650
 here they will remain at rest for a 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.680
 15 minute period 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.320
 then an operator is placing 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.220
 hands in plastic fountains to be 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.169
 heavy this weight must be 18 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:30.389
 700 grams 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:33.849
 then it is transported to the packing area 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:36.020
 where a pre-fumigation with 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.080
 sponge 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:42.990
 Then it is fumigated by sprinkling 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:46.420
 to avoid crown rot 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.590
 the fruits are labeled 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.920
 and bagged 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.870
 and finally packed in boxes of 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.910
 paperboard 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.510
 according to the policies of each 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:03.010
 exporting company some do the 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.010
 vacuum packing 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.670
 and marketing 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:14.029
 the banana is a product perished so 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:16.629
 that its marketing requires a 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:19.609
 efficient logistics throughout the chain 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:23.560
 to ensure that the product reaches the 

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:25.830
 consumer in optimal state 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.900
 let's remember 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.230
 that if we perform adequate and 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.450
 timely cultural work and 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.800
 the work to improve the quality of 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.150
 the fruit like 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:42.969
 in 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:46.810
 in tape eliminating acorns 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:50.830
 finger and hand removal 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.460
 in length we will obtain fruits of good 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:57.610
 quality 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.610
 and therefore better profits 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.940
