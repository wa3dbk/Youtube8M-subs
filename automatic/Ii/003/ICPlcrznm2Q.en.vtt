00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.540 
that would be causing them some some
problems<00:02:16.940> like<00:02:18.160> liabilities<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:19.250> call<00:02:19.459> it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
problems like liabilities I call it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.470 
problems like liabilities I call it
liabilities<00:02:20.030> where<00:02:20.180> they've<00:02:20.300> hurt

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
liabilities where they've hurt

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.240 
liabilities where they've hurt
themselves<00:02:20.690> or<00:02:21.110> or<00:02:21.500> might<00:02:21.709> even<00:02:21.860> have<00:02:22.040> some

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
themselves or or might even have some

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.800 
themselves or or might even have some
type<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.550> birth<00:02:22.700> defect<00:02:23.060> or<00:02:23.180> whatever<00:02:23.390> then<00:02:23.780> we

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
type of birth defect or whatever then we

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.300 
type of birth defect or whatever then we
can<00:02:24.049> work<00:02:24.200> around<00:02:24.319> those<00:02:24.650> things<00:02:24.890> because<00:02:25.159> we

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
can work around those things because we

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.380 
can work around those things because we
have<00:02:25.430> parameters<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.000> we're<00:02:26.090> going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.269> help

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
have parameters and we're going to help

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.000 
have parameters and we're going to help
them<00:02:26.569> find<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.959> good<00:02:27.319> set<00:02:27.470> up<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> good<00:02:27.830> swing

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
them find a good set up in a good swing

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.620 
them find a good set up in a good swing
but<00:02:28.159> barring

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
but barring

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.260 
but barring
issues<00:02:29.430> they're<00:02:30.430> basically<00:02:30.850> have<00:02:31.120> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
issues they're basically have the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.640 
issues they're basically have the
ability<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:31.630> swing<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:31.990> club<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.470> same

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
ability to swing the club the same

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.070 
ability to swing the club the same
correct<00:02:32.950> way<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.340> then<00:02:33.730> I<00:02:33.820> did<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.210> also<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:34.990> I

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
correct way and then I did I also then I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.450 
correct way and then I did I also then I
also<00:02:35.260> make<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> statement<00:02:35.950> about<00:02:36.160> something

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
also make a statement about something

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.440 
also make a statement about something
else<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.810> terms<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:39.060> father<00:02:40.060> talking

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
else the in terms of the father talking

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.760 
else the in terms of the father talking
about<00:02:40.630> his<00:02:40.840> wife<00:02:41.020> or<00:02:41.050> kids<00:02:41.440> whether<00:02:41.590> they

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
about his wife or kids whether they

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.220 
about his wife or kids whether they
should<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.310> same<00:02:42.490> way<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.870> laws<00:02:44.050> of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
should do it the same way the laws of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
should do it the same way the laws of
physics<00:02:44.320> are<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.650> same<00:02:44.740> for<00:02:45.070> everybody

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
physics are the same for everybody

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.050 
physics are the same for everybody
alright<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:48.280> ball<00:02:48.460> doesn't<00:02:48.490> always<00:02:48.910> hold

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
alright so the ball doesn't always hold

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.330 
alright so the ball doesn't always hold
in<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.300> club<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:50.410> laws<00:02:50.590> don't<00:02:50.890> care<00:02:51.070> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
in the club and the laws don't care the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.240 
in the club and the laws don't care the
laws<00:02:51.460> of<00:02:51.640> physics<00:02:51.930> don't<00:02:52.930> care<00:02:53.110> about<00:02:53.250> who's

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
laws of physics don't care about who's

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.340 
laws of physics don't care about who's
holding<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> club<00:02:54.850> so<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.810> those<00:02:56.080> things

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
holding the club so all those things

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.650 
holding the club so all those things
apply<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.190> yes<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.790> want<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.060> use<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.360> want<00:02:58.540> to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
apply so yes you want to use you want to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.270 
apply so yes you want to use you want to
use<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.930> same<00:02:59.140> swing<00:02:59.380> because<00:02:59.770> if<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.100> take

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
use the same swing because if you take

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.500 
use the same swing because if you take
the<00:03:00.430> club<00:03:00.580> straight<00:03:00.910> back<00:03:01.090> as<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.390> were

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
the club straight back as you were

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.570 
the club straight back as you were
implying<00:03:01.900> which<00:03:02.650> is<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.340> straight

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
implying which is like this straight

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.890 
implying which is like this straight
back<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.940> through<00:03:04.000> you're<00:03:04.570> actually

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
back and through you're actually

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.410 
back and through you're actually
bringing<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.260> back<00:03:05.410> shut<00:03:05.710> okay<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:07.300> you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
bringing it back shut okay and if you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.820 
bringing it back shut okay and if you
take<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.630> straight<00:03:07.900> back<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.320> stay<00:03:08.530> through

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
take a straight back and stay through

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.980 
take a straight back and stay through
and<00:03:09.040> taking<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.670> back<00:03:09.700> shut<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.630> are<00:03:10.780> you

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
and taking it back shut you are you

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.380 
and taking it back shut you are you
there's<00:03:11.230> no<00:03:11.350> rotation<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.550> club<00:03:13.000> you're

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
there's no rotation so the club you're

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.460 
there's no rotation so the club you're
just<00:03:13.600> basically<00:03:13.870> going<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.230> come<00:03:14.380> straight

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
just basically going to come straight

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.960 
just basically going to come straight
down<00:03:14.680> and<00:03:14.980> be<00:03:15.070> steep<00:03:15.310> on<00:03:15.460> the<00:03:15.550> ball<00:03:15.700> because

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
down and be steep on the ball because

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.630 
down and be steep on the ball because
why<00:03:16.150> your<00:03:16.660> backhand<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.980> lower<00:03:18.190> hand<00:03:18.490> which

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
why your backhand your lower hand which

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.680 
why your backhand your lower hand which
were<00:03:18.820> right-handed<00:03:19.030> would<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.540> right

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
were right-handed would be the right

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.660 
were right-handed would be the right
hand<00:03:19.900> left<00:03:20.140> for<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.320> left-hander<00:03:20.770> is<00:03:20.890> on<00:03:21.400> top

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
hand left for a left-hander is on top

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.700 
hand left for a left-hander is on top
it's<00:03:21.940> not<00:03:22.030> level<00:03:22.510> they're<00:03:22.930> not<00:03:22.960> parallel<00:03:23.500> to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
it's not level they're not parallel to

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.490 
it's not level they're not parallel to
the<00:03:23.860> ground<00:03:24.100> which<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:24.870> which<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.170> second

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
the ground which is which is the second

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.170 
the ground which is which is the second
secret<00:03:26.680> pawns<00:03:26.980> must<00:03:27.220> be<00:03:27.370> perpendicular<00:03:27.910> to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
secret pawns must be perpendicular to

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.910 
secret pawns must be perpendicular to
the<00:03:28.330> ground<00:03:28.480> threw<00:03:28.690> off<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:28.960> swing<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.410> think<00:03:29.860> I

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
the ground threw off the swing I think I

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.140 
the ground threw off the swing I think I
just<00:03:30.100> said<00:03:30.250> parallel<00:03:30.640> they<00:03:30.820> got<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.060> be

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
just said parallel they got to be

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.940 
just said parallel they got to be
perpendicular<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.810> ground<00:03:32.020> here<00:03:32.560> they're

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
perpendicular to the ground here they're

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.250 
perpendicular to the ground here they're
closer<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.460> parallel<00:03:33.910> because<00:03:34.210> the<00:03:34.690> lower

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
closer to parallel because the lower

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.600 
closer to parallel because the lower
hand<00:03:35.530> or<00:03:35.650> right<00:03:35.740> hand<00:03:35.800> again<00:03:36.130> as<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.280> said<00:03:36.340> for

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
hand or right hand again as I said for

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.980 
hand or right hand again as I said for
Ryan<00:03:36.790> there<00:03:36.910> would<00:03:37.000> be<00:03:37.030> on<00:03:37.210> top<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.660> it's

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
Ryan there would be on top and it's

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.450 
Ryan there would be on top and it's
pretty<00:03:38.140> much<00:03:38.230> matching<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.830> club<00:03:39.010> face<00:03:39.220> right

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
pretty much matching the club face right

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.280 
pretty much matching the club face right
so<00:03:39.820> from<00:03:40.060> there<00:03:40.210> all<00:03:40.360> you've<00:03:40.540> got<00:03:40.690> is<00:03:40.810> chopped

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
so from there all you've got is chopped

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.870 
so from there all you've got is chopped
down<00:03:41.470> on<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.740> ball<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:42.040> you're<00:03:42.340> very<00:03:42.520> likely

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
down on the ball and you're very likely

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.600 
down on the ball and you're very likely
gonna<00:03:43.510> be<00:03:43.780> QB<00:03:44.470> outside<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.130> line<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.490> not

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
gonna be QB outside the line and not

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.550 
gonna be QB outside the line and not
over<00:03:45.910> your<00:03:46.030> toe<00:03:46.180> line<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.230> wouldn't<00:03:47.470> have

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
over your toe line so you wouldn't have

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.290 
over your toe line so you wouldn't have
had<00:03:47.680> much<00:03:47.920> rotation<00:03:48.490> at<00:03:48.580> all<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.850> get<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.120> club

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
had much rotation at all to get the club

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.780 
had much rotation at all to get the club
here<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.020> that<00:03:50.170> they<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.500> be<00:03:50.680> squaring<00:03:51.490> up<00:03:51.700> to

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
here so that they can be squaring up to

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.610 
here so that they can be squaring up to
the<00:03:51.850> club<00:03:52.030> at<00:03:52.150> impact<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:52.720> then<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.320> going

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
the club at impact and then then going

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.660 
the club at impact and then then going
through<00:03:53.650> which<00:03:53.920> is<00:03:54.040> going<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.280> give<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.520> a

more solid hit in the center of the club

face where the sweet spot is now again

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.449

if<00:04:01.690> you're<00:04:01.840> if<00:04:02.050> you're<00:04:02.200> using<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.709> healing<00:04:03.340> toe

weighted Club and the sweet spots will

be more to the toe it might be out there

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.830 
be more to the toe it might be out there
but<00:04:06.490> you'll<00:04:06.640> feel<00:04:06.850> a<00:04:06.880> much<00:04:07.090> more<00:04:07.270> solid<00:04:07.480> hit

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
but you'll feel a much more solid hit

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.380 
but you'll feel a much more solid hit
it'll<00:04:08.560> be<00:04:08.650> out<00:04:09.130> towards<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.520> toe<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:10.150> you're

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
it'll be out towards the toe so you're

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.270 
it'll be out towards the toe so you're
coming<00:04:10.570> down<00:04:10.750> if<00:04:10.990> you're<00:04:11.590> if<00:04:11.830> you're<00:04:12.010> keeping

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
coming down if you're if you're keeping

coming down if you're if you're keeping
it<00:04:12.430> squared<00:04:12.700> going<00:04:12.910> back<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.300> through<00:04:13.510> you're

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
it squared going back and through you're

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.510 
it squared going back and through you're
basically<00:04:14.320> chopped<00:04:14.590> down<00:04:14.800> and<00:04:15.070> pushing

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
basically chopped down and pushing

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.580 
basically chopped down and pushing
through<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.239> you'd<00:04:16.420> still<00:04:16.690> want<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.989> have<00:04:17.170> you

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
through so you'd still want to have you

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.140 
through so you'd still want to have you
still<00:04:17.859> want<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.100> have<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.310> rotation<00:04:18.880> into<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
still want to have a rotation into the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.150 
still want to have a rotation into the
forward<00:04:19.330> mint<00:04:19.570> and<00:04:19.660> up<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> tree<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.320> almost

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
forward mint and up the tree I almost

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.500 
forward mint and up the tree I almost
caught<00:04:21.430> myself<00:04:21.580> I'll<00:04:21.850> just<00:04:21.970> about<00:04:22.150> ready<00:04:22.390> to

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
caught myself I'll just about ready to

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.700 
caught myself I'll just about ready to
chip<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.930> way<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.350> probably<00:04:23.470> wouldn't

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
chip that way but it probably wouldn't

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.200 
chip that way but it probably wouldn't
hurt<00:04:23.920> anything<00:04:24.130> because<00:04:24.760> there's<00:04:25.000> enough

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
hurt anything because there's enough

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.000 
hurt anything because there's enough
yard<00:04:25.450> over<00:04:25.600> there<00:04:25.720> too<00:04:26.050> for<00:04:26.380> just<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.620> chip<00:04:26.800> shot

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
yard over there too for just a chip shot

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.550 
yard over there too for just a chip shot
but<00:04:27.160> I'll<00:04:27.250> go<00:04:27.370> into<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.700> net<00:04:27.880> now<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.720> here<00:04:29.440> is

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
but I'll go into the net now so here is

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.470 
but I'll go into the net now so here is
where<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:30.010> down<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:30.940> through<00:04:31.060> shot<00:04:31.300> would<00:04:31.450> be

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
where a down and through shot would be

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.780 
where a down and through shot would be
you<00:04:31.990> take<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.470> up<00:04:32.560> if<00:04:32.920> you<00:04:32.980> keep<00:04:33.370> it<00:04:33.550> kind<00:04:33.730> of

you're still going to come back you have
the<00:05:01.580> same<00:05:01.790> rotation<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.450> over<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.690> towline

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
the same rotation to over to towline

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.950 
the same rotation to over to towline
rotate<00:05:03.830> here<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.250> then<00:05:04.639> rotate<00:05:04.760> there<00:05:05.240> all

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
rotate here and then rotate there all

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.360 
rotate here and then rotate there all
right<00:05:06.110> now<00:05:06.230> if<00:05:06.320> I<00:05:06.410> want<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.680> hit<00:05:06.770> it<00:05:06.830> lower<00:05:07.100> I

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
right now if I want to hit it lower I

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.070 
right now if I want to hit it lower I
can<00:05:07.880> put<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.120> ball<00:05:08.270> back<00:05:08.450> a<00:05:08.510> little<00:05:08.750> bit<00:05:08.930> more

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
can put the ball back a little bit more

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.300 
can put the ball back a little bit more
of<00:05:09.169> my<00:05:09.260> stand<00:05:09.500> cause<00:05:09.620> that<00:05:09.770> one<00:05:09.889> launched<00:05:10.220> it

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
of my stand cause that one launched it

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.159 
of my stand cause that one launched it
about<00:05:10.370> here<00:05:10.820> so<00:05:11.480> what's<00:05:11.630> that<00:05:11.690> one<00:05:11.960> Taylor

about here so what's that one Taylor

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.870 
about here so what's that one Taylor
really<00:05:12.380> low<00:05:12.620> like<00:05:12.770> I'm<00:05:12.919> right<00:05:13.130> here<00:05:13.490> I'm<00:05:13.639> gonna

really low like I'm right here I'm gonna

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.070 
really low like I'm right here I'm gonna
try<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.120> drop<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.480> ball<00:05:14.660> on<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.900> green

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
try to drop the ball on the green

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.810 
try to drop the ball on the green
somewhere<00:05:15.440> about<00:05:15.620> there<00:05:15.860> and<00:05:16.100> let<00:05:16.460> it<00:05:16.580> run<00:05:16.669> out

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
somewhere about there and let it run out

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.490 
somewhere about there and let it run out
I'll<00:05:17.150> put<00:05:17.389> it<00:05:17.510> back<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.690> little<00:05:17.990> bit<00:05:18.080> more<00:05:18.290> I'll

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
I'll put it back a little bit more I'll

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.719 
I'll put it back a little bit more I'll
get<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.710> little<00:05:18.860> bit<00:05:18.950> more<00:05:19.070> forward<00:05:19.310> but<00:05:19.669> I'm

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
get a little bit more forward but I'm

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.890 
get a little bit more forward but I'm
still<00:05:19.970> going<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.210> come<00:05:20.330> back<00:05:20.540> a<00:05:20.570> little<00:05:20.780> bit

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
still going to come back a little bit

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.730 
still going to come back a little bit
toe<00:05:21.110> up<00:05:21.290> and<00:05:22.070> just<00:05:22.280> keep<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.580> club<00:05:22.790> lower

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
toe up and just keep the club lower

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.200 
toe up and just keep the club lower
coming<00:05:24.740> through<00:05:24.979> and<00:05:25.190> trying<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:25.970> go<00:05:26.060> into

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
coming through and trying to go into

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.450 
coming through and trying to go into
catcher's<00:05:26.900> mitt<00:05:27.020> toe<00:05:27.200> up<00:05:27.380> so<00:05:27.620> I'm<00:05:27.889> maintaining

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
catcher's mitt toe up so I'm maintaining

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.490 
catcher's mitt toe up so I'm maintaining
my<00:05:28.639> rotation<00:05:29.270> so<00:05:29.389> I<00:05:29.450> can<00:05:29.600> square<00:05:29.840> up<00:05:30.020> hit<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
my rotation so I can square up hit the

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.710 
my rotation so I can square up hit the
ball<00:05:30.650> solidly<00:05:31.130> get<00:05:31.550> good<00:05:31.760> solid<00:05:32.060> contact<00:05:32.450> and

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
ball solidly get good solid contact and

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.780 
ball solidly get good solid contact and
therefore<00:05:33.200> get<00:05:33.350> a<00:05:33.380> better<00:05:33.560> more<00:05:34.310> solid<00:05:34.639> hit

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
therefore get a better more solid hit

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.430 
therefore get a better more solid hit
that<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.030> ball<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.240> gonna<00:05:35.389> react<00:05:35.660> properly<00:05:35.960> as

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
that the ball is gonna react properly as

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.750 
that the ball is gonna react properly as
far<00:05:36.710> as<00:05:36.800> going<00:05:37.070> in<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.280> air<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.520> especially

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
far as going in the air and especially

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.370 
far as going in the air and especially
hitting<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.150> ground<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.510> rolling<00:05:38.660> out<00:05:38.870> which

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
hitting the ground and rolling out which

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.250 
hitting the ground and rolling out which

chipping<00:06:01.880> is<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:02.000> different<00:06:02.330> game<00:06:02.450> a<00:06:02.690> little

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
chipping is a different game a little

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.870 
chipping is a different game a little
bit<00:06:03.140> different<00:06:03.470> setups<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:03.950> and<00:06:04.130> positions<00:06:04.729> to

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
bit different setups in and positions to

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.940 
bit different setups in and positions to
do<00:06:05.000> it<00:06:05.120> but<00:06:05.450> you<00:06:05.600> still<00:06:05.810> need<00:06:06.140> that<00:06:06.320> rotation

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
do it but you still need that rotation

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.890 
do it but you still need that rotation
you<00:06:07.280> still<00:06:07.580> need<00:06:07.729> that<00:06:07.760> Club<00:06:08.090> rotating

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
you still need that Club rotating

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.540 
you still need that Club rotating
through<00:06:09.140> just<00:06:09.830> like<00:06:09.950> we<00:06:10.070> talked<00:06:10.220> about<00:06:10.250> in

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
through just like we talked about in

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.409 
through just like we talked about in
putting<00:06:10.820> where<00:06:10.940> it's<00:06:11.030> a<00:06:11.060> little<00:06:11.240> bit<00:06:11.330> of

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
putting where it's a little bit of

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:11.920 
putting where it's a little bit of
arcing

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
arcing

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.360 
arcing
there's<00:06:12.229> still<00:06:12.440> a<00:06:12.500> little<00:06:12.710> bit<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.250> rotation

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
there's still a little bit of rotation

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.820 
there's still a little bit of rotation
which<00:06:14.150> has<00:06:14.270> gone<00:06:14.389> a<00:06:14.450> lot<00:06:14.660> of<00:06:14.810> clubface<00:06:15.139> the

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
which has gone a lot of clubface the

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.870 
which has gone a lot of clubface the
arms<00:06:16.100> and<00:06:16.220> hands<00:06:16.340> to<00:06:16.460> rotate<00:06:16.760> properly

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
arms and hands to rotate properly

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.760 
arms and hands to rotate properly
squared<00:06:17.419> up<00:06:17.539> at<00:06:17.660> impact<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:18.289> go<00:06:18.560> through

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
squared up at impact and go through

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.379 
squared up at impact and go through
because<00:06:18.950> we<00:06:19.070> know<00:06:19.220> it's<00:06:19.460> always<00:06:19.669> guaranteed

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
because we know it's always guaranteed

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.300 
because we know it's always guaranteed
that<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:20.990> hands<00:06:21.200> will<00:06:21.380> come<00:06:21.530> back<00:06:21.680> to<00:06:22.130> dead

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
that the hands will come back to dead

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.650 
that the hands will come back to dead
