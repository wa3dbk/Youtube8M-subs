whatever<00:01:01.620> order<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.070> want<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.699> like<00:01:02.790> I<00:01:02.940> was

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
whatever order you want but like I was

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.570 
whatever order you want but like I was
saying<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:03.570> would<00:01:03.720> put<00:01:03.960> probably<00:01:04.680> yellow<00:01:05.339> down

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
saying I would put probably yellow down

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.609 
saying I would put probably yellow down
first<00:01:05.910> just<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> light

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
first just so that it would be a light

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.590 
first just so that it would be a light
color<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.160> put<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.670> frosting<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
color to put your frosting on and it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
color to put your frosting on and it
would<00:01:09.690> look<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> little<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.290> prettier<00:01:10.430> but

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
would look a little bit prettier but

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.480 
would look a little bit prettier but
you'll<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.790> layer<00:01:12.030> up<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.450> colors<00:01:13.490> however

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
you'll just layer up your colors however

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120 
you'll just layer up your colors however
you<00:01:14.759> want<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.840> keep<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.170> mind<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you want and just keep in mind that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
you want and just keep in mind that
you're<00:01:17.310> still<00:01:17.520> only<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> fill

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
they first went on so that's one thing I

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:23.490 
they first went on so that's one thing I

there and stiffen up that icing and
here's<00:03:25.750> where<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:25.989> noticed<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.500> it's

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
here's where I noticed that it's

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.800 
here's where I noticed that it's
starting<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.040> happen<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.150> stick<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.720> the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
starting to happen so I stick it in the

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.069 
starting to happen so I stick it in the
freezer<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:30.519> while<00:03:31.090> that's<00:03:31.239> in<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.780> take

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
freezer and while that's in there I take

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.259 
freezer and while that's in there I take
my<00:03:32.560> coconut<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.459> put<00:03:33.639> some<00:03:33.670> green<00:03:34.030> food

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.300 
my coconut and I put some green food
coloring<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.109> just<00:03:35.260> shake<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.500> up<00:03:35.769> this

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
coloring in it and just shake it up this

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.770 
coloring in it and just shake it up this
is<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.609> go<00:03:36.730> around<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> edge<00:03:37.329> of<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.569> cake

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
is to go around the edge of the cake

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.229 
is to go around the edge of the cake
once<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.410> finished<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:39.130> pull<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:39.819> back<00:03:39.849> out

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
once it's finished I pull it back out

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.210 
once it's finished I pull it back out
and<00:03:40.510> I<00:03:40.569> pour<00:03:40.840> my<00:03:40.959> last<00:03:41.230> color<00:03:41.650> on<00:03:41.889> there<00:03:42.099> which

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
and I pour my last color on there which

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.140 
and I pour my last color on there which
was<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.549> pink<00:03:42.849> and<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:44.470> really<00:03:45.010> wish<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.340> had<00:03:45.579> put

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
was the pink and I really wish I had put

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.520 
was the pink and I really wish I had put
it<00:03:46.239> in<00:03:46.359> but<00:03:46.540> put<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.109> freezer<00:03:47.349> in

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
it in but put it in the freezer in

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.809 
it in but put it in the freezer in
between<00:03:47.799> each<00:03:47.980> one<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.370> them<00:03:48.459> because<00:03:48.639> it<00:03:48.790> just

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
between each one of them because it just

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.330 
between each one of them because it just
looks<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.329> much<00:03:49.359> better<00:03:49.720> with<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
looks so much better with that the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.670
