00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.640
 we continue with buses and trucks and now 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.740
 We are going to bring you the second part of a 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.920
 special report that has caused 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.750
 very much interest and it's about the model 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.300
 miner of international works stars 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.910
 7,600 with the novelty that brings 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.699
 tractocamiones uses the super hopper 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.859
 go ahead Jorge delra of the irrigation who is 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.260
 the commercial manager of trucks 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.590
 use to tell us everything at 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.120
 respect once more tractors 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 bringing news 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.590
 this is a hopper entirely of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.930
 aluminum in which it has a capacity 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.050
 of between cubic meters to be able 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.719
 recharge 40 tons of material that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 implies that it charges almost 3 to 3.5 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.010
 tons more than any other 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.559
 traditional the other great advantage that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.699
 has is that the suspension you have is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.270
 a suspension 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.550
 integrated hendrickson means that 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.649
 you do not have to have the suspension and the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.410
 separate shaft and lean on the chair 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.930
 of the suspension and have a mooring but 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.230
 in this case it is a single set and not 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.810
 need more 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.730
 bushings are larger in diameter the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 handling height is superior and the 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.680
 boat tilt and bounce too 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.380
 then that also gives us ways 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.060
 sinuous can go much better and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.900
 have greater stability in the product 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.450
 if I compare with the other hoppers this one 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.460
 tijeral not the simple fact that you have a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.860
 larger opening is not going to have a greater 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.960
 stability is as if I will gather my 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.760
 feet and I moved I'm going to lose a 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.140
 stability but if I open my feet 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.390
 obviously I will have a greater 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.250
 stability the system that has 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.630
 very important stability has a 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.580
 sensor that when making the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.620
 opening so that the turning is done 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.360
 may lose stability or in a few 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.700
 words will tell if that is not 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.050
 in in the proper position and once you 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.030
 one already has the right position already 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.460
 can work the hydraulic system that 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.770
 it's a very, very good security system 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.260
 timely the inside of the hopper 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.230
 It has a non -high strength polymer 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.630
 is a long chain polymer in the 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.899
 which makes the product can also 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.880
 not evacuate much more quickly than in 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.180
 any other type of material where 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.380
 can reload importance this 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.710
 the transporting friends of this 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.430
 good new product here this 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.250
 obviously in our offices 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.960
 leading in also in any of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.370
 another in our branches that we have 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.300
 nationwide or else to our 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.790
 main on the road 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.310
 central kilometer 3.5 where what 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.530
 we will gladly attend a very 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.560
 special for all who make up 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.530
 This great Peruvian truck tractor company 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.400
 use this December 5th we will be 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.440
 together for the 18 years of 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.090
 truck tractors use led by me 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.090
