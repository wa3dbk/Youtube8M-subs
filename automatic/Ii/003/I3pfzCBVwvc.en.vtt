and that he wanted to get on the beige
Phillip<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:52.140> because<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:52.980> were<00:00:53.039> redoing

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
Phillip show because they were redoing

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.180 
Phillip show because they were redoing
it<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.000> Dante<00:00:54.390> Nero<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.739> figured<00:00:56.160> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
it with Dante Nero and he figured that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.639 
it with Dante Nero and he figured that
you<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.789> he<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.239> just<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.600> regular<00:00:57.809> youtuber

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you know he was just a regular youtuber

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
you know he was just a regular youtuber
and<00:00:58.829> he<00:00:59.219> couldn't<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> contact<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.329> him

and he couldn't get in contact with him

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.569 
and he couldn't get in contact with him
so<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.780> figured<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.440> he<00:01:01.559> did<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:01.980> six<00:01:02.430> or

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
so he figured that if he did be six or

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.289 
so he figured that if he did be six or
seven<00:01:02.910> videos<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:04.350> know<00:01:04.470> somehow<00:01:05.299> Dante

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
seven videos that you know somehow Dante

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.679

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
Nero will find out and magically put him

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.240
