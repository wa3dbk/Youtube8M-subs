well as a metal turret this turret is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.280 
well as a metal turret this turret is
the<00:00:41.340> Henschel<00:00:41.730> turret<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.600> it's<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the Henschel turret so it's not the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
the Henschel turret so it's not the
Porsche<00:00:43.710> turret<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.309> usually<00:00:44.489> run<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.149> on

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
Porsche turret that we usually run on on

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.200 
Porsche turret that we usually run on on
the<00:00:45.780> Tigan<00:00:46.289> tanks<00:00:46.559> itself<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the Tigan tanks itself so this is a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
the Tigan tanks itself so this is a
different<00:00:48.600> style<00:00:48.870> turret<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.340> since

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
different style turret but if that since

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.400 
different style turret but if that since
it's<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> act<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.750> function<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.230> same

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
it's going to act and function the same

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.549 
it's going to act and function the same

little<00:01:51.329> switch<00:01:51.540> we're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> go<00:01:52.740> ahead

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
little switch we're going to go ahead

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.080 
little switch we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:53.040> hit<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.189> switch<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.390> open<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.409> tank<00:01:55.649> up

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
and hit that switch and open the tank up

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.190 
and hit that switch and open the tank up
we're<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.420> inside<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.079> a

then<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.640> course<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.030> got<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> airsoft<00:02:42.630> in

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
then of course we got the airsoft in

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.570 
then of course we got the airsoft in
here<00:02:43.400> this<00:02:44.400> model<00:02:45.030> will<00:02:45.240> feature<00:02:46.580> barrel

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
here this model will feature barrel

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.510 
here this model will feature barrel
recoil<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:48.300> infrared<00:02:48.660> loss<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.280> do

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
recoil on infrared loss so if you do

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.670 
recoil on infrared loss so if you do
have<00:02:50.760> an<00:02:50.880> infrared<00:02:51.180> model<00:02:51.630> your<00:02:51.960> barrel<00:02:52.380> will

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
have an infrared model your barrel will

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.150 
have an infrared model your barrel will
recoil<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.850> airsoft<00:02:54.360> ones<00:02:54.750> will<00:02:55.320> still<00:02:55.740> not

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
recoil the airsoft ones will still not

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.480 
recoil the airsoft ones will still not
recoil<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.970> moment<00:02:57.920> we<00:02:58.920> are<00:02:59.040> looking<00:02:59.250> into

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
recoil at the moment we are looking into

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.460 
recoil at the moment we are looking into
this<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.300> it's<00:03:00.480> not<00:03:00.540> something<00:03:00.900> no<00:03:01.110> problem

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
this but it's not something no problem

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.390 
this but it's not something no problem
yet<00:03:02.990> so<00:03:03.990> in<00:03:04.350> other<00:03:04.500> words<00:03:04.770> let's<00:03:05.010> look<00:03:05.130> at<00:03:05.250> your

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
yet so in other words let's look at your

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.760 
yet so in other words let's look at your
on-off<00:03:05.670> switch<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.990> new<00:03:07.140> on-off<00:03:07.410> switch<00:03:07.620> is

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
on-off switch the new on-off switch is

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.010 
on-off switch the new on-off switch is
going<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.980> be<00:03:08.040> right<00:03:08.280> here<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.600> can<00:03:09.630> flip

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
going to be right here so we can flip

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.320 
going to be right here so we can flip
that<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:10.470> that's<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.280> on/off<00:03:11.760> for<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> tank

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
that and that's the on/off for the tank

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:20.720 
that and that's the on/off for the tank
now<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.370> there<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.630> your<00:03:19.260> king<00:03:19.470> tiger<00:03:19.770> with<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
now so there is your king tiger with the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.000 
now so there is your king tiger with the
Henschel<00:03:21.090> turret<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.959> everyone<00:03:22.410> asked<00:03:22.860> me

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
