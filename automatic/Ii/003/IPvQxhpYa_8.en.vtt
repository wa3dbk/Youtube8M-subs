00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.350
 cover with lid and leave on slow 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 fire to boil well would you 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.240
 defrost and together seven 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.300
 vitamins minerals that are preserved 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.979
 they are well preserved you see that 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.979
 straight all as a living 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.950
 when it is thawed very much 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.950
 can try very tasty and 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 leave 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.310
 when compute is already in this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.740
 I fill sugar well when heated 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.020
 me this is so seven to eight spoons on this 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:59.480
 pot with a slide and leave for now 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.470
 don't even touch her fruit nothing she 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:08.690
 will gradually heat up and 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.440
 I sleep up to 7 liters 8 table rescued 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.440
 so here 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.100
 a certain temperature keeps too i 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:24.040
 now translate into a smaller warrior this is not 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:29.240
 so important now he will begin to boil 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 even boils I spit out in order to how 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.370
 would still improve the taste and turns off 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.860
 turned off the fire 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:45.769
 usually if we do, we still compote 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:49.340
 leave it leaves cool and here 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.950
 these here berries are all thrown out of windows 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.170
 here we drink but sometimes i do like this 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.300
 as I show you now sometimes I 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:04.540
 I collect right now the compote itself is hot 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:09.560
 and set him aside 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:17.090
 pieces of fruit and the very liquid of this 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:22.570
 I do another jelly we got 4 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:27.200
 liters of compote now with the remaining 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:30.540
 berries and compote I make 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:36.359
 jelly beat up 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:45.510
 what's left to add a couple 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:49.159
 spoons of sugar on 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.310
 water I grow a couple of spoons with a slide 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.930
 starch ordinary starch 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.790
 potato 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.599
 put on fire and when it comes to 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.310
 boil 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:09.209
 I'll pour out the starch and immediately the berries 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:13.010
 frozen strawberries like that 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:22.560
 turned out after we shot him down 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:26.340
 I am now growing a glass of water with one 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.500
 a tablespoon of starch starch take 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.620
 a little more yarn 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.190
 it's a half well two tablespoons without 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.590
 slides 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:40.440
 Well, starch is very hard to take without a slide 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:42.389
 so what a spoon and a half and 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:47.520
 that's when she is already boiling 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:50.250
 including a little more starch 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.669
 stir constantly so that he is well 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.669
 dissolved 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:19.850
 it is felt that he is already a bush and in this 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:26.090
 moment of god 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:30.080
