00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
first of three germanium pedals that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.710 
first of three germanium pedals that
were<00:00:53.710> building<00:00:53.950> in<00:00:54.160> Los<00:00:54.310> Angeles<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.450> first

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:55.720 
were building in Los Angeles the first

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.290 
were building in Los Angeles the first
is<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.990> color<00:00:56.320> boost<00:00:56.560> which<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.460> loosely<00:00:58.090> based

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
is a color boost which is loosely based

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.540 
is a color boost which is loosely based
on<00:00:58.720> our<00:00:58.900> favorite<00:00:59.170> old<00:00:59.530> treble<00:01:00.040> booster<00:01:00.370> from

transistor<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:04.239> thing<00:01:04.420> that's<00:01:04.600> odd<00:01:04.809> about

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
transistor the thing that's odd about

parts and these are hand wired pedals

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.550 
parts and these are hand wired pedals
they're<00:01:10.360> not<00:01:10.510> made<00:01:10.720> with<00:01:10.930> little<00:01:11.170> computer

how they were made back in the 60s so of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.830 
how they were made back in the 60s so of
the<00:01:18.220> famous<00:01:18.430> germanium<00:01:19.119> pedals<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.509> are<00:01:19.630> out

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
the famous germanium pedals that are out

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.480 
the famous germanium pedals that are out
there<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.229> big<00:01:20.410> three<00:01:20.710> this<00:01:20.890> was<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.250> first

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
there the big three this was the first

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.790 
there the big three this was the first

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
one it was a treble booster it gets a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.490 
one it was a treble booster it gets a
fantastic<00:01:24.610> distortion<00:01:25.180> we<00:01:25.960> also<00:01:26.140> put<00:01:26.470> some

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500

comes<00:01:33.430> out<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.420> first<00:01:34.690> let's<00:01:34.899> start<00:01:34.960> with<00:01:35.290> my

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
comes out so first let's start with my

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.260 
comes out so first let's start with my
basic<00:01:35.680> sound<00:01:36.130> I'm<00:01:36.310> playing<00:01:36.550> here<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:36.940> a<00:01:37.030> Paul

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
basic sound I'm playing here just a Paul

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so you can hear the classic germanium

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.770 
so you can hear the classic germanium
nasal<00:02:08.069> quality<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.300> move<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.750> down

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
nasal quality to it I can move it down

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:18.320 
nasal quality to it I can move it down
to<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> lower<00:02:10.560> register

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.850 

we<00:02:18.930> can<00:02:19.080> go<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.440> way<00:02:19.470> up<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.770> very

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
we can go all the way up to a very

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:51.600 
we can go all the way up to a very
almost<00:02:20.280> cocked<00:02:20.700> wah-wah<00:02:21.180> sound

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
booster now with it on I end up with

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:11.479 
booster now with it on I end up with
this

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.770 

and<00:03:12.489> here's<00:03:12.670> what<00:03:12.879> the<00:03:12.970> guitar<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.390> doing

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
and here's what the guitar is doing

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.369 
and here's what the guitar is doing
without<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.230> pedal<00:03:14.409> right<00:03:19.019> now<00:03:20.019> with<00:03:20.230> my
