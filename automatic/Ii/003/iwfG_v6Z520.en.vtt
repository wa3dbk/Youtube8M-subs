in this country too it really does still
make<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:56.839> think<00:01:01.300> but<00:01:02.300> it's<00:01:02.600> also<00:01:02.809> very<00:01:03.290> much

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
make you think but it's also very much

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.670 
make you think but it's also very much
about<00:01:03.800> self-discovery<00:01:05.140> about<00:01:06.140> tolerance

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
about self-discovery about tolerance

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.050 
about self-discovery about tolerance
courage

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.460 

that's<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.240> language<00:01:13.480> of<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> boot<00:01:14.050> is<00:01:14.290> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
that's the language of the boot is the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.870 
that's the language of the boot is the
language<00:01:14.650> of<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.100> period<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.950> think<00:01:18.760> it's

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
language of the period I think it's

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.400 
language of the period I think it's
important<00:01:19.360> that<00:01:19.390> we're<00:01:19.690> able<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:20.080> confront

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
important that we're able to confront

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.790 
important that we're able to confront
that<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.130> recognize<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.470> fact<00:01:23.470> that<00:01:23.650> that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
that and to recognize and fact that that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.970 
that and to recognize and fact that that
language<00:01:24.010> was<00:01:24.430> abusive<00:01:24.880> hot<00:01:25.810> people<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.320> it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980 
language was abusive hot people and it

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.070 
language was abusive hot people and it
was<00:01:27.130> used<00:01:27.430> as<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.640> weapon<00:01:27.850> against<00:01:28.390> me<00:01:28.480> the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
was used as a weapon against me the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.200 
was used as a weapon against me the
notion<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.560> softening<00:01:30.250> all<00:01:30.400> of<00:01:30.520> that<00:01:30.730> I<00:01:31.060> think

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
notion of softening all of that I think

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.870 
notion of softening all of that I think
runs<00:01:31.930> against<00:01:32.410> a<00:01:32.560> point<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.980> doing<00:01:33.160> the<00:01:33.370> play<00:01:33.610> I

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
runs against a point of doing the play I

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.310 
runs against a point of doing the play I
think<00:01:34.150> we<00:01:34.210> need<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.480> show<00:01:34.660> up<00:01:34.720> like<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.080> world

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
think we need to show up like the world

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.630 
think we need to show up like the world
was<00:01:36.330> it<00:01:37.680> Mahatma<00:01:38.680> Gandhi<00:01:39.040> who<00:01:39.190> asked<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
was it Mahatma Gandhi who asked the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.850 
was it Mahatma Gandhi who asked the
question<00:01:39.670> what<00:01:40.240> sort<00:01:40.510> of<00:01:40.570> what<00:01:41.320> what<00:01:41.620> honor

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
question what sort of what what honor

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.620 
question what sort of what what honor
does<00:01:42.070> it<00:01:42.250> do<00:01:42.370> a<00:01:42.400> man<00:01:42.670> for<00:01:42.910> someone<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.300> step<00:01:43.480> up

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
does it do a man for someone to step up

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:53.910 
does it do a man for someone to step up
the<00:01:43.780> sidewalk<00:01:44.260> for<00:01:44.290> them<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:52.470> quote<00:01:53.470> which<00:01:53.710> is
