00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
is a big car and it's it's pretty smooth

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
is a big car and it's it's pretty smooth
it<00:00:59.730> I'm<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.449> saying<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.929> it<00:01:01.019> floats<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
it I'm kind of saying that it floats a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.320 
it I'm kind of saying that it floats a
little<00:01:01.829> bit<00:01:02.059> over<00:01:03.059> some<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.570> terrain<00:01:03.929> and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
little bit over some of this terrain and

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
little bit over some of this terrain and
it<00:01:06.330> does<00:01:06.480> feel<00:01:06.659> heavy<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.409> say<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
it does feel heavy I will say that you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.470 
it does feel heavy I will say that you
know<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:08.940> feel<00:01:09.180> like<00:01:09.300> I<00:01:09.420> can

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
know I don't I don't feel like I can

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.030 
know I don't I don't feel like I can
really<00:01:09.659> whip<00:01:09.960> around<00:01:10.140> any<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> these<00:01:10.530> corners

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
really whip around any of these corners

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.280 
really whip around any of these corners
but<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:12.120> very<00:01:12.330> smooth<00:01:12.720> over<00:01:12.990> some<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.230> these

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
but it's very smooth over some of these

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.380 
but it's very smooth over some of these
bigger<00:01:13.500> bumps<00:01:13.890> which<00:01:14.159> i<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.550> key<00:01:14.970> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
bigger bumps which i think is key to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
bigger bumps which i think is key to
off-roading<00:01:16.040> yeah<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:17.220> an<00:01:17.370> interesting

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
off-roading yeah that's an interesting

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
off-roading yeah that's an interesting
description<00:01:18.120> saying<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.870> it<00:01:18.960> floats

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
description saying that it floats

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.270 
description saying that it floats
because<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> does<00:01:19.710> kind<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.920> feel<00:01:20.010> like<00:01:20.130> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
because it does kind of feel like that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.420 
because it does kind of feel like that
it's<00:01:21.000> pretty<00:01:21.960> smooth<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.950> inside

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it's pretty smooth right really inside

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
it's pretty smooth right really inside
here<00:01:23.880> even<00:01:24.150> though<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:24.360> bouncing<00:01:25.230> around

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
automatic transmission this one's fully

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.660 
automatic transmission this one's fully
loaded<00:01:40.410> in<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> MSRP<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:42.030> old<00:01:42.300> girl<00:01:42.570> is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
loaded in that MSRP this old girl is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.510 
loaded in that MSRP this old girl is
$70,000<00:01:44.700> yeah<00:01:45.180> she's<00:01:45.840> steep<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.590> cool<00:01:47.370> thing

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
$70,000 yeah she's steep a cool thing

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.450 
$70,000 yeah she's steep a cool thing
about<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.590> has<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> cylinder

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
about this is I think it has a cylinder

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.390 
about this is I think it has a cylinder
deactivation<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.750> for<00:01:52.530> fuel<00:01:52.710> economy<00:01:52.890> reasons

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
deactivation so for fuel economy reasons

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.630 
deactivation so for fuel economy reasons
it's<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.420> works<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> v8<00:01:55.440> but<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.520> can

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it's it works in the v8 but then it can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.840 
it's it works in the v8 but then it can
shift<00:01:56.910> down<00:01:57.180> into<00:01:57.660> it<00:01:58.140> says<00:01:58.350> B<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.790> a

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
shift down into it says B for like a

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.210 
shift down into it says B for like a
four-cylinder<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.440> instrument<00:02:02.010> cluster

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
four-cylinder in the instrument cluster

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.030 
four-cylinder in the instrument cluster
here<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:02.940> can<00:02:03.180> see<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.470> my<00:02:04.470> fuel<00:02:04.860> economy

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
here so I can see that my fuel economy

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.710 
here so I can see that my fuel economy
gets<00:02:05.310> better<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> better<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.570> out<00:02:06.690> a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
gets better and better if I go out a

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.270 
gets better and better if I go out a
higher<00:02:06.960> speed<00:02:07.290> or<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.680> cruising<00:02:08.160> or
