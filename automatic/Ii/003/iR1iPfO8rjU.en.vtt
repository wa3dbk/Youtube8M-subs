hi guys drink again and today we're

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.630 
hi guys drink again and today we're
going<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.779> show<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.049> how<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.379> read<00:00:08.130> lubricate

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:08.640 
going to show you how to read lubricate

your<00:00:08.790> gear<00:00:09.000> cables<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.660> would<00:00:10.200> identify<00:00:10.440> their

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
your gear cables I would identify their

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.350 
your gear cables I would identify their
mountain<00:00:11.220> bikes<00:00:11.250> especially<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.180> get<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
mountain bikes especially as you get a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.330 
mountain bikes especially as you get a
lot<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.600> grit<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.110> grind<00:00:13.530> getting<00:00:13.890> into<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
lot of grit and grind getting into the

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.980 
lot of grit and grind getting into the
Arctic<00:00:14.550> able<00:00:15.000> which<00:00:15.390> caused<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> lot<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
Arctic able which caused a lot of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.350 
Arctic able which caused a lot of
friction<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.500> gear<00:00:16.770> code<00:00:17.120> so<00:00:18.120> what<00:00:18.270> you

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
friction in the gear code so what you

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.030 
friction in the gear code so what you
want<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.570> be<00:00:18.630> doing<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.410> ensuring

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
want to be doing is actually ensuring

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.470 
want to be doing is actually ensuring

gear<00:00:25.680> cables<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.580> still<00:00:26.820> better<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.090> getting

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
gear cables you still better off getting

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.870 
gear cables you still better off getting
that<00:00:27.539> done<00:00:27.980> periodically<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.430> this<00:00:29.699> will

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
that done periodically but this will

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.400 
that done periodically but this will
definitely<00:00:30.060> make<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> bit<00:00:30.869> smoother<00:00:31.260> in

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
definitely make it a bit smoother in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.040 
definitely make it a bit smoother in
terms<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.890> shifter<00:00:32.610> feel<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.690> we're<00:00:33.810> going<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
terms of shifter feel so we're going to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.350 
terms of shifter feel so we're going to
do<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.320> show<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:35.700> club<00:00:35.910> code<00:00:36.210> on

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
do is just show up to your club code on

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.300 
do is just show up to your club code on
the<00:00:36.420> back<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:36.930> sex<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.350> then<00:00:38.100> most

the back of your sex and then most

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.650 
the back of your sex and then most
importantly<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:39.210> don't<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> be

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
importantly you don't want to be

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.120 
importantly you don't want to be
pedaling<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.260> stage<00:00:40.500> you're<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:40.950> going

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
pedaling for the stage you're just going

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.430 
pedaling for the stage you're just going
to<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.250> clicking<00:00:41.610> down<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.810> smallest<00:00:43.110> cog

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
to be clicking down to the smallest cog

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.960 
to be clicking down to the smallest cog
again<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> that's<00:00:44.489> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> give<00:00:44.790> you<00:00:44.940> all

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
again and that's going to give you all

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:54.770 
again and that's going to give you all
the<00:00:45.149> slack<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> cable<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> need<00:00:53.780> now

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the slack of the cable you need now

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.600 
the slack of the cable you need now
think<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> m's<00:00:55.440> lack<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> cables<00:00:56.370> what

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
think of the m's lack of the cables what

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
think of the m's lack of the cables what
you<00:00:56.730> want<00:00:56.880> to<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.000> doing<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.630> just<00:00:57.690> popping<00:00:58.200> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you want to be doing is just popping the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
you want to be doing is just popping the
outer<00:00:58.469> cable<00:00:58.920> out<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.520> frame<00:01:00.149> slots<00:01:00.510> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
outer cable out of the frame slots and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.420 
outer cable out of the frame slots and
that's<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> give<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> access<00:01:02.040> to<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that's going to give you access to the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.789 
that's going to give you access to the
whole<00:01:02.579> cable<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.149> unit<00:01:03.949> here<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.069> go<00:01:07.759> and

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
whole cable as a unit here we go and

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.749 
whole cable as a unit here we go and
what<00:01:10.799> we're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> use<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.459> this<00:01:11.549> is

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
what we're going to use for this is

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.209 
what we're going to use for this is
going<00:01:11.969> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.179> rag<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.719> some<00:01:12.810> GTA<00:01:13.499> 5<00:01:13.950> which

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
going to be a rag and some GTA 5 which

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.889 
going to be a rag and some GTA 5 which
is<00:01:14.249> actually<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.729> teflon<00:01:15.149> based<00:01:15.359> lube<00:01:15.600> or<00:01:15.749> any

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
is actually a teflon based lube or any

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.359 
is actually a teflon based lube or any
wet<00:01:16.139> spray<00:01:16.409> lube<00:01:16.619> will<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.219> be<00:01:17.340> very

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
wet spray lube will do but be very

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.889 
wet spray lube will do but be very
careful<00:01:17.789> than<00:01:18.119> using<00:01:18.329> this<00:01:18.539> because<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
careful than using this because you

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.120 
careful than using this because you
don't<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.289> this<00:01:19.469> anywhere<00:01:19.740> near

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
don't want to get this anywhere near

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.120 
don't want to get this anywhere near
your<00:01:20.249> disc<00:01:20.490> brakes<00:01:20.729> hence<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.779> rag<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:23.009> what

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
your disc brakes hence the rag so what

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.529 
your disc brakes hence the rag so what
we're<00:01:23.219> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.399> do<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.789> just<00:01:24.149> basically

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
we're going to do is just basically

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.050 
we're going to do is just basically
spray<00:01:24.959> onto<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.350> housing<00:01:25.829> and<00:01:26.039> just<00:01:26.700> put<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
spray onto the housing and just put it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.599 
spray onto the housing and just put it
back<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.779> do<00:01:27.929> and<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.950> massage<00:01:29.399> had<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
back as you do and just massage had a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:31.730 
back as you do and just massage had a
few<00:01:29.880> times<00:01:30.170> ensuring<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.349> that<00:01:31.529> loop

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
few times ensuring that all that loop

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.730 
few times ensuring that all that loop
goes<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.279> the<00:01:32.399> outer<00:01:32.520> cable<00:01:33.380> slam<00:01:34.380> again<00:01:34.649> on

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
goes into the outer cable slam again on

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
goes into the outer cable slam again on
the<00:01:34.829> back<00:01:36.259> put<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> there<00:01:38.869> here<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.020> go

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
the back put that in there here we go

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.010 
the back put that in there here we go
nice<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:40.499> smooth<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:44.479> just<00:01:45.479> pop<00:01:45.599> everything

the front be very careful not to move
the<00:01:56.189> cranks<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.639> this<00:01:56.759> stage<00:01:56.999> because<00:01:57.179> as<00:01:57.389> soon

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
the cranks at this stage because as soon

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.300 
the cranks at this stage because as soon
as<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.719> turn<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.929> crank<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.590> chain<00:01:59.009> will<00:01:59.130> go

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
as you turn the crank the chain will go

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.550 
as you turn the crank the chain will go
down<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.789> the<00:01:59.819> casetagram<00:02:00.359> into<00:02:01.139> the<00:02:01.229> cogging

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
down to the casetagram into the cogging

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.709 
down to the casetagram into the cogging
needs<00:02:01.739> to<00:02:01.919> be<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> no<00:02:03.450> peddling<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.989> this<00:02:04.109> stage

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
needs to be so no peddling at this stage

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.210 
needs to be so no peddling at this stage
there<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:06.989> all<00:02:07.169> the<00:02:07.259> cables<00:02:07.619> are<00:02:07.709> back<00:02:07.919> into

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
there we go all the cables are back into

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.560 
there we go all the cables are back into
their<00:02:08.340> housing<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.850> what<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.210> do<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.540> is

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
their housing so what we can do now is

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.309 
their housing so what we can do now is
actually

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
actually

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.170 
actually
get<00:02:10.739> back<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.159> again<00:02:11.280> which<00:02:11.640> will<00:02:11.790> give<00:02:11.909> us<00:02:12.030> our

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
get back up again which will give us our

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.539 
get back up again which will give us our
cable<00:02:12.510> tension<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.799> dividers<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
cable tension and the dividers in the

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.179 
cable tension and the dividers in the
appropriate<00:02:14.819> gear<00:02:15.180> again<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.069> should

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
appropriate gear again and that should

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.730 
appropriate gear again and that should
make<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> smooth
