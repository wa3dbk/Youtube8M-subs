00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
had time to try and start it up and do

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.999 
had time to try and start it up and do
any<00:00:12.360> final<00:00:12.870> tuning<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.380> needs<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.830> done

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
any final tuning that needs to be done

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.849 
any final tuning that needs to be done
so<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.360> put<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> little<00:00:15.719> gas<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.500> had

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
so I just put a little gas in it I had

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.429 
so I just put a little gas in it I had
drained<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.630> I've<00:00:18.630> already<00:00:18.810> put<00:00:19.080> oil<00:00:19.260> in

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
drained it and I've already put oil in

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.500 
drained it and I've already put oil in
it<00:00:19.500> since<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.949> had<00:00:20.189> previously<00:00:20.730> drained<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
it since I had previously drained the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.290 
it since I had previously drained the
oil<00:00:21.539> out<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.550> fresh<00:00:23.820> oil<00:00:24.090> in

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
oil out of it it's like the fresh oil in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.810 
oil out of it it's like the fresh oil in
here<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:25.580> should<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.820> enough<00:00:28.820> yeah

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
here I should have enough yeah

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:43.119 
here I should have enough yeah
everything's<00:00:30.359> good<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:41.090> greengage<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
everything's good there greengage the

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.830 
everything's good there greengage the
power<00:00:44.129> switch<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.969> choked<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.750> if

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
power switch it's choked I don't know if

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.119 
power switch it's choked I don't know if
it<00:00:45.930> really<00:00:45.960> needs<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.469> choked<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.010> we'll

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it really needs to be choked but we'll

00:00:47.129 --> 00:01:32.640 
it really needs to be choked but we'll
give<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> pull<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> starts

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.860 

alright<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:33.890> I<00:01:34.190> first<00:01:35.000> test<00:01:35.300> here<00:01:35.540> everything

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
alright so I first test here everything

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.780 
alright so I first test here everything
seems<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.229> be<00:01:36.320> working<00:01:36.409> but<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.430> real<00:01:37.580> test

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
seems to be working but the real test

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.100 
seems to be working but the real test
will<00:01:37.940> be<00:01:38.150> when<00:01:39.080> when<00:01:39.830> we<00:01:39.920> get<00:01:40.070> some<00:01:40.250> snow<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
will be when when we get some snow and

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.740 
will be when when we get some snow and
whether<00:01:42.110> or<00:01:42.170> not<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.530> thing<00:01:42.740> keeps<00:01:43.580> going<00:01:43.970> on

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
whether or not the thing keeps going on

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.719 
whether or not the thing keeps going on
the<00:01:44.990> snow<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:45.650> so<00:01:45.920> far<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:46.190> good<00:01:46.400> everything

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
the snow but so far so good everything

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.030 
the snow but so far so good everything
seems<00:01:47.119> to<00:01:47.210> be<00:01:47.300> good<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:48.470> only<00:01:48.650> thing<00:01:48.830> left

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
seems to be good the only thing left

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.359 
seems to be good the only thing left
here<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:50.409> replace<00:01:51.409> one<00:01:51.740> of<00:01:51.830> my<00:01:51.920> makeshift

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
here is to replace one of my makeshift

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.340 
here is to replace one of my makeshift
shear<00:01:52.790> bolts<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.240> notice<00:01:53.600> when<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.960> was<00:01:54.170> working

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
shear bolts I notice when I was working

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.530 
shear bolts I notice when I was working
on<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.680> that<00:01:54.830> this<00:01:54.950> one<00:01:55.159> was<00:01:55.360> snapped<00:01:56.360> that

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
on it that this one was snapped that

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.999 
on it that this one was snapped that
must<00:01:56.720> have<00:01:56.869> snapped<00:01:57.110> at<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:57.350> tail<00:01:57.619> end<00:01:57.650> of<00:01:57.950> the

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
must have snapped at the tail end of the

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.670 
must have snapped at the tail end of the
last<00:01:58.159> snowstorm<00:01:58.869> go<00:01:59.869> ahead<00:02:00.080> and<00:02:00.170> realized<00:02:00.500> it

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
last snowstorm go ahead and realized it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.200 
last snowstorm go ahead and realized it
was<00:02:00.830> snapped<00:02:01.100> I'll<00:02:01.340> replace<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.119> then

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
was snapped I'll replace that and then

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.719 
was snapped I'll replace that and then
this<00:02:02.330> will<00:02:02.479> be<00:02:02.660> great<00:02:03.110> drain<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.680> gas<00:02:04.430> out<00:02:04.700> of

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
this will be great drain the gas out of

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.310 
this will be great drain the gas out of
it<00:02:04.880> I<00:02:04.940> put<00:02:05.180> in<00:02:05.270> there<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:07.269> then<00:02:08.269> put<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.259> away

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
it I put in there and then put it away

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.510 
it I put in there and then put it away
