always<00:02:18.950> start<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.430> an<00:02:19.700> incline<00:02:20.120> movement

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
always start with an incline movement

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.630 
always start with an incline movement
whether<00:02:20.810> it's<00:02:21.080> incline<00:02:21.440> barbell<00:02:21.680> press<00:02:22.190> or

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
whether it's incline barbell press or

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.550 
whether it's incline barbell press or
incline<00:02:23.299> dumbbell<00:02:23.750> press<00:02:24.019> to<00:02:24.260> tell<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.500> the

because it gives me more freedom to

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.350 
because it gives me more freedom to
squeeze<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:30.280> freedom<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.549> control<00:02:32.150> the

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.589 
getting is good of a contraction and
it's<00:04:04.250> it's<00:04:04.699> really<00:04:04.970> not<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.150> good<00:04:05.299> exercise

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
it's it's really not a good exercise

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.750 
it's it's really not a good exercise
unless<00:04:06.079> you're<00:04:06.230> using<00:04:06.430> dumbbells<00:04:07.430> I

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
unless you're using dumbbells I

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.430 
unless you're using dumbbells I
personally<00:04:08.180> think<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.629> dips<00:04:09.019> are<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.260> better

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
personally think that dips are a better

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.430 
personally think that dips are a better
exercise<00:04:09.859> to<00:04:10.220> get<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.459> lower<00:04:10.639> PEC<00:04:11.079> if<00:04:12.079> that's

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
exercise to get the lower PEC if that's

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.250 
exercise to get the lower PEC if that's
what<00:04:12.590> you're<00:04:12.739> going<00:04:12.859> for<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.370> here's<00:04:13.639> my<00:04:14.260> basic

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
what you're going for so here's my basic

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.659 
what you're going for so here's my basic
routine<00:04:15.739> that<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.310> would<00:04:16.760> follow<00:04:17.000> one<00:04:18.669> start

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
routine that I would follow one start

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.520 
routine that I would follow one start
with<00:04:19.789> an<00:04:19.880> incline<00:04:20.209> movement

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
with an incline movement

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.200 
with an incline movement
so<00:04:21.920> that<00:04:22.070> should<00:04:22.220> be<00:04:22.280> inclined<00:04:22.790> barbell

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
so that should be inclined barbell

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.870 
so that should be inclined barbell
presses<00:04:23.510> or<00:04:23.930> incline<00:04:24.770> dumbbell<00:04:25.220> presses<00:04:25.580> or

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
presses or incline dumbbell presses or

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.730 
presses or incline dumbbell presses or
if<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.210> do<00:04:26.330> even<00:04:26.660> do<00:04:26.810> incline<00:04:27.380> hammer

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
if you do even do incline hammer

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.170 
if you do even do incline hammer
strength<00:04:28.070> if<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.639> hammer<00:04:28.940> strength

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
strength if you have a hammer strength

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.320 
strength if you have a hammer strength
machine<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.940> what<00:04:32.810> i<00:04:32.840> would<00:04:33.050> do<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.790> go<00:04:34.790> from<00:04:35.150> a

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
machine to what i would do is go from a

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.370 
machine to what i would do is go from a
pressing<00:04:35.930> movement<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.850> a<00:04:37.880> blood<00:04:38.690> movement<00:04:39.050> a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
pressing movement to a blood movement a

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.530 
pressing movement to a blood movement a
blood<00:04:39.680> volume<00:04:40.160> movement<00:04:40.550> which<00:04:41.150> I<00:04:41.360> would

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
blood volume movement which I would

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.240 
blood volume movement which I would
classify<00:04:41.720> as<00:04:42.110> like<00:04:42.590> cable<00:04:43.840> flyes<00:04:44.840> or<00:04:45.500> dumbbell

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
classify as like cable flyes or dumbbell

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.460 
classify as like cable flyes or dumbbell
flyes<00:04:46.490> or<00:04:46.760> machine<00:04:47.150> flies<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.870> try<00:04:48.410> to

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
flyes or machine flies and try to

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.350 
flyes or machine flies and try to
concentrate<00:04:48.950> on<00:04:49.160> that<00:04:49.370> upper<00:04:49.730> back<00:04:49.940> area<00:04:49.970> and

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
concentrate on that upper back area and

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.940 
concentrate on that upper back area and
filling<00:04:50.720> that<00:04:50.840> area<00:04:51.169> full<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.470> blood<00:04:51.770> after

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
filling that area full of blood after

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.850 
filling that area full of blood after
you<00:04:52.160> do<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.310> pressing<00:04:52.850> them<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.900> from<00:04:54.470> there<00:04:54.650> I

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
you do the pressing them to from there I

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.550 
you do the pressing them to from there I
would<00:04:55.100> move<00:04:55.280> into<00:04:55.730> more<00:04:56.270> of<00:04:56.330> a<00:04:56.480> flat<00:04:56.780> pressing

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
would move into more of a flat pressing

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.600 
would move into more of a flat pressing
movement<00:04:57.950> now<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.220> can<00:04:58.520> do<00:04:59.140> flat<00:05:00.140> bench

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
movement now you can do flat bench

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.420 
movement now you can do flat bench
dumbbell<00:05:01.610> presses<00:05:02.320> if<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.590> want<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:04.010> do<00:05:04.130> bench

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
dumbbell presses if you want to do bench

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.550 
dumbbell presses if you want to do bench
pressing<00:05:05.440> you<00:05:06.440> can<00:05:06.820> but<00:05:07.820> I<00:05:08.200> don't<00:05:09.200> think<00:05:09.380> it's

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
pressing you can but I don't think it's

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.159 
pressing you can but I don't think it's
the<00:05:09.740> best<00:05:10.150> exercise<00:05:11.150> for<00:05:11.180> activating<00:05:11.930> the

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
the best exercise for activating the

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.790 
the best exercise for activating the
pectoral<00:05:12.770> muscles<00:05:13.220> so<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.900> would<00:05:15.590> personally

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
pectoral muscles so I would personally

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.920 
pectoral muscles so I would personally
recommend<00:05:16.160> doing<00:05:16.550> dumbbell<00:05:16.910> presses<00:05:17.330> or<00:05:17.630> even

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
recommend doing dumbbell presses or even

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.430 
recommend doing dumbbell presses or even
going<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.229> a<00:05:18.560> flat<00:05:19.430> Hammer<00:05:20.120> Strength<00:05:20.479> machine

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
going to a flat Hammer Strength machine

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.370 
going to a flat Hammer Strength machine
press<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.160> then<00:05:22.880> from<00:05:23.150> there<00:05:23.210> I'd<00:05:23.660> finish<00:05:24.169> off

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
press and then from there I'd finish off

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.360 
press and then from there I'd finish off
with<00:05:25.160> another<00:05:27.880> blood<00:05:28.880> movement<00:05:29.260> I<00:05:30.260> think<00:05:31.190> that

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
with another blood movement I think that

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.880 
with another blood movement I think that
bench<00:05:31.640> pressing<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.419> flat<00:05:32.810> bench<00:05:33.050> dumbbell

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
bench pressing and flat bench dumbbell

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.770 
bench pressing and flat bench dumbbell
pressing<00:05:34.550> can<00:05:34.820> actually<00:05:35.210> be<00:05:35.330> interchange

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
pressing can actually be interchange

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.960 
pressing can actually be interchange
with<00:05:35.990> dips<00:05:36.290> a<00:05:36.530> lot<00:05:36.710> of<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.890> time<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.669> the<00:05:37.760> way

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
with dips a lot of the time and the way

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.180 
with dips a lot of the time and the way
I<00:05:38.000> do<00:05:38.180> flips<00:05:38.600> is<00:05:38.780> lean<00:05:39.350> forward<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.919> little<00:05:40.070> bit

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
I do flips is lean forward a little bit

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.930 
I do flips is lean forward a little bit
and<00:05:40.550> really<00:05:41.510> trying<00:05:41.870> to<00:05:41.930> push<00:05:42.110> down<00:05:42.590> and<00:05:42.979> get

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
and really trying to push down and get

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.610 
and really trying to push down and get
that<00:05:43.970> chest<00:05:44.419> move<00:05:44.660> it<00:05:44.840> that<00:05:45.260> chest

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
that chest move it that chest

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.240 
that chest move it that chest
contraction<00:05:46.270> so<00:05:47.590> there<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:48.620> have<00:05:48.770> it<00:05:48.890> that's

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
contraction so there you have it that's

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.330 
contraction so there you have it that's
