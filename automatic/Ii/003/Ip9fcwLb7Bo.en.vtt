00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.710
 from the boys here to light and darkness 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.060
 team and sorry for the mister and for this 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.880
 video there will be a little less quality 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.189
 because my phone went haywire 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.279
 so I can't use advertising 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.710
 hidden from the samsung and therefore there will be 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.489
 a lesser quality because it uses non-s ii 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.720
 okay nothing but poor hinges 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.890
 today we are here with the udc list 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.239

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.650
 world 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.930
 immediately began to tell you that I miss them 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.200
 a couple of cards, however, I didn't put myself 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.730
 looking for them to assemble the list is that 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.350
 reality is only one that I miss 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.900
 two others are ex are two ex eaton 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.670
 what a good aim to look for because not there 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.030
 I find it until I reprint them 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.640
 let's start right away with this deck list 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.750
 three monsters are down 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.020
 arcigay we of course staple pay 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.020
 jean 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.890
 2 necromancers 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.579
 ii Msgr 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.229
 then two of latehar youm which is very strong 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.020
 and the first round comes in special though 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.250
 lets you guys disappear i wanted 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.229
 to say that the list was practically 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 equal to my part two cards that are 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.829
 this being two grapher and I was playing 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.869
 mono instead of playing 2 armageddon bombs 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:36.359
 and gold fish hand that I played the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.000
 according to reinforcements for I think it's one 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.189
 because in every turn and at one it seems to me 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.879
 moroso and ires 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:49.590
 these were the monsters then oh well 3 on 

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:54.149
 wise all win strong allows 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.679
 to then find three upstarts because 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.599
 see the cards you need first and 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:03.090
 then to a target to discard by monk 

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:05.009
 or to challenge between typhoons because not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.170
 there were is already there was the ha 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.049
 caught however is typhoon is not needed anyway 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.940
 to avoid a combo or a target for 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:20.130
 the double lance monk to protect yourself from 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.930
 double instant shit where they love 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.590
 labyrinth propulsion against silly 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.030
 meeting reinforcements and charm 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.270
 will remain and magic traps I played three 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:41.500
 breaks and varies 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:45.510
 and this is really now the said no of 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:49.030
 which site the extra 2 the val val chain 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.330
 because not only for the combo 2 from the roles 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.470
 because they serve for the combo and two ex 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:00.970
 meanwhile raga I do n't have them there is definitely 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.069
 I didn't find them against bis dweller against 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.209
 whatever you want greta tops hates 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.360

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.040
 wrong does not play the ship was and 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.840
 since there were lots of bowling alleys 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.239
 according to me wrong to educate card gorgon 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.480

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.019

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.790
