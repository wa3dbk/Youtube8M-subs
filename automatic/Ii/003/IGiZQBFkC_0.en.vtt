Hi guys! I'm Seonkyoung Longest, welcome to Asian at home

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
..and today I'm going to show you how to make steamed buns

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they're just delightful buns, soft, fluffy and nice, if the clouds taste like bread this is probably what it taste like

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
serve this steamed buns so with asian dishes instead of rice..

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's get started..first, you will need 1/2 cup of warm milk and I'm going to add 1/4 cup of warm water..

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.000
..and here we are going to add 1 tbs of dry yeast and whisk

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and last the wet ingredients is 2 tbs of vegetable oil, mix one more time

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.000
alright, all our wet ingredients are ready, now let's mix all the dry ingredient

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you will need 2 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, just add it into the large mixing bowl

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.000
..and 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and same amount of salt ..and whisk to mix everything together

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
..and make a little hole middle of this dry ingredients so it has room for the wet ingredients

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
alright, I'm going to pour all my wet ingredients to my dry ingredients

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and slowly incorporate your wet and dry ingredients with your spatula

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
now it's time to knead with my hands

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
put everything together with your hand, then will come together really easily ..

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
..now is so soft and warm..oh, I love this feeling

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we are going to keep knead in the mixing bowl until the dough gets one formed

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.000
alright, my dough just became one chunk and it's not sticky at all

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and my mixing bowl is super squeaky clean, I'm just gonna set it right here, we'll use it later..

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and let's knead the dough with your two hands in a warm space..about 5 minutes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you can feel the dough is actually getting really really elastic and soft..

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.000
make a really nice ball shape and put it back to the mixing bowl that we used earlier

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
cover with a plastic wrap and we are going to let it rise about an hour at warm place

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.700
when the dough became the double of the size, push the middle of the dough with your finger and reached it the dough(?)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
cover with a plastic wrap and we are going to let it rest another 45-50 minuntes

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:59.000
from now what kind of shape you want your steamed buns will be is totally up to you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
because there's millions ways to do it 'cause now you have dough, whatever shape you want, go ahead and make it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but if you delight to make this steamed buns filled of delicious BBQ pork..

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
..check out my pork bun recipe, is delicious and I use axactly the same dough

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
but today, I'm going to make the most easiest one which is roll out the dough about 1/4 to 1/2 each

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and we are going to roll it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
make sure they are nice and cut into one inch

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000
either cupcake filter(?) cupcake paper cup or parchment paper will prevent your steamed buns stick in your steamer

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I'll place my steamed buns into my....what is that call? like a strainer kinda looking as a steamer

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
now cover up the mantou and we are going to let it rest about 20-30 minutes before steam

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I steamed my buns about 12 minutes and do not open it right away, then the dough nice effort

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
will suck down and you don't want that happen, right?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:29.000
just only for 2-3 minutes, that's all you need

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:38.000
I know my buns are not completely in white color, it's because I used the unbleched flour

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
if youo want really bright white color then you need to use blenched flour

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
