00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.349
 You like shepherds but you think it's evil. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.870
 create them in cages 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.640
 then in the place of true shepherds who 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 such as to fill your house with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.970
 paper 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.490
 but how do you go for a bird 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.060
 lie stand alone blindly 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.599
 teaches you will need a piece of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.880
 cardboard black pencil toothpick 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.480
 thin spider about 40 centimeters 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.649
 long adhesive tape wax chalk 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.140
 colored pencils 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.149
 the first design your partner in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 piece of paperboard 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.680
 it should have this format you can 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.280
 avoid it as you want 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.530
 when you are ready to cut on a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.199
 the ends of the wire and with the adhesive tape 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.440
 containing a toothpick on it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.690
 the result should be this then fold the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.559
 wire in the shape of a bow for 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.480
 finish 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.970
 use tape to learn the other 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.020
 part of the toothpick at the height of the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.510
 bird ready after the toothpick on 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.520
 end of a table and adjust the shape 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.729
 from the bow until your little bird is 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 up and down swings 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.080
 It's not cool the trick to balance the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.240
 object is in the way its mass 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640
 is distributed in relation to the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.439
 support that in the case of our experiment is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.570
 the tip of the toothpick 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.820
 It is important to put most of the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.159
 low mass of the support point and 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.950
 vertical direction in relation to it 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.730
 even with a little push object 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.030
 will return to its position 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.010
 this experiment is on ch c-160 that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.640
 brings many other legal texts
