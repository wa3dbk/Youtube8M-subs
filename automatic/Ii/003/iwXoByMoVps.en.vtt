00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:22.179 
away and also you can see the weight

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.089 
away and also you can see the weight
capacity<00:00:22.659> of<00:00:22.749> this<00:00:22.839> table<00:00:23.079> right<00:00:23.380> here<00:00:23.560> I<00:00:23.739> mean

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
capacity of this table right here I mean

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
you know we even stack firewood there if

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.260 
you know we even stack firewood there if
we<00:01:09.159> want<00:01:09.369> to<00:01:09.490> keep<00:01:09.670> everything<00:01:09.880> off<00:01:10.119> the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
got some aluminum foil right there

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.770 
got some aluminum foil right there
squared<00:01:14.920> away<00:01:15.009> and<00:01:15.329> you<00:01:16.329> know<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.509> works<00:01:16.659> out

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
squared away and you know it works out

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.419 
squared away and you know it works out
pretty<00:01:16.899> well<00:01:17.049> we<00:01:17.590> have<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.770> couple<00:01:17.979> support

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
pretty well we have a couple support

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.459 
pretty well we have a couple support
beams<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:19.060> here<00:01:19.359> just<00:01:20.020> basically<00:01:20.259> why

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
beams right here just basically why

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.859 
beams right here just basically why
stakes<00:01:20.829> that<00:01:20.950> help<00:01:21.130> support<00:01:21.340> these<00:01:22.030> smaller

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
stakes that help support these smaller

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.749 
stakes that help support these smaller
pieces<00:01:23.109> of<00:01:23.289> wood<00:01:23.439> and<00:01:23.590> these<00:01:24.100> three<00:01:24.429> trees

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
pieces of wood and these three trees

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.459 
pieces of wood and these three trees
right<00:01:24.999> here<00:01:25.030> just<00:01:25.420> close<00:01:25.600> enough<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.170> think<00:01:26.289> we

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
right here just close enough I think we

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
out of it so you'll have to come back

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.979 
out of it so you'll have to come back
every<00:02:54.730> once<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> while<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.390> retighten<00:02:55.810> your

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
you know years down the road it's gonna

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.800 
you know years down the road it's gonna
kill<00:03:09.430> these<00:03:09.610> trees<00:03:09.819> to<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.239> cordage<00:03:10.630> on

kill these trees to have this cordage on
there<00:03:10.989> but<00:03:11.650> this<00:03:11.799> area<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.580> know<00:03:12.670> we<00:03:12.790> probably

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
there but this area you know we probably

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.640 
there but this area you know we probably
have<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.269> take<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.930> down<00:03:14.019> every<00:03:14.290> once<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.560> a

if<00:03:17.019> we<00:03:17.500> see<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.040> trees<00:03:18.280> are<00:03:18.370> starting<00:03:18.579> to

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
if we see the the trees are starting to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.009 
if we see the the trees are starting to
choke<00:03:18.790> off<00:03:19.000> but<00:03:19.180> that's<00:03:19.299> gonna<00:03:19.390> take<00:03:19.600> years

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
choke off but that's gonna take years

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.410 
choke off but that's gonna take years
and<00:03:20.290> years<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.500> years<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.920> by<00:03:21.760> that<00:03:21.940> time<00:03:21.970> all

a couple pressing knots in here on
different<00:04:07.120> angles<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.510> hang<00:04:08.200> some<00:04:08.410> different

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
different angles to hang some different

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.770 
different angles to hang some different
things<00:04:08.859> and<00:04:09.819> that<00:04:10.060> way<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.269> can<00:04:10.420> slide<00:04:10.660> it
