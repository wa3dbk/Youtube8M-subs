00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
things I thought about is like why do i

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.760 
things I thought about is like why do i
do<00:00:14.370> sure<00:00:14.639> views<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.210> old<00:00:15.630> shoes<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.529> know

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.099 
do sure views on old shoes for you know
it<00:00:16.890> doesn't<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.460> difference<00:00:18.109> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it doesn't really make a difference it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.510 
it doesn't really make a difference it
doesn't<00:00:19.410> affect<00:00:19.710> whether<00:00:20.100> or<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.430> guys

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
doesn't affect whether or not you guys

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.710 
doesn't affect whether or not you guys
are<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.820> buy<00:00:20.970> them<00:00:21.180> or<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.420> just

are going to buy them or not just

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
actually had never even heard of these

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.150 
actually had never even heard of these
shoes<00:00:57.120> are<00:00:57.270> seeing<00:00:57.510> them<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.800> colorway

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
shoes are seeing them in this colorway

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.779 
shoes are seeing them in this colorway
until<00:00:59.969> recently<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.280> older<00:01:02.550> shoe

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
until recently so it's an older shoe

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.789 
until recently so it's an older shoe
it's<00:01:03.030> from<00:01:03.239> 2010<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> air<00:01:06.030> max<00:01:06.270> TN<00:01:06.799> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
it's from 2010 it is a air max TN and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
it's from 2010 it is a air max TN and
this<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> tune<00:01:08.880> version<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.570> guess<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this one is the tune version I guess it

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.340 
this one is the tune version I guess it
was<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.920> TN<00:01:11.490> plus<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.180> basically<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> only

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
was the TN plus and basically the only

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.429 
was the TN plus and basically the only
difference<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.310> flywire<00:01:15.080> other<00:01:16.080> than

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
difference is it has flywire other than

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.910 
difference is it has flywire other than
that<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:16.830> pretty<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> same<00:01:17.460> shoe<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
that it's pretty much the same shoe and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.429
