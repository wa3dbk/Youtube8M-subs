00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
once again it's Sonic Titan time I've

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.310 
once again it's Sonic Titan time I've
got<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.340> look<00:00:08.730> for<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> few<00:00:09.360> more<00:00:09.540> hours<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.050> I

really get into a lot of explanations
and<00:00:19.680> different<00:00:20.070> knob<00:00:20.220> settings<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
and different knob settings and that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.630 
and different knob settings and that
sort<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> thing<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.980> I'm<00:00:22.980> going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.220> show<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.580> a

Rocking

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:53.040 

playing<00:00:43.450> little<00:00:43.630> clean<00:00:43.930> sound<00:00:44.410> here

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.049 

let's<00:00:53.770> start<00:00:54.040> things<00:00:54.280> out<00:00:54.489> with<00:00:54.670> the<00:00:54.820> tone

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
let's start things out with the tone

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.750 
let's start things out with the tone
knob<00:00:55.390> said<00:00:55.719> about<00:00:55.899> nine<00:00:56.200> o'clock<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:57.579> is<00:00:57.610> a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
knob said about nine o'clock which is a

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.670 
knob said about nine o'clock which is a
good<00:00:58.000> place<00:00:58.270> to<00:00:58.300> start<00:00:58.750> with<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:58.989> pedal<00:00:59.290> and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
good place to start with this pedal and

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.990 
good place to start with this pedal and
I'm<00:00:59.770> going<00:00:59.920> to<00:00:59.980> start<00:01:00.190> with<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.399> drive<00:01:00.670> down

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
I'm going to start with the drive down

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.700 
I'm going to start with the drive down
it's<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> fair<00:01:01.840> amount<00:01:01.930> of<00:01:02.140> boost<00:01:02.379> on<00:01:02.590> this

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
it's a fair amount of boost on this

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:17.399 
it's a fair amount of boost on this
pedal

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.250 

and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:33.240 

it<00:01:22.620> was<00:01:22.800> really<00:01:23.040> natural<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.940> flight

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.650 

as<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.340> start<00:01:34.550> turning<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.090> tone<00:01:35.300> up<00:01:35.510> you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
as you start turning the tone up you

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.350 
as you start turning the tone up you
start<00:01:35.960> getting<00:01:36.230> some<00:01:36.440> brightness<00:01:37.090> more<00:01:38.090> of<00:01:38.210> an

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
start getting some brightness more of an

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.420 
start getting some brightness more of an
upper<00:01:38.750> mid<00:01:38.990> presence<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:39.890> little<00:01:40.100> bit<00:01:40.220> more

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
upper mid presence and a little bit more

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.340 
upper mid presence and a little bit more
gained<00:01:40.730> as<00:01:40.910> well

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.710 

I

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.360 

you

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:24.130 

oh<00:01:55.400> yeah

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.869 

that's<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.470> lower<00:02:25.920> gain<00:02:26.220> side<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:26.849> I

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
that's like the lower gain side of it I

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.479 
that's like the lower gain side of it I
think<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.629> lot<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.410> YouTube<00:02:28.769> demos<00:02:29.250> I've

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
think a lot of the YouTube demos I've

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.309 
think a lot of the YouTube demos I've
seen<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.940> been<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.510> focusing<00:02:31.019> on<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
seen have been really focusing on the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.250 
seen have been really focusing on the
high<00:02:31.500> gain<00:02:31.709> end<00:02:32.099> of<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.660> certainly<00:02:34.080> is

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
high gain end of it and it certainly is

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.570 
high gain end of it and it certainly is
a<00:02:34.290> lot<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.680> fun<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.010> play<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.250> high<00:02:35.519> gain<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.950> I

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
a lot of fun to play a high gain and I

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580 
a lot of fun to play a high gain and I
would<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> medium<00:02:39.840> gain<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.080> got<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.500> is

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
would I like the medium gain I got it is

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.000 
would I like the medium gain I got it is
noon<00:02:40.799> right<00:02:41.069> now

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.780 

you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.590 

I

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.940 

ah

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.729 

I<00:03:00.360> swing<00:03:01.360> that<00:03:01.540> tone<00:03:01.810> up<00:03:02.020> a<00:03:02.110> little<00:03:02.260> bit<00:03:02.500> get<00:03:02.709> a

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
I swing that tone up a little bit get a

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.580 
I swing that tone up a little bit get a
little<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.010> bite

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:18.940 

Oh

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.850 

I

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:04:15.750 

I<00:03:22.090> think<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.210> gain<00:03:23.390> up<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.720> little<00:03:23.900> bit

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.270 

No

uh<00:05:45.680> yeah<00:05:47.150> it's<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.300> sonic<00:05:48.720> Titan<00:05:49.080> people<00:05:49.500> this

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
uh yeah it's a sonic Titan people this

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.740 
uh yeah it's a sonic Titan people this
is<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.520> really<00:05:50.940> great<00:05:51.090> box<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:54.180> really<00:05:54.450> is<00:05:54.720> a

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
is a really great box and it really is a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.010 
is a really great box and it really is a
power<00:05:55.740> AB<00:05:56.040> Distortion<00:05:56.850> um<00:05:57.030> the<00:05:57.540> chip<00:05:57.810> inside

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
power AB Distortion um the chip inside

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.100 
power AB Distortion um the chip inside
there<00:05:58.590> is<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:59.220> uh<00:05:59.580> allegedly<00:06:00.510> not<00:06:00.720> technically

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
there is is uh allegedly not technically

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.890 
there is is uh allegedly not technically
technically<00:06:01.680> an<00:06:01.830> op-amp<00:06:02.190> it's<00:06:02.520> a<00:06:02.780> it's<00:06:03.780> a

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
small scale within the pedal is creating

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.960 
small scale within the pedal is creating
its<00:06:09.390> own<00:06:09.570> power<00:06:09.870> amp<00:06:10.200> distortion<00:06:10.860> in<00:06:11.610> a<00:06:11.670> box

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970

and it really does sound like it so how
have<00:06:16.260> this<00:06:16.470> helpfully<00:06:17.600> explained<00:06:18.600> it<00:06:18.840> a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870

have this helpfully explained it a
little<00:06:19.140> bit<00:06:19.320> better<00:06:19.530> than<00:06:19.800> my<00:06:19.980> last<00:06:20.010> demo<00:06:20.550> did

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:20.790

little bit better than my last demo did
and<00:06:21.410> this<00:06:22.410> box<00:06:22.680> rocks<00:06:23.070> I'm<00:06:23.400> going<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.580> have<00:06:23.700> one

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
and this box rocks I'm going to have one
