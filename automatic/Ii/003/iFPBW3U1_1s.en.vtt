 good evening to all tomorrow we take the opportunity 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.839
 sun will be waiting for you and the heat 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.400
 also we will often reach 30 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.590
 degrees for example in Paris and well one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230

 tomorrow 19 degrees expected for Sunday 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 on certain regions then showers 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.699
 we had some during 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.590
 the afternoon including the Pyrenees 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.730
 up to the franche ComtÃ© little by little 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.590
 all this will be absorbed 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.029
 tonight we'll find some more 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.650
 very light rain over the Pyrenees 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 everywhere else dry weather with a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 light sail over the northern half of the sun 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.309
 already in the morning with some low clouds 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.020
 all the same in the south west of the country 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.520
 some clouds also expected in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 the northeast a little wind around the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 Mediterranean and in the afternoon a 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 relatively calm time on France 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.090
 but in the late afternoon two new 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.770
 this stormy trend that will come 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.690
 in place on the Pyrenees until 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 direction of the central massif and 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 temperatures in the morning a small 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.570
 drop on champagne ardenne with 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.980
 only 9 degrees but already 19 degrees 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.079
 on the nice side and look at what you 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.840
 especially expecting the afternoon twenty nine to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.210
 paris and strasbourg 30 degrees on the side of 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.820
 reindeer 30 2 degrees expected in lyon or 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.400
 still montelimar as well as on Corsica 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 so we take advantage of it because on Friday the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.820
 time will become very unstable on the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.229
 country with showers locally 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 thunderstorms on three quarters of the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 france a quieter time in the north 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 Where is 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.570
 lower temperatures elsewhere 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.460
 in the south of the country with only one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.200
 average of 24 degrees the sector wind 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.299
 south that will blow up to 80 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 kilometers hour saturday arrival of a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.170
 new disturbance says a little bit more 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.400
 classic by the Atlantic you go the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.530
 find mid-day on the north 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420
 west with a cloudy sky 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.780
 will blow up to 60 kilometers an hour 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.310
 Sunday and disturbance is going to have to 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 wrong to advance in the land we have it 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.659
 will find besides Monday of the Pyrenees 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.759
 to the north-east with thunderstorms 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.409
 the front and we will continue with this time 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.299
 very unstable for the day of Tuesday 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.950
 but from Wednesday and for the weekend 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.590
 next anticyclonic conditions 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.939
 who will settle right away the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.950
 last breakaway I wish you to 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.950
