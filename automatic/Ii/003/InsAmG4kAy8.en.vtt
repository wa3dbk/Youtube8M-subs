00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 there it is now project cars is belief 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.960
 I 1 of the most distance 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.610
 expected racing games ever I have 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.230
 me now in advance a lot 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.059
 Information has also been included 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.830
 always in a livestream lately 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.750
 said yes podcast interested in it 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.000
 I too, yes, I still wait in principle 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.490
 in there release from the game and yes now 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.990
 Already there I am already 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 I was a bit surprised 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 then directly on the release evening or in the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 night, so to speak, a few streams 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.460
 occurs and later even believe 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.869
 still looked at hit box 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.700
 that all looked very much 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.200
 spectacular outside very very interesting 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.670
 You just have to say that out, even though I am 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.050
 really not a racing fan if he is me 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.770
 There really is no need for advertising here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.050
 do it for 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.940
 in the sense of hey the game you have to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 absolutely buy and necessarily blablabla 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.079
 because I'm not racing 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.059
 friend in the sense so I have though 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.170
 in the past also endless racing games 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.360
 played everything in the fingers 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 but you have gotten in the big one 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
 and all I have to say the whole 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.780
 Authoring games are simply us 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 do not say that thing by saying that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.840
 I really want to have there I have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.160
 People often asked why that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.350
 that's how it is and I can just say 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.630
 think that one is where I say now 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.299
 sometimes more realistic play on 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.580
 that's how it has to go at such a high level 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.409
 somehow for such a casual gamer as 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.240
 I especially now in racing games 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.590
 lingering is extremely difficult and me 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.420
 just do not have the ambition 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.890
 to deal with it for hours exactly 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.570
 to know at the moment you have to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 right here stunt then out there again 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.830
 to accelerate you the ultimate 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.259
 best lap time somehow at verse 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 tc blablabla but became the topic 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.250
 Of course there are advertising here as well 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.799
 again a tick to dj there you can do that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.960
 buy game order now download 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.869
 and of course he immediately gamble like that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.100
 always a fourth link iris theme 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.180
 advertising completed and 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.680
 Accordingly, it is now synonymous 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.450
 directly first forward then I have 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.860
 after I looked at the streams 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.149
 so I went to bed tomorrow 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.590
 get up and have me again 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.520
 quite normal looked at twitter and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.229
 I was very surprised at how 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.060
 so many people are big, too 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.149
 youtuber persisted tweeted 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 for example, backtracks project cars 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.950
 sigal from no question but somehow 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.750
 it did not blow me away in the sense of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.430
 yes, you have to stop now 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.530
 stay because it is, for example 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.729
 shooter it comes out new shooter 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.959
 Under the dash is just one 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.550
 shooter if you are not in it now 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.319
 and the ultra fan is in that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.180
 area falls within the genre then be 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.080
 harder to deal with that 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.209
 to set or 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.920
 there has to be up to date or to stay 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.840
 to deal with it and exactly like that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.640
 I also have the cracks 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.709
 was not the only one want to be on now 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.209
 this one is the only one you have 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.560
 Just call it here have one 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.060
 then people react to it 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.830
 have said yes I feel the same 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.269
 So there was a lot of feedback on that 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.739
 said it looks awesome 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.629
 Feedback is cool what you get from the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.709
 For example, street is the graphic 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.090
 really cool and I have to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.560
 Just say because I have here now 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.790
 two gameplays provided 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 get the first thing you have here now 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.230
 Just look that I have from yes I am 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.940
 I'm sure I'm using it now 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.769
 from ice cream parlor or from predecessor 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.390
 Of course we will get neat 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.340
 linked in the video description 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.690
 look at the channels of the two 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.310
 It's best to go directly to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.690
 and make yourself a picture of yourself 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.650
 I think that will be in the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.940
 next days certainly one more 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.879
 Upload a bit of content to it 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.980
 I can just say the videos 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.510
 see hammer out the livestreams see 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.580
 that's really awesome 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.690
 not to be outbid 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.430
 However, I would have now, unfortunately, 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.990
 but do not pick who of you for it 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.220
 interested as I said link you will find 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.570
 of course in the video description what 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.670
 he makes it out of me and sat down 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.920
 I do not really care about this 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.390
 I say it is cool to see it 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.740
 We have got it right and we can 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.330
 I might be there again 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.160
 in such an event participant in the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.780
 whole stop is played but I have 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.680
 that does not mean to prepare me big 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.780
 I do not believe it in the game right now 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.280
 buy apron and therefore high and 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.370
 gamble down because as before 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.760
 called a good player I think 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.560
 it's relatively difficult because it's always accurate 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.120
 to be up to date when do I have to give gas 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.170
 when do I brake of course I know 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.640
 I do not have to do that yet 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.200
 just do not put it that way 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.390
 one hundred percent in there we do that 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.310
 how do you see this is podcast for you 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.380
 a game that you say old swede 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.430
 ran as I do not come over I must 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.570
 have it is the hammer 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.220
 Then she wrote me the comments 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.900
 my name is jim rumen i have that 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.520
 Run here a bit short for what 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.840
 I'll have everything repacked later 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.550
 make another such full on video 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.690
 with your feedback and of course with the 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.590
 feedback what i got from the net about it 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.090
 collected 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.470
 I already had that before 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.520
 even if this video is included too 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.750
 can I have thought to myself then that would 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.280
 a bit fake so i will 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.900
 In principle, I have a few opinions 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.459
 catch up with other youtube and 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.930
 Of course, then of you skin in the 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.459
 keys write me what you have to 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.900
 want what you think what you think 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.890
 which makes the game especially good and where 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.350
 now the unique features 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.030
 are compared to others i call 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.880
 Now they play a very rough race 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.590
 So to other racing games in itself and 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.000
 what you need maybe you can 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.100
 play the thing with keyboard and mouse 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.750
 or at least the gamepad 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.300
 or even better, stop it 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.040
 Buy neat steering wheel 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.810
 say instead of this post 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.250
 I thank you for listening who it is 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.470
 Thumbs up here and made it 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.510
 Of course we always see each other with video 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.740
 I think about a week about 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.990
 I'm full on video on this one 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.550
 so make gas writes something in the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.150
 comments and we'll see each other by then 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.150
