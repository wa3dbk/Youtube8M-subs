did use this data this is by creating

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.600 
did use this data this is by creating

mutation in each class of these genes

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.690 
mutation in each class of these genes
this<00:03:14.240> is<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.420> case<00:03:14.630> one<00:03:15.010> mutation<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.670> gene

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
this is a case one mutation in a gene

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.880 
this is a case one mutation in a gene
let's<00:03:17.300> look<00:03:17.600> what<00:03:17.959> happens<00:03:18.440> if<00:03:18.590> there<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:18.860> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
let's look what happens if there is a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.540 
let's look what happens if there is a
mutation<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.550> a<00:03:19.820> gene<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.630> is<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:21.080> gene

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
mutation in a gene so this is the a gene

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.910 
mutation in a gene so this is the a gene
it<00:03:22.550> is<00:03:23.030> mutated<00:03:23.660> it's<00:03:23.840> no<00:03:24.050> more<00:03:24.260> functional<00:03:24.739> as

will be taken up by the CG in C gene

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.330 
will be taken up by the CG in C gene
becomes<00:03:31.760> more<00:03:32.030> active<00:03:32.300> so<00:03:33.080> in<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.380> place<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.830> a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
there is C gene then what is the change

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.199 
there is C gene then what is the change
in<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.130> world<00:03:37.310> formation<00:03:38.890> C<00:03:39.890> alone<00:03:40.370> that<00:03:41.030> will

in the world formation C alone that will

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.660 
in the world formation C alone that will
form<00:03:41.510> carpel<00:03:44.080> C<00:03:45.080> plus<00:03:45.440> B<00:03:45.470> that<00:03:46.190> will<00:03:46.370> form<00:03:46.640> the

upon<00:03:59.150> mutation<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.900> a<00:04:00.290> gene

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.980 

now<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.350> case<00:04:04.680> -<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.340> mutation<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:05.910> PG<00:04:06.390> as

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
now the case - that is mutation in PG as

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.370 
now the case - that is mutation in PG as
