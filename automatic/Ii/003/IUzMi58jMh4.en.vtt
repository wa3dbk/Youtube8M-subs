MacDonald signs on them I'm not sure if

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.480 
MacDonald signs on them I'm not sure if
you<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.140> actually<00:02:04.290> see<00:02:04.469> them<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:04.979> there<00:02:05.310> they

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
you can actually see them but there they

closer does not like that that's for
sure<00:02:19.060> hopefully<00:02:20.060> eventually<00:02:20.810> it'll<00:02:21.320> look

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
sure hopefully eventually it'll look

ahead and get moving in the shadow is

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.430 
ahead and get moving in the shadow is
killing<00:02:29.090> me<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.770> we've<00:02:31.010> got<00:02:31.450> some<00:02:32.450> Abra<00:02:32.870> the

what<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.670> guy's<00:02:43.850> called<00:02:44.260> but<00:02:45.260> ya<00:02:45.950> think<00:02:46.520> it's

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
what this guy's called but ya think it's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.400 
what this guy's called but ya think it's
like<00:02:46.730> axe<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.180> but<00:02:47.510> I<00:02:47.540> don't<00:02:47.690> remember<00:02:48.020> but

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
like axe you but I don't remember but

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.290 
like axe you but I don't remember but
anyways<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.310> guys<00:02:49.550> have<00:02:49.880> noticed<00:02:50.060> a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
anyways if you guys have noticed a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.100 
anyways if you guys have noticed a
common<00:02:50.780> theme<00:02:51.050> there<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.950> Halloween<00:02:52.430> each

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
common theme there is a Halloween each

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.090 
common theme there is a Halloween each
obviously<00:02:54.110> mini<00:02:54.740> set<00:02:55.160> based<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:57.830> energy

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
obviously mini set based on the energy

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.150 
obviously mini set based on the energy
that<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:59.000> requires<00:02:59.570> which<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.560> pretty<00:03:00.710> cool<00:03:00.950> if

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
that it requires which is pretty cool if

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.310 
that it requires which is pretty cool if
you<00:03:01.250> guys<00:03:01.310> remember<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.390> same<00:03:02.720> as<00:03:03.020> what

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
you guys remember it is the same as what

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.260 
you guys remember it is the same as what
they<00:03:03.470> have<00:03:03.710> in<00:03:03.950> our<00:03:04.900> southern<00:03:05.900> island<00:03:06.440> sets

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
they have in our southern island sets

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
they have in our southern island sets
here<00:03:08.270> we<00:03:08.360> go<00:03:08.450> here<00:03:08.720> are<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.870> ones<00:03:09.050> that<00:03:09.140> you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
here we go here are the ones that you

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.860 
here we go here are the ones that you
guys<00:03:09.440> seen<00:03:09.680> before<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.580> Chikorita<00:03:11.150> obviously

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
guys seen before the Chikorita obviously

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.560 
guys seen before the Chikorita obviously
and<00:03:12.050> then<00:03:12.080> we<00:03:13.010> got<00:03:13.220> audition<00:03:13.850> Volvo<00:03:14.209> Zords<00:03:14.510> a

Marilyn<00:03:28.400> such<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.670> cool<00:03:28.850> card<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.300> wish<00:03:29.510> they

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
Marilyn such a cool card I wish they

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.560 
Marilyn such a cool card I wish they
made<00:03:29.690> more<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.739> Neo<00:03:31.130> series<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.420> new

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
made more of the Neo series and the new

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.630 
made more of the Neo series and the new
sets<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.230> would<00:03:33.410> make<00:03:33.560> me<00:03:33.709> happy<00:03:34.040> and<00:03:34.220> that's

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
sets it would make me happy and that's

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.550 
sets it would make me happy and that's
pretty<00:03:34.910> much<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.150> set<00:03:35.600> but<00:03:35.989> there<00:03:36.230> was<00:03:36.350> also

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
pretty much the set but there was also

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.590 
pretty much the set but there was also
some<00:03:37.010> other<00:03:37.220> cool<00:03:37.489> cards<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.000> are<00:03:38.120> extremely

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
some other cool cards that are extremely

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.920 
some other cool cards that are extremely
hard<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.200> come<00:03:39.500> across<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:40.660> those<00:03:41.660> are<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
hard to come across and those are the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.860 
hard to come across and those are the
holographic<00:03:42.739> energy<00:03:43.459> cards<00:03:43.700> these<00:03:44.570> are

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
holographic energy cards these are

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.490 
holographic energy cards these are
probably<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:46.239> best<00:03:47.239> holographic<00:03:48.170> energy

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
probably the best holographic energy

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.130 
probably the best holographic energy
cards<00:03:48.709> I've<00:03:48.860> ever<00:03:49.100> seen<00:03:49.430> they<00:03:50.180> are<00:03:50.330> amazing<00:03:50.690> if

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
cards I've ever seen they are amazing if

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.160 
cards I've ever seen they are amazing if
anyone<00:03:51.680> ever<00:03:51.860> had<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.100> play<00:03:52.370> set<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.880> these<00:03:53.170> that

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
anyone ever had a play set of these that

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.260 
anyone ever had a play set of these that
would<00:03:54.410> that<00:03:54.680> would<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.400> amazing<00:03:55.640> I<00:03:55.940> couldn't

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
would that would be amazing I couldn't

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.140 
would that would be amazing I couldn't
imagine<00:03:56.480> anyone<00:03:56.900> doing<00:03:57.020> better<00:03:57.380> than<00:03:57.560> these

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
imagine anyone doing better than these

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.920 
imagine anyone doing better than these
that<00:03:59.150> would<00:03:59.360> be<00:03:59.570> pretty<00:04:00.320> cool<00:04:01.390> so<00:04:02.390> here<00:04:02.690> all

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
that would be pretty cool so here all

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.400 
that would be pretty cool so here all
the<00:04:03.140> energy<00:04:03.500> cards<00:04:04.630> probably<00:04:05.630> my<00:04:05.720> best<00:04:06.019> one<00:04:06.320> is

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the energy cards probably my best one is

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.690 
the energy cards probably my best one is
probably<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:07.190> grass<00:04:07.489> or<00:04:08.090> the<00:04:08.600> water<00:04:09.100> so<00:04:10.100> on

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
probably the grass or the water so on

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.449 
probably the grass or the water so on
the<00:04:11.390> bottom<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.959> also<00:04:12.350> comes<00:04:12.739> with<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.250> other

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
the bottom it also comes with the other

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.300 
the bottom it also comes with the other
non<00:04:13.940> holographic<00:04:14.600> energy<00:04:14.900> cards

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.429 

he<00:04:20.310> recalled<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.609> last<00:04:20.969> three<00:04:21.569> and<00:04:21.810> then<00:04:22.049> he

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:22.439 
he recalled the last three and then he

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.100 
he recalled the last three and then he
also<00:04:22.650> sent<00:04:23.159> some<00:04:23.430> really<00:04:23.759> cool<00:04:23.939> extras<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.930> got

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
also sent some really cool extras we got

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.459 
also sent some really cool extras we got
some<00:04:25.439> coin<00:04:26.039> tabs<00:04:26.580> that<00:04:26.819> came<00:04:27.120> with<00:04:27.330> these<00:04:27.629> most

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:28.469 
some coin tabs that came with these most

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:29.990 
some coin tabs that came with these most
likely<00:04:28.889> they<00:04:29.009> came<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.490> backs<00:04:29.729> of<00:04:29.909> the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
likely they came in the backs of the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.429 
likely they came in the backs of the
packs<00:04:30.300> when<00:04:30.569> he<00:04:30.659> actually<00:04:30.810> looked<00:04:31.139> at<00:04:31.289> them

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:31.439 
packs when he actually looked at them

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.679 
packs when he actually looked at them
but<00:04:32.039> pretty<00:04:32.520> cool<00:04:32.849> i'm<00:04:33.030> pretty<00:04:33.240> happy<00:04:33.389> i<00:04:33.569> was

graphics and what you think of having
you<00:04:48.479> know<00:04:48.599> if<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.349> could<00:04:49.590> would<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:49.860> ever

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
you know if you could would you ever

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:51.589 
you know if you could would you ever
have<00:04:50.189> a<00:04:50.370> play<00:04:50.669> set<00:04:50.909> of<00:04:51.000> these<00:04:51.150> i<00:04:51.180> would<00:04:51.509> be

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
have a play set of these i would be

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:52.760 
have a play set of these i would be
pretty<00:04:51.870> interested<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.289> see<00:04:52.439> how<00:04:52.560> many<00:04:52.620> people

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
pretty interested to see how many people

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.890 
pretty interested to see how many people
would<00:04:53.129> rather<00:04:53.729> have<00:04:54.060> these<00:04:54.449> types<00:04:54.779> of

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
would rather have these types of

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.550 
would rather have these types of
energies<00:04:55.550> impacts<00:04:56.550> nowadays<00:04:57.210> than<00:04:57.539> what<00:04:58.349> they

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
energies impacts nowadays than what they

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.980 
energies impacts nowadays than what they
are<00:04:58.770> do<00:04:59.009> now<00:04:59.219> at<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.550> normal<00:04:59.879> read<00:05:00.479> once<00:05:00.719> that

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
are do now at the normal read once that

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.149 
are do now at the normal read once that
would<00:05:01.379> be<00:05:01.469> I<00:05:01.500> think<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:01.919> would<00:05:02.039> be<00:05:02.129> really

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:02.159 
would be I think that would be really

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.360 
would be I think that would be really
cool<00:05:02.580> if<00:05:02.639> they<00:05:02.819> didn't<00:05:03.090> like<00:05:03.860> have<00:05:04.860> these<00:05:05.069> and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
cool if they didn't like have these and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.999 
cool if they didn't like have these and
sets<00:05:05.639> those<00:05:05.969> hollow<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:06.900> know<00:05:07.020> energies<00:05:07.650> I

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
sets those hollow you know energies I

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.709 
sets those hollow you know energies I
think<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.610> would<00:05:08.699> be<00:05:08.759> really<00:05:09.000> cool<00:05:09.300> in<00:05:09.479> today's

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
think it would be really cool in today's

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.510 
think it would be really cool in today's
age<00:05:10.020> I<00:05:10.259> think<00:05:10.439> a<00:05:10.500> lot<00:05:10.710> of<00:05:10.740> people<00:05:10.830> would<00:05:11.159> go<00:05:11.310> for

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
age I think a lot of people would go for

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.279 
age I think a lot of people would go for
that<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.939> now<00:05:12.389> I<00:05:12.419> know<00:05:12.599> what<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:12.779> think<00:05:13.020> what

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
that so now I know what you think what

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:14.450 
that so now I know what you think what
do<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.439> think<00:05:13.469> about<00:05:13.740> replacing<00:05:14.039> the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
do you think about replacing the

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.610 
do you think about replacing the
reverses<00:05:14.909> with<00:05:15.180> you<00:05:15.389> know<00:05:15.509> Howell<00:05:16.289> energy

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
reverses with you know Howell energy

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.100 
reverses with you know Howell energy
cards<00:05:16.830> like<00:05:17.039> these<00:05:17.219> you<00:05:18.180> know<00:05:18.240> they<00:05:18.960> don't

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
cards like these you know they don't

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.600 
cards like these you know they don't
have<00:05:19.199> to<00:05:19.349> be<00:05:19.469> in<00:05:19.620> every<00:05:19.860> pack<00:05:20.099> but<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.520> know
