hello everyone today I decided to create

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.590 
hello everyone today I decided to create
a<00:00:03.270> guide<00:00:03.629> for<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.350> area<00:00:04.650> healing<00:00:04.920> combo

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
a guide for the area healing combo

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.730 
a guide for the area healing combo
mainly<00:00:06.600> because<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:07.020> been<00:00:07.290> getting<00:00:07.620> these

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
mainly because I've been getting these

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.620 
mainly because I've been getting these
questions<00:00:08.690> quite<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> lot<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.320> stream<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
questions quite a lot on the stream and

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.570 
questions quite a lot on the stream and
the<00:00:12.630> main<00:00:12.840> reason<00:00:13.290> why<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> use<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.160> healing

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the main reason why I use the healing

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820 
the main reason why I use the healing
turret<00:00:14.880> for<00:00:15.089> my<00:00:15.240> engineer<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.619> get

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
turret for my engineer is because I get

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.220 
turret for my engineer is because I get
a<00:00:16.859> nice<00:00:17.369> water-filled<00:00:18.029> +2<00:00:18.690> Commission

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
a nice water-filled +2 Commission

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.939 
a nice water-filled +2 Commission
removal<00:00:19.760> every<00:00:20.760> time<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.029> use<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.949> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
removal every time I use it and the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.550 
removal every time I use it and the
healing<00:00:23.279> turret<00:00:23.460> itself<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.180> two<00:00:24.449> skills<00:00:24.810> so

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
healing turret itself has two skills so

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220 
healing turret itself has two skills so
the<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.279> skill<00:00:26.519> would<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.630> place<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.140> on

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the first skill would be you place it on

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290 
the first skill would be you place it on
the<00:00:28.349> ground<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:29.130> will<00:00:29.310> give<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:30.000> two

do is pick up the healing turret

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.810 
do is pick up the healing turret
immediately<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.460> give<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> a

now<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> next<00:01:09.180> step<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.659> introducing

the single blast finisher which is just
the<00:02:48.000> f1<00:02:48.440> just<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.560> careful<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:50.400> want<00:02:50.820> to

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
the f1 just be careful you don't want to

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.490 
the f1 just be careful you don't want to
use<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.150> too<00:02:51.360> often<00:02:51.570> only<00:02:52.260> if<00:02:52.350> you're

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
use this too often only if you're

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.160 
use this too often only if you're
running<00:02:52.710> away<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:54.060> you're<00:02:54.330> 100%<00:02:54.690> sure<00:02:55.020> you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
cannot pick the turret off because it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.110 
cannot pick the turret off because it
will<00:02:58.140> give<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.830> 5<00:02:59.160> extra<00:02:59.490> second<00:02:59.910> cooldown
