block put a fresh plate on it then go
one<00:00:24.090> block<00:00:24.300> back<00:00:24.660> from<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.080> build<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
one block back from it and build that

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.580 
one block back from it and build that
sort<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> blocks<00:00:26.730> 13<00:00:27.240> blocks<00:00:27.420> high<00:00:27.720> then

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
sort of blocks 13 blocks high then

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
sort of blocks 13 blocks high then
you're<00:00:28.740> gonna<00:00:28.859> extend<00:00:29.340> one<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:30.000> going

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
you're gonna extend one out that's going

you're gonna extend one out that's going
to<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:31.050> block<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> sticky<00:00:32.040> piston

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
to be the block that the sticky piston

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
to be the block that the sticky piston
connects<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> which<00:00:33.300> will<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> anvil<00:00:33.930> on

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
connects to which will have the anvil on

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.830 
connects to which will have the anvil on
top<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:35.010> build<00:00:35.250> two<00:00:35.579> blocks<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:35.969> or

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
top then build two blocks back or

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.240 
top then build two blocks back or
something<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.290> put<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> sticky<00:00:38.040> piston

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
these this is like a reverse sticky

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.779 
these this is like a reverse sticky
piston<00:01:01.020> store<00:01:01.230> or<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.710> deal<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.280> normally

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
piston store or so deal so it normally

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.820 
piston store or so deal so it normally
is<00:01:03.239> extended<00:01:03.840> out<00:01:03.989> let<00:01:04.290> me<00:01:04.379> step<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.739> the

is extended out let me step on the
pressure<00:01:05.010> plate<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.339> pulls<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:05.909> release

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
pressure plate it pulls it back release

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.899 
pressure plate it pulls it back release

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in a spiral so that the redstone connect

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.070 
in a spiral so that the redstone connect
all<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> way<00:01:20.159> up<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> actually<00:01:21.360> do

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.690 
reason they evil has to be so high is
because<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.740> how<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.860> an<00:01:41.130> anvil<00:01:41.280> has<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> be

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because I for how I an anvil has to be

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
because I for how I an anvil has to be
to<00:01:41.820> heal<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.180> has<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> 11<00:01:42.899> blocks<00:01:43.110> high<00:01:43.460> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
to heal you has to be 11 blocks high so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.340 
to heal you has to be 11 blocks high so
if<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.000> anything<00:01:45.210> lower<00:01:45.509> than<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.079> will

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
if it's anything lower than that it will

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.679 
if it's anything lower than that it will
not<00:01:46.619> kill<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.310> they<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.060> also<00:01:48.210> survive

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
not kill you and they can also survive

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
not kill you and they can also survive
if<00:01:48.869> there<00:01:49.020> were<00:01:49.110> an<00:01:49.229> armored<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.860> least<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
if there were an armored at least a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.030 
if there were an armored at least a
helmet<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:50.939> protect<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
helmet I know will protect you so this

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.920 
helmet I know will protect you so this
is<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> minimum<00:01:53.759> high<00:01:54.210> kick<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.780> know

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
is just the minimum high kick you know

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.280 
is just the minimum high kick you know
it<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.829> be<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.310> kill<00:01:57.180> but<00:01:57.659> it'll

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it can be to actually kill but it'll

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.330 
it can be to actually kill but it'll
definitely<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.740> be<00:01:58.770> higher<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.219> there

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
definitely have to be higher if there

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.280 
definitely have to be higher if there
were<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.549> armory<00:01:59.939> let's<00:02:00.240> factor<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
were an armory let's factor that in so

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.359 
were an armory let's factor that in so
if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> ever<00:02:01.500> trying<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.829> prank<00:02:02.009> your<00:02:02.130> buddies
