 And let it cool completely 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:24.420
 After the almonds cool down, start with the chocolate pudding on top of a water bath and dissolve it to 47 degrees 

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:44.235
 Lift it out of the fire and place it over a bowl of cool water and move to bring the heat down to 35 째 C
