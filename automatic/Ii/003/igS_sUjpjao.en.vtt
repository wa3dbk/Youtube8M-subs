00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.900 

I<00:00:04.700> just<00:00:05.600> recently<00:00:06.050> purchased<00:00:06.320> some

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
I just recently purchased some

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.830 
I just recently purchased some
lithium-ion<00:00:07.910> batteries<00:00:09.460> to<00:00:10.460> use<00:00:11.150> in<00:00:11.389> both<00:00:11.570> my

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
lithium-ion batteries to use in both my

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.910 
lithium-ion batteries to use in both my
golf<00:00:12.110> carts<00:00:12.559> I<00:00:13.240> have<00:00:14.240> renters<00:00:14.660> who<00:00:14.930> rent<00:00:15.650> the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
golf carts I have renters who rent the

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.279 
golf carts I have renters who rent the
house<00:00:16.520> and<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.000> golf<00:00:17.210> cart<00:00:17.510> each<00:00:17.720> year<00:00:17.990> and

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
house and the golf cart each year and

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.290 
house and the golf cart each year and
it's<00:00:19.070> always<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:19.430> bit<00:00:19.610> of<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.760> problem<00:00:19.970> because

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
it's always a bit of a problem because

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.630 
it's always a bit of a problem because
lead-acid<00:00:20.750> batteries<00:00:21.620> for<00:00:21.860> whatever<00:00:22.070> reason

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
lead-acid batteries for whatever reason

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.360 
lead-acid batteries for whatever reason
just<00:00:22.910> when<00:00:23.720> they're<00:00:23.900> newly<00:00:24.380> great<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.040> in

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
just when they're newly great but in

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.120 
just when they're newly great but in
short<00:00:25.670> order<00:00:25.820> they<00:00:26.090> tend<00:00:26.360> to<00:00:26.420> create<00:00:26.660> problems

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
short order they tend to create problems

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.000 
short order they tend to create problems
so<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:28.820> recently<00:00:29.360> installed<00:00:29.900> two<00:00:30.290> new<00:00:30.470> systems

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.010 
so I recently installed two new systems

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.760 
so I recently installed two new systems
and<00:00:31.719> so<00:00:32.719> far<00:00:32.989> they<00:00:33.170> seem<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.559> be<00:00:33.649> working

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
and so far they seem to be working

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.140 
and so far they seem to be working
wonderful<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:35.950> main<00:00:36.950> reason<00:00:37.340> for<00:00:37.490> me<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.120> I

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
wonderful I main reason for me is to I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.030 
wonderful I main reason for me is to I
don't<00:00:38.540> want<00:00:38.660> to<00:00:38.720> get<00:00:38.810> a<00:00:38.840> phone<00:00:39.079> call<00:00:39.110> from<00:00:39.500> one

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
don't want to get a phone call from one

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.830 
don't want to get a phone call from one
of<00:00:40.280> my<00:00:40.400> tenants<00:00:40.700> when<00:00:41.030> he's<00:00:41.150> on<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.390> 15th

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
of my tenants when he's on the 15th

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.740 
of my tenants when he's on the 15th
fairway<00:00:42.050> saying<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:43.070> oh<00:00:43.489> my<00:00:44.120> golf<00:00:44.420> carts

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
fairway saying that oh my golf carts

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.510 
fairway saying that oh my golf carts
stopped<00:00:44.989> going<00:00:45.350> because<00:00:45.530> there's<00:00:46.160> no<00:00:46.310> water

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
stopped going because there's no water

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.840 
stopped going because there's no water
in<00:00:46.850> it<00:00:46.970> or<00:00:47.239> there's<00:00:47.630> other<00:00:48.020> issues

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
in it or there's other issues

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.210 
in it or there's other issues
so<00:00:49.989> hopefully<00:00:50.989> that<00:00:51.380> might<00:00:51.530> be<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.800> case<00:00:51.980> with

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
so hopefully that might be the case with

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.139 
so hopefully that might be the case with
these<00:00:52.399> they<00:00:53.360> seem<00:00:53.960> very<00:00:53.989> easy<00:00:54.500> to<00:00:54.829> charge<00:00:55.640> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
these they seem very easy to charge and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.680 
these they seem very easy to charge and
very<00:00:56.510> easy<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:56.840> keep<00:00:57.020> control<00:00:57.290> of<00:00:57.520> so<00:00:58.630> for<00:00:59.630> that

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
very easy to keep control of so for that

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.139 
very easy to keep control of so for that
reason<00:01:00.140> I<00:01:00.290> really<00:01:01.040> like<00:01:01.190> them<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.970> other

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
reason I really like them and the other

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.119 
reason I really like them and the other
thing<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.480> I<00:01:02.690> like<00:01:02.870> about<00:01:03.050> him<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.770> had<00:01:03.920> one

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
thing that I like about him is I had one

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.280 
thing that I like about him is I had one
lead<00:01:04.640> acid<00:01:05.059> battery<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.600> blew<00:01:05.780> up<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:06.140> little

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
lead acid battery that blew up a little

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.740 
lead acid battery that blew up a little
while<00:01:06.560> ago<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:07.640> actually<00:01:08.000> exploded<00:01:08.570> and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
while ago it actually exploded and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.000 
while ago it actually exploded and
lifted<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.260> top<00:01:10.240> top<00:01:11.240> off<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.630> battery<00:01:12.049> right

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
lifted the top top off the battery right

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.280 
lifted the top top off the battery right
off<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.549> I'd<00:01:13.670> acid<00:01:14.150> all<00:01:14.299> over<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.659> floor<00:01:14.930> and

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
off and I'd acid all over the floor and

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.010 
off and I'd acid all over the floor and
that's<00:01:15.530> no<00:01:15.799> fun<00:01:15.830> at<00:01:16.220> any<00:01:16.370> time<00:01:16.750> one<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
that's no fun at any time one of the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.850 
that's no fun at any time one of the
neighbors<00:01:18.920> across<00:01:19.100> away<00:01:19.640> from<00:01:19.940> us<00:01:20.090> actually

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
neighbors across away from us actually

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.940 
neighbors across away from us actually
two<00:01:21.860> weeks<00:01:22.070> ago<00:01:22.369> had<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.700> big<00:01:23.270> final<00:01:23.680> half<00:01:24.680> the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
two weeks ago had a big final half the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.940 
two weeks ago had a big final half the
house<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.460> garage<00:01:25.640> caught<00:01:26.540> fire

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
house and a garage caught fire

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.920 
house and a garage caught fire
apparently<00:01:27.950> also<00:01:28.130> from<00:01:28.820> batteries<00:01:29.690> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
apparently also from batteries and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.560 
apparently also from batteries and
incorrectly<00:01:30.320> charging<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.880> those<00:01:32.090> are<00:01:32.299> kinds

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
incorrectly charging so those are kinds

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.149 
incorrectly charging so those are kinds
of<00:01:32.630> things<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:32.900> I'm<00:01:33.140> trying<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:33.560> avoid<00:01:33.770> and

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
of things that I'm trying to avoid and

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.520 
of things that I'm trying to avoid and
my<00:01:35.150> golf<00:01:35.659> carts<00:01:36.020> are<00:01:36.229> older<00:01:37.100> one<00:01:37.760> of<00:01:37.880> them<00:01:38.030> is<00:01:38.119> a

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
my golf carts are older one of them is a

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.990 
my golf carts are older one of them is a
2011<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.400> other<00:01:40.549> one<00:01:40.700> is<00:01:40.820> a<00:01:40.909> 2007<00:01:41.900> so<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.820> a

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
2011 the other one is a 2007 so it's a

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.880 
2011 the other one is a 2007 so it's a
pretty<00:01:44.210> expensive<00:01:44.600> thing<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:44.960> do<00:01:45.200> for<00:01:45.590> either

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
pretty expensive thing to do for either

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.070 
pretty expensive thing to do for either
one<00:01:46.130> of<00:01:46.159> those<00:01:46.400> but<00:01:46.760> just<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.540> save<00:01:47.900> the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
one of those but just to save the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.710 
one of those but just to save the
aggravation<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.060> have<00:01:50.060> something<00:01:50.570> that

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
aggravation and have something that

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.440 
aggravation and have something that
works<00:01:50.960> better<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:52.070> easier<00:01:52.280> to<00:01:52.700> plug<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
works better it's easier to plug in and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.890 
works better it's easier to plug in and
easier<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.960> operate<00:01:55.119> for<00:01:56.119> me<00:01:56.299> was<00:01:56.509> worth<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
easier to operate for me was worth the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
easier to operate for me was worth the
extra<00:01:57.020> money<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:59.320> the<00:02:00.320> service<00:02:00.650> that<00:02:00.799> I've

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
extra money and the service that I've

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.890 
extra money and the service that I've
received<00:02:01.310> from<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.909> company<00:02:02.689> has<00:02:02.810> been
