00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.750 

and<00:01:15.720> problem<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.550> makes

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
and problem with that is that it makes

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.300

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
comfortable was to have it turned down

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.300 
comfortable was to have it turned down
about<00:02:17.430> half<00:02:17.640> way<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:19.140> rate<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.920> measured

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
about half way and that rate we measured

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.699 
about half way and that rate we measured
it<00:02:20.459> at<00:02:20.700> not<00:02:21.360> much<00:02:21.660> less<00:02:21.959> really<00:02:22.320> like<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> kick

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
it at not much less really like a kick

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
out of gallon in the half a minute it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.440 
out of gallon in the half a minute it
just<00:02:26.160> wasn't<00:02:26.459> coming<00:02:26.520> out<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:26.850> forcefully

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
enough thankfully this is not a very

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.440 
encode goes for about 50 some dollars
and<00:02:51.780> you'll<00:02:52.590> notice<00:02:52.770> it<00:02:52.980> has<00:02:53.010> this<00:02:53.670> valve<00:02:54.180> on

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
and you'll notice it has this valve on

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.290 
and you'll notice it has this valve on
it<00:02:54.630> how<00:02:55.110> they<00:02:55.320> call<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.680> comfort<00:02:56.040> valve<00:02:56.520> what

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
it how they call it a comfort valve what

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.420 
it how they call it a comfort valve what
it<00:02:57.420> really<00:02:57.570> does<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.470> reduce<00:02:59.220> or

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
it really does is just reduce or

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.760 
it really does is just reduce or
increase<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.970> pressure<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:01.320> water<00:03:01.500> pressure

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
increase the pressure the water pressure

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.570 
increase the pressure the water pressure
going<00:03:02.100> through<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.870> thereby<00:03:04.800> increase<00:03:05.430> or

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
going through it and thereby increase or

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.699 
going through it and thereby increase or
decrease<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.880> flow<00:03:06.239> it's<00:03:06.840> similar<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.380> this

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
decrease the flow it's similar to this

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.949 
decrease the flow it's similar to this
valve<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.550> except<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.239> one<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.660> use<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
valve here except this one I can use to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.220 
valve here except this one I can use to
turn<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.590> shower<00:03:10.950> entirely<00:03:11.459> off

is<00:03:14.860> actually<00:03:15.099> when<00:03:15.849> it's<00:03:16.000> pointing<00:03:16.300> this<00:03:16.390> way

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
is actually when it's pointing this way

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.330 
is actually when it's pointing this way
is<00:03:16.659> the<00:03:16.810> high<00:03:16.989> setting<00:03:17.319> I'm<00:03:17.680> sure<00:03:17.890> I'll<00:03:18.040> turn

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
is the high setting I'm sure I'll turn

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.339 
is the high setting I'm sure I'll turn
that<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.879> I'll<00:03:18.940> show<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:22.170> little<00:03:23.170> bit

that on and I'll show you a little bit

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.199 
that on and I'll show you a little bit
noisy<00:03:23.500> but<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.340> doesn't<00:03:24.610> make<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.730> whirring

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
noisy but it doesn't make a whirring

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.240 
noisy but it doesn't make a whirring
sound<00:03:25.239> like<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> other<00:03:25.959> one<00:03:26.170> did<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:27.010> love<00:03:27.129> to

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
sound like the other one did you love to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.140

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
see that it has a wider prey pattern and

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.390 
see that it has a wider prey pattern and
there's<00:03:32.140> plenty<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.470> water<00:03:32.680> right<00:03:33.190> in<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
there's plenty of water right in the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.130 
there's plenty of water right in the
middle<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:33.910> it's<00:03:34.269> very<00:03:34.390> easy<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.720> wash<00:03:34.959> your

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.700 

we<00:03:42.340> can<00:03:42.550> turn<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.880> down<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.510> at<00:03:44.350> this<00:03:44.470> setting
