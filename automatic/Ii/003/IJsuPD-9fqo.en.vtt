00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
below I have this camera here which I do

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.140 
below I have this camera here which I do
love<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:43.010> I<00:01:43.040> find<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.760> doesn't<00:01:44.060> really

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
love but I find that it doesn't really

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.710 
love but I find that it doesn't really
function<00:01:44.600> well<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.810> low<00:01:45.140> light<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:47.240> find

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
function well in low light and so I find

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.149 
function well in low light and so I find
out<00:01:47.840> my<00:01:47.900> phone<00:01:48.170> works<00:01:48.440> better<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.920> I'll<00:01:49.040> be

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
out my phone works better so I'll be

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.550 
out my phone works better so I'll be
alternating<00:01:49.760> between<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.119> both<00:01:50.299> of<00:01:50.450> them<00:01:50.630> but

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
alternating between the both of them but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.340 
alternating between the both of them but
yeah<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.729> today<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.270> don't<00:01:53.750> really<00:01:53.990> have<00:01:54.140> much
