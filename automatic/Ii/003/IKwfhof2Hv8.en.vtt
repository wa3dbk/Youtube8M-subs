00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.009
 which one do you think is the animal that 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.769
 it takes to be born 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.320
 many will you tell me that the good human being 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.119
 it is not the human being the human being 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.270
 despite the complexity and what 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.310
 it takes a fetus to develop is not the 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.670
 human being is not the human being 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.320
 it takes longer for the elephant to be born so that 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.100
 you have an idea has a period of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.430
 gestation of 20 months the shark of 42 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:33.539
 months the salamander of 48 months and the 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:37.289
 octopus eye with the data takes four years 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:39.899
 and five months to be born imagine the 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.569
 amount of time that is necessary for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.850
 that the octopus is born, that is four years and 

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:47.190
 five months 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.710
 obviously due to the large amount of 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.429
 time they have to be to be able to 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.780
 born the mother stays stays 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.600
 watching over these four years 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.170
 and five months practically without eating 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.170
 nothing 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.760
 many many mothers do not get to overcome 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.030
 4 years and 5 months and die of hunger 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.950
 some that manage to support it remain 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.370
 so weak that they are not able to gather 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.960
 the forces necessary to feed 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.320
 so let's say that the mothers of the 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.490
 octopuses when when they are taking care of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.310
 her babies 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.220
 of their future offspring do nothing else 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.740
 have to protect them during all these years 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.680
 which reflects a sample of love 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.930
 supreme of the mother as you can see 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.899
 We have here some photos some pictures 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:43.170
 pretty amazing of an octopus 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.170
 taking care of his future his future children 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.920
 scientists still can not explain 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.610
 how can you survive in these 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.770
 conditions although they believe that casualties 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.860
 temperatures and the slow metabolic rate 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.950
 of deep-sea animals can 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.800
 help however you have to understand that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.380
 these octopuses 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.020
 because being so long without eating 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.060
 despite slowing down your metabolism go 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.130
 losing pigmentation they go in your 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.950
 rocking they are losing vision they are going 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.610
 turning white or is it really going away 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.530
 consuming slowly to be able 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.520
 protect your offspring an animal 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.170
 fascinating the octopus not many times 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.470
 we ignore what what is in front of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.050
 our own eyes the octopuses are 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.500
 animals of great intelligence capable of 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.630
 solve very complex problems and 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.180
 that also, as you can see, they have 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.370
 traits similar to humans do not 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.650
 in the sense that they protect and protect 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.160
 to the young with their life even better 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.200
 that many human beings do not 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 it's amazing to see how these octopuses 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.650
 they give their life and it's awesome too 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.130
 see how this is the animal that takes longer 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.340
 in making the whole animal kingdom four 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.340
 years and five months nothing more and nothing less
