there<00:03:00.660> are<00:03:00.780> actually<00:03:01.170> three<00:03:01.560> tiers<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:02.010> that

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
there are actually three tiers of that

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.390 
there are actually three tiers of that
achievement<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:04.410> first<00:03:04.680> tier<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.130> just

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
achievement the first tier is just

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.790 
achievement the first tier is just
finding<00:03:05.910> one<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.510> mysterious<00:03:07.110> devices

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
finding one of the mysterious devices

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.400 
finding one of the mysterious devices
the<00:03:08.040> second<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.520> finding<00:03:08.910> six<00:03:09.209> and<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.200> third

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
the second is finding six and the third

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.640 
the second is finding six and the third
is<00:03:10.650> finding<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.520> 12<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.470> like<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.590> said

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
is finding all 12 and like I said

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.770 
is finding all 12 and like I said
they're<00:03:14.070> divided<00:03:14.730> up<00:03:14.850> between<00:03:15.000> wayfarer

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
they're divided up between wayfarer

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.810 
they're divided up between wayfarer
foothills<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.470> diacid<00:03:17.040> plateau<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.700> we've

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
foothills and diacid plateau so we've

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.229
