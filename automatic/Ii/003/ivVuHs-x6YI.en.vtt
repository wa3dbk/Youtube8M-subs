00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.529
 we pass our lives to run after you and 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.119
 if unfortunately we stop we surrender 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.949
 realize that without you this life has not 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.300
 the truce we crossed you a few times 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.439
 in the eyes of parents 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.599
 we breathe badly in your absence 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 strangely it's funny you make us 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.800
 scared at all you betrayed us disappointed done 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.290
 bad but I remained for calls 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.140
 redhead you did not want it 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.550
 when you have to 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.559
 it's not nice when the faux pas 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.239
 to better deliver us intelligence 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.770
 which you demonstrate could have matched but 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.940
 we even made the ignorant believe 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.129
 that they could buy 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.140
 beyond that capricious and cruel 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.190
 yak pain with you if we see 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.620
 show in his most beautiful colors 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.750
 to flee is to survive is to expose oneself 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.310
 it's choosing to put forward your shield at 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.560
 risk of exploding 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.150
 neurotic respect is withdrawn dosed 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.020
 it's setting fire to a brain that 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.020
 can not rest 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.010
 I do not want to give up on you 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.420
 plan to win I missed you 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.980
 time was too heavy I do not know how 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.260
 the others are doing to put you on a 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.540
 pedestal will be your universality in 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.580
 counting the stars I invite more of me 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.350
 lurch you're hiding and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.890
 won 6 boats present were too 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.490
 slow 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.990
 for that put on a pedestal 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.990
 reality into account in the stars 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.399
 Yes 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.600
 brandt or not you showed us that 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.820
 was not alone and who will have people 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.320
 well in the story will tell no 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.970
 that it's not wrong there are not two of 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.620
 like you, despite the times when you could 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.720
 put a knife in the contract 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.670
 you are doing rare that makes salivate your 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.470
 public did it to me by me I do 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.910
 know too much about music you tell us 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.860
 give up before putting us in 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.630
 osmosis states from one time to another one 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 is astonished at the metamorphosis 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 it's hard to talk about you with friends 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.910
 the truth is that this convoy is this 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.650
 we hear you clash you prefer 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.660
 play hide-and-seek hidden in the 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.610
 implied you have to make fun of 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.960
 people who are often tense because 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.520
 at least one hundred face is a heart you're 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.200
 make an iceberg why you settle 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.510
 in my head if it's not your place here 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.980
 merit will always have the right role tim and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.200
 tien shue creates links because of 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.510
 well and honestly without you there's nothing 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.489

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.349
 others do to put you on a 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 pedestal strikes whose universality 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.000
 meanwhile the stars david toulouse

 of teachers on others for us 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.090
 to put on a pedestal 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.090
 quality by counting 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.250
