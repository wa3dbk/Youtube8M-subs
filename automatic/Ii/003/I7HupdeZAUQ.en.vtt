just a whole new subset of different

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.219 
just a whole new subset of different
types<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:46.560> glass<00:01:46.829> blocks<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.520> let's<00:01:48.119> go<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
types of glass blocks so let's go and

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.100 
types of glass blocks so let's go and
pull<00:01:49.409> out<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.860> red<00:01:50.430> one<00:01:50.640> called<00:01:51.360> Chinese

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
pull out this red one called Chinese

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
pull out this red one called Chinese
glass<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.799> there<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.880> go<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.600> just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
glass and there we go and we can just

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.380 
glass and there we go and we can just
sort<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.079> put<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.979> together<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.270> it

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
sort of put it together like so and it

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.539 
sort of put it together like so and it
just<00:01:57.570> behaves<00:01:57.719> like<00:01:58.079> normal<00:01:58.590> glass<00:01:58.770> same<00:01:59.280> sort

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
just behaves like normal glass same sort

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.999 
just behaves like normal glass same sort
of<00:01:59.750> transparency<00:02:00.750> behavior<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.469> whatnot<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
of transparency behavior and whatnot and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.030 
of transparency behavior and whatnot and
the<00:02:02.880> list<00:02:03.119> goes<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.860> keep

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the list goes on you can just keep

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.590 
the list goes on you can just keep
putting<00:02:05.280> different<00:02:05.700> blocks<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.360> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
putting different blocks in here and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.350 
putting different blocks in here and
it'll<00:02:07.020> keep<00:02:07.320> giving<00:02:08.190> us<00:02:08.310> these<00:02:08.759> these

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it'll keep giving us these these

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690 
it'll keep giving us these these
different<00:02:09.750> trims<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> rather<00:02:11.340> than<00:02:11.580> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
different trims so rather than the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.559 
different trims so rather than the
actually<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.300> through<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.020> these

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
actually going through all of these

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.210 
actually going through all of these
I've<00:02:13.780> actually<00:02:14.080> set<00:02:14.470> up<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.650> little<00:02:14.860> wall<00:02:15.040> up

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I've actually set up a little wall up

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.649 
I've actually set up a little wall up
there<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.489> can<00:02:15.580> kind<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.819> see<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> has

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
there you can kind of see it it has

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.050 
there you can kind of see it it has
every<00:02:17.019> single<00:02:17.319> block<00:02:17.500> laid<00:02:17.739> out<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.760> before

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
every single block laid out but before

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.640 
every single block laid out but before
we<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.569> I<00:02:19.870> figured<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.620> should

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
we get to that I figured I should

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.100 
we get to that I figured I should
mention<00:02:21.010> if<00:02:21.400> you've<00:02:21.640> noticed<00:02:22.299> these<00:02:22.659> strange

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
mention if you've noticed these strange

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.890 
mention if you've noticed these strange
blocks<00:02:23.560> laying<00:02:24.010> around<00:02:24.900> naturally

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
blocks laying around naturally

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.330 
blocks laying around naturally
generating<00:02:26.349> with<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.590> world<00:02:26.769> once<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.250> add

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
generating with the world once you add

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.550 
generating with the world once you add
this<00:02:27.519> mod<00:02:27.760> in<00:02:27.939> and<00:02:28.239> make<00:02:28.629> a<00:02:28.659> new<00:02:28.870> world<00:02:29.049> or<00:02:29.349> load

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this mod in and make a new world or load

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.160 
this mod in and make a new world or load
up<00:02:29.680> new<00:02:29.829> chunks<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:30.940> this<00:02:31.480> limestone

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
up new chunks you get this limestone

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.949 
up new chunks you get this limestone
block<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.370> get<00:02:33.519> marble<00:02:33.940> blocks<00:02:34.120> so<00:02:34.810> these

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
block and you get marble blocks so these

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.140 
block and you get marble blocks so these
they're<00:02:35.590> they're<00:02:35.890> very<00:02:35.920> plentiful<00:02:36.700> they're

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
they're they're very plentiful they're

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.990 
they're they're very plentiful they're
not<00:02:37.360> rare<00:02:37.659> by<00:02:38.290> any<00:02:38.470> means<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:39.010> find<00:02:39.250> this<00:02:39.640> just

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
not rare by any means to find this just

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.640 
not rare by any means to find this just
naturally<00:02:40.450> occurred<00:02:40.720> right<00:02:40.989> next<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.409> spawn

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
naturally occurred right next to spawn

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.309 
naturally occurred right next to spawn
so<00:02:41.680> they're<00:02:42.159> there<00:02:42.340> all<00:02:42.489> over<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.790> place<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
so they're there all over the place and

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.229 
so they're there all over the place and
you<00:02:44.319> can<00:02:44.349> also<00:02:44.709> craft<00:02:45.670> these<00:02:45.909> into<00:02:46.209> different

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
you can also craft these into different

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.930 
you can also craft these into different
varieties<00:02:46.989> using<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.440> workbench<00:02:47.890> as<00:02:48.099> well<00:02:48.730> as

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
varieties using the workbench as well as

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.910 
varieties using the workbench as well as
trimming<00:02:49.750> them<00:02:49.989> into<00:02:50.260> different<00:02:50.379> varieties

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
trimming them into different varieties

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.920 
trimming them into different varieties
using<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.370> chisel<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.389> here<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.629> just<00:02:52.720> have

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
using the chisel so in here I just have

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.869 
using the chisel so in here I just have
some<00:02:53.200> crafting<00:02:53.530> recipes<00:02:53.889> so<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.069> can<00:02:54.190> craft

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
some crafting recipes so you can craft

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.330 
some crafting recipes so you can craft
the<00:02:55.060> raw<00:02:55.629> marble<00:02:56.170> blocks<00:02:56.409> which<00:02:56.739> are<00:02:56.950> again

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
the raw marble blocks which are again

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.940 
the raw marble blocks which are again
what<00:02:57.940> appear<00:02:58.269> naturally<00:02:58.720> generating<00:02:59.230> into

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
what appear naturally generating into

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.280 
what appear naturally generating into
marble<00:03:00.430> pillars<00:03:00.790> similar<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.019> quartz

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
marble pillars similar to the the quartz

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.199 
marble pillars similar to the the quartz
pillars<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.670> can<00:03:03.790> craft<00:03:03.970> them<00:03:04.150> into

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
pillars and you can craft them into

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.930 
pillars and you can craft them into
stairs<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.769> craft<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.549> pillars

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
stairs so you can craft the the pillars

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.750 
stairs so you can craft the the pillars
themselves<00:03:07.810> into<00:03:08.319> slabs<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.489> can<00:03:09.579> also

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
themselves into slabs and you can also

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.479 
themselves into slabs and you can also
craft<00:03:10.120> the<00:03:10.359> raw<00:03:10.480> marble<00:03:10.930> into<00:03:11.500> slabs<00:03:11.799> as<00:03:12.280> well

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
craft the raw marble into slabs as well

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.879 
craft the raw marble into slabs as well
and<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.870> also<00:03:13.989> take<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.440> limestone

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
and then you can also take the limestone

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.640 
and then you can also take the limestone
and<00:03:15.099> you<00:03:15.549> can<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.790> stairs<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> half<00:03:17.379> slabs

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
and you can do stairs and a half slabs

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.430 
and you can do stairs and a half slabs
no<00:03:17.859> pillars<00:03:18.250> with<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:18.760> limestone<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.440> again

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
no pillars with the limestone and again

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.490 
no pillars with the limestone and again
all<00:03:20.889> of<00:03:21.280> these<00:03:21.400> blocks<00:03:21.669> here<00:03:22.299> you<00:03:22.959> can<00:03:23.169> again

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
all of these blocks here you can again

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.159 
all of these blocks here you can again
add<00:03:23.859> into<00:03:24.459> your<00:03:24.579> chisel<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.120> make<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> whole

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
add into your chisel and make a whole

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.509 
add into your chisel and make a whole
bunch<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.470> different<00:03:26.590> trims<00:03:26.980> so<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> list

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
bunch of different trims so the list

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.659 
bunch of different trims so the list
just<00:03:27.790> sort<00:03:28.180> of<00:03:28.269> goes<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.620> on<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.099> on<00:03:30.340> here

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
just sort of goes on and on and on here

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.210 
just sort of goes on and on and on here
just<00:03:30.879> as<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> quick<00:03:32.079> example<00:03:32.230> let<00:03:32.829> me<00:03:32.859> try<00:03:33.190> to

just as a quick example let me try to

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.220 
just as a quick example let me try to
grab<00:03:33.549> the<00:03:33.760> stair<00:03:34.030> which<00:03:34.359> is<00:03:34.540> not<00:03:34.780> letting<00:03:35.019> me

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
grab the stair which is not letting me

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.520 
grab the stair which is not letting me
do<00:03:35.500> there<00:03:36.489> we<00:03:36.579> go<00:03:36.730> raw<00:03:36.910> marble<00:03:37.359> slab<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.260> if<00:03:38.440> I

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
do there we go raw marble slab so if I

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.589 
do there we go raw marble slab so if I
right-click<00:03:38.769> my<00:03:39.069> chisel<00:03:39.400> again<00:03:39.669> and<00:03:39.940> throw<00:03:40.510> it

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
right-click my chisel again and throw it

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.900 
right-click my chisel again and throw it
in<00:03:40.750> we<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.500> get<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.680> whole<00:03:42.129> subset<00:03:42.609> of<00:03:42.699> blocks

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
in we just get a whole subset of blocks

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.569 
in we just get a whole subset of blocks
once<00:03:43.239> more<00:03:43.449> here<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.900> kind<00:03:44.319> of<00:03:44.379> like<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.680> like

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
once more here I kind of like the like

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.530 
once more here I kind of like the like
old<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.359> I<00:03:46.389> lace<00:03:46.599> them<00:03:46.840> down<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.319> yeah<00:03:48.540> so

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
old one so I lace them down and yeah so

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.569 
old one so I lace them down and yeah so
that's<00:03:49.690> that's<00:03:50.109> how<00:03:50.319> this<00:03:50.530> thing<00:03:50.739> works<00:03:50.949> it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
that's that's how this thing works it

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.839 
that's that's how this thing works it
just<00:03:51.609> allows<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.419> very<00:03:53.019> very<00:03:53.440> easily

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
just allows you to very very easily

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.180 
just allows you to very very easily
obtain<00:03:54.849> a<00:03:54.879> whole<00:03:55.449> subset<00:03:56.319> of<00:03:56.530> different

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
obtain a whole subset of different

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.610 
obtain a whole subset of different
varieties<00:03:57.549> of<00:03:57.730> your<00:03:58.269> blocks<00:03:58.510> data<00:03:58.900> not<00:03:59.349> much

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
varieties of your blocks data not much

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.399 
varieties of your blocks data not much
cost<00:03:59.949> to<00:04:00.220> you<00:04:00.370> except<00:04:01.000> for<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.239> stick<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.840> an

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
cost to you except for a stick and an

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.129 
cost to you except for a stick and an
iron<00:04:02.650> ikut<00:04:02.980> all<00:04:03.849> right<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.540> here<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.959> the

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
iron ikut all right so here is the

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.589 
iron ikut all right so here is the
entire<00:04:05.500> layout<00:04:05.949> of<00:04:06.459> all<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.269> different

entire layout of all the different

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.500 
entire layout of all the different
blocks<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.650> can<00:04:08.699> create<00:04:09.699> using<00:04:10.239> the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
blocks that you can create using the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.449 
blocks that you can create using the
chisel<00:04:10.720> so<00:04:11.409> the<00:04:11.530> sign<00:04:11.769> on<00:04:11.799> each<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.400> these

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
chisel so the sign on each of these

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.640 
chisel so the sign on each of these
blocks<00:04:12.729> signifies<00:04:13.389> what<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.930> started<00:04:14.260> off<00:04:14.379> as

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
blocks signifies what it started off as

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.029 
blocks signifies what it started off as
and<00:04:14.889> then<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:15.489> just<00:04:15.639> goes<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.449> in<00:04:16.810> these<00:04:17.019> two<00:04:17.739> by

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
and then it just goes on in these two by

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.709 
and then it just goes on in these two by
eight<00:04:18.400> row<00:04:19.329> slash<00:04:19.750> columns<00:04:20.470> of<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:22.419> different

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
all the different blocks look like I'll

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:08.939 
all the different blocks look like I'll
try<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.870> Center<00:05:08.259> it<00:05:08.349> there<00:05:08.500> we<00:05:08.590> go

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
try to Center it there we go

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.689

here's<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.490> full<00:05:09.699> screen<00:05:09.969> for<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:11.129> yeah<00:05:12.129> so

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
here's a full screen for you and yeah so

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.439 
here's a full screen for you and yeah so
that's<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:13.060> mod<00:05:13.259> a<00:05:14.789> bajillion<00:05:15.789> new<00:05:16.180> blocks

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
that's the mod a bajillion new blocks

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.170 
that's the mod a bajillion new blocks
for<00:05:17.199> you<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.379> build<00:05:17.529> from<00:05:17.879> apparently<00:05:18.879> lots<00:05:19.090> of

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
for you to build from apparently lots of

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.209 
for you to build from apparently lots of
the<00:05:19.300> textures<00:05:19.719> are<00:05:19.990> from<00:05:20.319> painterly<00:05:20.889> so<00:05:21.189> I

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
the textures are from painterly so I

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.860 
the textures are from painterly so I
guess<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:21.639> it's<00:05:22.060> almost<00:05:22.210> like<00:05:22.449> it's<00:05:22.689> just

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
guess it it's almost like it's just

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.379 
guess it it's almost like it's just
adding<00:05:23.199> many<00:05:23.889> many<00:05:24.189> new<00:05:24.400> texture<00:05:24.879> packs<00:05:25.090> into

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
adding many many new texture packs into

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.929 
adding many many new texture packs into
your<00:05:25.509> game<00:05:25.659> but<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.650> think<00:05:27.279> it's<00:05:27.370> very<00:05:27.400> cool<00:05:27.699> and

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
your game but I think it's very cool and

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:30.209 
your game but I think it's very cool and
hopefully<00:05:28.689> you've<00:05:29.139> enjoyed<00:05:29.289> it<00:05:29.650> as<00:05:29.770> well<00:05:29.919> if

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:30.219 
hopefully you've enjoyed it as well if
