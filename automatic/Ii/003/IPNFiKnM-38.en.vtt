very light if you have a quite a light
brownish<00:03:00.430> color<00:03:00.730> then<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.150> will<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.480> lighter

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
for you little light and this is

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.180 
for you little light and this is
daylight<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:24.730> will<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.300> will<00:03:25.480> see<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:26.190> if

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
daylight you will you will see that if

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.600 
daylight you will you will see that if
the<00:03:27.660> contact<00:03:28.660> lens<00:03:28.930> will<00:03:29.230> comes<00:03:29.530> free<00:03:29.950> but

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
the contact lens will comes free but

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.320 
the contact lens will comes free but
it's<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.140> subtle<00:03:32.530> change<00:03:33.250> on<00:03:33.610> my<00:03:33.910> eyes<00:03:34.150> I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
it's it's a subtle change on my eyes I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.470 
it's it's a subtle change on my eyes I
believe<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.690> suffocates<00:03:35.080> somehow<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.680> camera

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
believe it suffocates somehow the camera

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.180 
believe it suffocates somehow the camera
lighten<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.600> up<00:03:37.720> slightly<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.560> think<00:03:39.040> in

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
lighten it up slightly I think in

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.800 
lighten it up slightly I think in
realize<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.000> slightly<00:03:40.480> darker<00:03:41.280> but<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.810> think

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
realize the slightly darker but I think

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.470 
realize the slightly darker but I think
these<00:03:44.140> are<00:03:44.200> reason<00:03:44.709> because<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.910> looks<00:03:46.180> almost

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
these are reason because it looks almost

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.830 
these are reason because it looks almost
like<00:03:46.750> hazel<00:03:47.530> green<00:03:48.220> on<00:03:48.520> my<00:03:48.730> eyes<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.239> think<00:03:49.750> it

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
like hazel green on my eyes I think it

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.930 
like hazel green on my eyes I think it
looks<00:03:49.989> maybe<00:03:50.230> more<00:03:50.620> believable<00:03:51.190> maybe<00:03:51.670> more

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
looks maybe more believable maybe more

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.390 
looks maybe more believable maybe more
natural<00:03:52.980> because<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.030> wanted<00:03:55.030> to<00:03:56.400> reiterate

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
natural because I wanted to reiterate

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.850 
natural because I wanted to reiterate
myself<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.390> that<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.900> looks<00:03:59.140> slightly<00:03:59.470> dark

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
myself is that it looks slightly dark

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.630 
myself is that it looks slightly dark
and<00:04:00.100> rely<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.989> again<00:04:02.860> as<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.130> said<00:04:03.190> it's<00:04:03.550> in

was it was a little bit maybe slightly
uncomfortable<00:05:03.210> because<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:05.159> material<00:05:06.159> of

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
uncomfortable because the material of

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.430 
uncomfortable because the material of
the<00:05:06.460> contact<00:05:06.819> lens<00:05:06.880> is<00:05:07.360> slightly<00:05:07.810> different

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.430 
the contact lens is slightly different
to<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.650> rest<00:05:08.970> and<00:05:09.970> I'm<00:05:10.180> not<00:05:10.389> sure<00:05:10.630> it's<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.199> new

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
to the rest and I'm not sure it's a new

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.040 
to the rest and I'm not sure it's a new
material<00:05:11.860> or<00:05:12.250> this<00:05:12.789> is<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.120> material<00:05:13.389> of<00:05:13.780> the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
material or this is the material of the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.159 
material or this is the material of the
Gila<00:05:14.289> charm<00:05:14.680> contact<00:05:15.490> lenses<00:05:15.789> because<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.840> is

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
Gila charm contact lenses because it is

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.570 
Gila charm contact lenses because it is
slightly<00:05:18.810> it's<00:05:19.810> slightly<00:05:20.229> more<00:05:20.409> thick<00:05:21.250> and

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
slightly it's slightly more thick and

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.040 
slightly it's slightly more thick and
more<00:05:22.380> springing<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:24.250> it<00:05:24.940> really<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.750> doesn't

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
more springing so it really it doesn't

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.330 
more springing so it really it doesn't
really<00:05:27.930> slips<00:05:28.930> too<00:05:29.169> much<00:05:29.409> in<00:05:29.590> your<00:05:29.740> eyes<00:05:29.919> so

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
really slips too much in your eyes so

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.730 
really slips too much in your eyes so
it's<00:05:30.550> quite<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.330> sturdy<00:05:31.750> consequence<00:05:32.380> once<00:05:32.620> you

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
it's quite a sturdy consequence once you

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.879 
it's quite a sturdy consequence once you
put<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.039> team<00:05:33.310> is<00:05:33.520> gonna<00:05:34.030> stay<00:05:34.419> put<00:05:34.780> oh<00:05:35.110> I

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
put the team is gonna stay put oh I

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.649 
put the team is gonna stay put oh I
think<00:05:36.009> for<00:05:36.340> that<00:05:36.370> reason<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.909> it<00:05:37.090> reminds<00:05:37.509> me

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
think for that reason and it reminds me

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.719 
think for that reason and it reminds me
little<00:05:38.080> bit<00:05:38.169> of<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.560> material<00:05:38.830> on<00:05:39.219> the<00:05:39.430> air

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
little bit of the material on the air

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.930 
little bit of the material on the air
optics<00:05:40.330> which<00:05:40.780> I<00:05:41.080> believe<00:05:41.500> is<00:05:41.889> one<00:05:42.699> of<00:05:42.729> the

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
optics which I believe is one of the

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.520 
optics which I believe is one of the
most<00:05:43.120> of<00:05:43.389> civil<00:05:43.690> consequences

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
most of civil consequences

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.309 
most of civil consequences
so<00:05:44.949> my<00:05:45.520> experience<00:05:45.729> longer<00:05:46.569> you<00:05:46.719> wear<00:05:46.900> this

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
so my experience longer you wear this

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.559 
so my experience longer you wear this
consequence<00:05:48.009> is<00:05:48.400> the<00:05:48.460> more<00:05:48.759> comfortable<00:05:49.000> it

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
consequence is the more comfortable it

00:05:49.569 --> 00:06:02.640 
consequence is the more comfortable it
