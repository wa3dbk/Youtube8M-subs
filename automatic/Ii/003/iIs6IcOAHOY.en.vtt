00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 you see that people have no idea 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.179
 it's more than they do not even know that there's 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 be or comparsa but sometimes I say 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.070
 yes I have to share that yes 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 where what is done is clear 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.330
 not the truth that they have no idea yes 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.130
 it's good how you lived this 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.439
 first weekend on Saturday more 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.449
 On Sunday morning, the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.550
 subject of the sun the wait of imagine that the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.699
 Wait is what lowers your adrenaline 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.190
 natural when you have to do something is 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.020
 like you iron with little distinction 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.570
 and a little the truth that if one is 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.519
 tired it was cold but the truth that 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.790
 then what gives you the strength of the 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.000
 people fanaticism how it supports you 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.790
 encourages at all times and soft and water 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.530
 that there were creatures and they were all 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.170
 encouraging and that's the truth that I 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.699
 He really wanted to dance 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.460
 well you saw like I do not know if you 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.210
 you saw in the movie dance good I am 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.690
 very criticized me all the time always 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.940
 I'm always 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.430
 evaluating all the time and trying to 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.760
 always improve for me I always have 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.370
 to improve something always always good 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.920
 you come with all the scrolls all the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.260
 world says an aldana is one of the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.510
 great candidates this the truth that 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.810
 dance very well what things you lack 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:32.690
 here you think to adjust and is able to be 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.150
 a little more sympathetic can be serious 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.000
 but I do not know I think it's a matter of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.310
 concentration 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 I try to concentrate on being able to continue 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.720
 enduring that not many are 10 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.270
 minutes that we have to be there and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.580
 I want more or less will not reach the end 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.380
 from tired I always try to save a 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.010
 little energy for the end to finish 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.030
 always blue not and that I try too 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.760
 to control a little 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.360
 for example what happened on Wednesday 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.340
 is half and with fear was that the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.670
 scenario I had not seen it there was a 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.459
 wood then already moved all the time 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.690
 it was full of feathers stones and it was 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.730
 like the whole guy was looking at the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.220
 floor so as not to fall down let's say and it was like that 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.440
 I had a little space if out there 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.220
 clashed with Victor or the girls 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.680
 and out there I got a little misplaced but 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.360
 good for the next one for sure 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 well the floor will continue like this 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.620
 if out there that felt like losing the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.989
 balance out there and the movements by 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.790
 I say that I should have marked more 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.640
 cuts and that but at the same time I could not 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.739
 because I was afraid of falling or losing the 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.390
 Balance 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.459
 well I saw the one on Sunday I saw you from 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.700
 close and affirmations on my channel in 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.920
 youtube in this visit all the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.629
 videos of the day of the first of the first 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.540
 night note that he looked a lot goes out to the 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:01.109
 samba school I do not know if you feel happened 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.910
 what I was looking at all the time is for a 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.739
 theme of I do not know how I'm dancing 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.750
 with them I am sharing with that and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.400
 it's like I look at them because apart 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.470
 we stop in good vibes 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.269
 the truth that divines the girls the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.790
 boys, víctor rosso, that's why it's like 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.069
 I dance and here I am sharing my 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.980
 dance with them because we are a group 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.590
 good as as cavani suárez or as you 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.540
 the insertion in the carnival of 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.459
 current already with all the essays 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.859
 this first weekend here is 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.230
 speak and here we talk about the morning 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:36.969
 early until the carnival night and it's 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.349
 what you like what you do not like is the 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:42.879
 discussion at the cane post was 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.609
 samba school was just nativity 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:48.970
 Fernández cooks also that was 2011 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.849
 Andrea Torres also good is very from 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.890
 a lot of exposure you're going to keep at 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.069
 margin you will get involved in the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.349
 discuss to see what they say have the 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.639
 true that I 'm not interested in that 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.099
 because it will always be in those who go 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.650
 to speak badly well and the truth that no no 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.989
 I'm not interested I always listen to 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.780
 constructive criticism the rest I do not 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.030
 interesting because there's always going to be 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.430
 people who speak for other let's say and what 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.530
 only that I care about myself for 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.930
 improve day by day to grow as 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.530
 dancer and not to fail my comparsa 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.810
 and make it look good and win good 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.820
 surprised your choice I remember in the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.940
 and in the riverbank complex I do not know in what month 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.180
 in August you did not decide to introduce yourself was 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.300
 something that you had thought how it was for 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.190
 stand for those elections and if the 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.320
 I really wanted to introduce myself and then 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.410
 I felt like I was a bit hungry 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.090
 because the truth that a post 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.430
 important that you have to have a lot 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.840
 responsibility and it's not that you do not have it 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:56.139
 but that there was in another let's say 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.730
 with other competences also and as 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.030
 that he had many things in his head and 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:03.790
 that water and apart will go as well 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.040
 I did not have much that was going to stay and we're going 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.320
 for being of resistance recently that 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.720
 I entered the comparsa and as if 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.940
 I had a lot of February but one day before 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.510
 well they asked me to present and good 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.430
 I said if I'm going to try just in case and 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.220
 this morning I heard good with gavin 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.520
 zevallos we hear the cuts a little 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.970
 we put something together and that's it with a 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.970
 morning 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.400
 Obviously you feel very loose very 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.560
 natural i am fake dancer how how 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.440
 Rate this from 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.940
 after dancing in front of a 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.820
 samba school 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:49.580
 it's easy for me it's a challenge 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:52.220
 question of challenge as a dancer 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.860
 It serves me a lot as an experience for me 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.289
 and we go and if the truth that I am 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.990
 I'm always very calm because I 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.840
 10 years ago that already danced and that I am 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.879
 dancer there everything 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.669
 confidence to me I did not lack yes for that 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:09.379
 that is, you are still rehearsing and you already 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.639
 you are preparing and I said that always 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:16.759
 not really but I said yes because you 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.740
 we're going to kill and I think we 're not going anymore and 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.990
 I'm rehearsing and the suit already 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.449
 I have a lie they did not have is the cream with 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.710
 this is nothing but wait because 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.660
 I'm sure that's it 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.210
 I like to improvise too 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.560
 yes I out there when I have a 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.330
 choreography out there I get nervous 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.490
 because if I forgot a little step and I 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.800
 it hurts everything and xavi faces like that is not there 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.900
 and I love to improvise I like 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.570
 to do shows I do all the ends 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.470
 weeks I have I do at parties let's say 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.090
 I do not dance Arabic I dance everything and I already 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.260
 I'm used to being among the 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:54.990
 people and do I just like it then 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.020
 out there improvised and depends on my state 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.570
 of mind let's say of the people also that 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:04.170
 the people out there give you a lot of encouragement 

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:07.320

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:09.450
