00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
out because my curls are a little

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.609 
out because my curls are a little
tighter<00:01:04.129> when<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.450> defy<00:01:06.450> my<00:01:06.780> hair<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.320> let<00:01:07.500> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
tighter when I defy my hair and I let it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
tighter when I defy my hair and I let it
just<00:01:07.740> naturally<00:01:08.430> dry<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.720> little

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
just naturally dry I have a little

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.280 
just naturally dry I have a little
tighter<00:01:10.350> curl<00:01:10.820> sometimes<00:01:11.820> I'll<00:01:12.240> blow<00:01:12.930> dry<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
tighter curl sometimes I'll blow dry it

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.679 
tighter curl sometimes I'll blow dry it
and<00:01:13.530> defuse<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.520> it'll<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.420> this

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and defuse it and it'll have this

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.899 
and defuse it and it'll have this
texture<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.590> automatically<00:01:17.340> because<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
texture to it automatically because of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.899 
texture to it automatically because of
the<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.900> dryer<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.580> let
