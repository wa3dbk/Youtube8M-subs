at<00:00:59.780> training<00:01:00.049> 90%<00:01:00.949> plus<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:01.820> did<00:01:01.909> you<00:01:02.000> do

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:12.010 
at training 90% plus so what did you do
to<00:01:02.720> get<00:01:02.869> towards<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:03.379> goal

90%<00:01:12.740> plus<00:01:12.920> range

90% plus range

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.690 
90% plus range
for<00:01:14.780> example<00:01:15.380> for<00:01:16.010> me<00:01:16.100> to<00:01:16.190> hit<00:01:16.280> my<00:01:16.400> four<00:01:16.610> or

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
for example for me to hit my four or

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.500 
for example for me to hit my four or
five<00:01:16.880> four<00:01:17.060> times

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
five four times

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.680 
five four times
yeah<00:01:17.630> I<00:01:17.810> think<00:01:17.930> my<00:01:18.350> average<00:01:18.740> same<00:01:19.070> way<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.370> was

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
yeah I think my average same way it was

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.450 
yeah I think my average same way it was
375<00:01:20.690> for<00:01:21.140> basically<00:01:21.410> sets<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.830> five<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.190> six

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
375 for basically sets of five to six

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.000 
375 for basically sets of five to six
yeah<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.630> just<00:01:23.930> slowly<00:01:24.140> build<00:01:24.500> volume<00:01:24.890> in

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
yeah so I just slowly build volume in

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.670 
yeah so I just slowly build volume in
7080<00:01:25.670> percent<00:01:26.090> range<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.750> then<00:01:27.230> once<00:01:27.470> more

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
7080 percent range and then once more

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.800 
7080 percent range and then once more
I'll<00:01:27.890> test<00:01:28.190> something<00:01:28.790> so<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.000> tested<00:01:29.420> two<00:01:29.510> four

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
I'll test something so I tested two four

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.940 
I'll test something so I tested two four
or<00:01:29.900> five<00:01:30.110> ten<00:01:30.560> reps

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
or five ten reps

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.370 
or five ten reps
yeah<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:31.790> basically<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.480> keep<00:01:32.900> adding<00:01:33.080> a

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
yeah so basically I just keep adding a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.420 
yeah so basically I just keep adding a
little<00:01:33.500> bit<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.740> all<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.010> hear<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.220> little<00:01:34.310> bit

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
little bit of all you hear a little bit

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.760 
little bit of all you hear a little bit
of<00:01:34.490> lime<00:01:34.640> in<00:01:34.700> there<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.870> slowly<00:01:36.230> adds<00:01:36.530> up

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
of lime in there and it slowly adds up

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.910 
of lime in there and it slowly adds up
so<00:01:36.980> if<00:01:37.160> I<00:01:37.280> had<00:01:37.400> like<00:01:37.580> one<00:01:37.760> set<00:01:38.650> at<00:01:39.650> three

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
so if I had like one set at three

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.820 
so if I had like one set at three
seventy-five<00:01:40.250> percent<00:01:40.940> six<00:01:41.510> per<00:01:42.500> training

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
seventy-five percent six per training

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.460 
seventy-five percent six per training
session<00:01:43.160> I<00:01:43.220> fetch<00:01:43.550> twice<00:01:43.790> a<00:01:43.820> week<00:01:44.140> over<00:01:45.140> 12

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
session I fetch twice a week over 12

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.280 
session I fetch twice a week over 12
weeks<00:01:45.680> which<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:45.980> have<00:01:46.130> an<00:01:46.220> extra<00:01:46.550> four<00:01:47.290> sets

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
weeks which I have an extra four sets

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.290 
weeks which I have an extra four sets
water<00:01:49.070> that's<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.490> lot<00:01:49.640> of<00:01:49.670> which<00:01:49.850> accumulated

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
water that's a lot of which accumulated

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.390 
water that's a lot of which accumulated
yeah<00:01:50.510> is<00:01:50.960> that<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.200> just<00:01:51.350> like<00:01:51.620> I<00:01:51.680> 150

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
yeah is that so just like I 150

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.710 
yeah is that so just like I 150
basically<00:01:53.210> breaths

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
basically breaths

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.120 
basically breaths
yeah<00:01:54.140> three<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.470> thirty<00:01:54.590> five<00:01:54.740> pounds<00:01:54.920> which

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
yeah three to thirty five pounds which

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.820 
yeah three to thirty five pounds which
is<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.280> huge<00:01:55.640> training<00:01:55.880> stimulus<00:01:56.290> so<00:01:57.290> contrary

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
is a huge training stimulus so contrary

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.610 
is a huge training stimulus so contrary
to<00:01:58.040> what<00:01:58.160> people<00:01:58.190> think<00:01:58.930> training<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.050> not<00:02:00.260> a

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
to what people think training is not a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:07.510 
to what people think training is not a
rocket<00:02:05.290> analysis<00:02:06.290> it's<00:02:06.500> not<00:02:06.650> failing<00:02:07.010> it's

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
rocket analysis it's not failing it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.730 
rocket analysis it's not failing it's
not<00:02:07.700> screaming<00:02:07.970> it's<00:02:08.780> just<00:02:08.960> put<00:02:09.230> the<00:02:09.320> work<00:02:09.500> in

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
not screaming it's just put the work in

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.650 
not screaming it's just put the work in
you<00:02:10.070> don't<00:02:10.250> have<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.490> train<00:02:10.700> with<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.910> maximal

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
you don't have to train with a maximal

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.870 
you don't have to train with a maximal
weight<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:12.140> achieve

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880
