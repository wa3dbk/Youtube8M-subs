00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.410

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 simple recipe try to bake 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.280

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.320
 need well here's a recipe for us 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
 recommend 5-6 young tubers 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 small potatoes 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 I put in general more I measured 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.530
 how much will fit into the pan and completely 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.180
 scored and and potatoes then 1 tea 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.800
 spoon of olive oil 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.399
 but I do not know how it is possible in one tea 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.530
 spoon smear all this potatoes here 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.440
 I did not work so I took two 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.229
 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.020
 1 head of garlic a few twigs 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.710
 thyme has all dry grass 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.049
 Well in bags as spices salt I by the way 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.840
 did not add because I decided to add 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.869
 another seasoning for potatoes black 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.659
 freshly ground pepper and large pinch 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.080
 ground chili optional chili i also don't 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 added in principle what we do we 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.450
 wash my potatoes with a brush here if there 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.009
 have these sprouted there or whether the eyes 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.409
 something this is all washed away 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.229
 disassemble garlic cloves clean and in 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.570
 a bowl lay the garlic with potatoes 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.729
 further we sprinkle it all with injuries 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.070
 I listed above but I will leave here 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.790
 the recipe is still to make you vividly 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.920
 watched and fill it all with olive 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.990
 oil mix and ship to 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.990
 preheated frying pan 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.210
 further as soon as we laid out the potatoes and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.060
 covered the lid immediately reduce the fire 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.450
 I have a maximum of three on my stove 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.860
 I subtract to edinichki we basically all 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.840
 waiting for somewhere 25-30 mm 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.000
 until the potatoes are ready and here 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.490
 here in the book we are given advice for 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.770
 This dish is ideal the smallest 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.420
 a walnut-sized potato 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.310
 there are such small potatoes 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.310
 so they just baked and happen 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.840
 it is much faster than as large 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.490
 potatoes in general take about 15 minutes 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.770
 baking here is such a small 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.340
 potato issue now see what have 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.340
 I got 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.930
 This is how I got a potato 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.569
 I hope that a simple recipe for you 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.949
 Liked everyone for their attention and 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.949
 bon appetit and bye
