00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.850
 the girl is like this I hope she gets 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.550
 find very very well I love you 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.980
 show in a video in the routine 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.030
 makeup that I have been carrying day by day 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.340
 to the school to service and so 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.890
 let's start making up our 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.620
 eyebrows defining them very well and then 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 combing the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.050
 apply a first and if you do not have use 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 a concealer later with a shadow 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.910
 brown and a brush for 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.149
 blur defines the basin very well but 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.250
 try to be very subtle we are looking 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.070
 a natural effect so do not overdo it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.649
 with the color now take any shade 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.449
 clarita that you have in your house I in this 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.640
 occasion I chose this as a champagne 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 rose that I had out there and we're going to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 place all over the mobile eyelid to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 add a little dimension takes a 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.390
 little of a dark brown shadow with a 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.979
 brush to blur but again not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.039
 you exceed with the color we look for a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.170
 natural effect now let's delineate 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.060
 the eyes you can choose the delineated 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.640
 of your preference in our song I 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.850
 I'm going to make a successful ogre with a tail 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.000
 but if you want something more delicate then 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.310
 better do not make it so thick my part 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.679
 favorite is the mascara so 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.720
 that applies many many layers and does not 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.700
 forget the lower lashes that 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.700
 they are also very important 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.670
 and now we go with the face first 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.250
 What I do is put my corrector after 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 Seal everything with polvitos and once that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.229
 apply all over my face so it does not 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 they split your lips is very important 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.109
 that you use a lip balm 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.259
 and on the cheeks use this pink plus 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:01.140
 that is my favorite and well it would be like that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.819
 the first version of the look but if you 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.979
 you prefer to wear some color in the 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.860
 lips I recommend this lipstick that I 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.649
 has fascinated in this fall is like a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.580
 burnt pink but it's very subtle and I do not know 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.410
 You see very very colorful and ready you achieve a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 look that is in the trend because 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.629

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.690
