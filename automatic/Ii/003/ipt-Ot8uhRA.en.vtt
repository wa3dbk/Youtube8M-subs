about straightening my hair or fooling

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.249 
about straightening my hair or fooling

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
with the closure it's just a lot less

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.170 
with the closure it's just a lot less
hassle<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> don't<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> use

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
hassle and because I don't have to use

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.640 
hassle and because I don't have to use
any<00:01:39.420> heat<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.110> don't<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.470> worry

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
any heat I really don't have to worry

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.140 
any heat I really don't have to worry
about<00:01:40.740> heat<00:01:41.040> damage<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> really

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
about heat damage so this is a really

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
about heat damage so this is a really
good<00:01:42.360> protective<00:01:42.899> style<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.320> well<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.159> hair

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
good protective style as well this hair

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.580 
good protective style as well this hair
is<00:01:44.610> super<00:01:44.850> full<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.810> mentioned<00:01:46.259> before<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
is super full like I mentioned before I

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
is super full like I mentioned before I
only<00:01:46.860> use<00:01:47.130> two<00:01:47.369> bundles<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> hair<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> was

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
only use two bundles of hair and it was

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
only use two bundles of hair and it was
definitely<00:01:48.990> enough<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.740> complete<00:01:50.310> install

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
definitely enough for a complete install

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.569 
definitely enough for a complete install
I<00:01:51.090> only<00:01:51.570> left<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> tiny<00:01:52.590> tiny<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.399> my

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
I only left out a tiny tiny bit of my

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.999 
I only left out a tiny tiny bit of my
natural<00:01:53.939> hair<00:01:54.090> blended<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
natural hair blended and that's it but I

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.620 
natural hair blended and that's it but I
did<00:01:56.399> kind<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.670> run<00:01:56.820> into<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.090> issue<00:01:57.210> with<00:01:57.509> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
did kind of run into an issue with this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.209 
did kind of run into an issue with this
hair<00:01:57.840> because<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.409> not<00:01:58.740> used<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.070> only

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
hair because I'm not used to only

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.069 
hair because I'm not used to only
wearing<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.640> bundles<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.299> when<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> first<00:02:00.810> sold

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
wearing two bundles so when I first sold

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
wearing two bundles so when I first sold
it<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> laid<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> tracks<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it in I laid the tracks like how I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.190 
it in I laid the tracks like how I
normally<00:02:03.030> would<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.689> really<00:02:04.079> close

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
normally would which is really close

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.160 
normally would which is really close
together<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> got<00:02:05.640> like

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
together but when I got like

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.080 
together but when I got like
right<00:02:06.259> here<00:02:06.619> I<00:02:06.770> ran<00:02:07.040> out<00:02:07.250> of<00:02:07.280> here<00:02:07.520> so<00:02:07.729> I<00:02:07.759> had<00:02:07.970> to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
right here I ran out of here so I had to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.449 
right here I ran out of here so I had to
completely<00:02:08.479> take<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:08.780> out<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.259> redo<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.009> so

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
completely take it out and redo it so

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.580 
completely take it out and redo it so
when<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.030> sold<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.569> second<00:02:11.989> time<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:12.380> made

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
when I sold it in the second time I made

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.080 
when I sold it in the second time I made
sure<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:12.800> lay<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.130> tracks<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.550> lot<00:02:13.849> further

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
sure to lay the tracks a lot further

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.760 
sure to lay the tracks a lot further
apart<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.080> enough<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.440> reach<00:02:15.590> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
apart so I will have enough to reach the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.559 
apart so I will have enough to reach the
top<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.370> was<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.550> bit<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.880> hassle<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.360> I

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
top that was a bit of a hassle because I

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.900 
top that was a bit of a hassle because I
basically<00:02:17.900> had<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.349> sew<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:18.800> twice<00:02:19.099> but<00:02:19.489> it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
basically had to sew it in twice but it

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.400 
basically had to sew it in twice but it
all<00:02:20.090> worked<00:02:20.300> out<00:02:20.420> me<00:02:20.630> in<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.110> came<00:02:21.230> out

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
all worked out me in and it came out

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.229 
all worked out me in and it came out
really<00:02:21.440> nicely<00:02:21.860> another<00:02:22.580> thing<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.880> love<00:02:23.030> about

which is very surprising to me because a

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.590 
which is very surprising to me because a

lot of times with curly hair you get
some<00:03:02.900> type<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.140> tangling<00:03:03.709> but<00:03:03.920> with<00:03:04.069> this<00:03:04.220> I

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
this hair is so soft I always find

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.970 
this hair is so soft I always find
myself<00:03:08.569> with<00:03:08.870> my<00:03:08.959> hands<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.470> here<00:03:09.560> or<00:03:09.709> finding

myself with my hands in here or finding

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.860 
myself with my hands in here or finding
a<00:03:10.069> reason<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.430> touch<00:03:10.640> it<00:03:10.820> it<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.390> feels<00:03:11.570> so

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
a reason to touch it it just feels so

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.690 
a reason to touch it it just feels so
good<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.470> almost<00:03:12.799> makes<00:03:13.010> me<00:03:13.100> want<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.370> like<00:03:13.489> go

good it almost makes me want to like go

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.340 
good it almost makes me want to like go
up<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.820> random<00:03:14.239> people<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.810> have<00:03:14.930> them<00:03:15.079> touch

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
up to random people and have them touch

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.780 
up to random people and have them touch
my<00:03:15.560> hair<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:15.980> they<00:03:16.100> can<00:03:16.220> experience<00:03:16.579> this

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
my hair so they can experience this

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.180 
my hair so they can experience this
greatness<00:03:17.120> but<00:03:17.540> then<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.200> stop<00:03:18.530> because<00:03:18.920> I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
greatness but then I stop because I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.289 
greatness but then I stop because I
don't<00:03:19.340> want<00:03:19.489> them<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.670> feel<00:03:19.850> my<00:03:20.000> tracks

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
don't want them to feel my tracks

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.880 
don't want them to feel my tracks
because<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.720> might<00:03:20.900> be<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:21.079> little<00:03:21.350> awkward

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
because that might be a little awkward

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.220 
because that might be a little awkward
so<00:03:22.220> no<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.510> one<00:03:23.660> thing<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.900> don't<00:03:23.959> like<00:03:24.140> about

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
so no the one thing I don't like about

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.259 
so no the one thing I don't like about
