fish was in sad shape so I actually

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.289 
fish was in sad shape so I actually
didn't<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.610> gonna<00:01:17.700> make<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.030> too

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.100 
didn't think he was gonna make it too
much<00:01:18.450> longer<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.900> about<00:01:19.260> three<00:01:19.590> days<00:01:19.770> ago<00:01:19.979> I

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
much longer so about three days ago I

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
much longer so about three days ago I
caught<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.350> fish<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.010> this<00:01:23.760> is<00:01:23.909> my<00:01:24.060> other

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
caught this fish and this is my other

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
caught this fish and this is my other
system<00:01:24.780> luckily<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> had<00:01:26.010> another<00:01:26.280> place<00:01:26.640> for

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
system luckily I had another place for

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.250 
system luckily I had another place for
him<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.939> know<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.330> small<00:01:30.600> system<00:01:31.020> for

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
him and I know it's a small system for

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.140 
him and I know it's a small system for
this<00:01:31.350> fish<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.040> temporary<00:01:32.580> and<00:01:32.790> I'm

hoping in two or three weeks he can

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.999 
hoping in two or three weeks he can
really<00:01:35.880> recover<00:01:36.509> quite<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:37.890> I'm

good<00:01:46.650> in<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.920> system<00:01:49.520> actually<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.700> close

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
good in this system actually up close

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.480 
good in this system actually up close
you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.299> see<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.840> clown<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:52.950> him<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.310> still

getting<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> know<00:01:53.880> each<00:01:54.030> other<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:55.290> other

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
getting to know each other but other

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.039 
getting to know each other but other
than<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.340> mean<00:01:56.490> he<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.600> made<00:01:57.869> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
than that I mean he he just made a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.929 
than that I mean he he just made a
little<00:01:58.229> movement<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.130> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.520> he's

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
little movement there but I think he's

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.819 
little movement there but I think he's
settled<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.479> really<00:02:00.780> nicely<00:02:01.020> he<00:02:01.350> seems<00:02:01.649> at

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
settled in really nicely he seems at

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
settled in really nicely he seems at
ease<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.560> close<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:06.090> tell<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
ease and up close I can tell that all of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.809 
ease and up close I can tell that all of
his<00:02:07.259> fins<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.979> kind<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.340> starting<00:02:08.700> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
his fins are kind of starting to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.709 
his fins are kind of starting to
regenerate<00:02:09.349> which<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:11.239> really<00:02:12.239> good<00:02:12.420> sign

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
regenerate which is a really good sign

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.830

and<00:02:13.279> I<00:02:14.279> really<00:02:14.790> don't<00:02:14.939> know<00:02:15.209> who<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.659> culprit

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
and I really don't know who the culprit

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.920 
and I really don't know who the culprit
was<00:02:16.139> in<00:02:16.469> mine

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
was in mine

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
was in mine
gallon<00:02:17.349> I<00:02:17.500> initially<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.280> thought<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:18.849> my

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
gallon I initially I thought it was my

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.869 
gallon I initially I thought it was my
larger<00:02:19.480> tomini<00:02:19.840> tang<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:21.250> since<00:02:21.519> my<00:02:21.700> last

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
larger tomini tang but since my last

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.130 
larger tomini tang but since my last
video<00:02:22.209> I've<00:02:22.450> had<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.659> couple<00:02:22.959> other

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140

subscribers comment that it could be my

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.280 
subscribers comment that it could be my
six<00:02:27.010> line<00:02:27.219> rafts<00:02:27.549> which<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.900> more<00:02:29.109> I<00:02:29.140> think

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
six line rafts which the more I think

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.280 
six line rafts which the more I think
about<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:31.060> that's<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.959> viable

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
about it that that's really a viable

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.089 
about it that that's really a viable
option<00:02:32.709> as<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:35.230> one<00:02:35.409> that<00:02:35.650> could<00:02:35.859> have<00:02:35.950> been

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
option as the one that could have been

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.970 
option as the one that could have been

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
for a long time now I mean this fish's

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.059 
for a long time now I mean this fish's
fins<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.669> been<00:03:00.819> in<00:03:00.939> really<00:03:01.359> poor<00:03:01.750> shape<00:03:02.079> so

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
had to be done he's in this system one

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.140 
had to be done he's in this system one
thing<00:03:14.230> that's<00:03:14.469> really<00:03:14.680> kind<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.489> cool<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.790> was

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
thing that's really kind of cool I was

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.149 
thing that's really kind of cool I was
just<00:03:16.389> setting<00:03:16.659> up<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.930> camera<00:03:17.379> and<00:03:18.010> I've

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 
just setting up the camera and I've

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.129 
just setting up the camera and I've
always<00:03:18.340> kind<00:03:18.639> of<00:03:18.700> had<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:18.849> bubble<00:03:19.269> algae<00:03:19.419> issue

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
always kind of had a bubble algae issue

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.430 
always kind of had a bubble algae issue
in<00:03:20.530> this<00:03:20.709> system<00:03:21.209> nothing<00:03:22.209> too<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.900> hand<00:03:23.019> I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
in this system nothing too out of hand I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.229 
in this system nothing too out of hand I
keep<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.769> in<00:03:23.889> check<00:03:24.129> pretty<00:03:24.400> good<00:03:24.609> but

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
keep it in check pretty good but

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.780 
keep it in check pretty good but
especially<00:03:25.479> behind<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:26.500> anemone<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
especially behind the anemone on the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.869 
especially behind the anemone on the
back<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.359> nano<00:03:28.569> cube<00:03:28.900> there<00:03:29.729> there's<00:03:30.729> a

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
back of the nano cube there there's a

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.640 
back of the nano cube there there's a
pretty<00:03:31.209> good<00:03:31.389> patch<00:03:31.599> of<00:03:31.810> bubble<00:03:32.109> algae<00:03:32.229> that

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
pretty good patch of bubble algae that

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.039 
pretty good patch of bubble algae that
always<00:03:32.919> shows<00:03:33.129> up<00:03:33.189> and<00:03:33.790> every<00:03:34.659> now<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:34.900> then<00:03:34.989> I

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
always shows up and every now and then I

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.839 
always shows up and every now and then I
got<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.409> remove<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:35.949> and<00:03:36.189> I<00:03:36.310> was<00:03:36.430> just<00:03:36.669> setting

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
got to remove it and I was just setting

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.330 
got to remove it and I was just setting
up<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> camera<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.870> kind<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.799> looking<00:03:39.099> in<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
up the camera and kind of looking in the

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.050 
up the camera and kind of looking in the
tank<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.819> noticed<00:03:40.209> it's<00:03:40.689> all<00:03:40.930> gone<00:03:41.169> so<00:03:42.060> I'm

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
tank and noticed it's all gone so I'm

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.909 
tank and noticed it's all gone so I'm
pretty<00:03:43.389> positive<00:03:43.689> that<00:03:44.199> this<00:03:44.379> Tang<00:03:44.680> had

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919 
pretty positive that this Tang had

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:46.289 
pretty positive that this Tang had
something<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.430> do<00:03:45.579> with<00:03:45.699> it<00:03:45.909> I've<00:03:46.060> never

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
something to do with it I've never

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.409 
something to do with it I've never
personally<00:03:47.290> seen<00:03:47.319> a<00:03:47.949> Tang<00:03:48.609> eat<00:03:48.909> bubble<00:03:49.269> algae

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419 
personally seen a Tang eat bubble algae

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:52.140 
personally seen a Tang eat bubble algae
but<00:03:49.959> I<00:03:50.199> know<00:03:50.709> they're<00:03:51.009> herbivores<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:52.000> you

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
but I know they're herbivores and you

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.879 
but I know they're herbivores and you
know<00:03:52.269> every<00:03:52.599> fish<00:03:52.840> kind<00:03:53.079> of<00:03:53.259> can<00:03:53.530> acquire<00:03:53.829> a

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
know every fish kind of can acquire a

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.149 
know every fish kind of can acquire a
taste<00:03:54.250> for<00:03:54.569> different<00:03:55.569> things<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.169> he's

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:57.159 
taste for different things so he's

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.830 
taste for different things so he's
eating<00:03:57.459> my<00:03:57.609> bubble<00:03:58.269> algae<00:03:58.389> I'm<00:03:58.750> all<00:03:58.959> for<00:03:59.229> it

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
eating my bubble algae I'm all for it

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.569 
eating my bubble algae I'm all for it
maybe<00:04:01.840> after<00:04:02.199> being<00:04:02.439> in<00:04:02.560> this<00:04:02.680> tank<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:03.340> if<00:04:03.430> he

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
maybe after being in this tank and if he

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.119 
maybe after being in this tank and if he
does<00:04:03.790> well<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.959> couple<00:04:05.319> weeks<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:06.009> know

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
does well in a couple weeks you know

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.949 
does well in a couple weeks you know
maybe<00:04:06.340> he'll<00:04:06.609> have<00:04:06.819> there'll<00:04:07.479> be<00:04:07.509> no<00:04:07.750> more

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
maybe he'll have there'll be no more

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.689

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
colony of green star polyps was really

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.580 
colony of green star polyps was really
nice<00:05:37.890> and<00:05:38.160> here<00:05:38.430> but<00:05:38.700> it<00:05:39.390> had<00:05:39.630> really<00:05:40.410> gone

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
nice and here but it had really gone

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.130 
nice and here but it had really gone
crazy<00:05:41.010> it<00:05:41.340> was<00:05:41.520> all<00:05:41.790> up<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.300> back<00:05:42.540> of<00:05:42.570> the<00:05:42.930> Nano

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
crazy it was all up the back of the Nano

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.160 
crazy it was all up the back of the Nano
cube<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:44.370> had<00:05:44.700> covered<00:05:45.150> this<00:05:45.300> entire<00:05:45.750> rock

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
cube and had covered this entire rock

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.650 
cube and had covered this entire rock

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
and this rock which was underneath you

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.720 
and this rock which was underneath you
can<00:05:48.810> see<00:05:49.050> some<00:05:49.410> of<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.590> membranes<00:05:50.100> still<00:05:50.400> left

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
can see some of the membranes still left

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.320 
can see some of the membranes still left
from<00:05:51.120> the<00:05:51.240> GSP<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:52.550> most<00:05:53.550> of<00:05:53.730> it<00:05:53.850> seems<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.150> be

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
from the GSP and most of it seems to be

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.180 
from the GSP and most of it seems to be
dying<00:05:54.570> off<00:05:54.870> I've<00:05:55.200> peeled<00:05:55.500> some<00:05:55.800> of<00:05:55.920> it<00:05:56.040> off

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
dying off I've peeled some of it off

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.150 
dying off I've peeled some of it off
I'll<00:05:56.460> try<00:05:56.670> to<00:05:56.730> get<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.060> rest<00:05:57.270> off<00:05:57.510> that<00:05:57.810> way

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
I'll try to get the rest off that way

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.860 
I'll try to get the rest off that way
with<00:05:59.160> this<00:05:59.370> new<00:05:59.640> rock<00:06:00.000> I<00:06:00.270> put<00:06:00.510> in<00:06:00.630> there<00:06:00.750> and
