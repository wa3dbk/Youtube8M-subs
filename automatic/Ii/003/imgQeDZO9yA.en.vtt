00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.610
 hi unhappy humans i am maca the 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.530
 who is your spiritual leader your coach of 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.570
 the perversion in the name of the father of the 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.700
 son of spears saint with condom this 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.829
 video have to see and share if 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.599
 they want their brain and brain to 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.359
 your friends your loved ones 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.119
 keep being healthy the 10 things that 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.490
 we make them kill our neurons 10 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.679
 things that we do often and do not do 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.689
 we know that they are killing violating 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.880
 our few neurons remind them that 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.280
 the neurons are the only cells of the 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.070
 human body that do not come out again 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.380
 we are born with a fist and in the course 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.450
 of our lives are dying depends 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.760
 of us from other habits to conserve 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.070
 our neurons still alive I will tell you 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.290
 the 10 things we do unintentionally and 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.020
 that kill them the first thing not 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.300
 breakfast well people who do not eat breakfast 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.160
 well have the day low blood sugar 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.070
 and this causes the neurons to die 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.490
 the second contrasting thing eat of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.550
 plus 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.290
 If you eat this puts other harder the 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.140
 arteries of your brain and it makes 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.810
 neurons die the third thing 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.120
 Give smoking smoking does not allow your 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.860
 brain connections here walk 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.869
 working cool this is putting the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.119
 neurons work more and die 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.350
 the fourth thing consume high quantities 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.840
 of sugar 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.390
 if you eat a lot of sugar the proteins here 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.460
 they do not come tasty and this affects the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.800
 brain development the fifth thing 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.930
 that sends your neurons breathe air 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.390
 dirty the brain is the organ that most 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.159
 consumes oxygen if you pass it by bike 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.110
 there behind a truck you will peel it 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.539
 the sixth thing that makes you die 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.729
 neurons is sleeping little if you keep 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.440
 awake long ago that 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.970
 the brain gets tired and the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.149
 seventh thing that makes your neurons 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.009
 they die sleeping with their heads covered 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.750
 many do this this increases the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.149
 concentration of carbon dioxide and 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.390
 decreases oxygen what your brain 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.700
 dies number 8 make work your 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 brain when you're sick does not put 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 work a brain now sixth is 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.000
 sick if you go to work if you go to the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.700
 sick school then to spain the cell 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.459
 I was stabbing number 9 for your 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.810
 neurons but stimulates your brain 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.860
 our brain has to be in 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.660
 movement 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.180
 things if you do not put your work to work 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.250
 brain your brain decreases its size 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.960
 therefore its capacity therefore 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.990
 less neurons therefore you are a 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.330
 asshole number 10 silly talks 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.790
 they kill your brain talks 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.310
 deep or intellectuals promote 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 brain efficiency so you know if 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.760
 they want their neurons not to die 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.530
 practice with intelligent people those 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.990
 were ten things that kill your neurons 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.820
 and that you did not know compass this video my 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.260
 twitter when you monkey my page 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.490
 facebook the description there you can 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.810
 give a wild like remember me 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.490
 you help a lot if you share this video 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.950
 because if you do not share it your neurons 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.660
 they are going to move ass that was all that 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.720
 macarÃ¡ that is share video and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.540
 subscribe goodbye in this one that I will tell you 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.880
 the five most sold cell phones in the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.980
 history the five cell phones that all 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.170
 they had the five cell phones that all 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.270
 we saw these cell phones were up in 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 the sofa click zero mesero 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.450
 there is a fly and an indestructible nokia 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.450
 in my soup
