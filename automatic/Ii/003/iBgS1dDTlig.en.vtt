00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 good evening let's work with a 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.649
 musical instrument an instrument of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.889
 percussion for which we are going to perform 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.910
 the drum we will use the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.980
 following materials first 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.760
 We recycled a milk jar with its 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.310
 capita accompanied with fiber paper or 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.060
 spider paper 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.330
 we also use the scissors the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.750
 gun on the silicon bar is a 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.410
 drum very easy to make and that is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.830
 of pleasure for the children especially 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.129
 in the preschool stage we are going to 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:49.910
 start first by pasting the paper 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.910
 fiber using silicone rubber 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.960
 we are going to stick it little by little with the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.280
 so that it stays accurate and we are not 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.280
 go take off 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.410
 like fiber paper is a bit simple 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.950
 and we are going to put another layer so that 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.670
 our drum is liked for 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 our little ones 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.270
 I'm using the orange color a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.969
 very striking color 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.429
 for the children they will call you the 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:32.240
 attention and will be interested in this 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.240
 musical instrument 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:40.770
 as I was saying we are placing another 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.770
 layer using the silicone bar 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 We always have to be careful not to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.680
 hurt us because we use the gun 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.930
 of silicon we can hurt ourselves and 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.979
 we have in the event that it is carried out 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.760
 small should do it as help from a 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.900
 adult 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.900
 then we are going to close the milk jar 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.030
 I was telling you that this 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.540
 we can find recycling these 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.850
 materials and we're going to cover what they are 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.580
 the two ends of the jar 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.220
 I'm going to use a green color of 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.070
 Same quality fiber-colored paper 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.950
 they are striking colors of pleasure for 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.450
 children 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.769
 let's get around 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.080
 with silicon so that we do not leave 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:48.100
 take off 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.100
 so we are forming our drum 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.610
 so that it is more precise we will stick to 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.610
 the sides 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.280
 taking into account not to hurt yourself 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.830
 let's do it slowly 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.990
 hitting looking good 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:30.990
 so that no 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.990
 with more baths years 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.930
 we have stuck the first end 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.800
 now let's paste the other end of 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.800
 the same way we did it 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.800
 previously 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.750
 now 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.370
 already hitting the two ends 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.370
 we can realize 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:26.250
 we already have our drum 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.010
 in the report that he sent he spoke of 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.500
 We use the same spoon that 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.680
 we find in this rite of milk that 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.680
 it helps us to hit on the drum 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.250
 for 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.889
 from the age of 0 to 5 years because also 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.560
 we could use it 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.560
 so that they feel motivated 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.500
 Thank you
