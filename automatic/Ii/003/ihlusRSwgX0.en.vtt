00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.880
 wang ling and good welcome a new 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
 tutorial of black ops zombies in trance 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.799
 good in transit mode and good as in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.730
 the title today I hope delivered the tutorial 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.590
 how to create 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.120
 is the new weapon 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.130
 and well first 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.130
 you can not drop this thing 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 good because they do not have to leave the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.090
 beginning of the season I 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 I recommend that the principle of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.150
 coherence and departure and as good 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.640
 view of cpn big good played only 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.930
 they have to grab and you have to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.390
 take it as well as I do they go by bus 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.540
 because they are not so dangerous 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.210
 and do not leave them 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.910
 well then they have to travel all 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.400
 the map and get here until the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.890
 village 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.250
 I recommend that you be active before 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.810
 in electricity because here I leave you 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 an annotation of how to do it if not 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.900
 you know up here in the little corner and 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.210
 well you have to open this door and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.460
 add this 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.460
 this piece on this table 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.600
 I would tell them to stay together 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.930
 points for the titan because it's going to be 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.090
 complicated then after 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.040
 to see change change what does not change 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.180
 agreement that followed 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.200
 this may be 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.049
 then it seems to me that 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.049
 and then we have to go into 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 / amount of salt or something 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:53.159
 of the forest 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.329
 and you have to give us the adventure to go 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.329
 here in the forest 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.759
 without those horrible ugly things the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.740
 evil done by the contrite devil of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.799
 right they know to lose be all 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:13.460
 because you put pause vote 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:17.180
 so they stick to the left 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:21.040
 well not so much there, they 're going to see that 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.040
 fire and already reach a little cabin 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.310
 that thing is still next who is 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.860
 where is the guerrilla exactly 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 opposite and then here he commits another pm 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.920
 leave the bus again, do not reach it 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.130
 of squares and almost subway and now I 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.530
 I do not think the driver wants to climb me 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.540
 because I 'm a little 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.220
 well after our book of 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.220
 a few times the bus 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.069
 silly robot this we are going to 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.439
 go to put 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:05.329
 this piece that is like a meter 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:08.389
 heat of the temperature and good let's 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.920
 our mini craft character table 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.560
 jan 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.450
 the transit payroll 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.250
 what is in here we are going to be 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.860
 we add the parsley before 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.400
 to serve poor that now and 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.400
 is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.930
 good is the clipper tutorial 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.079
 land 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.490
 well then we're here and I did not get off 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:44.470
 I 'm lazy on the farm 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.240
 when they want to have a trolero try 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.570
 get on the bus so it does not look 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.570
 model 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.100
 i 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.840
 for this are the fields of study 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.879
 half 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.970
 more good they have to lower they have to 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.909
 go swimming a good totem the second one 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:10.150
 they announced good is over here 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:12.549
 to see if that white car s 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.980
 all right here put a lot of care 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.320
 with those things 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.320
 I was cholera on the truck 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.300
 on the right it shows why 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.420
 they are more of the children and they will arrive 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.100
 up to a total 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.780
 in that piece that we lack is like a 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.350
 handlebar of a motorcycle can be 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:39.490
 there or here where it came out to me that is first 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.490
 and you grab it so like the other 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.010
 sometimes they go and they put it nothing I do not know 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.620
 crafting me and wait for me not 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.480
 they will kill me I recommend the same 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.950
 wait, we do not have to hurry because 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.410
 I introduced myself at the beginning and could not 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.780
 that's why I spent a lot of time trying 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.340
 take steps and this time was the first 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.340
 Once I could get 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:07.070
 I no longer need a piece that is what 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.960
 is 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.540
 in electricity where you have a 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.030
 electricity have to stop for that 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.280
 I recommend you wait for the bus 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.140
 and it gives in the return and good being here 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.890
 having already activated electricity 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.840
 obviously not to die we go here 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.420
 there you can be where those are 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.910
 boats for example can be there where 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.129
 is that white there out there in there I do not 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.289
 there are less 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.089
 or maybe you do not touch me here 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.949
 Be careful with regret because I 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:38.619
 First, I played, I thought 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:41.099
 that could happen and I died so I did not 

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:41.099
 they comment 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.990
 they already know their inferred 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.810
 and then we wanted to do it with a 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.700
 subscriber and we could not not spot three 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.710
 attempts tried 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.449
 I left to play alone and I could 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.789
 beat by hand 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.090
 and well we grabbed those cables 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.880
 and we go to our crafter table 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.950
 mini trance 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.100
 and we put it we created it 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.050
 and that would be all 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.220
 let's use it let's try the 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.220
 we grab and eat 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:26.410
 and as you see on that little wheel 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.650
 of the heating of the temperature and 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.569
 reaches the rock that follows is the red 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.759
 it is destroyed they will see how it is destroyed 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.330
 I thought it was infinite to put all 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.330
 The drinks 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:43.430
 that is also that they exploded but now 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.590
 I'm going to check if this again and I 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.100
 came the surprise that you can no longer 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.930
 pick them up again 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.790
 and well that would be all I hope that 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.390
 they liked to leave like like 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.490
 is it so 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.380
 they supported the other video happened 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.360
 brother 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.360
 22 likes no manches 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.350
 and well here is where is the for capon 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:06.880
 either tomorrow or after a while I bring you the 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:09.940
 tutorial on how to do it also as 

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.170
 improve the weapons and well I hope that you 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.690
 Thank you for watching to see if it's 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.990
 crisis comment until next time 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.990
 goodbye 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.710
