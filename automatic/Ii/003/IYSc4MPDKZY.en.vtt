yeah<00:00:02.190> hello<00:00:02.490> everyone<00:00:03.110> today<00:00:04.110> I'm<00:00:04.440> going<00:00:04.650> to

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
yeah hello everyone today I'm going to

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.019 
yeah hello everyone today I'm going to
show<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:04.950> how<00:00:05.100> to<00:00:05.160> adjust<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.700> temperature

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
show you how to adjust the temperature

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.890 
show you how to adjust the temperature
on<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.420> gas<00:00:06.799> water<00:00:07.799> heater<00:00:08.570> if<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.690> live<00:00:09.870> here

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
on a gas water heater if you live here

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.629 
on a gas water heater if you live here
in<00:00:10.200> New<00:00:10.230> England<00:00:10.320> you<00:00:10.889> probably<00:00:11.160> got<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> cellar

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
in New England you probably got a cellar

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.950 
in New England you probably got a cellar
that<00:00:11.759> looks<00:00:12.059> something<00:00:12.300> like<00:00:12.420> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that looks something like this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.890 
that looks something like this
and<00:00:13.070> if<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.190> have<00:00:14.340> gas<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.360> house<00:00:15.480> you

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and if you have gas in the house you

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.939 
and if you have gas in the house you
probably<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> gas<00:00:16.740> water<00:00:17.609> heater<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:19.380> know

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
probably have a gas water heater I know

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.050 
probably have a gas water heater I know
this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.340> gas<00:00:20.550> because<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> gas<00:00:21.949> pipe

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
this is gas because it's got a gas pipe

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.849 
this is gas because it's got a gas pipe
feeding<00:00:24.060> fuel<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> tank<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.590> got<00:00:25.769> an

feeding fuel to the tank it's got an

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.790 
feeding fuel to the tank it's got an
exhaust<00:00:26.300> and<00:00:27.300> it's<00:00:27.510> got<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> typical<00:00:28.500> gas

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
exhaust and it's got a typical gas

exhaust and it's got a typical gas
control<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:30.019> what<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.140> want<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
control and what you want to do is

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.370 
control and what you want to do is
adjust<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.160> temperature<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.140> no<00:00:34.140> hotter

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
adjust the temperature so it's no hotter

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.319 
adjust the temperature so it's no hotter
than<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.710> need<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.640> don't<00:00:35.880> waste

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
than you need it so you don't waste

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.590 
than you need it so you don't waste
energy<00:00:37.399> to<00:00:38.399> adjust<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.879> temperatures<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
energy to adjust the temperatures and

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.639 
energy to adjust the temperatures and
there's<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> lot<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.200> need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.530> about

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
there's a lot you need to know about

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.500 
there's a lot you need to know about
tanks<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> adjust<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> temperatures<00:00:42.360> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
tanks but to adjust the temperatures you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.420 
tanks but to adjust the temperatures you
need<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.750> know<00:00:42.840> very<00:00:42.870> little<00:00:43.370> there's<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
need to know very little there's a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
need to know very little there's a
thermostat<00:00:44.700> control<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.690> almost<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.140> tanks

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
thermostat control on almost all tanks

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.819 
thermostat control on almost all tanks
that<00:00:46.710> look<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.550> similar<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.829> what

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
that look very similar to this and what

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.069 
that look very similar to this and what
you<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.489> adjust<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.360> dial<00:00:51.629> here

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you do is you just adjust this dial here

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
you do is you just adjust this dial here
for<00:00:53.039> either<00:00:53.239> warmer<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.530> hot<00:00:55.530> depending<00:00:56.520> on

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
for either warmer or hot depending on

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840 
for either warmer or hot depending on
how<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.800> generally<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.399> turn<00:00:59.640> them

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
how you want it generally you turn them

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.689 
how you want it generally you turn them
clockwise<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.840> make<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.140> warmer<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
clockwise to make them warmer and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.539 
clockwise to make them warmer and
counterclockwise<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.600> cool<00:01:03.809> them<00:01:03.989> off

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
counterclockwise to cool them off

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.580 
counterclockwise to cool them off
there's<00:01:05.549> little<00:01:05.880> indicators<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.960> show<00:01:06.990> what

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
there's little indicators to show what

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
there's little indicators to show what
the<00:01:07.710> temperature<00:01:08.070> setting<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the temperature setting is and if you

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
the temperature setting is and if you
don't<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.900> lose<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.290> setting<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.100> can

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
don't want to lose your setting you can

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
don't want to lose your setting you can
just<00:01:11.430> make<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.820> mark<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.390> your<00:01:13.080> dial

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
just make a little mark on your dial

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
just make a little mark on your dial
with<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> pencil<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> pen<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:14.880> something<00:01:15.299> so

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
with a pencil or a pen or something so

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.890 
with a pencil or a pen or something so
you'll<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.590> where<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.890> had<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you'll know where you had it set and to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020 
you'll know where you had it set and to
adjust<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.439> tank<00:01:19.740> temperature<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.880> do

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
adjust the tank temperature all you do

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.580 
adjust the tank temperature all you do
is<00:01:21.150> turn<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> style<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:23.490> water<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.939> fairly

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
is turn the style now my water is fairly

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.560 
is turn the style now my water is fairly
cool<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.159> I'm<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> drop<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.420> down<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
cool but I'm going to drop it down a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.090 
cool but I'm going to drop it down a
little<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.799> hotter<00:01:29.009> than

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
little bit more because it's hotter than

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
little bit more because it's hotter than
I<00:01:29.310> need<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> little

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
I need it and there are a little

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.030 
I need it and there are a little
indicator<00:01:31.670> dials<00:01:32.670> knobs<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.990> style<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
indicator dials knobs on the style and

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.800 
indicator dials knobs on the style and
you<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.310> turn<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:36.270> notch<00:01:36.479> at<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you just turn it down one notch at a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.380 
you just turn it down one notch at a
time<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.740> happens<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.850> from<00:01:39.240> right

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
time to see what happens so from right

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020 
time to see what happens so from right
where<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.720> now<00:01:39.960> I'll<00:01:40.950> drop<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.520> down<00:01:41.549> one

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
where it is now I'll drop it down one

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.859 
where it is now I'll drop it down one
notch<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:44.149> I'm<00:01:45.149> just<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> leave<00:01:45.840> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
notch and I'm just going to leave it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.580 
notch and I'm just going to leave it
like<00:01:45.990> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
like that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740 
like that
you<00:01:47.579> don't<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> turn<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> down<00:01:48.270> too<00:01:48.570> much

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
you don't want to turn it down too much

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.469 
you don't want to turn it down too much
because<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.140> don't<00:01:49.409> run<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.710> hot<00:01:49.950> water

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
because you don't run out of hot water

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.940 
because you don't run out of hot water
the<00:01:51.479> ideal<00:01:51.930> setting<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.470> energy

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the ideal setting for energy

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580 
the ideal setting for energy
conservation<00:01:53.329> is<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.390> temperature<00:01:55.020> where<00:01:55.229> when

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
conservation is a temperature where when

conservation is a temperature where when
you<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.950> showers<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.360> you're<00:01:57.750> using<00:01:57.960> your

you take showers or you're using your
hot<00:01:58.770> water<00:01:59.240> you<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.140> straight

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
hot water you have it on at the straight

hot water you have it on at the straight
hot<00:02:01.979> water<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.759> plenty<00:02:03.270> hot<00:02:03.479> enough<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
hot water it's plenty hot enough for you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.200 
hot water it's plenty hot enough for you
and<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.009> run<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.430> hot<00:02:05.700> water<00:02:05.729> if

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and you don't run out of hot water if

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.540 
and you don't run out of hot water if
you're<00:02:06.780> running<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.290> hot<00:02:07.439> water<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
you're running out of hot water then you

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
you're running out of hot water then you
may<00:02:08.700> need<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.000> turn<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.569> bit<00:02:09.780> if

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
may need to turn it up a little bit if

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.479 
may need to turn it up a little bit if
you<00:02:10.170> never<00:02:10.530> run<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.890> hot<00:02:11.129> water

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
you never run out of hot water

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.500 
you never run out of hot water
you<00:02:11.610> could<00:02:11.760> probably<00:02:12.000> turn<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> temperature

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you could probably turn the temperature

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.640 
you could probably turn the temperature
down<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> little<00:02:13.170> bit

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
down a little bit

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.930 
down a little bit
there's<00:02:13.890> really<00:02:14.069> no<00:02:14.280> need<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.610> keep<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
there's really no need to keep the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.490 
there's really no need to keep the
temperature<00:02:15.330> hotter<00:02:15.569> than<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.140> need<00:02:16.349> it

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
temperature hotter than you need it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.740 
temperature hotter than you need it
you're<00:02:17.069> just<00:02:17.160> wasting<00:02:17.700> energy<00:02:17.849> because<00:02:18.629> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
you're just wasting energy because the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.330 
you're just wasting energy because the
tank<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.140> sitting<00:02:19.410> here<00:02:19.440> much<00:02:19.800> hotter<00:02:20.040> than<00:02:20.220> it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
tank is sitting here much hotter than it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.970 
tank is sitting here much hotter than it
needs<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.610> be<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.510> cools<00:02:21.750> off<00:02:21.959> faster<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
needs to be and it cools off faster the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.400 
needs to be and it cools off faster the
hotter<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.870> causing<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.080> use<00:02:25.200> more

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
hotter it is causing you to use more

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.650 
hotter it is causing you to use more
energy<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.760> reason<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.209> want<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> turn

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
energy the reason you don't want to turn

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.089 
energy the reason you don't want to turn
the<00:02:27.780> temperature<00:02:27.930> down<00:02:28.200> too<00:02:28.410> much<00:02:28.560> at<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> time

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the temperature down too much at a time

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.150 
the temperature down too much at a time
is<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.970> takes<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.780> day<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.349> two<00:02:31.560> for

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
is because it takes a day or two for

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.729 
is because it takes a day or two for
this<00:02:32.340> tank<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.940> adjust<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.319> temperature

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
this tank to adjust that the temperature

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.380 
this tank to adjust that the temperature
setting<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.160> have<00:02:35.190> now<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:35.910> tank<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.360> have

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
setting you have now the tank I have

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.930 
setting you have now the tank I have
here<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> 40<00:02:38.160> gallon<00:02:38.310> tank<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.879> know

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
here this is a 40 gallon tank and I know

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.150 
here this is a 40 gallon tank and I know
it's<00:02:39.209> 40<00:02:39.540> gallon<00:02:39.810> because<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.110> says<00:02:40.349> right<00:02:40.590> in

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it's 40 gallon because it says right in

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.570 
it's 40 gallon because it says right in
here<00:02:41.340> 40<00:02:41.670> gallons<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:43.049> anyways<00:02:43.580> typically

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
here 40 gallons but anyways typically

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.789 
here 40 gallons but anyways typically
you'll<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.940> 30<00:02:45.269> 40<00:02:45.599> 50<00:02:46.019> gallon<00:02:46.290> tank<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
you'll have a 30 40 50 gallon tank a

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.759 
you'll have a 30 40 50 gallon tank a
tank<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.849> you<00:02:48.060> could<00:02:48.239> turn<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
tank like this you could turn the

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.020 
tank like this you could turn the
temperature<00:02:49.769> you<00:02:50.250> could<00:02:50.370> turn<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.640> heat<00:02:50.819> off

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
temperature you could turn the heat off

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.930 
temperature you could turn the heat off
and<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.930> will<00:02:52.019> still<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:53.400> hot<00:02:53.610> water<00:02:53.640> in

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
and it will still have hot water in

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.300 
and it will still have hot water in
there<00:02:54.209> for<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> couple<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.079> days<00:02:55.260> depending<00:02:56.250> on

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
there for a couple of days depending on

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.190 
there for a couple of days depending on
how<00:02:56.430> much<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.760> use<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.150> typically<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> tank

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
how much you use it typically a tank

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.160 
how much you use it typically a tank
like<00:02:58.349> that<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.420> take<00:03:00.569> care<00:03:00.810> take<00:03:01.140> a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
like that can you can take care take a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.440 
like that can you can take care take a
couple<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.590> showers<00:03:02.060> even<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.150> it's<00:03:03.299> not

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
couple of showers even if it's not

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.990 
couple of showers even if it's not
reheating<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.200> not<00:03:04.440> run<00:03:04.620> out<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.769> hot<00:03:04.950> water

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
reheating and not run out of hot water

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.460 
reheating and not run out of hot water
so<00:03:06.000> your<00:03:06.329> reason<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.930> don't<00:03:07.110> want<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.349> turn

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
so your reason you don't want to turn

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.289 
so your reason you don't want to turn
down<00:03:07.620> too<00:03:07.829> much<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.760> like<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.239> said

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
down too much is because like I said

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.240 
down too much is because like I said
takes<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.870> while<00:03:10.019> for<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.410> adjust<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> set

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
takes a while for it to adjust the set

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.460 
takes a while for it to adjust the set
to<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.579> setting<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.930> may<00:03:13.079> turn<00:03:13.230> down

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
to the setting and you may turn down

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.900 
to the setting and you may turn down
more<00:03:13.709> than<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.890> need<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.579> turn<00:03:14.790> it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
more than you need to so you turn it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.460 
more than you need to so you turn it
down<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.060> little<00:03:15.209> bit<00:03:15.420> let<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.019> run<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.410> a

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
down a little bit let it run for a

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
down a little bit let it run for a
couple<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.890> days<00:03:17.040> see<00:03:17.430> how<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.609> like<00:03:17.760> that

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
couple of days see how you like that
