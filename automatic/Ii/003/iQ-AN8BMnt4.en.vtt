00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:38.030
 it makes you or all of them 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.760
 involved are really blogger is 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.010
 actually more like that 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 the area and of course 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 Accordingly, our focus is certainly 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.070
 highest of course I am fashion but what we 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.450
 always try back 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.240
 that always a bit on the 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.180
 funny way too 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:03.020
 how important is the mature or how much 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:11.690
 it belongs to the everyday life only to no 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:13.280
 car better for yourself someone who 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.990
 like to go and find it already 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.230
 somehow as if you have other people 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.820
 sees and sees the cafÃ©s there and 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.370
 she pushed somehow something completely 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.890
 very different than if you are for yourself 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.840
 go shopping what's going on 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.970
 at this exit or well 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.530
 feels like it could just happen 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.360
 let scratch so beautiful 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.360
 wool sweater with the whole day 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.700
 combination of aesthetics function 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.369
 now very much looking so nice 24 30 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.770
 as well a secondhand store and us 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.619
 in it against the sympathetic so bright and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.030
 kind of a bit he almost like that 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.030
 a little bit she arranged me 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 mcadams that vorarlberg how is it then 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.530
 for those in a big city like Vienna too 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.860
 lay 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.930
 nice would be nice yes I'm believe 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.990
 Last country talked about as she did 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.720
 come clarified villagers 100 people 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:20.690
 somehow everyone knows and found it extreme 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.820
 pleasant as you at the moment 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.710
 In any case, as it certainly will not 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.500
 always stay because I still have many 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 Books in Austria is right 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.130
 but that's what they're in here as well 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.890
 likes to like many, of course 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.410
 things from them there but I think so 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:57.200
 nevertheless, somehow exactly that 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:59.630
 I think that's not so good 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.540
 ask the Iraqi so much so that he 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.580
 tine and classic reduced exactly 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.440
 many exaggerate it then and there 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.959
 not really from the christbaum and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.820
 Had the full body as she likes it 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.680
 rather then really so sophie 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.080
 lost a long dress and then she too 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.459
 like brightly colored shoes but find it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.060
 It is always very important that you 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.060
 exactly
