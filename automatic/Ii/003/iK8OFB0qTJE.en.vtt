00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.970 
and I'm going to keep working right
through<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.540> top<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:11.140> previous<00:03:11.380> single

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
through the top of the previous single

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.650 
through the top of the previous single
crochet

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.640 

this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.810> how<00:03:21.960> you<00:03:22.020> will<00:03:22.200> end<00:03:22.380> with<00:03:22.530> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
this is how you will end with the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.270 
this is how you will end with the
continual<00:03:23.160> round<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.240> see<00:03:24.540> here<00:03:25.280> there

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
continual round you can see here there

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.160 
continual round you can see here there
is<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.490> ridge<00:03:26.850> right<00:03:26.880> here<00:03:27.600> since<00:03:27.960> we've<00:03:28.080> been

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
is a ridge right here since we've been

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.050 
is a ridge right here since we've been
working<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.680> continual<00:03:29.070> round<00:03:29.550> we<00:03:29.850> want

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
working in the continual round we want

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.870 
working in the continual round we want
to<00:03:30.210> even<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.720> off<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:32.160> will<00:03:32.280> put<00:03:32.490> your<00:03:32.610> hook

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
to even that off you will put your hook

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.850 
to even that off you will put your hook
through<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.240> next<00:03:33.270> stitch<00:03:33.840> wrap<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.680> yarn

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
through the next stitch wrap the yarn

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.010 
through the next stitch wrap the yarn
over<00:03:35.130> pull<00:03:35.310> through<00:03:35.720> pull<00:03:36.720> through<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.930> loop

over pull through pull through the loop

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.740 
over pull through pull through the loop
on<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.410> hook<00:03:37.490> that<00:03:38.490> evens<00:03:39.090> off<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.510> round

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
on the hook that evens off the round

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.900 
on the hook that evens off the round
you'll<00:03:40.230> wrap<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> yarn<00:03:40.620> over<00:03:40.890> pull<00:03:41.070> through<00:03:41.580> I

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you'll wrap the yarn over pull through I

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.600 
you'll wrap the yarn over pull through I
have<00:03:42.360> already<00:03:42.540> cut<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.020> yarn<00:03:43.320> I<00:03:43.620> have

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
have already cut the yarn I have

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.850 
have already cut the yarn I have
threaded<00:03:44.850> my<00:03:45.180> needle<00:03:45.210> and<00:03:45.720> I'm<00:03:46.290> working<00:03:46.530> on

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
threaded my needle and I'm working on

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.120 
threaded my needle and I'm working on
the<00:03:46.920> inside<00:03:47.720> putting<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.960> needle<00:03:49.320> below<00:03:49.950> the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the inside putting the needle below the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.830 
the inside putting the needle below the
loops<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:50.880> this<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:56.760> I'm<00:03:56.880> weaving<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
loops like this and then I'm weaving the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.890 
loops like this and then I'm weaving the
tail<00:03:58.110> between<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:59.610> loops<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.120> each<00:04:00.300> stitch

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
tail between the loops of each stitch

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.440 
tail between the loops of each stitch
when<00:04:01.410> we<00:04:01.530> flip<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:01.830> over<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.910> don't<00:04:03.060> see<00:04:03.330> the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
when we flip it over you don't see the

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.100 
when we flip it over you don't see the
needle<00:04:03.810> we<00:04:04.140> flip<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> back<00:04:04.650> around<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.930> don't

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
needle we flip it back around you don't

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.560 
needle we flip it back around you don't
see<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.410> on<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.530> inside<00:04:08.090> then<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.210> pull<00:04:09.450> it

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
see it on the inside then you pull it

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.730 
see it on the inside then you pull it
through<00:04:09.600> like<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:11.210> then<00:04:12.210> continue<00:04:12.740> it's

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
through like that and then continue it's

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.420 
through like that and then continue it's
writing<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:15.020> between<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.890> stitches<00:04:16.920> like

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
writing it between the stitches like

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.600 
writing it between the stitches like
that<00:04:17.880> but<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.239> like<00:04:18.450> to<00:04:18.660> go<00:04:18.780> over<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.590> loop<00:04:20.220> you

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
that but I like to go over a loop you

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.220 
that but I like to go over a loop you
can<00:04:20.790> see<00:04:20.970> we<00:04:21.090> came<00:04:21.270> up<00:04:21.480> right<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:21.959> through

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
can see we came up right here through

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.980 
can see we came up right here through
this<00:04:22.380> loop<00:04:22.710> you'll<00:04:22.980> go<00:04:23.130> over<00:04:23.720> back<00:04:24.720> in<00:04:24.780> the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
this loop you'll go over back in the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.660 
this loop you'll go over back in the
opposite<00:04:25.560> direction<00:04:26.300> for<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> little<00:04:27.600> bit<00:04:27.750> more

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
opposite direction for a little bit more

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:36.149 
opposite direction for a little bit more
security<00:04:31.130> like<00:04:32.130> that

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.219 

and<00:04:36.339> then<00:04:36.879> you<00:04:36.999> can<00:04:37.179> cut<00:04:37.449> off<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:37.629> little<00:04:37.959> bit

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
and then you can cut off a little bit

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.689 
and then you can cut off a little bit
like<00:04:38.439> this<00:04:40.409> now<00:04:41.409> what<00:04:41.649> I'm<00:04:41.770> going<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.099> do<00:04:42.399> is

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
like this now what I'm going to do is

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.729 
like this now what I'm going to do is
take<00:04:43.089> and<00:04:43.419> pull<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.469> strands<00:04:44.830> apart<00:04:46.529> and<00:04:47.529> this

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:47.739 
take and pull the strands apart and this

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:50.309 
take and pull the strands apart and this
is<00:04:47.949> a<00:04:47.979> little<00:04:48.309> trick<00:04:48.639> for<00:04:48.669> adding<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.569> little

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:50.319 
is a little trick for adding a little

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.189 
is a little trick for adding a little
extra<00:04:50.789> security<00:04:51.789> to<00:04:52.119> the<00:04:52.269> tail<00:04:52.569> it<00:04:52.869> may<00:04:53.019> be<00:04:53.080> a

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
extra security to the tail it may be a

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.929 
extra security to the tail it may be a
little<00:04:53.409> challenging<00:04:53.529> to<00:04:54.249> get<00:04:54.459> the<00:04:54.610> strands

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
little challenging to get the strands

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:57.839 
little challenging to get the strands
apart<00:04:55.649> but<00:04:56.649> they<00:04:56.830> will<00:04:57.099> come<00:04:57.399> apart

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
apart but they will come apart

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:04.320 
apart but they will come apart
eventually

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.100 

and<00:05:04.810> wind<00:05:05.230> them<00:05:05.410> like<00:05:05.680> that<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:10.150> now<00:05:10.990> I'm

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
and wind them like that and now I'm

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.850 
and wind them like that and now I'm
going<00:05:11.170> to<00:05:11.440> take<00:05:11.770> two<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:12.850> strands<00:05:13.270> and

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
going to take two of the strands and

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.430 
going to take two of the strands and
then<00:05:14.860> pull<00:05:15.160> them<00:05:15.340> through<00:05:15.790> with<00:05:16.660> my<00:05:16.840> hook<00:05:17.140> just

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
then pull them through with my hook just

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:26.090 
then pull them through with my hook just
like<00:05:17.560> this<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.770> I'm<00:05:20.920> going<00:05:20.980> to<00:05:21.310> make<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.520> knot

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.420 

keep<00:05:27.100> in<00:05:27.280> mind<00:05:27.520> this<00:05:27.730> is<00:05:27.970> on<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.300> inside<00:05:28.420> still

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
keep in mind this is on the inside still

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:37.080 
keep in mind this is on the inside still
just<00:05:30.430> like<00:05:30.640> that<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:35.890> then<00:05:36.310> sometimes<00:05:36.940> you

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
just like that and then sometimes you

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.540 
just like that and then sometimes you
can<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:37.270> pull<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.110> it'll<00:05:38.920> pull<00:05:39.310> back

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
can just pull it and it'll pull back

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:53.580 
can just pull it and it'll pull back
between<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:40.030> stitches

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.550 

I<00:05:53.730> have<00:05:54.730> threaded<00:05:54.940> my<00:05:55.120> needle<00:05:55.270> again<00:05:55.930> and<00:05:56.410> I'm

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
I have threaded my needle again and I'm

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.330 
I have threaded my needle again and I'm
going<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:56.830> weave<00:05:57.130> back<00:05:57.550> in<00:05:58.120> this<00:05:58.420> direction

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
going to weave back in this direction

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.080 
going to weave back in this direction
not<00:06:00.340> very<00:06:00.670> far<00:06:01.920> we<00:06:02.920> do<00:06:03.070> have<00:06:03.280> a<00:06:03.310> pretty<00:06:03.550> secure

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
not very far we do have a pretty secure

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.240 
not very far we do have a pretty secure
tail<00:06:04.450> right<00:06:04.690> now<00:06:04.960> and<00:06:05.350> then<00:06:05.800> just<00:06:06.010> pull<00:06:06.220> the
