it's<00:04:12.200> really<00:04:12.230> though<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:13.190> horsepower<00:04:13.579> is<00:04:13.700> not

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
it's really though the horsepower is not

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.729 
it's really though the horsepower is not
it<00:04:14.060> it's<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.720> torque<00:04:14.989> they<00:04:15.170> make<00:04:15.320> an<00:04:15.440> enormous

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
it it's the torque they make an enormous

it it's the torque they make an enormous
amount<00:04:15.859> of<00:04:15.980> torque<00:04:16.220> but<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:17.150> cool<00:04:17.359> thing<00:04:17.390> is

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
amount of torque but the cool thing is

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.449 
amount of torque but the cool thing is
that<00:04:18.019> some<00:04:18.500> of<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.650> components<00:04:19.160> inside<00:04:19.280> the
