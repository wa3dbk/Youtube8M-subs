what the world is going on if you're

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
what the world is going on if you're
less<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.870> probably<00:01:03.899> gain<00:01:04.350> about

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
less than that you probably gain about

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.149 
less than that you probably gain about
two<00:01:04.890> pounds<00:01:05.400> maybe<00:01:06.049> one<00:01:07.049> pound<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.010> you're

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
two pounds maybe one pound and if you're

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
two pounds maybe one pound and if you're
really<00:01:08.369> light<00:01:08.670> weight<00:01:08.850> maybe<00:01:09.180> around<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.439> pound

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
really light weight maybe around a pound
