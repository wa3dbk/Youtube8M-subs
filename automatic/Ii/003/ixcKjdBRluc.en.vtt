00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.260
 do not 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.359
 before the accusations of authorities of 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.490
 the municipal agency 'san miguel' tomorrow 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.680
 to pp where they blamed the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 local party deputy 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.880
 revolutionary institutional by the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.070
 district ixtlán de juárez adolfo garcía 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.750
 morals to be involved in the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.360
 invasion of about 15 hectares 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 by the municipal seat of 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.340
 san juan quiotepec the legislator 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 disengaged from such accusations 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.990
 ensuring that this is probably 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.870
 product of political adversaries without 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.659
 say names adolfo garcía pointed out that 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.249
 instead of harming or wanting to point out the 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:40.559
 solution must be given through the 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.019
 dialogue and not by people who are wrong 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.019
 advising the comuneros I think that 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.719
 Until now nobody can prove that I 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:50.609
 is involved in a personal way or 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.079
 direct way in this subject in this 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.809
 moment that occurs between we ask you 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.420
 nor our pact then what do I know which 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.249
 is the conclusion that there should be 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.010
 someone back who is telling you 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:05.190
 good attack this guy so that with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.380
 this maybe you could have calmed down 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.540
 those of jiutepec but I'll repeat you again 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.189
 at 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.530
 for I have nothing to say I 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.180
 here another permanent but about it and 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.380
 if you realize that is why 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.170
 even made a some statement 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.430
 to speak against manialtepec 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.590
 because I have nothing against them 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 I do not think they can prove 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.409
 that I am against them 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.810
 not to say of the legislator this is a 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.720
 agrarian conflict with more than 15 years of 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.270
 antiquity and not social or political like 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.689
 they have wanted to indicate the tables agredes 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.539
 I wanted to help, I wanted to search 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 an alternative is a subject if you want 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.259
 as by a human sense or by a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 moral commitment with all citizens 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.159
 in general so much so that another 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.159
 pe as for marin to this effect and I 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.720
 right now I can not even 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.520
 get ahead to tell you hey is that I 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.979
 hit is wrong or maninat you hit are 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.399
 that's why I was telling you a long time ago 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.830
 that the most important thing is that we look 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.630
 how can you solve it better nobody 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.000
 can say is that I win losing myself 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.890
 the important thing is that it is solved with 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.319
