00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.920
 Super easy 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:15.200
 It is the second round of how music can be read in 5 minutes 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:18.680
 Today, I want to describe your symbol a room in the continuation of the previous tower symbol 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.020
 Those who are thought to be difficult to read 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:28.280
 That's a total mistake 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:29.030
 Go chanting again the magic spell of Nomo nurses stood that had you remember at the time of the tone-symbols 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.320
 Only 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.320
 It will be easy to read, so let's work together 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:43.550
 Then please look at the music score right away 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.550
 Now under two from the line will be the soil 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.130
 And the same 3 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.960
 Rose in the element 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:01:02.540
 If it is said, you should go up the same meat again 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:07.600
 So this I'd a place of Aldo contains the short stick on the this. Tone previously performed 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.600
 The low degree of the symbol will be the same height 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 The fact that exactly the same sound and well every time low Takaido and tone-symbols of a single氣号 represents the keyboard entered 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.650
 Will be 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:29.810
 At Maeda Ai on the piano keyboard the sound goes high when you go right 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.810
 I try reflected a little towards the Piana 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.250
 Let's go well into in this 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.600
 Click here for the two eyes of the line is if 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.009
 How m 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.250
 I understand right away How about this from the second run next 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.990
 It is the right stop 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.080
 How is the next time ? 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.120
 I'm miserable and it's fara 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.330
 At last 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.960
 I'm hiding a bit, but how about this side 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.940
 road 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 It will be called Meeher Layer 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.240
 Next is the note during this time 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:23.710
 Let 's do of this kind of Isle po yon 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:26.740
 Yes when you do po cease between the following looks for first the name of the line immediately below this note 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:32.390
 Transported to the road 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:36.459
 How about in March seems the way to take from the city of Ueda Netsugi 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.580
 Because it is miso on that 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.680
 It is Doremifa premature ejaculation 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.319
 Next 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:49.630
 Because it is on the same 3 磯 stock 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:54.490
 I'm Doremifa So next 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:03:01.570
 And copper three-layer because it on the teeth 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:05.670
 Doremi file Sorashido in the wind that say it is if Te is referred to as complete notes between the line and the line of Kannon Pu child 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:10.850
 Please count it as well 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.210
 That will mix the feeling of randomness next randomly 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.990
 Well then please follow the house Road 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.530
 Third place so 4 items so great 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:26.270
 It's a way like Doremifa 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:31.640
 We will be following the same 3 KuraiSoshi 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:38.709
 But if you start from here, it's right next door , so please read on that part 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:41.550
 It is easier if you think so and it is good to think about places that fly like this 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.200
 Miso c 0 fatif 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.980
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:51.950
 In it can either by in Haa 3 because here also is a short 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:59.390
 You may call it from the bottom with the same 3 elements 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:04:02.190
 In here I bet it only if 0 seen over think from now on because it is just above the right next example of another example 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:08.280
 When I jump a lot like this 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.820
 You may count from the bottom, and if you are sticking it right away , the sound before this one will soon come 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.750
 From 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.580
 Also to get read in conjunction with 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.350
 I think it is a good way 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.590
 Then next 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:30.090
 It is the third time, but even if you can read only the third time, you can not read the department 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:31.480
 The length of the sound is added to this and it is called rhythm, but it is possible to read the department only if it is understood 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.860
 It will be 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:40.469
 The third time 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:40.469
 I would like to work together on the basis of the rhythm
