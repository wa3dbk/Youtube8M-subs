BTU burner can be at its lowest setting
the<00:00:13.719> way<00:00:13.809> I'm<00:00:13.870> going<00:00:14.019> to<00:00:14.049> do<00:00:14.200> this<00:00:14.379> is<00:00:14.650> I<00:00:14.709> have

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
the way I'm going to do this is I have

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.840 
the way I'm going to do this is I have
cut<00:00:15.610> out<00:00:15.789> some<00:00:16.330> circles<00:00:16.869> of<00:00:17.740> paper<00:00:17.950> there<00:00:18.730> are

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
cut out some circles of paper there are

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.210 
cut out some circles of paper there are
five<00:00:19.060> and<00:00:19.090> a<00:00:19.269> half<00:00:19.300> inches<00:00:19.869> in<00:00:20.170> diameter<00:00:20.710> and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
five and a half inches in diameter and

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.189 
five and a half inches in diameter and
I'm<00:00:22.090> going<00:00:22.240> to<00:00:22.359> show<00:00:22.630> you<00:00:22.689> the<00:00:22.840> comparison

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
I'm going to show you the comparison

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.740 
I'm going to show you the comparison
between<00:00:23.769> the<00:00:24.400> culinarian<00:00:24.910> on<00:00:25.300> its<00:00:25.570> lowest

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
between the culinarian on its lowest

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.349 
between the culinarian on its lowest
setting<00:00:26.019> the<00:00:26.980> wolf<00:00:27.429> on<00:00:27.609> its<00:00:27.759> lowest<00:00:27.880> setting

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
setting the wolf on its lowest setting

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
setting the wolf on its lowest setting
and<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.869> deck<00:00:29.050> on<00:00:29.289> its<00:00:29.560> lowest<00:00:29.800> setting

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
and the deck on its lowest setting

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.159 
and the deck on its lowest setting
you're<00:00:31.119> really<00:00:31.300> going<00:00:31.419> to<00:00:31.509> get<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:31.660> good<00:00:31.900> feel

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
you're really going to get a good feel

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.910 
you're really going to get a good feel
again<00:00:33.070> about<00:00:33.430> even<00:00:33.910> heat<00:00:34.060> distribution<00:00:34.920> with

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
again about even heat distribution with

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.069 
again about even heat distribution with
this<00:00:36.160> this<00:00:36.910> test<00:00:37.180> then<00:00:37.660> we<00:00:37.690> have<00:00:37.870> the

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:38.079 
this this test then we have the

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.709 
this this test then we have the
culinarian<00:00:38.860> on<00:00:39.039> its<00:00:39.219> lowest<00:00:39.610> setting<00:00:39.760> so

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
culinarian on its lowest setting so

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.540 
culinarian on its lowest setting so
we're<00:00:40.809> going<00:00:40.899> to<00:00:40.989> put<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.199> paper<00:00:41.410> on<00:00:41.559> press

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
we're going to put the paper on press

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.439 
we're going to put the paper on press
Start<00:00:42.579> and<00:00:43.860> see<00:00:44.860> what<00:00:45.010> happens<00:00:45.370> over<00:00:45.969> a<00:00:46.239> period

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
Start and see what happens over a period

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.810 
Start and see what happens over a period
of<00:00:46.570> time<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.770> we're<00:00:47.920> gonna<00:00:48.010> run<00:00:48.250> these<00:00:48.370> tests

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
of time and we're gonna run these tests

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.779 
of time and we're gonna run these tests
for<00:00:49.059> 20<00:00:49.690> minutes<00:00:49.960> if<00:00:50.890> it's<00:00:51.640> possible<00:00:51.789> to<00:00:52.030> do<00:00:52.210> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
for 20 minutes if it's possible to do so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.279 
for 20 minutes if it's possible to do so
so<00:00:54.789> we're<00:00:55.030> currently<00:00:55.390> going<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.019> be<00:00:56.109> hitting

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
so we're currently going to be hitting

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.110 
so we're currently going to be hitting
in<00:00:56.440> 15<00:00:56.769> seconds<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.600> pretty<00:00:58.600> much<00:00:58.780> no<00:00:58.989> change

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
in 15 seconds and pretty much no change

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.790 
in 15 seconds and pretty much no change
I'll<00:01:01.120> come<00:01:01.329> back<00:01:01.449> periodically<00:01:02.140> and<00:01:02.350> just

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
I'll come back periodically and just

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.770 
I'll come back periodically and just
show<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.160> differences<00:01:03.579> here<00:01:03.820> we<00:01:04.690> are

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
show you the differences here we are

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.930 
show you the differences here we are
approaching<00:01:05.050> 5<00:01:05.379> minutes<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.310> as<00:01:06.670> you<00:01:06.760> can<00:01:06.880> see

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
approaching 5 minutes and as you can see

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.410 
approaching 5 minutes and as you can see
very<00:01:07.390> little<00:01:08.140> that's<00:01:08.409> happened<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:08.950> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
very little that's happened to the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.499 
very little that's happened to the
cullinary<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.600> paper

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
cullinary and paper

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.910 
cullinary and paper
it's<00:01:13.509> like<00:01:13.720> tarnishing<00:01:14.320> pretty<00:01:14.560> much<00:01:14.710> all<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
it's like tarnishing pretty much all the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.940 
it's like tarnishing pretty much all the
way<00:01:15.009> around<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:16.470> we'll<00:01:17.470> leave<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:17.770> in<00:01:17.830> another

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
way around so we'll leave it in another

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.569 
way around so we'll leave it in another
5<00:01:18.310> minutes<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.850> come<00:01:19.240> back<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:21.189> I'll

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
5 minutes and come back to it so I'll

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.940 
5 minutes and come back to it so I'll
slide<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.820> little<00:01:22.000> bit<00:01:22.150> but<00:01:22.420> here<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.840> are<00:01:22.869> at<00:01:23.470> 30

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
slide a little bit but here we are at 30

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.840 
slide a little bit but here we are at 30
minutes<00:01:24.369> 15<00:01:24.670> seconds<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:26.340> no<00:01:27.340> real<00:01:27.520> change

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
minutes 15 seconds and no real change

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.260 
minutes 15 seconds and no real change
still<00:01:28.810> sitting<00:01:29.680> pretty<00:01:29.829> good<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.280> few<00:01:31.030> little

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
still sitting pretty good a few little

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.440 
still sitting pretty good a few little
burnt<00:01:31.479> pieces<00:01:31.930> about<00:01:32.680> pretty<00:01:33.130> much<00:01:33.390> okay<00:01:34.390> so

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
burnt pieces about pretty much okay so

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.660 
burnt pieces about pretty much okay so
here<00:01:34.780> we<00:01:34.899> are<00:01:35.049> approaching<00:01:35.500> 20<00:01:36.040> minutes<00:01:36.310> and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
here we are approaching 20 minutes and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.200 
here we are approaching 20 minutes and
as<00:01:36.939> you<00:01:37.030> can<00:01:37.210> see<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.790> pretty<00:01:39.790> good<00:01:39.939> piece<00:01:40.090> of

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
as you can see a pretty good piece of

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.069 
as you can see a pretty good piece of
paper<00:01:40.390> 20<00:01:40.840> minutes<00:01:41.140> on<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.350> 23,000<00:01:42.340> BTU<00:01:42.670> burner

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
paper 20 minutes on a 23,000 BTU burner

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.569 
paper 20 minutes on a 23,000 BTU burner
so<00:01:44.079> let's<00:01:44.259> go<00:01:44.350> do<00:01:44.500> some<00:01:44.649> comparison<00:01:45.189> with<00:01:45.369> the

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
so let's go do some comparison with the

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.690 
so let's go do some comparison with the
wolf<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.329> deck<00:01:46.509> are<00:01:46.689> now<00:01:47.219> ok<00:01:48.219> so<00:01:48.280> here<00:01:48.579> we

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
wolf and the deck are now ok so here we

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.999 
wolf and the deck are now ok so here we
have<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:48.969> wolf<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:51.040> gas<00:01:51.670> range<00:01:51.969> 36-inch

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
have the wolf or gas range 36-inch

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.490 
have the wolf or gas range 36-inch
the<00:01:54.009> wolf<00:01:54.189> actually<00:01:54.369> has<00:01:55.140> several<00:01:56.140> settings

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
the wolf actually has several settings

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.310 
the wolf actually has several settings
that<00:01:56.950> mean<00:01:57.130> high<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:59.530> mean<00:01:59.710> medium<00:02:01.320> have

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
that mean high that mean medium have

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.929 
that mean high that mean medium have
been<00:02:02.469> low<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:05.409> have<00:02:05.619> a<00:02:05.649> simmer

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
been low and they have a simmer

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.419 
been low and they have a simmer
I'll<00:02:07.270> put<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:07.479> phone<00:02:07.719> back<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:09.160> we'll<00:02:09.280> just

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
I'll put the phone back and we'll just

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:19.740 
I'll put the phone back and we'll just
see<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:11.020> wolf<00:02:11.230> simmers<00:02:13.110> turn<00:02:14.110> it<00:02:14.230> down<00:02:18.750> as

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
see how the wolf simmers turn it down as

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.190 
see how the wolf simmers turn it down as
you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> rapid<00:02:22.080> burning<00:02:23.080> at

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
you can see that is a rapid burning at

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.300 
you can see that is a rapid burning at
this<00:02:23.319> pet<00:02:23.560> but<00:02:23.709> I<00:02:23.739> don't<00:02:23.890> know<00:02:23.950> if<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.069> can<00:02:24.160> see

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
this pet but I don't know if you can see

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.759 
this pet but I don't know if you can see
but<00:02:24.550> smoke<00:02:24.970> coming<00:02:25.269> off<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:26.200> black<00:02:26.500> pieces

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
but smoke coming off it the black pieces

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.970 
but smoke coming off it the black pieces
increasing<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.819> size<00:02:27.970> dramatically<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.980> we

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
increasing in size dramatically and we

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.210 
increasing in size dramatically and we
were<00:02:30.040> only<00:02:30.130> at<00:02:30.340> 17<00:02:31.150> seconds<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> wolf

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
were only at 17 seconds so the wolf

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.970 
were only at 17 seconds so the wolf
without<00:02:33.489> question<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.300> huge<00:02:35.050> hot<00:02:35.349> spot<00:02:35.380> to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
without question as a huge hot spot to

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.280 
without question as a huge hot spot to
the<00:02:36.069> best<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.459> pan<00:02:36.670> this<00:02:37.569> was<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.840> five<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
the best of a pan this was a five and a

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.740 
the best of a pan this was a five and a
half<00:02:38.319> inch<00:02:38.620> pan<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:40.090> only<00:02:40.239> bit<00:02:40.450> getting

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
half inch pan then the only bit getting

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.600 
half inch pan then the only bit getting
hot<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.319> really<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.769> center<00:02:42.160> piece<00:02:42.340> and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
hot is that really that center piece and

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.809 
hot is that really that center piece and
he's<00:02:43.510> getting<00:02:43.690> way<00:02:43.989> too<00:02:44.049> hot<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.400> yeah<00:02:45.640> I<00:02:45.670> think

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
he's getting way too hot so yeah I think

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.440 
he's getting way too hot so yeah I think
we<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.209> say<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.780> wolf<00:02:47.319> simmer<00:02:47.650> is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
we can say that the wolf simmer is

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.479 
we can say that the wolf simmer is
knowing<00:02:49.450> near<00:02:49.720> as<00:02:49.930> effective<00:02:50.440> as<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
knowing near as effective as the

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.839 
knowing near as effective as the
culinarian<00:02:52.480> simmer<00:02:52.959> or<00:02:53.470> two<00:02:54.459> completely

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
culinarian simmer or two completely

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.509 
culinarian simmer or two completely
different<00:02:55.060> things

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
different things

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.160 
different things
no<00:02:57.519> even<00:02:58.000> heat<00:02:58.150> distribution<00:02:58.299> on<00:02:58.989> this

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
no even heat distribution on this

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.410 
no even heat distribution on this
whatsoever<00:02:59.440> he<00:03:00.190> come<00:03:00.519> in<00:03:00.640> directly<00:03:01.060> upwards

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
whatsoever he come in directly upwards

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.509 
whatsoever he come in directly upwards
from<00:03:01.630> their<00:03:01.810> similar<00:03:02.170> burner<00:03:02.380> scorch<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
from their similar burner scorch that

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.110 
from their similar burner scorch that
paper<00:03:03.760> within<00:03:04.150> 15<00:03:04.480> seconds<00:03:05.730> here<00:03:06.730> we<00:03:06.849> are<00:03:06.880> at

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
paper within 15 seconds here we are at

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.340 
paper within 15 seconds here we are at
six<00:03:07.450> minutes<00:03:07.739> seven<00:03:08.739> seconds<00:03:10.019> and<00:03:11.019> as<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.230> can

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
six minutes seven seconds and as you can

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.039 
six minutes seven seconds and as you can
see<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.709> paper<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:12.069> burnt<00:03:12.430> through

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
see the paper is burnt through

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.710 
see the paper is burnt through
smoldering<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:15.519> guess<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.359> some<00:03:16.480> stares

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
smoldering and I guess it some stares

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.090 
smoldering and I guess it some stares
that<00:03:16.900> people<00:03:17.260> just<00:03:17.470> disappear

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
that people just disappear

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.479 
that people just disappear
or<00:03:18.430> burst<00:03:18.970> into<00:03:19.120> flames<00:03:20.130> let's<00:03:21.130> just<00:03:21.280> reflect

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
or burst into flames let's just reflect

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.910 
or burst into flames let's just reflect
back<00:03:21.760> for<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> second<00:03:22.389> the<00:03:22.510> capital<00:03:22.989> culinarian

back for a second the capital culinarian

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.340 
back for a second the capital culinarian
was<00:03:24.489> 20<00:03:24.970> minutes<00:03:25.329> and<00:03:25.630> there<00:03:26.049> was<00:03:26.139> nowhere

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
was 20 minutes and there was nowhere

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.729 
was 20 minutes and there was nowhere
near<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:27.630> somewhat<00:03:28.630> for<00:03:28.810> wolves<00:03:29.079> wonderful

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
near that somewhat for wolves wonderful

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:36.259 
near that somewhat for wolves wonderful
simmer<00:03:33.090> burnt<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.150> hole<00:03:34.180> clean<00:03:34.540> through<00:03:34.630> it

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
simmer burnt a hole clean through it

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.460 
simmer burnt a hole clean through it
okay<00:03:37.269> this<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.600> dickhole<00:03:37.989> so<00:03:38.290> we're<00:03:38.380> going

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
okay this is a dickhole so we're going

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.080 
okay this is a dickhole so we're going
to<00:03:38.530> do<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.739> same<00:03:38.920> on<00:03:39.069> this<00:03:39.220> one<00:03:39.280> turn<00:03:39.850> down<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
to do the same on this one turn down to

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.210 
to do the same on this one turn down to
full<00:03:40.359> turn<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:40.989> down<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.590> then<00:03:41.769> put<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.040> paper

full turn it down and then put the paper
on

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.020 

so<00:03:47.920> that's<00:03:48.099> not<00:03:48.220> this<00:03:48.310> lowest<00:03:48.700> setting<00:03:51.030> start

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
so that's not this lowest setting start

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.360 
so that's not this lowest setting start
the<00:03:52.120> timer<00:03:52.329> and<00:03:55.920> we'll<00:03:56.920> just<00:03:57.099> see<00:03:57.189> what<00:03:57.310> this

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
the timer and we'll just see what this

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.890 
the timer and we'll just see what this
goes<00:03:57.579> like

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.580 

I'll<00:04:04.500> lift<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.860> got<00:04:05.040> past<00:04:05.280> the<00:04:05.489> 15<00:04:06.150> seconds<00:04:06.629> but

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
I'll lift it got past the 15 seconds but

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.930 
I'll lift it got past the 15 seconds but
you<00:04:07.709> can<00:04:07.830> see<00:04:08.010> they're<00:04:08.250> starting<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.760> change

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
you can see they're starting to change

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.800 
you can see they're starting to change
color<00:04:09.060> pretty<00:04:09.569> rapidly<00:04:10.019> on<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:11.810> right-hand

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
color pretty rapidly on the right-hand

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.979 
color pretty rapidly on the right-hand
side<00:04:16.549> okay<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:17.579> you<00:04:17.910> can<00:04:18.090> see<00:04:18.269> here<00:04:18.600> we've<00:04:18.959> got

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
side okay so you can see here we've got

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.219 
side okay so you can see here we've got
a<00:04:19.199> definite<00:04:19.709> hot<00:04:19.919> spot<00:04:20.220> or<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.940> hot<00:04:21.239> half<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.989> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
a definite hot spot or a hot half of the

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.150 
a definite hot spot or a hot half of the
burner<00:04:22.470> not<00:04:23.430> sure<00:04:23.610> what<00:04:23.790> that<00:04:23.820> would<00:04:24.210> be<00:04:24.449> but

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
burner not sure what that would be but

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.800 
burner not sure what that would be but
clearly<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.400> right<00:04:26.970> hand<00:04:27.180> side<00:04:27.360> is<00:04:27.600> hotter

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
clearly the right hand side is hotter

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.650 
clearly the right hand side is hotter
than<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.290> left-hand<00:04:28.680> side<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:30.150> we're<00:04:30.419> coming

around the right-hand side

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.939 
around the right-hand side
the<00:04:44.940> left-hand<00:04:45.300> side<00:04:45.360> is<00:04:45.539> now<00:04:45.930> just<00:04:46.560> starting

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.100 
the left-hand side is now just starting
to<00:04:47.010> creep<00:04:47.160> around<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.550> bit<00:04:47.699> all<00:04:48.600> there<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.960> I'll

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
to creep around a bit all there is I'll

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.320 
to creep around a bit all there is I'll
just<00:04:49.350> let<00:04:49.530> this<00:04:49.620> run<00:04:49.860> till<00:04:50.130> 20<00:04:50.820> minutes<00:04:51.090> and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
just let this run till 20 minutes and

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.810 
just let this run till 20 minutes and
then<00:04:51.840> we<00:04:51.930> can<00:04:52.110> do<00:04:52.260> what<00:04:53.220> is<00:04:53.340> really<00:04:53.610> going<00:04:53.699> to

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
then we can do what is really going to

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.820 
then we can do what is really going to
be<00:04:53.880> a<00:04:53.910> fair<00:04:54.150> comparison<00:04:54.479> 20<00:04:55.320> minutes<00:04:55.590> on<00:04:55.680> each

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
be a fair comparison 20 minutes on each

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.740 
be a fair comparison 20 minutes on each
seems<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.550> be<00:04:56.639> fair<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.449> here<00:04:57.600> we<00:04:57.720> are

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
seems to be fair so here we are

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.189 
seems to be fair so here we are
approaching<00:04:59.030> 20<00:05:00.030> minutes<00:05:00.300> on<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.840> deck<00:05:00.990> or

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
approaching 20 minutes on the deck or

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.260

and<00:05:02.150> as<00:05:03.150> you<00:05:03.270> can<00:05:03.360> see<00:05:03.419> a<00:05:04.039> lot<00:05:05.039> of<00:05:05.160> heat<00:05:05.490> went<00:05:06.150> to

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
and as you can see a lot of heat went to

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.540 
and as you can see a lot of heat went to
the<00:05:06.419> right<00:05:06.870> hand<00:05:07.050> side<00:05:07.229> and<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.130> little<00:05:08.400> bit

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
went to the left hand side okay so here

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.620 
went to the left hand side okay so here
we<00:05:16.320> go<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.740> end<00:05:16.830> of<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.220> end<00:05:18.120> of<00:05:18.360> this<00:05:18.450> video
