00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:30.980 
you can basically go ahead and create

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.040 
you can basically go ahead and create
your<00:07:31.160> new<00:07:31.310> world<00:07:31.550> and<00:07:31.790> play<00:07:32.000> pixel<00:07:32.390> on<00:07:32.510> and

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
your new world and play pixel on and

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.920 
your new world and play pixel on and
that<00:07:33.620> is<00:07:33.770> basically<00:07:33.980> how<00:07:34.580> you<00:07:34.610> do<00:07:35.000> it<00:07:35.150> that's

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:35.930 
that is basically how you do it that's

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.840 
that is basically how you do it that's
how<00:07:36.080> you<00:07:36.140> install<00:07:36.620> the<00:07:36.830> pixelmon<00:07:37.250> mod<00:07:38.680> and

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:39.850 
how you install the pixelmon mod and

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:45.780 
how you install the pixelmon mod and
yeah<00:07:40.850> so<00:07:41.390> I<00:07:41.840> guess<00:07:42.320> that's<00:07:42.470> it<00:07:42.740> but<00:07:44.169> you<00:07:45.169> know

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:45.790
