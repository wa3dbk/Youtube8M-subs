Peugeot 206 as you turn the ignition on

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.089 
Peugeot 206 as you turn the ignition on
you'll<00:00:12.809> see<00:00:12.870> information<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.740> mileage

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you'll see information on the mileage

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.400 
you'll see information on the mileage
and<00:00:15.080> on<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> current<00:00:16.590> electronic<00:00:17.160> oil<00:00:17.609> level

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
and on the current electronic oil level

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
and on the current electronic oil level
in<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.619> car<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.160> showing<00:00:20.460> 50%<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:23.810> low<00:00:24.810> oil

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
in this car it's showing 50% a low oil

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.439 
in this car it's showing 50% a low oil
level<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.830> damage<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.250> car<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> it's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
level can really damage a car so it's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.589 
level can really damage a car so it's
definitely<00:00:27.750> time<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> top<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.470> one<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:29.539> so<00:00:30.539> we

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
definitely time to top this one up so we

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
definitely time to top this one up so we
start<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.170> opening<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.650> bonnet<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.520> we<00:00:32.610> can

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
start by opening the bonnet so we can

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.150 
start by opening the bonnet so we can
get<00:00:32.850> access<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.510> engine<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.110> put<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.040> oil

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
get access to the engine to put the oil

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.410 
get access to the engine to put the oil
in<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.790> also<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> check<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.840> oil<00:00:36.870> level

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.389 

opening<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.510> bonnet<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> 206<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.250> can

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
opening the bonnet on the 206 you can

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
opening the bonnet on the 206 you can
see<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> engine<00:00:48.030> oil<00:00:48.300> directly<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.870> front<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
see the engine oil directly in front of

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.299 
see the engine oil directly in front of
you<00:00:50.809> it's<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.170> clear<00:00:52.410> image<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you it's not a very clear image but you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
you it's not a very clear image but you
can<00:00:53.430> obviously<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.879> from<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.090> dipstick<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
can obviously see from the dipstick the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.900 
can obviously see from the dipstick the
oil<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.140> lower<00:00:55.350> than<00:00:55.590> 50%<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.760> more

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
oil is lower than 50% it's more

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.490 
oil is lower than 50% it's more
accurately<00:00:57.420> measured<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.899> dipstick<00:00:58.199> than

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
accurately measured on the dipstick than

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.509 
accurately measured on the dipstick than
it<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.120> dashboard<00:01:00.270> itself<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:05.460> is

it is on the dashboard itself this is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.590 
it is on the dashboard itself this is
the<00:01:05.640> oil<00:01:05.850> I've<00:01:06.060> used<00:01:06.619> standard<00:01:07.619> 1040<00:01:08.189> oil<00:01:11.600> just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
given hello this oil level was I've got

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.570 
given hello this oil level was I've got
about<00:01:31.720> 50%<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.380> the<00:01:32.500> jar<00:01:32.680> full<00:01:32.950> what<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.490> be

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
about 50% of the jar full what to be

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.190 
about 50% of the jar full what to be
really<00:01:33.820> careful<00:01:34.000> not<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.450> overfill<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.020> oil

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
really careful not to overfill the oil

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.609 
really careful not to overfill the oil
at<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.250> engine<00:01:36.580> with<00:01:37.180> oil<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:38.320> can<00:01:38.470> really

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
at the engine with oil it can really

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.450 
at the engine with oil it can really
damage<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:39.190> engine<00:01:41.040> exactly<00:01:42.040> the<00:01:42.130> same<00:01:42.310> way

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
damage the engine exactly the same way

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.499 
damage the engine exactly the same way
as<00:01:42.520> being<00:01:42.759> too<00:01:42.939> low<00:01:43.119> can<00:01:44.940> just<00:01:45.940> open<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.330> cap

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
as being too low can just open the cap

00:01:46.509 --> 00:02:09.810 
as being too low can just open the cap
and<00:01:47.009> literally<00:01:48.009> pour<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> oil<00:01:48.369> straight<00:01:48.789> in

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.920 

we're<00:02:10.820> obviously<00:02:10.880> gonna<00:02:11.180> need<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.540> read<00:02:11.720> check

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
we're obviously gonna need to read check

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.080 
we're obviously gonna need to read check
the<00:02:12.140> oil<00:02:12.170> level<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:13.490> make<00:02:13.610> sure<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.880> get<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
the oil level to make sure we get the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.030 
the oil level to make sure we get the
right<00:02:14.240> amount<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.630> oil<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.990> it's<00:02:15.650> important

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
right amount of oil in it's important

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.730 
right amount of oil in it's important
not<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.460> dirt<00:02:16.670> into<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.060> oil<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.590> just

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
not to get dirt into the oil so I'm just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:27.120 
not to get dirt into the oil so I'm just
going<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.920> put<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.160> cap<00:02:19.310> straight<00:02:19.610> back<00:02:19.790> on

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.350 

takes<00:02:28.130> quite<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.520> while<00:02:28.820> for<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.150> oil<00:02:29.270> to

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
takes quite a while for the oil to

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.570 
takes quite a while for the oil to
actually<00:02:29.870> head<00:02:30.380> down<00:02:30.590> through<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.950> engine<00:02:31.280> so

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
actually head down through the engine so

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.020 
actually head down through the engine so
as<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.330> can<00:02:32.420> see<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.810> not<00:02:32.959> really<00:02:33.230> showing

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
as you can see it's not really showing

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.150 
as you can see it's not really showing
much<00:02:35.030> oil<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.630> having<00:02:35.959> dropped<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.800> bottom

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
much oil is having dropped to the bottom

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.980 
much oil is having dropped to the bottom
of<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.370> dipstick<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.910> pick<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:41.750> need<00:02:41.900> to

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
of the dipstick to pick up we need to

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.949 
of the dipstick to pick up we need to
wait<00:02:42.140> about<00:02:42.260> two<00:02:42.650> minutes<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.600> oil<00:02:44.750> to

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
wait about two minutes for the oil to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.510 
wait about two minutes for the oil to
settle<00:02:45.320> correctly<00:02:45.800> in<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:45.950> engine<00:02:46.310> to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
settle correctly in the engine to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:54.420 
settle correctly in the engine to
measure<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.910> properly

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.350 

we<00:02:55.430> can<00:02:55.610> help<00:02:55.730> check<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.240> oil<00:02:56.420> level<00:02:56.660> again

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.370 

and<00:03:01.050> it's<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.440> about<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> third<00:03:01.920> full<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:04.260> we

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
and it's at about a third full so we

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.340 
and it's at about a third full so we
still<00:03:04.680> need<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:05.280> continue<00:03:05.670> topping<00:03:06.240> up<00:03:09.350> just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
still need to continue topping up just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.750 
still need to continue topping up just
going<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> check<00:03:10.710> it<00:03:10.890> electronically<00:03:11.460> now<00:03:11.700> to

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
going to check it electronically now to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.350 
going to check it electronically now to
also<00:03:12.210> prove<00:03:13.400> slight<00:03:14.400> difference<00:03:14.790> between<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
also prove slight difference between the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:28.730 
also prove slight difference between the
measures<00:03:16.050> here

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.640 

and<00:03:29.190> as<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.520> see<00:03:29.930> this<00:03:30.930> believes<00:03:31.260> it's<00:03:31.440> over

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
and as you see this believes it's over

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.210 
and as you see this believes it's over
half-full<00:03:32.100> now<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.500> I'm<00:03:37.590> basically<00:03:37.770> going<00:03:38.160> to

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
half-full now so I'm basically going to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.010 
half-full now so I'm basically going to
top<00:03:38.400> up<00:03:38.550> again<00:03:38.820> now<00:03:39.060> about<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.720> same<00:03:39.900> amount

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
top up again now about the same amount

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
top up again now about the same amount
of<00:03:40.260> oil<00:03:40.880> try<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.000> bring<00:03:42.710> the<00:03:43.710> dipstick

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
of oil try and bring the dipstick

00:03:44.040 --> 00:04:38.740 
of oil try and bring the dipstick
measurement<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.820> just<00:03:45.120> below<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:45.750> full<00:03:46.080> mark

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.779 

the<00:04:39.750> electronic<00:04:40.289> reading<00:04:40.620> now<00:04:40.800> shows<00:04:41.069> 100%

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
the electronic reading now shows 100%

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.540 
the electronic reading now shows 100%
full<00:04:42.590> which<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.710> exactly<00:04:44.069> where<00:04:44.220> we<00:04:44.250> want<00:04:44.460> to

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
full which is exactly where we want to

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.699 
full which is exactly where we want to
be
