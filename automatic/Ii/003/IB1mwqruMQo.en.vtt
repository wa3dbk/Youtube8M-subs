bandit
we<00:02:09.610> can<00:02:09.789> kind<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.060> see<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:11.440> housing<00:02:11.830> in

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
we can kind of see that the housing in

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.699 
we can kind of see that the housing in
there<00:02:12.159> is<00:02:12.340> actually<00:02:12.760> I<00:02:13.090> think<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.140> stops<00:02:14.440> like

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
there is actually I think it stops like

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.710 
there is actually I think it stops like
right<00:02:15.099> here<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:18.310> know<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.670> when<00:02:19.360> that's

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
right here so you know that when that's

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.460 
right here so you know that when that's
so<00:02:19.930> much<00:02:20.019> like<00:02:20.610> shot<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> guy<00:02:21.879> that<00:02:22.569> it<00:02:22.720> just

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
so much like shot a guy that it just

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.670 
so much like shot a guy that it just
tapped<00:02:23.680> out<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.069> there<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:25.599> back<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.200> did

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
tapped out right there on the back I did

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.920 
tapped out right there on the back I did
the<00:02:26.799> same<00:02:27.010> thing<00:02:28.379> before<00:02:29.379> I<00:02:30.010> used<00:02:30.930> Traxxas

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
the same thing before I used Traxxas

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.619 
the same thing before I used Traxxas
Slash<00:02:31.959> shocks<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.010> think<00:02:33.340> some<00:02:34.030> stock<00:02:34.269> some<00:02:34.480> old

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
Slash shocks I think some stock some old

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.240 
Slash shocks I think some stock some old
ones<00:02:34.750> ahead<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:37.390> only<00:02:38.079> gave<00:02:38.379> me<00:02:38.409> I<00:02:38.860> think

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
ones ahead but it only gave me I think

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.000 
ones ahead but it only gave me I think
like<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.940> think<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.510> can<00:02:40.690> go<00:02:40.810> like<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.620> far<00:02:41.860> down

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
like I think I can go like that far down

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.660 
like I think I can go like that far down
and<00:02:42.310> would<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.610> tap<00:02:42.849> out<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:44.190> what<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.220> did<00:02:45.459> is

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
and would just tap out so what I did is

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.559 
and would just tap out so what I did is
I<00:02:45.790> took<00:02:45.849> a<00:02:46.060> rod<00:02:46.840> out<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:47.230> them<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:48.390> all<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
I took a rod out of them and all the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.360 
I took a rod out of them and all the
plunger<00:02:49.930> crap<00:02:50.140> on<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.410> inside<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:51.010> these<00:02:51.280> are

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
plunger crap on the inside and these are

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.729 
plunger crap on the inside and these are
the<00:02:51.459> stock<00:02:51.900> bodies<00:02:52.900> for<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.230> shocks<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
the stock bodies for the shocks in the

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.360 
the stock bodies for the shocks in the
HPI<00:02:54.099> I<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.810> replaced<00:02:56.170> them<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:58.000> shaft<00:02:58.599> and

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
HPI I just replaced them that shaft and

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.190 
HPI I just replaced them that shaft and
you<00:03:00.370> know<00:03:00.459> basically<00:03:00.700> kept<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.450> top<00:03:01.750> here<00:03:01.989> so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
you know basically kept the top here so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.030 
you know basically kept the top here so
you<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.579> is<00:03:03.640> smaller<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.920> know

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
you know it is smaller but you know

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.180 
you know it is smaller but you know
basically<00:03:06.940> when<00:03:07.299> it<00:03:07.329> tapped<00:03:07.629> out<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.230> don't

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
basically when it tapped out I don't

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.069 
basically when it tapped out I don't
even<00:03:09.280> hit<00:03:09.879> the<00:03:10.030> ground<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.510> know<00:03:10.599> what's<00:03:10.810> I

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
even hit the ground you know what's I

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:17.420 
even hit the ground you know what's I
still<00:03:11.650> got<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:12.389> little<00:03:13.650> midget<00:03:14.650> nut<00:03:15.190> here<00:03:16.260> so

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
still got a little midget nut here so

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.720 
still got a little midget nut here so
you<00:03:18.430> know<00:03:18.750> there's<00:03:19.750> actually<00:03:19.870> pretty<00:03:20.260> easy<00:03:20.730> I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
you know there's actually pretty easy I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.620 
you know there's actually pretty easy I
did<00:03:22.630> use<00:03:22.810> bigger<00:03:23.049> spring<00:03:23.410> so<00:03:24.180> what<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.209> did<00:03:25.419> is<00:03:25.510> I

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
did use bigger spring so what I did is I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.199 
did use bigger spring so what I did is I
just<00:03:25.660> hooked<00:03:26.049> around<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.849> stock<00:03:27.849> spring

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
just hooked around the stock spring

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.440 
just hooked around the stock spring
holder<00:03:28.540> up<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.799> just<00:03:30.010> like<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:31.030> holding

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
holder up I just like so it the holding

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.330 
holder up I just like so it the holding
part<00:03:31.690> would<00:03:31.810> be<00:03:31.840> up<00:03:32.139> and<00:03:32.410> then<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.650> put<00:03:32.829> this<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
part would be up and then I put this the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.150 
part would be up and then I put this the
big<00:03:33.669> spring<00:03:33.970> right<00:03:34.419> up<00:03:34.540> underneath<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.530> it

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
big spring right up underneath it and it

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.059 
big spring right up underneath it and it
doesn't<00:03:36.730> slide<00:03:36.880> around<00:03:37.060> or<00:03:37.359> anything<00:03:38.069> since

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
doesn't slide around or anything since

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.069 
doesn't slide around or anything since
this<00:03:39.190> video<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.790> basically<00:03:40.000> from<00:03:40.359> my<00:03:40.419> phone<00:03:40.780> I

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079
