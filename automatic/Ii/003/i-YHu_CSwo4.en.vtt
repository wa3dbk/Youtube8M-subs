00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.809
 hello to all guys welcome to this one 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.490
 new Sunday episode where there is 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.289
 we'll talk a little about what's going on 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.250
 happening in these weeks of the world 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.930
 that mdb magic star of casina madonna e 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.330
 we want to talk about since obviously 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.369
 there was this problem of the 9 70 gods 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.950
 4 GB of memory not good lawyers I go 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.020
 times and 970 practically there was everything 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.000
 this fuss if you can say so in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.130
 it seems that the love he could 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.230
 play on reality demon cards 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.180
 what was effective and there was a 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.460
 a bit of a ruckus because we say that 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.440
 in short, he invites the Chinese close to some 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.960
 casino but I can't do but it's not true 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.790
 it is not true because oh my God it is true that 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
 however you would not do it however we have 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.950
 done when we had knight black with the 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.500
 970 we tried butterfield 4 and far 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.140
 cry 4 all ultra on three screens 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.030
 then allocating 4GB of memory then 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.530
 saturating all the moya and the problem 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.930
 he didn't ask too much because we 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.329
 we were 30 countries and I know for 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.549
 exteriors in a situation almost 4k 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.040
 so let's assume that a person 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.049
 normal with a full hd screen not 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.539
 then the fourth logic arrives in spring 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.189
 the problem does not arise is very wrong 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.020
 from bper not having said it before 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.670
 of the release that hid this one 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.439
 what if so then it was 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.939
 wrong from nvidia but does not consider 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.439
 even that is this big problem in 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.929
 how surely you invite them to solve the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.490
 problem like the real and serious cry that then 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.749
 I emitted are going out they will be already 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.670
 in short, come out because in short 

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.319
 and then they realized it and saw vi 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.999
 we also say that some shops are 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.829
 you already know which ones but anyway you can 

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:41.240
 asking for a refund reported that I don't know 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.159
 if you have it but some shops 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.749
 who make the refund the name 70 if 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.209
 let us remember that we point to this problem 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:52.909
 of 4 gb and on gtx and 9 79 80 no ce 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.579
 ha as it is and the version is there 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.709
 perfect version because the 970 is one 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.299
 weakened of the new 80 and behold 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.270
 why is this problem this milan 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.300
 and then I have to talk about md Thursday 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.240
 finally madonna guys fine 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.860
 did something he did know that 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.020
 in the second quarter of this year it is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.450
 write new video cards amd the series 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.110
 3 censis according to which they are 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.940
 four months 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.160
 in short, in a few months or so prix 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 will succeed in the new describe me of what 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.790
 know how to 63 percent for dr 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.710
 so much the 90 in something like that with 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 evening names of the strange and apparently 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.910
 is the pure power says that there is a bull 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.830
 beautiful of millions stream something 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.850
 such a mess and how much 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.430
 apparently they will exceed 9 79 80 because 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.070
 they use a special let's say memory 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.320
 call hbm that apparently according to 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.920
 they go nine times faster than 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.450
 gddr5 pdl memories from them is that they come 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.340
 sometimes it is such form considers that a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.930
 determine an attendant cheering someone 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.850
 because the commitment of the Bible is not in the DNA 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.710
 it is clear that if it says to in the video says 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.570
 that goes stronger on and that is partisans 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.160
 that should be poor because also up 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:01.480
 Internet already around is not benchmarks 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.250
 on these these infamous 393 80x that 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.310
 they actually go faster though yes 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 is based on the heads used not yes 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.550
 is the drivers used level of 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.860
 optimization as with social media is not 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.590
 knows nothing however it seems emery has 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.090
 did a good job but by way of head and 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.280
 then you have to see why center e 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.350
 blogger and in other words we say that the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.160
 Competition is good is the low prices 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.410
 happy people 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.510
 fan boys as well but we remain in 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.920
 waiting because we can't tell you anything else 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.020
 we only know that gen. will be released 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.790
 February March April and November in 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.420
 more or less likely facts then between 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.010
 two months 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.010
 oh well anyway nvidia is always better 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.320
 just perfect of the hangman another 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.170
 news of which one for the area and that is 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.310
 bio at all two tobin motherboards 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.310
 stark for those who don't know him 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.290
 fas cows from a company that was 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.209
 motherboards for oriental market 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.910
 in short, the Japanese Chinese throat if not 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.650
 mistake and that he repeated in these 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.810
 months believes we ask that you stay there 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.709
 these months that apparently would seem 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.720
 I'm 197 15 I don't know what you're sorry for 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.060
 fairly recently the king mida centers in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.340
 how much yes yes then precisely last 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.959
 last and nothing from the magic anyway 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.680
 see anyway to find an interior 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.719
 they are also many 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.509
 actually see you remember a little 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.100
 on the other hand a style with all the others 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:20.470
 then the card covers in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.630
 particular has only done so 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.100
 that in fact I like it a lot and if it is 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.460
 nice because it's a market anyway 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.419
 dominated by home and all these brands 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.840
