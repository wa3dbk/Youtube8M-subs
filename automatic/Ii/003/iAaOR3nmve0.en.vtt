the<00:02:13.319> image<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.800> set<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the image I set you

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.880 
the image I set you
to<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.210> if<00:02:15.330> somebody<00:02:15.720> sees<00:02:16.230> an<00:02:16.470> image<00:02:16.590> in

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
to that so if somebody sees an image in

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.710 
to that so if somebody sees an image in
this<00:02:17.100> slideshow<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.880> they<00:02:17.970> want<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> go<00:02:18.330> see

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
this slideshow and they want to go see

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720 
this slideshow and they want to go see
it<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.080> gallery<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> might<00:02:20.550> as<00:02:20.580> well

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
it in the gallery then I might as well

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.930 
it in the gallery then I might as well
just<00:02:21.120> let<00:02:21.420> them<00:02:21.600> click<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.140> go<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.380> it

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
just let them click and go to it

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.890 
just let them click and go to it
captions<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.060> say<00:02:24.240> no<00:02:24.420> because<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.660> don't<00:02:24.810> have

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
captions I say no because we don't have

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.590 
captions I say no because we don't have
any<00:02:25.050> captions<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.620> these<00:02:26.040> photos<00:02:26.280> show<00:02:26.670> the

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
any captions for these photos show the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.600 
any captions for these photos show the
thumbnails<00:02:28.080> no<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:29.010> makes<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.460> more

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
thumbnails no just makes it more

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970 
thumbnails no just makes it more

speed<00:02:32.970> I<00:02:33.270> select<00:02:33.720> speed<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.140> fast<00:02:35.330> because<00:02:36.330> I'd

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
speed I select speed is fast because I'd

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.260 
speed I select speed is fast because I'd
find<00:02:36.720> fast<00:02:36.990> isn't<00:02:37.350> all<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.440> fast<00:02:37.770> actually

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
find fast isn't all that fast actually

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.300 
find fast isn't all that fast actually
show<00:02:39.270> speed<00:02:39.690> no<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.350> don't<00:02:40.740> want<00:02:40.890> somebody<00:02:41.070> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
show speed no I don't want somebody to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.460 
show speed no I don't want somebody to
have<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.550> change<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.030> speed<00:02:42.300> page<00:02:43.110> style

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
have to change the speed page style

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.340 
have to change the speed page style
black<00:02:44.070> or<00:02:44.280> white<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.460> don't<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:45.090> matters<00:02:45.450> so

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
black or white I don't think matters so

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.610 
black or white I don't think matters so
I<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.560> leave<00:02:46.740> it<00:02:46.770> as<00:02:46.920> black<00:02:47.240> show<00:02:48.240> buttons<00:02:48.720> no

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
I just leave it as black show buttons no

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.920 
I just leave it as black show buttons no
I<00:02:49.890> don't<00:02:50.070> want<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.250> show<00:02:50.400> buttons<00:02:50.930> random

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
I don't want to show buttons random

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.080 
I don't want to show buttons random
start<00:02:52.230> yes<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.800> do<00:02:52.860> want<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> start<00:02:53.580> randomly

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
start yes I do want it to start randomly

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930 
start yes I do want it to start randomly
and<00:02:54.860> randomize<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.130> photos<00:02:56.490> as<00:02:56.670> they<00:02:56.820> go

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and randomize the photos as they go

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.430 
and randomize the photos as they go
through<00:02:57.180> yes<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.750> think<00:02:57.810> that's<00:02:57.990> a<00:02:58.170> good<00:02:58.290> idea

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
through yes I think that's a good idea

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.470 
through yes I think that's a good idea
as<00:02:58.680> well<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.070> splash<00:02:59.880> ooh<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> lot

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
as well a splash ooh a lot

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.620 
as well a splash ooh a lot
I<00:03:00.510> believe<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> splash<00:03:01.140> URL<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.760> can<00:03:02.910> tell

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
I believe the splash URL is you can tell

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.210 
I believe the splash URL is you can tell
the<00:03:03.870> slideshow<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.910> always<00:03:06.860> show<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> certain

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the slideshow to always show a certain

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.280 
the slideshow to always show a certain
photo<00:03:08.610> before<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.209> slideshow<00:03:09.420> starts<00:03:10.020> I've

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
photo before the slideshow starts I've

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.840 
photo before the slideshow starts I've
just<00:03:10.470> left<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.830> as<00:03:10.980> blank<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:11.520> can<00:03:11.610> play

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
just left that as blank but you can play

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.500 
just left that as blank but you can play
around<00:03:11.880> with<00:03:12.180> it

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
around with it

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.110 
around with it
splash<00:03:13.170> delay<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.800> crossfade<00:03:14.280> speed<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.760> think

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
splash delay and crossfade speed I think

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.300 
splash delay and crossfade speed I think
I'd<00:03:15.209> leave<00:03:15.390> is<00:03:15.570> default<00:03:15.990> which<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:16.200> 0<00:03:17.040> for

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
I'd leave is default which is 0 for

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.550 
I'd leave is default which is 0 for
splash<00:03:17.550> delay<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.150> 350<00:03:18.870> milliseconds<00:03:19.410> for

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
splash delay and 350 milliseconds for

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.830 
splash delay and 350 milliseconds for
crossfade<00:03:20.130> speed<00:03:20.489> again<00:03:21.360> all<00:03:21.540> these<00:03:21.720> are

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
crossfade speed again all these are

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.420 
crossfade speed again all these are
really<00:03:21.989> easy<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.410> play<00:03:22.530> around<00:03:22.739> with<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.190> this

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
really easy to play around with but this

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.670 
really easy to play around with but this
just<00:03:23.820> works<00:03:24.390> for<00:03:24.510> me<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.040> click<00:03:26.400> Save<00:03:26.670> and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
there we go there's our slideshow so now

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.460 
there we go there's our slideshow so now
when<00:03:30.810> I<00:03:30.840> go<00:03:30.900> into<00:03:31.019> visitor<00:03:31.530> view<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.930> pops<00:03:34.230> up

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
when I go into visitor view it pops up

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.220 
when I go into visitor view it pops up
