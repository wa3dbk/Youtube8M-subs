time to take full advantage of the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
controls the fact that it's going to be

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.710 
controls the fact that it's going to be
coming<00:05:00.600> out<00:05:00.780> way<00:05:01.740> after<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.940> other<00:05:03.120> versions

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
coming out way after the other versions

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.770 
coming out way after the other versions
meaning<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.440> lot<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.670> bugs<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.240> are<00:05:06.450> going

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
meaning a lot of the bugs that are going

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.670 
meaning a lot of the bugs that are going
to<00:05:06.870> be<00:05:06.990> inevitably<00:05:08.330> in<00:05:09.330> these<00:05:10.110> versions<00:05:10.350> when

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
to be inevitably in these versions when

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.550 
to be inevitably in these versions when
they<00:05:10.830> come<00:05:11.100> out<00:05:11.130> next<00:05:12.000> month<00:05:12.530> will<00:05:13.530> be

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
they come out next month will be

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.360 
they come out next month will be
probably<00:05:14.220> fixed<00:05:14.910> on<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.810> wii<00:05:15.930> u<00:05:16.080> version<00:05:16.370> they

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
probably fixed on the wii u version they

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.330 
probably fixed on the wii u version they
might<00:05:17.580> even<00:05:17.730> have<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.120> dlc<00:05:19.010> included<00:05:20.010> on<00:05:20.190> the

the wii u has the potential to be the

the wii u has the potential to be the
