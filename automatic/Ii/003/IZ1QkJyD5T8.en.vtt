because it's mod is in very early stages
it<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.990> gonna<00:01:52.259> sound<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.070> horse

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it is actually gonna sound like a horse

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
it is actually gonna sound like a horse
when<00:01:53.790> you're<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.659> standing<00:01:54.990> there<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.870 
it still kind of got the horse miss to
it<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.110> basically<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> hop<00:02:02.610> onto

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.459 
it but basically you can just hop onto
it<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.299> now<00:02:03.390> you're<00:02:03.509> riding<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> broom<00:02:04.140> and

because it because of the clothes I'm
wearing<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.049> kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.520> cutting<00:02:08.520> through<00:02:08.700> me

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
wearing it's kind of cutting through me
a<00:02:08.940> little<00:02:09.149> bit<00:02:09.300> but<00:02:09.539> nonetheless<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:10.830> still

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.339 
a little bit but nonetheless I'm still
riding<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.370> broom<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:12.629> basically<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.200> use

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349

it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.930 
it
you<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.220> kind<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.430> ride<00:02:14.610> your<00:02:14.819> horse

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
like that and then if you aim up you'll

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.990 
like that and then if you aim up you'll
start<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.130> upwards<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.850> always

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
start going upwards and you can always

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.780 
start going upwards and you can always
obviously<00:02:18.720> sprint<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.500> everything
