give<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.370> probably<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.850> a<00:02:11.880> five<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.570> wish<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.200> was

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
give it probably be a five I wish it was

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
give it probably be a five I wish it was
a<00:02:13.320> bit<00:02:13.530> more<00:02:13.709> realistic<00:02:14.990> taste<00:02:16.190> more<00:02:17.190> true<00:02:17.459> to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
a bit more realistic taste more true to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.600 
a bit more realistic taste more true to
a<00:02:17.820> guava<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:19.170> one's<00:02:19.380> more<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.920> candy<00:02:20.280> ish<00:02:20.400> I

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
a guava this one's more of a candy ish I

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.520 
a guava this one's more of a candy ish I
think<00:02:21.239> maybe<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:21.660> why<00:02:21.870> they<00:02:21.930> don't<00:02:22.140> really

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
think maybe that's why they don't really

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.790 
think maybe that's why they don't really
make<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:23.160> lot<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.459> guava<00:02:23.970> flavors<00:02:24.570> out<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:25.110> so

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
make a lot of guava flavors out there so

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.090 
make a lot of guava flavors out there so
I<00:02:26.270> need<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.360> really<00:02:27.720> stand<00:02:27.959> out<00:02:28.110> any<00:02:28.350> up<00:02:28.560> so

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
I need that really stand out any up so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.300 
I need that really stand out any up so
