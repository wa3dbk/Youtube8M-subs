00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.760
 let's imagine that this sponge is the 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.440
 substrate that retains water that the 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 solvent that can also expel it 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 now it is completely dry 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.260
 and in the case of the cfi locus 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.260
 I would put it like that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.940
 it tightens if it does not release but it's wet 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.469
 with it being wet enough and you 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.930
 we can then leave a few days 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.360
 totally dry that the plant that we 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.649
 Warns if you need water but good 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:52.149
 know photos each in your world and the 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.920
 Sometimes you can water more others less 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.370
 normally in the payments are put weapons 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.370
 with peat 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.280
 in summer with the venus fly trap I 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.280
 I would leave the substrate like this 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.930
 it is wet more than in the lotus but 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.080
 if you squeeze 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.560
 loose water but not much 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.350
 maybe in summer and spring he wants 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.900
 say that in summer in winter forgiveness 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 in winter in autumn especially in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.580
 winter that this information 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.530
 the best thing is that if you squeeze do not leave the 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.270
 water is humid 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 but it does not release good 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.369
 with the reasons I would have it really 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.369
 my spring well 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.270
 crying 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.240
 made reality 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:01.409
 in antonio and less 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.880
 Antonio always wet 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.380
 but not as much as in summer in 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.390
 spring although you're not going either 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.149
 nothing because it was the same as in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.879
 spring summer because they are more dishes 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.879
 resistant and in winter it would have 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.890
 humidity whenever you let go of the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.150
 tightening water but nothing more because the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.060
 plant is in hibernation and we should 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.930
 be careful with botrytis and others 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.569
 diseases like they know 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.410
 but hey that also give you console 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.420
 generation 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.940
 they can spend the whole year with something in 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.360
 the plate but good to prevent if 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.360
 It can 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.209
 with the rivals nothing like they are annual 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.209
 as always lots of water abound 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.910
 with Mexican movies is already another 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.430
 story is a little harder to 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.400
 explain 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:02.400
 and I would divide it in two stages 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.900
 or three but hey better in spring 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.780
 summer autumn winter in spring and 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.780
 summer the substrate would not leave it like this 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.100
 it is wet it is not appreciated well in the 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.760
 bed but it releases us from water squeeze is 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.760
 a kind of water 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.760
 and in winter and summer in winter and 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.160
 autumn would leave him completely dry with 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.310
 watering breaks and would water again 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.930
 leaving it like this should never exceed the 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.710
 water limit this is wet but 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.710
 not like that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.780
 because they are very susceptible to greece 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.210
 with the tempered films is already another 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.210
 history 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.290
 these we can usually know very well 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.030
 How spring-summer but never 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.310
 lack of water 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.270
 winter as it is at the macro level 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.790
 so try to keep it as the 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.890
 actions or a little bit always wet 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.890
 always wet but not to exceed 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.270
 Let's not be in a pond 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:27.670
 and then there are movies from North America 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.850
 that they grow to that of that reason and so 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.440
 should and should that we work with partners 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.110
 therefore if you can do the same what 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.930
 what happens that also looks at the py 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.480
 this is the spreadsheet one placed in looking 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.630
 the species by internet see where they grow 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.160
 and his habits the photos and it's seen that 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.860
 a donut grows in clear support areas 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.080
 accomplices endure quite long in 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:54.110
 spam substrate is like the best I have not 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.310
 seen that the movies go back 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.310
 and Americans
