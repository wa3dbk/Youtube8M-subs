00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 in order to bring up the panel settings 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.339
 tasks 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.069
 we need to right click 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.450
 mouse on the free area of ​​the taskbar and 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 call the context menu 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.420
 it is the taskbar to further select 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 the property option will open already known 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.289
 we need a menu 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.070
 more precisely the taskbar properties window and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.930
 start menu 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 we have already considered this tab 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.619
 which concerned the start menu 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.170
 now let's take a look at the taskbar 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.630
 The first option is to fix the taskbar 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.550
 you can just do the same 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 calling the context menu and select here 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.440
 option to fix or own, respectively 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.110
 release if the tick is worth the panel 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.110
 tasks fixed what gives you this option 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.610
 if the taskbar is fixed then you like 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.559
 would you not seize it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.260
 left mouse button you with her nothing 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.300
 do if the taskbar once 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.370
 attach it like this 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.780
 you can give it here and take it off too 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.539
 check and click ok 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.690
 then you can taskbar like this 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.270
 way to grab and bring to any 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.760
 parts of the screen for example you can leave it 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.520
 top or install it on the side 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.409
 or from the other side to return to the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 place you that way you can 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 change its location and then again 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 fix it further automatically 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.400
 hide taskbar 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 If you select this item, then I have 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.460
 the taskbar is hidden if the mouse cursor 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.430
 I hated her if I omit 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 mouse down then I appear 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.770
 its out on the taskbar 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.770
 tidying up disappears 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.290
 further use small icons 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.560
 now you see what the icons are here 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.970
 big enough for an hour I will apply 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.320
 the application of this parameter is small 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.020
 icons make icons 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.479
 much less I basically like 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.770
 big icons so i will leave them 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.530
 and further we have the taskbar 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.020
 By hand, yes, that is, I once fastened and pulled 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.239
 on different sides of the screen the same thing i 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.319
 I can set up here and display 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.819
 left to right and so on that is possible 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.260
 this case is set up without dragging 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.170
 taskbar itself 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.870
 next taskbar button here you 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.360
 can customize how the buttons on 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.130
 taskbar will display first 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.830
 my turn here was set up by 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.530
 The default option is to always group what 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.630
 This means as I showed you if you 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.750
 open a few conductors 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.910
 for example with the shift button yes and opening 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.489
 I have several conductors 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.430
 grouped if i choose now 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.019
 properties and choose not to group 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.859
 apply what you see I have all each 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.299
 Explorer opens in its like 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.049
 such a button is created that is not 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.190
 very convenient from my point of view and 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.720
 accordingly you can group and 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.590
 hide tags that is these here 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.019
 signatures or group in only 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.450
 if we have how to perform ask 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.549
 filled ie we have no space 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.290
 free and so they are grouped but 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.959
 in this case my label is displayed 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.640
 button itself that also takes up space 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.100
 this is I do not like so I 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.730
 I choose the default item that I 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.970
 seems most acceptable further here 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.260
 There are notifications area settings 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.569
 notification areas we will talk 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.450
 next lesson and see these here 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.160
 settings too in the next lesson a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.380
 now let's switch back here to this one 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.239
 vkladochku toolbar honestly 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.359
 say do not use these panels 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.910
 tools that are here well here 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.340
 Here are 4 panels that you 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.540
 can turn on the taskbar for example 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.540
 that's the way they look 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.480
 don't really know i don't use them 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.200
 I think they take too much 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.330
 places and by and large they are not needed 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.760
 in this way you can come here 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:09.550
 in general, enable all settings 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.410
 taskbar on on this i this lesson 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.690
 I finish in the next lesson we 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.490
 go to the last item panel 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.490
 tasks to the notification area
