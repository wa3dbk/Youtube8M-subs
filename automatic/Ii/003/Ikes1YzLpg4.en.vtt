00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and obviously we don't necessarily need

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
and obviously we don't necessarily need
to<00:00:55.649> be<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.920> last<00:00:56.160> place<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.850> if<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
to be in last place I don't know if the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.720 
to be in last place I don't know if the
target<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:58.219> because<00:00:59.219> I'm<00:00:59.309> pretty<00:00:59.430> close

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
target is first because I'm pretty close

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.399 
target is first because I'm pretty close
to<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> by<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> second<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.649> must<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:01.980> be

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
to it by a second that must just be

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.840 
to it by a second that must just be
place<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.799> don't<00:01:05.070> know<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.430> make<00:01:05.580> sure<00:01:05.700> you're

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
place I don't know just make sure you're

place I don't know just make sure you're
always<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.659> your<00:01:06.840> target<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.760> won't

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
