in<00:00:16.320> itself<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:17.550> its<00:00:17.580> component<00:00:18.359> parts<00:00:18.420> now

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
in itself into its component parts now

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
in itself into its component parts now
when<00:00:19.529> I<00:00:19.560> first<00:00:19.800> look<00:00:20.039> at<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.460> see<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> word

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
when I first look at this I see the word

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.519 
when I first look at this I see the word
beaten<00:00:22.580> that's<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:24.090> strong<00:00:24.449> clue<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.109> is

beaten that's a very strong clue that is

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.230 
beaten that's a very strong clue that is
going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:25.980> anagram<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.730> clue<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
going to be an anagram in this clue I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.380 
going to be an anagram in this clue I
see<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:29.010> World<00:00:29.369> Cup<00:00:29.730> team<00:00:31.790> has<00:00:32.790> 12<00:00:33.149> letters

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
see that World Cup team has 12 letters

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.020 
see that World Cup team has 12 letters
and<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.200> see<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.739> length<00:00:35.309> indication

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and we see from the length indication

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.810 
and we see from the length indication
that<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> answer<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.079> two<00:00:37.350> words<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.489> six

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that the answer is two words of six

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.560 
that the answer is two words of six
letters<00:00:39.090> each<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.850> think<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.329> that

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
letters each so now what I think is that

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.920 
letters each so now what I think is that
this<00:00:43.110> World<00:00:43.649> Cup<00:00:43.739> team<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.520> what<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.600> know<00:00:45.719> as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this World Cup team is what we know as

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
this World Cup team is what we know as
anagram<00:00:46.829> fodder<00:00:47.219> these<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> letters

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
anagram fodder these are the letters

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.500 
anagram fodder these are the letters
that<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.510> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:49.610> mixed<00:00:50.610> up<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:51.239> find

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
that are going to be mixed up to find

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.529 
that are going to be mixed up to find
the<00:00:51.899> answer<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> dressing<00:00:53.489> after<00:00:53.820> shower<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
the answer and dressing after shower is

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.130 
the answer and dressing after shower is
going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> be<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.190> definition<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.140> the

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
going to be the definition of the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.260 
going to be the definition of the
resulting<00:00:58.649> phrase<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.670> how<00:00:59.820> do<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:00.000> start

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
resulting phrase so how do I start

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
resulting phrase so how do I start
working<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.899> well<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.309> usually<00:01:02.520> do

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
working on that well what I usually do

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
working on that well what I usually do
is<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:04.320> letters<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> mix<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.670> a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
is take the letters and mix them up a

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.289 
is take the letters and mix them up a
little<00:01:05.909> bit<00:01:06.350> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:08.040> piece<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> paper<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:09.030> I've

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
little bit on the piece of paper so I've

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:19.130 
little bit on the piece of paper so I've
got<00:01:11.360> World<00:01:16.100> Cup

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.140

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
team and these are all of those letters

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.190 
team and these are all of those letters
and<00:01:24.150> I've<00:01:24.270> mixed<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.690> so<00:01:24.870> that<00:01:24.900> I'm<00:01:25.020> not

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
and I've mixed them up so that I'm not

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.810 
and I've mixed them up so that I'm not
looking<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.620> them<00:01:25.770> as<00:01:25.890> words<00:01:26.159> anymore<00:01:26.640> but

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.790 
looking at them as words anymore but
just<00:01:26.850> as<00:01:27.090> letters<00:01:27.510> on<00:01:27.630> their<00:01:27.780> own<00:01:27.930> now<00:01:28.560> one

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800

one other letter which were okay cou PL
E<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:09.890> M<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:13.170> see<00:02:13.320> here<00:02:13.530> there's<00:02:13.860> only<00:02:14.100> one

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
E and M and we see here there's only one

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.970 
E and M and we see here there's only one
vowel<00:02:14.700> four<00:02:15.120> six<00:02:15.600> letters<00:02:15.959> which<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.380> very

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
vowel four six letters which is very

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.009 
vowel four six letters which is very
unusual<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> word<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> think<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.870> word

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
unusual in the word so I think the word

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.410 
unusual in the word so I think the word
couple<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.620> not<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.190> be<00:02:20.310> right<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.180> let's

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
couple is not going to be right so let's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.670 
couple is not going to be right so let's
discard<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.920> look<00:02:26.610> for<00:02:26.760> another<00:02:27.680> six

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
discard that I look for another six

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.259 
discard that I look for another six
letter<00:02:28.860> word<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.310> eventually<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.910> came<00:02:30.090> up

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
letter word and eventually I came up

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.509 
letter word and eventually I came up
with<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.540> word<00:02:31.190> there's<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.280> P<00:02:32.519> o<00:02:32.730> w<00:02:33.269> de<00:02:33.660> R<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.280> we

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
with the word there's a P o w de R so we

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.199 
with the word there's a P o w de R so we
have<00:02:38.030> powder

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
have powder

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.120 
have powder
what<00:02:40.110> does<00:02:40.230> that<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:40.560> letters<00:02:40.860> does<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
what does that what letters does that

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:50.020 
what does that what letters does that
leave<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:42.480> leaves<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:44.000> see<00:02:45.000> an<00:02:45.840> L<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:47.180> T<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.799> you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
leave that leaves a see an L a T a you

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.900 
leave that leaves a see an L a T a you
and<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.970> an<00:02:53.970> M<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.900> what<00:02:55.640> can<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:56.790> with

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and a and an M now what can I do with

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.479 
and a and an M now what can I do with
those<00:02:57.060> letters<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.769> after<00:02:59.130> looking<00:02:59.250> at<00:02:59.400> it

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
those letters and after looking at it

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.600 
those letters and after looking at it
for<00:02:59.549> again<00:02:59.790> again<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> would<00:03:01.220> put<00:03:02.220> them<00:03:02.340> into<00:03:02.489> a

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
for again again I would put them into a

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.900 
for again again I would put them into a
jumble<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:05.720> it's<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.810> huh<00:03:06.989> what<00:03:07.260> do<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.910> we

jumble and it's a huh what do we have we

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.880 
jumble and it's a huh what do we have we
