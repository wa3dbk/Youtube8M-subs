00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 good for the workers party there is no need 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.109
 pay the vulture funds and you have to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.730
 repudiate the set of external debt 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.059
 because it has a usurious character because 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.660
 the debt is unpayable for Argentina 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.160
 external in general has operated as a 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.039
 strangulation factor of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.670
 economic development now not for the 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.369
 external debt is to break a pillar of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.099
 current economic system that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.260
 precisely works through the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.620
 confiscation of national savings 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 part of some industrial octopus 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 financial agrarian who then use 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.810
 that national gold to dump it into the country 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.320
 in the form of an external debt 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:50.650
 This explains why there outside 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.110
 according to some 250 thousand another 400 thousand 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.980
 millions of dollars 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:01.870
 this Argentine capitalists 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.989
 then if the break with this debt 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.970
 Usury area really involves a bankruptcy 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.729
 of the current regime that put another 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.729
 economic regime and in that other regime 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.680
 economic the state should have in its 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.320
 hands two fundamental levers of the 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.420
 economy as is the banking system and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.720
 foreign trade so that savings 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:26.110
 national does not run away from the country so that 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.170
 the national does not spend on expenses 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:33.220
 completely useless or parasitic and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.399
 applied to necessary investments of 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.619
 industrialization of social improvement 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.800
 improvement of the environment 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.950
 housing plans and so that 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.330
 can naturally occur the frank of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.820
 state has to be in the hands of the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.190
 workers because he continues to be 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.159
 brothers of the same bourgeoisie that has 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.399
 created all this external debt system 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.979
 no one would fundamentally change so 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.140
 both the workers' party declares 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.259
 openly that is the external debt is 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.939
 unpayable that the funds of the debt with 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.470
 the vulture funds is an aberration 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.360
 huge you think it's a debt 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.860
 that comes from far away and that the judge 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:21.099
 griesa has been updated until the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.140
 interest rates that agreed to horse in the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.080
 the time of the rÃºa francamente usurarias 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.810
 that's why it grows a lot and that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.569
 is negotiating your payment through the 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.260
 bond issue as eni pf which 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.959
 double doubles for the conditions of 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.549
 those bonds doubles the debt that 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.690
 Argentina today has the set of 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.349
 the vulture funds good this is 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.470
 impossible to break this means putting 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.470
 in crisis the current economic regime and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.489
 develop another economic regime that 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.140
 stop national savings within the country 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.150
 is national savings has been allocated to 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.849
 true priority 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.310
 fundamental for the majority of the country and 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.900
 that requires a government of workers 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.299
 the problem of external debt in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.599
 last instance raises a question of 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.599
 power
