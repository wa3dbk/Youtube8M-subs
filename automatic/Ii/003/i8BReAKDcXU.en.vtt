generally<00:01:20.240> speaking<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.750> treatises<00:01:21.080> need<00:01:21.200> to

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:21.289 
generally speaking the treatises need to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:22.859 
generally speaking the treatises need to
propagate<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.039> lowland<00:01:22.369> country

propagate in that lowland country

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.359 
propagate in that lowland country
probably<00:01:23.869> on<00:01:23.960> a<00:01:23.990> theory<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:24.289> think<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.740> once<00:01:25.159> in<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
probably on a theory I think I once in a

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.430 
probably on a theory I think I once in a
millennium<00:01:25.460> type<00:01:25.880> flooding<00:01:26.210> event<00:01:26.450> set

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
millennium type flooding event set

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.680 
millennium type flooding event set
thusly<00:01:27.619> downstream<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.420> little<00:01:29.600> bit

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
thusly downstream and we little bit

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.940 
thusly downstream and we little bit
higher<00:01:29.930> than<00:01:30.110> normal

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
higher than normal

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.770 
higher than normal
let's<00:01:31.520> look<00:01:31.610> at<00:01:31.880> going<00:01:31.970> you<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.210> next<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.600> very

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
let's look at going you to next the very

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.139 
let's look at going you to next the very
special<00:01:33.140> place<00:01:33.380> with<00:01:34.340> trees<00:01:34.520> propagated<00:01:35.030> and

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
special place with trees propagated and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:43.350 
special place with trees propagated and
change

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.700 

so<00:01:44.360> we're<00:01:44.480> no<00:01:44.540> longer<00:01:44.630> at<00:01:45.140> million<00:01:45.440> followers

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
so we're no longer at million followers

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.810 
so we're no longer at million followers
we're<00:01:45.830> just<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.010> few<00:01:46.160> metres<00:01:46.400> above<00:01:46.490> sea<00:01:46.670> level

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
we're just a few metres above sea level

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.580 
we're just a few metres above sea level
now<00:01:47.210> again<00:01:47.690> we've<00:01:47.780> got<00:01:47.900> some<00:01:48.020> lemon<00:01:48.230> tea<00:01:48.350> trees

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
now again we've got some lemon tea trees

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.930 
now again we've got some lemon tea trees
here<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:49.010> can<00:01:49.160> see<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> leaves<00:01:49.490> are<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.700> same

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
here you can see the leaves are the same

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.060 
here you can see the leaves are the same
and<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:50.270> setting<00:01:50.540> some<00:01:50.690> seed<00:01:50.960> but<00:01:51.830> really

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
and then setting some seed but really

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.050 
and then setting some seed but really
it's<00:01:52.160> actually<00:01:52.370> quite<00:01:52.550> different<00:01:52.760> on<00:01:52.970> the

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
it's actually quite different on the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.520 
it's actually quite different on the
inside<00:01:53.390> if<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.600> smell<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.020> leaves

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
inside if you smell the leaves

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.500 
inside if you smell the leaves
it's<00:01:54.740> very<00:01:54.920> perfumey<00:01:55.730> and<00:01:55.880> fruity<00:01:56.240> quite

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
it's very perfumey and fruity quite

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.850 
it's very perfumey and fruity quite
different<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.140> lemon<00:01:57.440> tea<00:01:57.590> tree<00:01:57.800> at

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
different to the lemon tea tree at

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.630 
different to the lemon tea tree at
minion<00:01:58.130> Falls

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
minion Falls

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.610 
minion Falls
come<00:01:59.030> along<00:01:59.180> here<00:01:59.570> there's<00:02:00.050> another<00:02:00.230> lemon

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
come along here there's another lemon

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.190 
come along here there's another lemon
tea<00:02:00.740> tree<00:02:01.010> but<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:01.610> one<00:02:01.870> actually<00:02:02.870> smells

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
tea tree but this one actually smells

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.570 
tea tree but this one actually smells
like<00:02:03.320> Terps<00:02:03.620> it's<00:02:03.830> actually<00:02:04.100> pretty<00:02:04.310> ordinary

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
like Terps it's actually pretty ordinary

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.940 
like Terps it's actually pretty ordinary
so<00:02:05.510> it<00:02:05.570> was<00:02:05.660> actually<00:02:05.720> trees<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:06.620> this<00:02:06.770> one

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
so it was actually trees like this one

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.170 
so it was actually trees like this one
where<00:02:07.100> C<00:02:07.250> was<00:02:07.430> collected<00:02:07.730> several<00:02:07.970> decades

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
where C was collected several decades

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.270 
where C was collected several decades
ago<00:02:08.450> actually<00:02:08.869> formed<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.350> basis<00:02:09.740> of<00:02:09.860> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
ago actually formed the basis of the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.860 
ago actually formed the basis of the
plantations<00:02:10.910> for<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> supply<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.690> new

Australia central oil now I think this

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.340 
Australia central oil now I think this
area<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.910> very<00:02:14.150> special<00:02:14.630> there's<00:02:14.930> only<00:02:15.050> been<00:02:15.290> a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
area is very special there's only been a

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.990 
area is very special there's only been a
couple<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.680> hectares<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.190> think<00:02:16.700> I've<00:02:16.790> found

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
couple of hectares I think I've found

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.870 
couple of hectares I think I've found
all<00:02:17.330> these<00:02:17.630> trees<00:02:17.930> growing<00:02:18.460> these<00:02:19.460> trees<00:02:19.730> have

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
all these trees growing these trees have

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.650 
all these trees growing these trees have
survived

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
survived

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.700 
survived
because<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.960> rest<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.260> areas<00:02:21.590> got

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
because the rest of the areas got

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.650 
because the rest of the areas got
sugarcane<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.310> cattle<00:02:22.700> grazing<00:02:23.150> everywhere

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
sugarcane and cattle grazing everywhere

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.160 
sugarcane and cattle grazing everywhere
but<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.230> area<00:02:24.650> survived<00:02:24.950> because<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.370> this

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
but this area survived because of this

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
but this area survived because of this
rock<00:02:27.170> cow<00:02:27.890> cart<00:02:28.220> graze<00:02:28.460> here

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
rock cow cart graze here

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.910 
rock cow cart graze here
the<00:02:29.240> short<00:02:29.480> cane<00:02:29.660> can't<00:02:29.900> grow<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.800> this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
the short cane can't grow here so this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.170 
the short cane can't grow here so this
area<00:02:31.130> has<00:02:31.220> been<00:02:31.310> able<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.520> survive<00:02:31.820> it's<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.090> bit
