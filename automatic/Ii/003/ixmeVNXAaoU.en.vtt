00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
haven't done a lot of research so I'll

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.650 
haven't done a lot of research so I'll
leave<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> comments<00:00:48.420> let<00:00:48.510> me<00:00:48.570> know

jump but uh you can see you can see kind
of<00:01:04.170> where<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> inspirations<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.070> coming

and show you guys kind of a maybe a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
and show you guys kind of a maybe a
side-by-side<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:11.030> can<00:01:12.619> kind<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> difficult<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
side-by-side I can kind of difficult to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.999 
side-by-side I can kind of difficult to
do<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.450> three<00:01:15.659> as<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.930> see<00:01:16.080> like

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
do here so the three as you can see like

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
do here so the three as you can see like
the<00:01:17.130> toe<00:01:17.250> box<00:01:17.400> area<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the toe box area right here or just the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.289 
the toe box area right here or just the
the<00:01:18.750> collar<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.140> whatever<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.530> called<00:01:20.299> this

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the collar or whatever it's called this

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.890 
the collar or whatever it's called this
whoops<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.850> 3s<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.299> well<00:01:24.810> as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
whoops that is a from the 3s as well as

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.850 
whoops that is a from the 3s as well as
this<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.650> back<00:01:25.799> tab<00:01:26.040> area<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.430> here<00:01:27.799> it's<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
this the back tab area right here it's a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.740 
this the back tab area right here it's a
similar<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> three<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.000> kind<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
similar from the three so that's kind of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
similar from the three so that's kind of
where<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.200> pattern<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.159> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
where they get that pattern from I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.100 
where they get that pattern from I
believe<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.689> drew<00:01:33.960> from

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
believe that's all that they drew from

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
believe that's all that they drew from
the<00:01:34.170> threes<00:01:35.090> next<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.600> de<00:01:36.930> force<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:38.030> you

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the threes next up is de force and you

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.880 
the threes next up is de force and you
can<00:01:39.150> tell<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.650> mesh<00:01:40.920> area<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
can tell the mesh area right here is

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.810 
can tell the mesh area right here is
inspiration<00:01:43.890> from<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.130> fours<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> actually

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
inspiration from the fours and actually

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.210 
inspiration from the fours and actually
you<00:01:44.909> can't<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:46.649> mesh<00:01:46.829> goes<00:01:47.070> all

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you can't see it but the mesh goes all

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.100 
you can't see it but the mesh goes all
the<00:01:47.250> way<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> four<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.990> due

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the way up just like the four is due

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
the way up just like the four is due
right<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.790> they<00:01:50.790> don't<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.299> any<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
right here they don't have any of the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.580 
right here they don't have any of the
side<00:01:51.990> parts<00:01:52.710> right<00:01:53.189> here<00:01:53.509> with<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.290> same<00:01:55.470> as

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
side parts right here with the same as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
side parts right here with the same as
the<00:01:55.680> floor<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.700> think<00:01:56.969> that's<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the floor so that I think that's the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.819 
the floor so that I think that's the
only<00:01:57.479> inspiration<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.590> off<00:01:58.710> this

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
only inspiration that I can see off this

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.950 
only inspiration that I can see off this
one<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.100> from<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> pores<00:01:59.700> these<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.299> some

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
one is from the pores these have some

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
one is from the pores these have some
heavy<00:02:01.110> inspiration<00:02:01.740> from<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> 5s<00:02:02.310> though<00:02:02.430> as

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
heavy inspiration from the 5s though as

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.569 
heavy inspiration from the 5s though as
you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.479> tongue<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.040> from<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> 5s

you can see the tongue is from the 5s

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can see the tongue is from the 5s
and<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.770> soul<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> 5s<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.539> well<00:02:09.690> it's
