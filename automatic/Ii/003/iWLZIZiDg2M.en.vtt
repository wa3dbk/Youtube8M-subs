00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:15.529
 During the IAA Commercial Vehicles 2010 were again many vintage cars 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:16.789
 shown 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.470
 in the past few decades few of the workplace of motorists very much 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.269
 simply designed 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.229
 such is a short story that is also essential to the vacant 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:28.029
 older 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.699
 but the association of the automobile industry has from now on their mothers too early 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.350
 born crew 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.940
 a joint action that means it will be in a certain percentage 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.590
 is available for play 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.760
 Historic Commercial Vehicles Buses Construction Vehicles 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.960
 displayed 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.620
 Look, if you visit the IAA here today in 2010 percent 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.010
 you will find many modern vehicles 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.140
 Aldi will support the entrepreneur in his business in the future 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.340
 the voice witnessed and found the 50s have been built around the 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.840
 Fathers and grandparents 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.890
 after World War II helped to earn money again 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.870
 And these cars do not have their way into the blast furnace despite all this 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.050
 found 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.540
 and then are missing from the current owner again in this case 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.930
 or restored state has been relocated 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.170
 And that is in motion &amp; emotion is an issue but is very important 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.650
 that would be the younger generations today, the children and grandchildren 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.009
 The entrepreneur shows how the grandfather and father his money back then 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.190
 hard earned 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.300
 because these vehicles they see here have largely no 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.760
 Soup Power steering Brake assistance systems and others 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.990
 there was the Bridget driver of motorists that word 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.670
 Percent absolutely true strength and questions and today 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.020
 This is the case in modern vehicles for a variety of reasons 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.960
 Actually, for me personally as President, I have to go to Zurich 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.700
 Mitterrand Community a vehicle driver and many of these work 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.180
 who have to take over the trunk earlier 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.930
 he no longer has to represent him today, somewhere at a ramp and stays 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.290
 hang on without may not get off please unload truck here 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.250
 These vehicles used to be loaded by hand b and unload the pallets and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.030
 The forklift was in the early 50s or 50's female 50's 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.379
 Years the Frankfurt 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.899
 that is a cab of a copt must thanks 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:25.829
 You can see the front of the hood and the cool weather the fenders 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.009
 largely in original condition 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:32.549
 that is, with the latest technology percent pickled so the old paint d 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.809
 brought down old layers of paint 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.789
 but the cabs had a problem back then 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:41.089
 she was not built for eternity it was a wood skeleton what 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:42.269
 was granted 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.760
 and that wood this cab has sometime then through worm and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.059
 humidity 

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.799
 found the way to earth and then you have to go first 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.659
 Rebuild cab 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.119
 and here the company enters three of a customer a vehicle which 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.170
 there is in the restoration and as a long-distance truck the is built 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.669
 one has yes and shows the percent of Baptists towered he is explicitly times 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.889
 the sales the numbers of the entire classic car scene 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.979
 has determined it is indeed several billion d-mark the sum in the 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.669
 entire second half of the scene 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.529
 flow 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:20.319
 in the truck sector, it is certainly manageable because not so many 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.879
 Companies are active there 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.839
 but it is easier 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 Öztürk right 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.039
 No 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.259
 on the air around the clock 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.899
 the DB Projektbau Forum 24 comes the woman
