00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:24.680
 tonight I want to talk to you for 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.260
 thank you right now there is no let's go 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.910
 with dodi and we ask them a question too 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.010
 if actually listening to this record myself 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.710
 I've already given an answer where it is 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.070
 when the music was finished the music did not go 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.839
 the music is here 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.250
 well yes it is a good answer also because 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.350
 as it is seen there is no point 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.879
 question mark in the exclamation mark 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.510
 I want to say where the la went 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.129
 music is a comparison of what it is 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.140
 a story between two people 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.080
 they ask where the harmony that lies conceals 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.070
 we didn't like to think among ourselves 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.449
 to tell in our opinion modestly 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.489
 where we think the music is gone is 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.630
 we rightly believe that since 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.940
 this disk full of lots of input 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.720
 they are instrumental passages are love songs 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.670
 they are prog songs of the songs you like 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.240
 to go on magic inside 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.590
 of Australia and can be a little 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.590
 summary of a date the team music 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.240
 for wii music library then secret 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.310
 that of always being always for the 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.890
 secret I don't know exactly what though though 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.910
 surely there is a constant 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.250
 in the approach we have the automata 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.660
 in life towards music 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 I started playing had four 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.880
 years I started playing I was 5 and 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.940
 I believe that both he and I were not doing 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.840
 this pig burst out at the heart so 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.239
 we have so a sense of gratitude in the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.890
 against the life of the people who 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.950
 they did this to do this 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.270
 profession of having met us 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.940
 I think this is the secret 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.989
 which leads us to always carry 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.390
 go and see where she went to 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.900
 music not where it went where it is 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.330
 going 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.910
 as you said at the beginning 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.930
 yes curiosity maybe that's what we do 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.219
 leads to see 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.920
 in a world that is changing so 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.359
 quickly no with means of 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.459
 communication that allows us to do 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:03:01.870
 discs in da london from nashville 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.409
 then from Italy to missiles to postpone 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.180
 of the files we are very curious and maybe a 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.609
 semicolon we were able to put 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.900
 in this world where music is 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.900
 thus changing the chin rose thanks 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:04:02.829
 the cd rom only the great musicians yes 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:05.170
 allow you to immerse yourself in music 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.879
 popular without being afraid of 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.549
 getting your hands dirty only the big ones do it 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.549
