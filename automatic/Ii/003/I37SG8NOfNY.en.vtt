that is his brain behind it but who

that is his brain behind it but who

knows well I've never really thought I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.179 
knows well I've never really thought I
had<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> most<00:00:21.570> photogenic<00:00:21.990> face<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:23.070> today

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
had the most photogenic face but today

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.679 
had the most photogenic face but today
I'm<00:00:23.460> gonna<00:00:23.640> find<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.660> a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
I'm gonna find out if I have a

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.620 
I'm gonna find out if I have a
photogenic<00:00:25.199> brain<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.519> come<00:00:26.670> on<00:00:26.820> my<00:00:27.359> brains

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
photogenic brain so come on my brains

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.660 
photogenic brain so come on my brains

at<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> University<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> Nottingham<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:31.349> I'd

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
at the University of Nottingham now I'd

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.749 
at the University of Nottingham now I'd
like<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> tell<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.099> they're<00:00:32.340> only<00:00:32.369> using

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
like to tell you they're only using

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.600 
like to tell you they're only using
geniuses<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.899> experiment<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:35.190> really

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
geniuses for this experiment but really

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
geniuses for this experiment but really
the<00:00:35.760> only<00:00:35.790> requirement<00:00:36.600> was<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.899> was

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
the only requirement was that I was

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
the only requirement was that I was
healthy<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> didn't<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.460> any<00:00:38.640> metal<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.120> my

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
healthy and didn't have any metal in my

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.700 
healthy and didn't have any metal in my
body<00:00:39.450> no<00:00:39.989> metal<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.680> scanner<00:00:42.530> I'll<00:00:43.530> be

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
body no metal in the scanner I'll be

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.680 
body no metal in the scanner I'll be
spending<00:00:44.070> 40<00:00:44.460> minutes<00:00:44.730> inside<00:00:45.090> an<00:00:45.239> MRI

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
spending 40 minutes inside an MRI

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.110 
spending 40 minutes inside an MRI
scanner<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.710> really<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> very<00:00:47.520> big<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
scanner which is really a very big and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.569 
scanner which is really a very big and
very<00:00:48.420> powerful<00:00:49.140> magnet<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> watch<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
very powerful magnet I have to watch a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.340 
very powerful magnet I have to watch a
series<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.149> videos<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.510> answer<00:00:52.170> questions

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.789 

just<00:01:02.180> keep<00:01:03.180> watching<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.409> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
just keep watching as I do this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.830 
just keep watching as I do this
countless<00:01:05.339> pictures<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.240> brain<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.810> been

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
countless pictures of my brain have been

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.170 
countless pictures of my brain have been
captured<00:01:07.280> recording<00:01:08.280> where<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> blood<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
captured recording where the blood and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
captured recording where the blood and
oxygen<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.810> flowing<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.680> when

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
oxygen are flowing so you know when

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
oxygen are flowing so you know when
certain<00:01:11.100> video<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:12.110> what<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> state

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
certain video was on what was the state

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
certain video was on what was the state
of<00:01:13.799> activity<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.520> brain<00:01:14.700> dr.<00:01:15.240> Ramsay<00:01:15.720> will

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
of activity in the brain dr. Ramsay will

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.899 
of activity in the brain dr. Ramsay will
use<00:01:16.049> them<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.350> better<00:01:16.560> understand<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.310> humans

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
use them to better understand how humans

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.179 
use them to better understand how humans
interpret<00:01:18.570> behavior<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.380> actions<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> other

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
interpret behavior and actions of other

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.090 
interpret behavior and actions of other
people<00:01:20.430> but<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.360> volunteers<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.050 
photo of my brain at the end most people
do<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.430> they<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> picture<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
do it because they get a picture of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.440 
do it because they get a picture of
their<00:01:33.240> brain<00:01:34.009> I'd<00:01:35.009> say<00:01:35.280> yes<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.299> for

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
their brain I'd say yes they do it for

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.250 
their brain I'd say yes they do it for
the<00:01:36.509> brain

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.190 

so<00:01:43.260> flourish<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.940> was<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.270> fine<00:01:45.600> nothing<00:01:46.050> be

it that's brilliant and here's my brain

it that's brilliant and here's my brain
up<00:02:09.119> close<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:10.320> fancy<00:02:10.860> bits<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
up close with fancy bits like the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.180 
up close with fancy bits like the
cerebellum<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:12.690> cerebral<00:02:13.350> cortex<00:02:13.830> pretty

cerebellum and cerebral cortex pretty

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.490 
cerebellum and cerebral cortex pretty
much<00:02:14.459> where<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.820> should<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.260> now<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.320> can

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
much where they should be now you can

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.080 
much where they should be now you can
see<00:02:16.620> more<00:02:16.770> pictures<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.100> my<00:02:17.340> brain<00:02:17.670> or<00:02:17.940> perhaps

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
see more pictures of my brain or perhaps

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.990 
see more pictures of my brain or perhaps
more<00:02:18.570> importantly<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.560> longer<00:02:20.220> explanation<00:02:20.340> of

today<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.670> wonder<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:29.730> they'd<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.000> do<00:02:30.150> it<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
today I wonder if they'd like to do it a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.040 
today I wonder if they'd like to do it a
hundred<00:02:30.390> times

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
hundred times

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.320 
hundred times
cuz<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.320> would<00:02:31.440> be<00:02:31.560> $1,000<00:02:32.220> no<00:02:32.790> I<00:02:32.820> doubt<00:02:32.970> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
cuz that would be $1,000 no I doubt it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.030 
cuz that would be $1,000 no I doubt it

don't forget his vital organ is on the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.229 
don't forget his vital organ is on the
