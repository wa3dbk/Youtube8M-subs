00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
are doing this for the resources mostly

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.670 
are doing this for the resources mostly
so<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> strongly<00:02:12.810> some<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> these<00:02:13.379> clan

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so the strongly some of these clan

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.720 
so the strongly some of these clan
troops<00:02:14.159> and<00:02:15.049> watch<00:02:16.049> them<00:02:16.349> do<00:02:16.530> their<00:02:16.709> work<00:02:16.980> so

troops and watch them do their work so
the<00:02:18.120> one<00:02:18.299> good<00:02:18.510> thing<00:02:18.540> about<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.110> rate<00:02:19.379> is

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the one good thing about this rate is

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.030 
the one good thing about this rate is
that<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.099> spreads<00:02:20.579> out<00:02:20.730> all<00:02:21.030> your<00:02:21.510> troops<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that it spreads out all your troops so

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.699 
that it spreads out all your troops so
that<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.610> splash<00:02:24.450> damages<00:02:25.079> as<00:02:25.319> in<00:02:25.650> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
that the splash damages as in the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.850 
that the splash damages as in the
mortars<00:02:26.069> are<00:02:26.280> more<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.290> confused<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.470> when

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
mortars are more of confused and when

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.960 
mortars are more of confused and when
they<00:02:29.010> tack<00:02:29.340> they<00:02:29.790> won't<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:31.700> big<00:02:32.700> chunks

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
they tack they won't get big chunks

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.479 
they tack they won't get big chunks
except<00:02:33.690> if<00:02:33.840> they<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.200> crowded<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.860> here<00:02:34.890> in

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
except if they get crowded in here in

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.149 
except if they get crowded in here in
which<00:02:35.940> they<00:02:36.900> all<00:02:37.140> are<00:02:37.349> so<00:02:37.560> i<00:02:37.650> could<00:02:37.829> throw<00:02:38.010> down

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
which they all are so i could throw down

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.890 
which they all are so i could throw down
a<00:02:38.190> rage<00:02:38.489> spell<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.510> don't<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.870> one

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900

this raid went very well i got a lot of

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.069 
this raid went very well i got a lot of
resources<00:02:59.700> so<00:03:00.120> far<00:03:00.389> if<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.599> could<00:03:00.750> breaking

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
resources so far if they could breaking

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.899 
resources so far if they could breaking
this<00:03:01.200> wall<00:03:01.500> i<00:03:01.530> might<00:03:01.859> be<00:03:02.040> able<00:03:02.099> to<00:03:02.190> get<00:03:02.340> town

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:07.879 
this wall i might be able to get town
hall<00:03:05.599> but<00:03:06.599> it<00:03:06.810> looks<00:03:07.019> like<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> archers<00:03:07.620> are

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
hall but it looks like the archers are

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.099 
hall but it looks like the archers are
going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.609> get<00:03:08.819> destroyed<00:03:09.299> by<00:03:09.359> this<00:03:09.569> mortar

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
going to get destroyed by this mortar

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.020 
going to get destroyed by this mortar
but<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.859> okay<00:03:11.159> because<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.639> got<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
but that is okay because we got the

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.629 
but that is okay because we got the
majority<00:03:12.239> of<00:03:12.659> their<00:03:12.900> resources<00:03:13.290> i'm<00:03:14.040> just

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
majority of their resources i'm just

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.750 
majority of their resources i'm just
going<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.030> end<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:16.470> here<00:03:16.500> as<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.639> be

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
going to end it here as they will be

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.619
