00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.550
 hi everyone, how are you today? 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.469
 propose three smoothie recipes 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.030
 natural fruits that are super rich and 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.590
 Super I like to discuss all 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.150
 that I teach and donate ideals for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.770
 accompany the breakfast to consume 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.420
 between meals or just when we 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.980
 grab a hunger attack and we do not want 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.230
 take a hand of some chips or a 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 cake or any processed food and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.619
 we want to consume something healthier than 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 It does a lot of good to our cut you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.349
 They give me that I only share things with them 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.599
 easy to do things that we do not 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.369
 complicate life and apart from that today 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.840
 I also want to show you that sometimes 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.790
 it's much cheaper with green 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.620
 healthy that soon becomes something 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.850
 the store something that has processed me and that 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.469
 does not do our good 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 organism so if you want to see how 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.850
 are the smoothies this shake goes well 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.710
 of apple is perfect to accompany your 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
 breakfast because apart from being full of 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.399
 vitamins has soothing properties and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.410
 relaxants that helps control states 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.210
 of anxiety and stress the protagonist of 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.820
 this shake is the apple thanks to 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 Fortifies skin nails and hair promotes 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.239
 production of defenses and help to have 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.309
 a normal digestion we will need 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.379
 an entire apple a glass of yogurt 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.580
 natural the juice of an orange and a glass 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.380
 of jett do not forget to wash 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.750
 in fruits take heart to 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 apple and if you want you can peel it but 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.930
 I leave it like this to keep you all 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.250
 the nutrients with the apple the juice of 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.560
 orange and yogurt in the blender 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.660
 liquefies and finally adds the ice and 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.110
 Blend again until you get texture 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.940
 of frape now if it serves no and it's ready 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.770
 to enjoy you can accompany it with 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.990
 a few cookies or take it alone is very 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 very rich already with those of the first shake of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 ready let's see the second option and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.090
 This is very special because it is a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.650
 little thicker texture and mix 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.570
 soft yogurt with the sweetness of 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 fruit and the one chosen for this smoothie is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.350
 the kiwi because this little one has more 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.060
 vitamin c that the orange contains 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.010
 vitamins that protect the cells of the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.479
 aging and protects the system 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.160
 immunological of diseases besides 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 has very little calories and the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.790
 Next and last ingredient is a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 Greek yogurt because it is low in fat and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.820
 has more protein ratio than the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.710
 normal yogurt 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.110
 the rest is super easy only for the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.180
 kiwis and then to the very well put a 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.490
 bowl one layer of the shake another layer 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.260
 of yogurt and another layer of more smoothie is left 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.010
 perfect if you add granola oatmeal or 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.010
 whatever you want 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.459
 and our last shake is a 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.349
 delicious combination of two tropical 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.430
 also leaves a full stomach a good 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.469
 All we need is red strawberries 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.780
 mango very ripe so that sweet 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.980
 naturally the milkshake and ice 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.680
 amounts of slope that both 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.599
 you want to do add strawberries the handle 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.519
 the grapes and the ice and like the 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.519
 previous lico until it is very soft 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.569
 Serve it and you can add pieces of 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.569
 fruit 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.819
 this shake I loved the explosion 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.950
 of flavors and the color that the subject takes 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.450
 nice day and after taking what I already 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.800
 they are satisfied that in a good time 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.450
 he wants to know nothing more about food 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.680
 left that very easy to do is 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.569
 just almost to throw the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.450
 ingredients in the blender liquefy 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.160
 to serve 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.239
 so much in none happy that any kind 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.709
 interesting because I liked it 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.540
 enjoy as the natural flavor of 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.340
 things but do not want to do you can 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.569

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.129
 face do not like any of the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.599
 fruits that I propose can change 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.599
