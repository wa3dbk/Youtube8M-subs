00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519
 to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.010
 hello to all my friends from youtube this 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.010
 video side because this many people 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 they have many doubts about the life of 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.950
 the battery and explain many of the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.700
 questions they asked me in the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.260
 comments 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.420
 it was about the m6 battery that the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.239
 have all the comments they made 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.770
 it seems that we did not read the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.760
 other comments that is where I 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.250
 he explained and it seems 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.290
 I had to be answering a 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.700
 question often exists if it is in 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:18.070
 This video is is that I M6 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.060
 this is the module that the brain is ready 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.500
 logically if it has its own sounds 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.259
 and can look for other tutorial videos 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.729
 about this battery in the 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.990
 official videos 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.420
 d 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.300
 you can go as how to use this one that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.780
 It has several sounds 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.760
 but I do not use these sounds that I use them 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.680
 via usb that is backwards in the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.550
 back of the 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.550
 of the battery 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 he passed it directly 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.439
 I would be the superior 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.500
 to the questions they ask me is yes 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.020
 how the tarola sounded when you smashed it 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.470
 would decline and if so the sound of unemployment 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.470
 of the cloth 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.140
 these things work by means of 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.680
 sensors for example have two sensors 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.680
 here 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.900
 the other drums post 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.519
 this stretch was followed as rain 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.519
 this 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.090
 Y 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.550
 good good cons of this battery 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.140
 is that we are used to 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.100
 use real batteries we beat you very 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.830
 strong and this battery because I broke without 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.330
 want it that opens because you can see 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.330
 tape with silicone 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.030
 nothing happens the battery keeps sounding 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.640
 same 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.959
 and buy these batteries I recommend them 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.020
 they do not hit it too hard because they do not 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.290
 they hold a lot the heras 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.130
 in our normal summer parties 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.130
 remember that we 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.370
 about the hype that can be put 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.370
 double pedal 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.040
 this is how they see in the hype area 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.900
 It is very small 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.549
 if I put double pedal that I 've already 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.560
 made the other pedal to be the other 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.810
 would be here in this area of 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.060
 here and it does not shoot it very well not 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.310
 wheat can very well be a 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.990
 problem what you can do is get 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.010
 another of these put here 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.220
 the club's top bass drum adapter 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.220
 what 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.900
 to leave 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.720
 the cables 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.830
 I do not put it here 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.170
 two looks but do not put here the other 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.880
 they put 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.109
 in the other hype it will come out the same 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.320
 sound but it's not a problem because it 's the 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.320
 drum 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.430
 I have been asked what can be done 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.380
 do with the same colors with the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.900
 cymbal but it has no case because it would be 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.150
 the same 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.220
 the same sounds unless you 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.260
 they want it 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.540
 the battery can not be added more in 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.700
 outputs 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.210
 Exactly why I put this as 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.210
 always following 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.560
 last of the drums and according to 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
 sources dealing with or the one 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.330
 different has 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.550
 has one rubber edge here the other 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.890
 sensor 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.660
 for the whale but the difference 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.409
 the other tones that are with ricky 2 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.699
 they're hard 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.699
 but the different 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.889
 the years that are listening screams are 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.400
 directly the program the superior 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.830
 drummer I can not teach you the sounds 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.539
 real right now because I would have to 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.520
 connect it to an amplifier or 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.470
 directly the computer and I do not 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.450
 I have the cable to do this very far 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.720
 but believe me the sounds are very 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:29.050
 false and sound 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:32.430
 they realize that they beat him slowly 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.430
 I do not know exactly when 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.080
 when you hit a horde of this 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.510
 Titanic 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.670
 do not 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.590
 instead the original sounds of the 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.610
 battery you hear exactly the same 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.300
 hit but 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.539
 with low volume with low force 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.550
 but tip with the same sound very 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.210
 cloned done very fake that does have 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.210
 many different sounds 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.060
 electronic if that was true friend 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.639
 personal I do not do not use only 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.440
 I use the USB output to carry 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.490
 to the computer 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.490
 use it with the same 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.139
 well I'm tutorial to use the 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.229
 building we go with the battery 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.379
 are using right now the east requested 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.379
 plus 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:34.520
 this as you can see they have all these 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.220
 present there our 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.900
 this 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:44.710
 although I'm fine very well down here 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.970
 for the younger cousin of the superior 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:50.860
 program is not that this does not happen almost 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.659
 nothing too that is very simple 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.460
 so it is important that we will see 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:57.470
 is the other the suffering drama 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.080
 so that we overcome have all Jesus 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.729
 these are here they have to first in 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.319
 save the other 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:05.300
 and here installs in the district and already 

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:08.059
 you can use this and you look there all 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.639
 Sometimes it's not the same, it's the same 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:12.710
 web for when will they allocate wake for 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.069
 example the right saucer badly crush 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.069
 to English 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:19.440
 they go to the battery they take off the battery 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.180
 is 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.990
 and sign automatically 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.000
 well this would be all east though 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.960
 so they can assign the battery has 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.260
 that follow branch and in the inserts and 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.260
 as well 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:49.580
 this is the program I'm using the club 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:51.590
 beige to 16 but the assignments of the 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.950
 dishes of the tops and if you want to put 

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.490
 a lot like it's ray because it 's the 

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:58.030
 same 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:03.400
 we are all inside the key cap 

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.400
 then there is a video and it has been useful
