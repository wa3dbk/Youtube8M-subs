00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.219
 welcome to this short tutorial very 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.490
 the short mosquito League of Legends 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.510
 and I will teach how 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 how to speak 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.930
 when you are in it 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.439
 in the viewer mode or on a screen 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.720
 of load of the champions or that you 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.980
 remove the chat and then maybe 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.570
 are you talking to someone something 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 important or not or just want 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.290
 say anything and you can not then if 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 can 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.200
 for example viewer mode let's see 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.829
 to my cousin 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.460
 to my cousin wow kiriki 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.460
 chiriquÃ­ 6202 manga gris 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 Now I'm going to hit a cut because 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.050
 I think that if he did not succeed we will see that 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.480
 is 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.400
 because if I do not think it taxes us the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.220
 game itself but it stays a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.000
 black screen we stop if we 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.630
 you are doing, you are going to see 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.630
 here but you do not see 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.660
 you see then now we give to 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.660
 tabulator 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.050
 now he is recording 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.850
 and here in the bar this process or 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.759
 be an old red thing 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.370
 and as you see we can talk to who 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.770
 We want now with my cousin 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.240
 I would like I can not answer if you want or 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.240
 It is not an excuse d 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.359
 and that's the way it is and in the meantime we can 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:56.210
 be seeing here that is this this 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.730
 jungle I do not know 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.210
 kirk and 6 all 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.700
 0 2 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.829
 Well, that's all 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.110
 so nothing else that has to do with alt 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.810
 + tabulator what it does is change 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 of window does not close anything or anything 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.879
 window changes and that's it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.620
 I hope that it has served you and it is already 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.620
 we do not see other videos until another
