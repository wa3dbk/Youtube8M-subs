filters<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.600> would<00:01:24.750> match<00:01:25.110> them<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:25.530> how

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
filters you would match them with how

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.620 
filters you would match them with how
many<00:01:26.190> you<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.550> installed<00:01:26.940> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.270> upper

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
chamber as they work together so let's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
chamber as they work together so let's
look<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> different<00:01:30.570> systems<00:01:30.720> available

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
look at the different systems available

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
look at the different systems available
and<00:01:31.500> how<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.400> suggest<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:33.060> selects<00:01:33.450> your

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and how I would suggest one selects your

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.930 
and how I would suggest one selects your
system<00:01:34.050> a<00:01:34.229> good<00:01:34.950> rule<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.250> thumb<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
system a good rule of thumb is that

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.090 
system a good rule of thumb is that
bigger<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.630> always<00:01:36.899> better<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
bigger is always better if you have the

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.850 
bigger is always better if you have the
space<00:01:38.399> cord<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.930> would<00:01:40.170> estimate<00:01:40.470> daily

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
space cord also I would estimate daily

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.279 
space cord also I would estimate daily
usage<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.580> about<00:01:41.789> half<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> gallon<00:01:42.630> per<00:01:42.930> person
