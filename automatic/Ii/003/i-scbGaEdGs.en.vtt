00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:01.889 
kind of line the edges part of my lips

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.519 
kind of line the edges part of my lips
first<00:06:02.309> because<00:06:02.969> in<00:06:03.299> this<00:06:03.569> kind<00:06:03.899> of<00:06:03.989> color<00:06:04.259> or

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
first because in this kind of color or

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.919 
first because in this kind of color or
any<00:06:04.739> dark<00:06:05.099> shade<00:06:05.459> lip<00:06:05.819> color<00:06:06.059> you<00:06:06.179> have<00:06:06.569> to<00:06:06.599> be

any dark shade lip color you have to be

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:09.559 
any dark shade lip color you have to be
really<00:06:07.499> precise<00:06:08.069> so<00:06:08.789> I'm<00:06:08.999> just<00:06:09.179> basically

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
really precise so I'm just basically

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.139 
really precise so I'm just basically
lining<00:06:10.169> the<00:06:10.289> edges<00:06:10.649> first<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.279> then<00:06:11.429> I<00:06:11.609> go<00:06:11.849> and

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.149 
lining the edges first and then I go and

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:15.049 
lining the edges first and then I go and
fill<00:06:12.419> in<00:06:12.569> the<00:06:12.959> inner<00:06:13.889> part<00:06:14.249> of<00:06:14.339> my<00:06:14.399> lip

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:15.059 
fill in the inner part of my lip

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.139 
fill in the inner part of my lip
I<00:06:15.589> feel<00:06:16.589> like<00:06:16.769> this<00:06:16.979> shade<00:06:17.279> for<00:06:17.579> me<00:06:17.729> is<00:06:17.939> more
