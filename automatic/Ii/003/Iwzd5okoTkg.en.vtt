 made 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.409
 farah 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.890
 in full 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.890
 percent 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.860
 he refused 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.350
 composer-director 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.940
 production in English 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.690
 I make music my fucking album called dimaga is felt more 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.700
 but which are stable in 2011 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.500
 on which I have several other guests singers like sandra 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.940
 nkakÃ© of grasshoppers omar 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:55.680
 on the side 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.800
 reindeer 3-0 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.270
 this week is delicate 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 mermoud head of the dip 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 so already in this cdc balneo album 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.370
 grubby 2 - his eleventh album both at the beginning of the month are very numerous 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.000
 in this direction 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.090
 but also pieces 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.550
 it's because it's true that my feeling today 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.430
 we find on the albums very beautiful story as they say 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.090
 either albums 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.630
 debussy train to compose 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 however, a song 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.160
 more lively about it 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.640
 all these people are gone 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.790
 and I tried 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.820
 it's by watching 15 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.820
 to be able to counterbalance 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.970
 go with her with that the basin pieces 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.860
 it's a piece without nuance among others 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.649
 enters the classical subregion 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.319
 and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.089
 very spontaneously 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.229
 it's quite funny by the way and I'm going to think a little bit like this as a 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:19.439
 piece 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.769
 as for that in fact to which I add a rhythm and that I am 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.379
 proud of him asked whether 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.019
 i bet i 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.969
 we actually 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.199
 we're thinking we're going to talk about summer 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.339
 we have everything we need 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.290
 apart from that easy to talk about summer titin by the executive 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.799
 everything was done very quickly 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.919
 he was present 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.019
 every time I pass the project which is at the same time I sang 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.999
 and that's great at the same time we did not stop saying bullshit he 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.729
 even sang beautifully censored on the title 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.039
 and it really gives it's precisely people it says 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:21.680
 in the world of things effect on this title I'm pretty happy it's a 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:25.109
 story I was very surprised by the same maturity of 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.139
 here is his maturity 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.139
 artistic and his true talent 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.649
 multi-instrumentalist yet in the arrangements 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.309
 or all that talent in this person is really something 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:44.669
 very surprising for me i am proud to be part of this project 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.059
 I'm so proud that now I'm going to sing the song in my 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.689
 own concerts so 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.540
 it's too much 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.739
 and why 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.739
 for his performance on the title 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.619
 how I redefined even though musically enough album 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:14.229
 I think it's a marc banger 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.340
 between two willow leaves 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.909
 the little hunt his wife 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.909
 knowing that most of the time on these are the titles 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.059
 we will try to bring special care instead of just one 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:28.400
 the day of his return 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.819
 we find face to Monaco 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.819
 the population of his sentence 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.930
 drouet cut of africa 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.150
 e with her concern in front of her 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.509
 the title that opens the album is also second part of the album 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.509
 I went out in 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.370
 in one fell swoop 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.589
 to say that bordeaux 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.139
 why not ride along the watercourse 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.050
 between June and December 2010 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.870
 and things finally became quite naturally south-south relations became 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.839
 very very well 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.379
 but without gravity 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:21.240
 particularly 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.210
 worshiping authorities response 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.210
 the spread to Algeria I will try 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.150
 here they are in the end we have a title a dance party has been remixed by 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.990
 party does not exist 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.180
 by laziness 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.319
 in England 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.059
 and by assailant beat in French 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.460
 see cl 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.189
 the title lives what seogwipo with them 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:46.189
 with them sandra nkakÃ© 

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:06.089
 Bernard Gerard 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:22.189
 point 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 a perfect day however the 3rd 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.800
 your favor 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:39.419
 10 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:41.369
 he is always a little more tense 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:43.990
 david s the other projects 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.760
 it was great it's over 10 billion I followed violence for 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.460
 able to stay at the top of the g20 in london friday 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.539
 charpy 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.539
 the years revival with a screen like that 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.460
 it 

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.839
 so they must if be judge and part 

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.849
