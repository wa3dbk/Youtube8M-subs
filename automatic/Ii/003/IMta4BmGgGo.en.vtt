00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
it functions I think she gave us so much

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.610 
it functions I think she gave us so much
detail<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.850> information<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.869> like<00:02:11.080> we

each other and one of the kind of rules
of<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.819> pieces<00:02:22.030> act<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.660> instinct<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.440> that's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
of the pieces act on instinct and that's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.190 
of the pieces act on instinct and that's
both<00:02:24.010> in<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.370> making<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.270> but<00:02:25.600> really<00:02:25.959> in

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
both in the making of it but really in

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.449 
both in the making of it but really in
the<00:02:26.319> performing<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.160> well

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
the performing of it as well

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.470 
the performing of it as well
involves<00:02:27.880> seven<00:02:28.180> bodies<00:02:28.709> seven<00:02:29.709> people

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
involves seven bodies seven people

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.640 
involves seven bodies seven people
making<00:02:31.480> decisions<00:02:31.600> moving<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.530> this

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
making decisions moving in this

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.980 
making decisions moving in this
incredibly<00:02:33.190> complex<00:02:33.700> multi-layered<00:02:34.270> way<00:02:34.750> and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
incredibly complex multi-layered way and

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.720 
incredibly complex multi-layered way and
so<00:02:35.080> you<00:02:35.170> do<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.740> put<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.920> lot<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.220> rehearsal

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
so you do have to put a lot of rehearsal

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.480 
so you do have to put a lot of rehearsal
in<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.150> be<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:38.350> aware<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.920> everyone

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
in and be really aware of everyone

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.370 
in and be really aware of everyone
around<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.569> me<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.020> kind<00:02:41.290> of

beautiful thing to watch and like see

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.449 
beautiful thing to watch and like see
everybody<00:02:55.599> moving<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.740> interacting<00:02:57.280> with

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
everybody moving and interacting with

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.100 
everybody moving and interacting with
each<00:02:57.490> other<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.120> think<00:02:58.240> that<00:02:58.420> people<00:02:58.660> who<00:02:58.900> know

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
each other I think that people who know

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.810 
each other I think that people who know
sentry<00:02:59.590> set<00:02:59.830> will<00:03:00.040> come<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.340> see<00:03:00.490> this<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
sentry set will come to see this and

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.240 
sentry set will come to see this and
they'll<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.090> sentry<00:03:01.420> set<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:02.260> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
they'll see sentry set it is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.210 
they'll see sentry set it is
recognizable<00:03:04.120> not<00:03:04.510> all

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
recognizable not all

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.630 
recognizable not all
because<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:06.000> travels<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.990> certain<00:03:07.640> pathway

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
because it travels in a certain pathway

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.510 
because it travels in a certain pathway
it<00:03:08.700> follows<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.120> certain<00:03:09.530> topography<00:03:10.530> but

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
it follows a certain topography but

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.150 
it follows a certain topography but
because<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.720> has<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.530> certain<00:03:13.920> way<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.040> being

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
because it has a certain way of being

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.890 
because it has a certain way of being
inside<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> piece<00:03:15.270> which<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.720> something

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
inside of the piece which is something

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.200 
inside of the piece which is something
that<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.350> discovered<00:03:17.010> over<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.490> duration<00:03:17.940> of

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
that is discovered over a duration of

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.150 
that is discovered over a duration of
time<00:03:18.450> we<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.170> are<00:03:19.320> recreating<00:03:19.710> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
time we really are recreating the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.400 
time we really are recreating the
original<00:03:20.250> work<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.360> our<00:03:21.900> version

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
original work but it's it's our version

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.670 
original work but it's it's our version
of<00:03:22.710> it<00:03:22.890> which<00:03:23.130> was<00:03:23.940> really<00:03:23.970> hard<00:03:24.690> really

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
of it which was really hard really

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.550 
of it which was really hard really
challenging<00:03:26.220> but<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:27.110> really<00:03:28.110> inspiring

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
challenging but we really inspiring

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.720 
challenging but we really inspiring
we're<00:03:29.130> dealing<00:03:29.460> with<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.440> wider<00:03:32.130> spectrum

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
we're dealing with with a wider spectrum

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.890 
we're dealing with with a wider spectrum
of<00:03:34.010> different<00:03:35.010> kinds<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.490> moving<00:03:35.760> bodies<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
of different kinds of moving bodies the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.410 
of different kinds of moving bodies the
thing<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.290> think<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.770> really<00:03:38.730> wonderful

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
thing that I think was really wonderful

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.420 
thing that I think was really wonderful
and<00:03:39.840> mind-blowing<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.500> me<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.830> oh<00:03:41.010> actually

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
and mind-blowing to me is oh actually

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.280 
and mind-blowing to me is oh actually
