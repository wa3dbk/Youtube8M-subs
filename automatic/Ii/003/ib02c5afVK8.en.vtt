00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:15.669
 so love folks we'll have to bristle on the second instance still dating 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.039
 refunded from the 20 lost and we know that schnapps storms 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.070
 and also corresponded to AUD steadfast 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.640
 Mao tse-tung, however, he later in the fight to do so now have first 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.640
 the job is to blunder the schnapps killing him 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.860
 and yes he has some skills the first one can be seen here in the picture 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.990
 a warrior circuit with a red arrows on his head 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 and give up 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.410
 am running now holding Goody 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.880
 So it is always so Advantest jahn player marked and then storm 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.690
 the finke group pilot at the four podium naturalness to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 a natural from the complexion sources would have to 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.790
 and then of course be killed 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.780
 in otherwise distributed I believe that is also a star a gentleman c 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.330
 Liquid is distributed to a player 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.330
 in our case Prokop the Warlock 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.189
 then you can test one should test and Pia that was already everything 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.910
 what city Stuttgart and at 50% of liquor Schlunz stands out 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.030
 because the just on the left in the picture comes exclude that we have 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.910
 we go through our group 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.400
 who may perhaps forgive there because the damage look 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 At any rate, it is still relatively high at the moment 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.740
 and yes the Affected player you can see here now not so nice 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.690
 Examples 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.080
 the marked it should of course come as possible to the complexion then it is 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.130
 of course easier for me too 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.649
 to the left it out again and then snap hour saved 25 percent 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:42.490
 reached 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.770
 again, it was almost like 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.160
 It may be a bit busy but the evening is not that hard 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.540
 we are not even ready in the instance and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.690
 Ergo bad so too on toe 11 the raver no idea 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.620
 that was so Dr fight against Jorge Lorenzo 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.610
 and he sets dead right away, and then we still have 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.630
 the fight against jump Stephan fair in the course of the fight again and again 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.959
 visited 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.209
 and yes sobbing is dead there is no courage for now 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.670
 but St March, from afar, he lives here in front of me 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:20.929
 you run it 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.929
 can you could you went 10 o'clock as I said we are out of sight 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.049
 Boonen St 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.319
 we just keep on picking out the 2 4 smallest ones the trunk seen here 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.359
 starts 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.759
 Gudensberg makes an Arista forward similar to how the Warrior is a bit 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.389
 like the magician does not league 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:40.909
 the system is easy 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.940
 the field goes with halo Tablets also do not seek a word 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:49.389
 and how does that look anytime after the video service to a symbol of this 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.850
 that of the management of the office easy to see 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.619
 maybe you should be careful 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.349
 or I now just hang the boss 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.650
 Gentlemen of the group tankan tank here the mentioned whirlwind there 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.729
 of course running out 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.999
 and yes he has a player Peter 2 million because there we are very fast 

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.719
 now almost 50 percent soon 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.849
 and then that's no problem 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.149
 I'm back the Orco lost 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.399
 and yes that was so in the whole competition beyond Stefan Teipel remaining 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.859
 even a 50 was 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.019
 Of course, that should be enough for Cologne 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 or the screen should be easy dead 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.370
 um and then this is not a problem yes thank you for that 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.869
 watch and 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:37.659
 OM is the diocese Essen Boss or the next instance ever 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.019
 after this 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.129
 and yes 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.840
 I'm fun doing a good job
