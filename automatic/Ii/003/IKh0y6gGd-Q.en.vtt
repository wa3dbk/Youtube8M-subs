 the bus fleet 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.299
 as expected 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.999
 and I can not go on because I have the key 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.929
 in the middle of the euro 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.929

 the chance 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.520
 to the procedure already lost so many cards again 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.870
 so rehearse with fire

 for the hold there as LASK and does not work 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.129

 sum up like that 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.800
 therefore love too empty 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.389
 Of course, down there both "Focus" from Oelde must die 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.909
 and finally through the area 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.460
 to be rehabilitated 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.930
 but no Pegasus no one was worried 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.180
 perfect jump 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.180
 that he is clear 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.809
 the culprit blew up 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.050
 perfect jump 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.039

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.449
 only the 1 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.259
