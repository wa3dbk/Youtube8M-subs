 we see here at the back 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.019
 battery cover that you can screw open 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.350
 He also has two contact points so that 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.210
 you him 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.429
 yes just can charge in the charging station 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.319
 of course here goes the ring 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.090
 clip in which you can from top to bottom 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:15.130

 then you can put on your belt when we still have it 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.310
 take a look at the top 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.289
 find another headset port here 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210
 behind the door you seal rubber 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.889
 found here the antenna and find the 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.299
 on and off button and the volume button and 

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.299
 above that there is also an LED light 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.539
 now let's see how the tucker t80 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 extreme exactly works well of course you can 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.569
 You of course just have them here 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.459
 both are on on the same channel and 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.689
 same subcode channel 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:40.479
 well if we're just in one of those two 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.700
 devices speak hello hello well then 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.100
 we hear that it just works to ptt you 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.679
 button and you speak of course 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.149
 always one-way traffic 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.009
 There are some functions that these 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.359
 of course first of all has the display 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.369
 nor is it illuminated now because 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.959
 we are in the bright light but it 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.700
 display is therefore handy 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.319
 addition you can also call someone 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:06.849
 by means of the call does the pressure 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:09.220
 here and then you get a call then 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.780
 by on the other device if you are 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.520
 someone wants to wake up for a while 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.910
 shake have a mother monitoring ' 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.230
 test 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.239
 so you can 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.099
 instantly without filtering everything 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.080
 monitor what's on this channel in this one 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.390
 this kind of code channel takes place such that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.390
 you then press how a lock 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.230
 well if you impress him longer than you stay 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.170
 he on the monitoring 'section 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.489
 we have a selection button here 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.319
 you can do it with the selection button 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.470
 determine the main channel and the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.370
 subcode channel are 128 sipko the channels 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.500
 who can determine 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.640
 so yes you can also according to that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.230
 use 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.060
 go to the menu menu consists of the 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.519
 scan function allowing all channels 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.709
 main channels goes through scanning we find 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.239
 a function to two channels 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.950
 so the technician has two at the same time 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 channels and subchannels at the same time 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.209
 monitor well then you can say the 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.829
 yes if something comes in on one of them 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.200
 those two channels then you hear alone 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.879
 we find another channel itself 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.410
 see foxwing so you can get hands-free 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.269
 start talking and then it goes 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.579
 automatic transmit to find another one 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.959
 baby monitor function and fame function it 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.620
 number that is above this is the 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.660
 sensitivity 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.250
 so at what sensitivity he already 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.319
 transmission is going to do so you can do this 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.540
 set also use as a baby monitor type one 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.700
 baby monitor function finds the tone 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.459
 the call tone that you can adjust 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.290
 silent is just saying he is off you 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.700
 can then also select and then you can 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.489
 say that it must go completely out 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.859
 they are in select moment that he must 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:35.500
 are to be for a semi another 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:37.239
 time function where in that time can hurt 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.980
 can set and power function 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.859
 in this power function cockpit, for example, 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.120
 indicate that at 3 o'clock example 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.829
 in three years it should be automatic 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.630
 assume the unit is about three 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.480
 automatically off and so not 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.310
 receive more or send something further 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.959
 so that yes a handy feature for sure 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.910
