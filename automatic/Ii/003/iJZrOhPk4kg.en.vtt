of the home is extremely well insulated
it's<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.799> built<00:01:56.310> incredibly<00:01:57.060> tight<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
it's also built incredibly tight so that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's also built incredibly tight so that
we<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.320> have<00:01:58.619> unwanted<00:01:59.130> air<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> leakage

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
we don't have unwanted air of leakage

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
we don't have unwanted air of leakage
into<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> house<00:02:00.689> so<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.649> nice<00:02:01.920> thermal
