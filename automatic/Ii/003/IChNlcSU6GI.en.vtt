they went to the 3 for 8 they made a

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.610 
they went to the 3 for 8 they made a
longitudinal<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.519> have<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:52.230> engine<00:02:52.500> up

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
longitudinal so you have the engine up

the<00:03:47.099> shocking<00:03:47.430> concept<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:49.380> have<00:03:49.470> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
the shocking concept is that you have to

the shocking concept is that you have to
drop<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.830> engine<00:03:50.099> every<00:03:50.489> three<00:03:50.730> years<00:03:50.900> you

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
drop the engine every three years you

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.660 
drop the engine every three years you
take<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.410> Ferrari<00:03:52.709> dealer<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.250> do<00:03:53.400> that

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
take it to the Ferrari dealer to do that

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.699 
take it to the Ferrari dealer to do that
it's<00:03:53.970> going<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.270> cost<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.810> four<00:03:55.500> or<00:03:55.560> five

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
it's going to cost you four or five

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.930 
it's going to cost you four or five
thousand<00:03:56.250> dollars<00:03:56.580> maybe<00:04:01.069> the<00:04:02.069> good<00:04:02.370> news<00:04:02.640> is

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
thousand dollars maybe the good news is

if you're handy with tools it's actually

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.220 
if you're handy with tools it's actually
not<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.400> particularly<00:04:05.970> difficult<00:04:06.300> job<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.050> do

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.940 

the<00:04:10.370> engine<00:04:11.370> sits<00:04:11.910> in<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.709> framework<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.950> the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
the engine sits in a framework and the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.729 
the engine sits in a framework and the
whole<00:04:17.190> thing<00:04:17.489> drops<00:04:17.970> down<00:04:18.419> out<00:04:18.810> at<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:19.470> bottom

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
whole thing drops down out at the bottom

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.770 
whole thing drops down out at the bottom
of<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.889> car<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.120> not<00:04:21.209> like<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.570> have<00:04:21.750> to

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
of the car so it's not like you have to

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.210 
of the car so it's not like you have to
disconnect<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.650> engine<00:04:23.040> from<00:04:23.160> the

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
disconnect the engine from the

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.860 
disconnect the engine from the
transmission<00:04:23.790> and<00:04:24.419> all<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.750> kind<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.020> stuff

transmission and all that kind of stuff

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.260 
transmission and all that kind of stuff
basically<00:04:27.870> there's<00:04:28.320> 12<00:04:28.860> bolts<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.940> hold<00:04:30.150> the

the whole thing drops out I'm not saying

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.420 
the whole thing drops out I'm not saying
it's<00:04:51.960> the<00:04:52.050> world's<00:04:52.470> easiest<00:04:52.590> thing<00:04:52.919> to<00:04:53.039> do<00:04:53.190> but

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
it's the world's easiest thing to do but

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.029 
it's the world's easiest thing to do but
it<00:04:53.700> actually<00:04:54.180> can<00:04:54.360> be<00:04:54.390> done<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:55.020> it's<00:04:55.320> not

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
it actually can be done and it's not

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.279 
it actually can be done and it's not
horribly<00:04:56.370> difficult<00:04:56.840> if<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.930> look<00:04:58.080> at<00:04:58.169> my

of<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.590> reasons<00:06:27.830> I<00:06:27.889> bought<00:06:28.039> a<00:06:28.099> three<00:06:28.370> four

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 
of the reasons I bought a three four

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.010 
of the reasons I bought a three four
eight<00:06:28.820> is<00:06:29.060> I<00:06:29.979> considered<00:06:30.979> it<00:06:31.130> probably<00:06:31.759> the

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
eight is I considered it probably the

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:37.270 
eight is I considered it probably the
latest<00:06:34.720> Ferrari<00:06:35.720> that<00:06:36.110> still<00:06:36.710> was<00:06:36.889> pretty

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
latest Ferrari that still was pretty

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.960 
latest Ferrari that still was pretty
simple<00:06:37.880> mechanically<00:06:38.780> to<00:06:39.020> work<00:06:39.199> on<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.970> so

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970 
simple mechanically to work on and so

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.659 
simple mechanically to work on and so
far<00:06:41.180> I<00:06:41.210> found<00:06:41.509> it<00:06:41.599> to<00:06:41.690> be<00:06:41.720> that<00:06:42.310> that<00:06:43.310> being

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:43.669 
far I found it to be that that being

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.700 
far I found it to be that that being
said<00:06:44.030> I<00:06:44.479> have<00:06:44.690> never<00:06:44.900> worked<00:06:45.139> on<00:06:45.259> a<00:06:45.319> three<00:06:45.530> five

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
said I have never worked on a three five

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.730 
said I have never worked on a three five
five<00:06:45.889> so<00:06:46.099> they<00:06:46.220> may<00:06:46.370> be<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.580> a<00:06:47.289> piece<00:06:48.289> of<00:06:48.470> cake<00:06:48.620> to

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
five so they may be a a piece of cake to

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.409 
five so they may be a a piece of cake to
work<00:06:48.949> on<00:06:49.159> but<00:06:50.650> all<00:06:51.650> those<00:06:52.370> additional<00:06:53.180> power

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:53.419 
work on but all those additional power

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:55.300 
work on but all those additional power
things<00:06:53.870> to<00:06:54.320> me<00:06:54.470> are<00:06:54.650> just<00:06:54.860> something<00:06:55.009> else<00:06:55.250> to

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
things to me are just something else to

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.710 
things to me are just something else to
go<00:06:55.430> wrong<00:06:57.789> there<00:06:58.789> are<00:06:59.030> problems<00:06:59.449> with<00:06:59.539> three

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 
prone to corrosion there is something

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.420 
prone to corrosion there is something
called<00:07:08.509> a<00:07:08.659> gold<00:07:08.930> kit<00:07:09.199> that<00:07:09.409> you<00:07:09.440> can<00:07:09.680> buy<00:07:09.740> to

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
called a gold kit that you can buy to

replace your plugs I've done that to my

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.159 
replace your plugs I've done that to my
car<00:07:15.680> and<00:07:16.039> just<00:07:16.550> as<00:07:16.969> an<00:07:17.150> example<00:07:17.479> here's<00:07:17.870> one<00:07:18.050> of

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169 
car and just as an example here's one of

the<00:07:19.060> plugs<00:07:20.060> and<00:07:20.889> you<00:07:21.889> probably<00:07:22.070> can't<00:07:22.340> see

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
the plugs and you probably can't see

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.180 
the plugs and you probably can't see
this<00:07:22.729> but<00:07:23.030> you<00:07:23.389> can<00:07:23.539> actually<00:07:24.530> a<00:07:24.560> little<00:07:24.770> gold

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190 
this but you can actually a little gold

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.899 
this but you can actually a little gold
tinge<00:07:25.580> to<00:07:25.909> all<00:07:26.030> those<00:07:26.210> little<00:07:26.300> pins<00:07:26.719> in<00:07:26.930> there

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:27.909 
tinge to all those little pins in there

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:32.890 
tinge to all those little pins in there
it<00:07:28.909> is<00:07:29.630> not<00:07:30.169> a<00:07:30.949> quick<00:07:31.520> and<00:07:31.699> easy<00:07:31.969> thing<00:07:32.300> to<00:07:32.360> do

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:32.900 
it is not a quick and easy thing to do

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.589 
it is not a quick and easy thing to do
but<00:07:33.500> it<00:07:34.460> definitely<00:07:34.669> makes<00:07:35.090> it<00:07:35.240> a<00:07:35.360> more

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 
but it definitely makes it a more
