adapter I I bought one with tp-link
Tom's<00:02:52.060> before<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.540> had<00:02:52.720> quite<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.959> few

Tom's before and I had quite a few

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.199 
Tom's before and I had quite a few
problems<00:02:53.230> with<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.579> was<00:02:54.760> due<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> bad

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
problems with it but that was due to bad

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.000 
problems with it but that was due to bad
signal<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.349> bought<00:02:56.620> one<00:02:56.769> with<00:02:56.889> the

signal and so I bought one with the

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.949 
signal and so I bought one with the
unter<00:02:57.310> neuron<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.639> it<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.879> hopefully<00:02:58.540> will

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
unter neuron in it that hopefully will

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.199

I'm kind of hoping that 800 will be
enough<00:04:21.340> if<00:04:21.669> I<00:04:21.880> want<00:04:22.090> crossfire<00:04:22.630> there<00:04:22.930> since

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
enough if I want crossfire there since

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.950 
enough if I want crossfire there since
my<00:04:24.070> 50s<00:04:24.610> but<00:04:24.849> I<00:04:24.880> think<00:04:25.090> one<00:04:25.270> alone<00:04:25.539> should<00:04:25.870> be

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
my 50s but I think one alone should be

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.030 
my 50s but I think one alone should be
pretty<00:04:26.229> huge

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
pretty huge

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.570 
pretty huge
for<00:04:27.220> now<00:04:27.310> when<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.640> comes<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:29.380> know<00:04:29.550> what<00:04:30.550> I

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
for now when it comes to you know what I

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.400 
for now when it comes to you know what I
want<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.940> do<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:34.660> know<00:04:34.750> smoke<00:04:34.990> damage<00:04:35.230> on<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
want to do you know smoke damage on the

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.010 
want to do you know smoke damage on the
Box<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:36.300> motherboard<00:04:38.850> now<00:04:39.850> this<00:04:40.060> came

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
Box the motherboard now this came

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.640 
Box the motherboard now this came
recommended<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:42.100> me<00:04:42.250> a<00:04:42.550> friend<00:04:42.970> who<00:04:43.470> has<00:04:44.470> the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
recommended to me a friend who has the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.330 
recommended to me a friend who has the
same<00:04:44.860> processor<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:46.570> it's<00:04:46.780> got<00:04:46.990> quite<00:04:47.920> a<00:04:48.040> few

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
same processor and it's got quite a few

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.900 
same processor and it's got quite a few
good<00:04:48.550> things<00:04:48.820> firstly<00:04:49.300> it's<00:04:49.750> got<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.990> PC<00:04:50.290> i3

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
good things firstly it's got the PC i3

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.640 
good things firstly it's got the PC i3
which<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.360> next<00:04:52.540> generation<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.620> don't

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
which is the next generation I don't

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.830 
which is the next generation I don't
know<00:04:53.830> what's<00:04:54.040> going<00:04:54.340> on<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.550> there<00:04:54.730> unless<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
know what's going on in there unless the

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.130 
know what's going on in there unless the
next<00:04:55.930> generation<00:04:56.500> of<00:04:56.640> chipset<00:04:57.640> basically<00:04:58.140> so

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
next generation of chipset basically so

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.520 
next generation of chipset basically so
it's<00:04:59.590> got<00:04:59.830> the<00:05:00.190> USB<00:05:00.460> 3<00:05:00.970> which<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.600> obviously<00:05:02.440> a

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
it's got the USB 3 which is obviously a

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.960 
it's got the USB 3 which is obviously a
lot<00:05:02.650> less<00:05:02.860> than<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.070> USB<00:05:03.250> 2<00:05:03.840> it's<00:05:04.840> got<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.970> its

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
lot less than the USB 2 it's got the its

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.750 
lot less than the USB 2 it's got the its
ports<00:05:07.450> since<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.290> intel's<00:05:08.890> integrated

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
ports since it intel's integrated

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.370 
ports since it intel's integrated
graphics<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.890> does<00:05:12.070> it<00:05:12.310> turns<00:05:12.790> off<00:05:13.060> your

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
graphics so it does it turns off your

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.260 
graphics so it does it turns off your
dedicated<00:05:14.380> GPU<00:05:14.950> when<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:15.610> not<00:05:15.730> needed<00:05:15.880> and

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
dedicated GPU when it's not needed and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.300 
dedicated GPU when it's not needed and
that<00:05:16.300> also<00:05:17.050> apparently<00:05:17.740> improves<00:05:18.190> your

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
that also apparently improves your

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.900 
that also apparently improves your
performance<00:05:18.430> somehow<00:05:20.010> the<00:05:21.010> Intel<00:05:21.580> Smart

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
performance somehow the Intel Smart

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.440 
performance somehow the Intel Smart
Response<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.870> lets<00:05:23.500> use<00:05:23.830> like<00:05:24.040> an<00:05:24.190> SSD<00:05:24.580> as<00:05:25.390> a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
Response that lets use like an SSD as a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.760 
Response that lets use like an SSD as a
cache<00:05:25.810> for<00:05:26.200> your<00:05:27.480> hard<00:05:28.480> drive<00:05:28.750> service<00:05:29.500> it

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
cache for your hard drive service it

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.250 
cache for your hard drive service it
turns<00:05:30.070> your<00:05:30.190> hard<00:05:30.400> drive<00:05:30.640> into<00:05:30.880> an<00:05:31.090> SSD<00:05:31.450> so

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
turns your hard drive into an SSD so

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.930 
turns your hard drive into an SSD so
it's<00:05:32.350> a<00:05:32.380> bit<00:05:32.500> cheaper<00:05:32.800> way<00:05:33.010> of<00:05:33.070> doing<00:05:33.340> it<00:05:33.490> it's

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
it's a bit cheaper way of doing it it's

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.880 
it's a bit cheaper way of doing it it's
not<00:05:34.120> like<00:05:34.480> a<00:05:34.510> full<00:05:34.810> SSD<00:05:35.290> but<00:05:35.470> it'll<00:05:35.620> be<00:05:35.680> pretty

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
not like a full SSD but it'll be pretty

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.070 
not like a full SSD but it'll be pretty
fast<00:05:36.250> be<00:05:37.180> not<00:05:37.330> my<00:05:37.480> hard<00:05:37.690> drive<00:05:37.900> will<00:05:38.050> be

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
fast be not my hard drive will be

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.830 
fast be not my hard drive will be
hopefully<00:05:38.920> good<00:05:39.070> enough<00:05:39.250> as<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.520> is<00:05:39.840> that

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
hopefully good enough as it is that

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.930 
hopefully good enough as it is that
tells<00:05:41.200> you<00:05:41.290> all<00:05:41.320> about<00:05:41.410> certain<00:05:41.980> or<00:05:42.070> caste<00:05:42.310> and

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
tells you all about certain or caste and

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.710 
tells you all about certain or caste and
then<00:05:43.650> extra<00:05:44.650> fast<00:05:44.920> learn<00:05:45.520> yeah<00:05:46.420> well<00:05:46.540> they<00:05:46.630> all

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
then extra fast learn yeah well they all

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.900 
then extra fast learn yeah well they all
say<00:05:46.930> that<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.200> never<00:05:47.410> really<00:05:47.650> know

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
say that you never really know

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.420 
say that you never really know
apparently<00:05:48.910> it's<00:05:49.030> got<00:05:49.120> gold<00:05:49.450> caps<00:05:50.400> again<00:05:51.400> I

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
apparently it's got gold caps again I

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.530 
apparently it's got gold caps again I
don't<00:05:51.580> care<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:53.320> a<00:05:53.910> reasonably<00:05:54.910> good<00:05:54.940> sound

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
don't care and a reasonably good sound

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.700 
don't care and a reasonably good sound
experience<00:05:56.440> I'll<00:05:56.740> be<00:05:56.980> getting<00:05:57.280> my<00:05:57.690> speakers

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
experience I'll be getting my speakers

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
experience I'll be getting my speakers
probably<00:05:59.710> tomorrow<00:05:59.980> or<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.310> day<00:06:00.430> after<00:06:00.460> I

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:00.730 
probably tomorrow or the day after I

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.600 
probably tomorrow or the day after I
ordered<00:06:01.090> them<00:06:01.210> late<00:06:01.750> as<00:06:01.900> well<00:06:02.080> I<00:06:02.320> do<00:06:03.190> actually

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
ordered them late as well I do actually

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.460 
ordered them late as well I do actually
have<00:06:03.730> some<00:06:04.030> built<00:06:04.240> into<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.630> back<00:06:04.780> or<00:06:04.960> monitor

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
have some built into the back or monitor

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.530 
have some built into the back or monitor
but<00:06:05.830> they're<00:06:05.980> free<00:06:06.460> awful<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:09.360> I'm<00:06:10.360> gonna

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
but they're free awful so I'm gonna

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.890 
but they're free awful so I'm gonna
start<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.470> build<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:12.450> probably<00:06:13.450> very<00:06:13.600> video

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
start the build and probably very video

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.110 
start the build and probably very video
while<00:06:14.200> I'm<00:06:14.410> doing<00:06:14.650> it

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
while I'm doing it

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.610 
while I'm doing it
once<00:06:16.120> I've<00:06:16.210> got<00:06:16.240> not<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.810> lot<00:06:16.960> of<00:06:17.050> idea<00:06:17.380> of<00:06:17.440> how

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
once I've got not a lot of idea of how

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.250 
once I've got not a lot of idea of how
long<00:06:17.800> this<00:06:17.950> is<00:06:17.980> gonna<00:06:18.160> take<00:06:18.280> me<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:20.050> I<00:06:20.080> guess

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
long this is gonna take me so I guess

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.450 
long this is gonna take me so I guess
we'll<00:06:20.410> just<00:06:20.440> see<00:06:20.860> how<00:06:20.980> I<00:06:21.010> go<00:06:22.080> okay<00:06:23.280> I'm<00:06:24.280> gonna

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
we'll just see how I go okay I'm gonna

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.850 
we'll just see how I go okay I'm gonna
split<00:06:25.300> this<00:06:25.420> up<00:06:25.600> into<00:06:25.750> two<00:06:25.990> different<00:06:26.320> videos

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
split this up into two different videos

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.280 
split this up into two different videos
obviously<00:06:26.980> YouTube's<00:06:27.520> not<00:06:27.640> gonna<00:06:27.850> let<00:06:27.970> me

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
obviously YouTube's not gonna let me

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.440 
obviously YouTube's not gonna let me
upload<00:06:29.290> really<00:06:29.890> long<00:06:30.070> videos<00:06:30.790> and<00:06:31.090> also

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 
upload really long videos and also

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.510 
upload really long videos and also
people<00:06:31.780> get<00:06:31.900> bored<00:06:32.110> when<00:06:32.260> it's<00:06:32.410> like<00:06:33.600> long

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
people get bored when it's like long

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.999 
people get bored when it's like long

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:46.100
