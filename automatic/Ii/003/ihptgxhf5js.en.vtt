00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
the last one oh I think in a somewhat

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.470 
the last one oh I think in a somewhat
I'm<00:06:36.710> like<00:06:36.830> that<00:06:37.010> we<00:06:37.160> was<00:06:37.310> a<00:06:37.340> working<00:06:38.180> on<00:06:38.270> past

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:38.480 
I'm like that we was a working on past

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.880 
I'm like that we was a working on past
history<00:06:38.630> isn't<00:06:38.990> that<00:06:39.140> probably<00:06:39.410> got<00:06:39.560> you<00:06:39.710> want

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
history isn't that probably got you want

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.290 
history isn't that probably got you want
around<00:06:40.130> the<00:06:40.220> edge<00:06:40.370> of<00:06:40.520> something<00:06:40.670> yeah<00:06:40.970> at<00:06:41.210> me

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
around the edge of something yeah at me

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.850 
around the edge of something yeah at me
so<00:06:41.510> there<00:06:42.170> I<00:06:42.200> think<00:06:42.440> I<00:06:42.500> brought<00:06:42.710> it<00:06:42.860> out<00:06:42.950> then
