I started the journey in Egypt where I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.899 
I started the journey in Egypt where I
studied<00:01:12.030> medicine<00:01:12.619> but<00:01:13.619> immediately<00:01:14.340> after

studied medicine but immediately after

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.570 
studied medicine but immediately after
that<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.450> came<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.649> United<00:01:16.890> Kingdom

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
that I came to the United Kingdom

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.990 
that I came to the United Kingdom
because<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.420> was<00:01:18.630> convinced<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
because I was convinced that that is the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.190 
because I was convinced that that is the
place<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.509> wanted<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.049> practice<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:25.549> I<00:01:27.200> liked

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
place I wanted to practice in I liked

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.969 
place I wanted to practice in I liked
very<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.869> system<00:01:31.289> of<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.590> National

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
very much the system of the National

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.010 
very much the system of the National
Health<00:01:32.280> Service<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.110> was

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
Health Service because it was

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.670 
Health Service because it was
egalitarian

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
egalitarian

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.090 
egalitarian
do<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:39.280> strive<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:40.750> giving<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.290> best<00:01:41.470> for

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
do you strive for giving the best for

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.230 
do you strive for giving the best for
everybody

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
everybody

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.400 
everybody
and<00:01:43.450> I<00:01:43.780> think<00:01:43.990> that's<00:01:44.230> really<00:01:45.360> important

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
and I think that's really important

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.880 
and I think that's really important
it<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.510> model<00:01:49.510> for<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.140> rest<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> world

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
it is a model for the rest of the world

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.750 
it is a model for the rest of the world
to<00:01:51.280> follow<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:53.070> think<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.220> National<00:01:54.580> Health

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
to follow I think the National Health

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.990 
to follow I think the National Health
Service<00:01:55.140> speaks<00:01:56.140> loads<00:01:56.470> about<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.400> character

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
Service speaks loads about the character

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.350 
Service speaks loads about the character
of<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.840> pitch<00:01:59.080> people<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.700> National<00:02:01.090> Health

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
of the pitch people the National Health

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.340 
of the pitch people the National Health
Service<00:02:02.170> provides<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:03.010> very<00:02:03.220> good<00:02:03.370> model<00:02:03.850> for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Service provides a very good model for

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.630 
Service provides a very good model for
making<00:02:05.350> health<00:02:06.100> care<00:02:06.390> at<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.750> highest<00:02:07.960> level

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
making health care at the highest level

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:17.100 
making health care at the highest level
achievable<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.929> those<00:02:11.200> who<00:02:12.130> need<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.930> are

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
achievable for those who need it we are

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.360 
achievable for those who need it we are
sitting<00:02:17.709> now<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:19.390> Magda<00:02:19.780> Yahoo<00:02:20.370> Institute

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
sitting now in the Magda Yahoo Institute

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.880 
sitting now in the Magda Yahoo Institute
we<00:02:21.790> collect<00:02:22.360> money<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:23.500> support<00:02:23.740> research

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
we collect money to support research

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.370 
we collect money to support research
while<00:02:26.890> medical<00:02:27.730> practice<00:02:28.209> obviously<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.050> very

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
while medical practice obviously is very

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.960 
while medical practice obviously is very
very<00:02:29.650> important<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.550> feel<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.420> research<00:02:32.230> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
very important I feel that research and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.600 
very important I feel that research and
innovation<00:02:33.970> has<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.780> be<00:02:34.959> number<00:02:35.620> one<00:02:35.830> priority

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
innovation has to be number one priority

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.410 
innovation has to be number one priority
if<00:02:37.209> our<00:02:37.890> predecessors<00:02:38.890> were<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:39.610> researching

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
if our predecessors were not researching

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.750 
if our predecessors were not researching
like<00:02:41.140> math<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.830> wouldn't<00:02:42.160> be<00:02:42.280> here<00:02:42.459> and

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
like math we wouldn't be here and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.720 
like math we wouldn't be here and
therefore<00:02:43.600> we<00:02:44.019> have<00:02:44.230> to<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.739> same<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.489> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
therefore we have to do the same for the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.140 
therefore we have to do the same for the
next<00:02:46.030> generations<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.459> all<00:02:48.760> this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
next generations we have all this

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.550 
next generations we have all this
equipment<00:02:50.070> plus<00:02:51.070> all<00:02:51.610> these<00:02:52.060> young<00:02:52.360> people

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
equipment plus all these young people

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.900 
equipment plus all these young people
with<00:02:53.560> fresh<00:02:53.890> young<00:02:54.190> minds

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
with fresh young minds

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.050 
with fresh young minds
very<00:02:56.540> keen<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.170> work<00:02:57.320> together<00:02:57.590> and<00:02:58.550> so<00:02:58.850> he's

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
very keen to work together and so he's

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.590 
very keen to work together and so he's
working<00:02:59.510> on<00:02:59.690> stem<00:03:00.050> cells<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.820> how<00:03:01.820> they<00:03:02.390> are

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
working on stem cells and how they are

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.040 
working on stem cells and how they are
moving<00:03:02.900> towards<00:03:03.740> heart<00:03:04.550> cells<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.720> can't

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
moving towards heart cells so you can't

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.930 
moving towards heart cells so you can't
be<00:03:06.590> more<00:03:07.120> cutting-edge<00:03:08.120> than<00:03:08.150> down<00:03:08.920> Britain

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
be more cutting-edge than down Britain

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.570 
be more cutting-edge than down Britain
has<00:03:10.940> contributed<00:03:11.600> to<00:03:12.230> medical<00:03:12.710> science<00:03:12.950> and

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
has contributed to medical science and

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.430 
has contributed to medical science and
practice<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.570> lot<00:03:15.560> more<00:03:16.570> than<00:03:17.570> its<00:03:17.780> science

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
practice a lot more than its science

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.070 
practice a lot more than its science
I<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:20.180> the<00:03:20.390> intellectual<00:03:20.900> atmosphere

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
I like the intellectual atmosphere

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.390 
I like the intellectual atmosphere
because<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.490> Britain<00:03:23.320> maybe<00:03:24.320> more<00:03:24.710> than<00:03:25.070> other

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
because in Britain maybe more than other
