 pit full of water right off the
corner<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.350> here<00:02:07.489> we're<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.519> splash<00:02:09.179> in

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.960 

sailing<00:02:34.129> was<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.610> should<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:34.940> it

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
sailing was like this should do it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.630 
sailing was like this should do it
forever<00:02:35.739> not<00:02:36.739> every<00:02:36.950> day<00:02:36.980> is<00:02:37.099> like<00:02:37.250> this

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
forever not every day is like this

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.520 
forever not every day is like this
sometimes<00:02:38.420> they're<00:02:38.599> a<00:02:38.629> lot<00:02:38.720> more<00:02:38.780> frustrating

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
