00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Welcome from London The LG goes three 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.980
 mobile phone and the LG G2 the predecessor 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.260
 both very nice devices 1 52 witnesses 55 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.389
 inch screen you can see that 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.519
 nevertheless it did not succeed here 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.650
 getting bigger is always both 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.619
 can overlap clearly 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.289
 see that it lg g2 not much smaller 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.369
 is like the g3 and she is quite 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.199
 an upgrade is worthwhile because we have 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 really not just more screen size 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.949
 but also much more pixels 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.660
 because full hd vs ktg is not only 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 twice as many pixels but four times 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 so many pixels with 538 pixels per inch 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.960
 very nice then on the back two 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.260
 wonderful as with megapixel cameras 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160
 optical autofocus optical 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.320
 image stabilizer in there but we have 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 even a laser sensor inside the open 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 autofocus even faster then and ensures 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.579
 Two lights still offer up the picture in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930
 low light against a flash at the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.670
 back and a little bit changed 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.989
 also what that was because here was 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.579
 Metal used instead of plastic and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.899
 wrap even decrease and the three 1000 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.600
 exchange milliampere customers 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.710
 and we have micro sd memory 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.000
 Extension possibility what you at the g2 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700
 unfortunately did not have 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.159
 Nevertheless, the other two the possibility 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.189
 of course with the dual lures here 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.790
 Wake up very quickly both 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.600
 stepping against night watch out for 1 processor 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.600
 kidnapper two installed 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.460
 so could see speed at 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.590
 but take a completely new 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.930
 surface here with a new flat 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.040
 design so to speak at the g3 chance shortly 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.890
 the cameras where you two of course 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.460
 as I said the 13er would have pixel 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.050
 but the autofocus would just have a lot 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:44.140
 be faster with the g3 two of these 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.490
 still looks very good so there 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.480
 she can not complain 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.280
 I'll work on it shortly and there we can 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.920
 see here that the quality view 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 has definitely improved from 720p up 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.870
 full hd is our 2.1 megapixel the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.760
 really much more beautiful but of 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.400
 the picture is a good fit or too 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.630
 more pure in that goes in and that 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.600
 water already with the very short one 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.950
 Comparison here of the two devices 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.479
 infrared of course, both continue here 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.470
 in it 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.600
 Thick, they are actually similar 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.060
 so that would be great on everyone 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.610
 of course, the new pick 95 but 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 euro for 16gb with expandable 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.560
 store yourself via micro sd too 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.530
 interchangeable markus of course very 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.850
 practically opposite the gt2 window up 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.180
 next time and it will be the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.180
 to take harm
