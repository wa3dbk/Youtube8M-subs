the hospital for rehabilitation and
stuff<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.920> when<00:01:38.340> he<00:01:38.490> gets<00:01:38.579> out<00:01:38.790> basically<00:01:39.509> our

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
stuff so when he gets out basically our

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.060 
stuff so when he gets out basically our
whole<00:01:39.630> life<00:01:40.250> lifestyle<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.579> gonna<00:01:41.820> change<00:01:42.180> and

whole life lifestyle is gonna change and
he<00:01:44.070> has<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.310> stay<00:01:44.520> away<00:01:44.729> from<00:01:44.759> salt<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> sodium

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.480 
he has to stay away from salt and sodium
so<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> thought<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.860> would<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.070> kind<00:01:47.430> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so I thought that this would be kind of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.789 
so I thought that this would be kind of
a<00:01:47.579> nice<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:48.119> hopefully<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.140> tastes<00:01:49.619> about

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
a nice thing hopefully it tastes about

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
familiar in my mind so I think it's a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.729 
familiar in my mind so I think it's a
good<00:02:44.610> name<00:02:44.820> brand<00:02:45.180> but<00:02:45.630> anyhow<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.440> got

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
good name brand but anyhow I just got

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.080 
good name brand but anyhow I just got
the<00:02:46.920> Marie<00:02:47.100> Callender<00:02:47.610> all-natural

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
the Marie Callender all-natural

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.229 
the Marie Callender all-natural
chocolate<00:02:48.959> fudge<00:02:49.320> brownie<00:02:49.830> mix<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:51.030> got

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
chocolate fudge brownie mix and it's got

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.220 
chocolate fudge brownie mix and it's got
no<00:02:51.600> trans<00:02:51.959> fat<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.680> apparently<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.230> sodium

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
no trans fat in it apparently and sodium

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.470 
no trans fat in it apparently and sodium
it's<00:02:55.410> extremely<00:02:56.370> high<00:02:56.550> but<00:02:56.940> that'll<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.239> okay

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
it's extremely high but that'll be okay

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.910 
it's extremely high but that'll be okay
because<00:02:57.660> these<00:02:57.810> will<00:02:57.959> probably<00:02:58.350> be<00:02:58.440> all<00:02:58.650> gone

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
because these will probably be all gone
