tango<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.840> here<00:02:18.019> we<00:02:18.170> are<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.440> both<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.620> us

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
tango so here we are the both of us

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.490 
tango so here we are the both of us
fighting<00:02:19.280> what<00:02:19.550> seems<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.880> be<00:02:19.970> two<00:02:20.269> fish<00:02:20.569> and

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
fighting what seems to be two fish and

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.100 
fighting what seems to be two fish and
these<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.830> was<00:02:21.950> thought<00:02:22.810> when<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> fish

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
these that was thought when the fish

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.410 
these that was thought when the fish
gets<00:02:24.380> closer<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.760> actually<00:02:25.940> see<00:02:26.299> that

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
gets closer you can actually see that

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.100 
gets closer you can actually see that
both<00:02:26.630> are<00:02:26.810> lines<00:02:26.989> across<00:02:28.480> at<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.630> moment<00:02:29.840> on

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
both are lines across at this moment on

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.530 
both are lines across at this moment on
once<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:30.709> knew<00:02:30.920> were<00:02:31.069> tangled<00:02:31.370> my<00:02:32.120> dad<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.480> I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.970 
once we knew were tangled my dad and I
put<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> bet<00:02:33.019> on<00:02:33.049> to<00:02:33.260> see<00:02:33.440> who<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.709> one<00:02:33.860> who

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
put a bet on to see who the one who

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.360 
put a bet on to see who the one who
actually<00:02:34.160> had<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.640> fish<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.420> their<00:02:35.720> line

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.449 

see<00:02:41.880> here<00:02:42.090> were<00:02:42.180> both<00:02:42.420> fighting<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.870> fish<00:02:43.459> I'm

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
see here were both fighting the fish I'm

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.010 
see here were both fighting the fish I'm
having<00:02:44.880> trouble<00:02:45.180> reading<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> in<00:02:45.660> because

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
having trouble reading it in because

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.550 
having trouble reading it in because
what<00:02:46.230> lines<00:02:46.410> are<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.709> tangled<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.880> his<00:02:48.150> cook

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
what lines are so tangled that his cook

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.510 
what lines are so tangled that his cook
eventually<00:02:49.560> actually<00:02:49.680> comes<00:02:50.099> all<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.400> way<00:02:50.430> up

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
eventually actually comes all the way up

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.350 
eventually actually comes all the way up
to<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:50.970> rod<00:02:51.780> tip<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:53.069> just<00:02:53.670> makes<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:53.970> for<00:02:54.150> our

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
to my rod tip and just makes it for our

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.589 
to my rod tip and just makes it for our
cattle<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:56.090> know<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.300> all<00:02:57.390> are<00:02:57.420> probably

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
cattle I know you all are probably

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.120 
cattle I know you all are probably
wondering<00:02:57.989> why<00:02:58.319> we<00:02:58.349> didn't<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.800> cut<00:02:59.010> his

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
wondering why we didn't just cut his
