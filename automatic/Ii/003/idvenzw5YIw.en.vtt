00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.999
 this is our first mobile game 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.659
 exclusively for the platform with a wide effort 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.329

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:36.309
 what's new tell new very 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.519
 a lot actually gru we launched already 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.559
 a month ago that is May 5 launched it in 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.600
 Scandinavian countries as soft lunch 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.590
 Rega showed with a very good side 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.719
 we reached the top 3 on the iPad chart in all 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.140
 Soviet countries got a lot 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.039
 positive feedback for example in games to 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.920
 we have a very nice about 70 minutes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.749
 every player spends in battle it's pretty 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.549
 serious indicator and this indicator 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:09.520
 growing yesterday literally we announced a date 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.590
 release exclusively on ps under the form for 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.420
 Appstore and this June 26 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.700
 the game will be available globally 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.490
 including in russia left and with different 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.020
 localization so my hope that as a 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.649
 in Scandinavia all over the world 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:27.009
 the game will cause a lot of interest such a question 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.570
 what are you connected with about what country choice for 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:32.670
 initial test run 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.490
 the reason is generally quite simple this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920
 the proximity of the Scandinavian countries to ours 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.939
 Minsk office so the team 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.840
 development 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.329
 command server is easier to work 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.439
 easier fixes bugs and easier to respond to 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.780
 some problems in the game 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.670
 well, plus we wanted to test the game 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 in several different countries a bit with 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.539
 different mentality but with a similar 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.209
 culture 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.500
 try different localization and 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.939
 use the European server inside 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.170
 the results show that we are not 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.229
 progadali and of course as one of 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.079
 here points we wanted to prepare a game 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.599
 for other regions 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.610
 as good as possible all 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.510
 fully provide close all bugs 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.470
 to the gameplay and all the playability was 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.099
 at the highest level 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.930
 great i hope you do it 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.030
 let's see what they see 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.250
 users in this project 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.040
 actually on june 26 each of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.250
 users can see more than 90 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.310
 tanks of three main nations is the us 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.700
 Germany and the Soviet Union 4 main 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.080
 class light and medium heavy tanks and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.790
 this is sau respectively a tank tree in 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.640
 whole something similar to the fact that something is well 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.610
 there are in big tanks we go ten 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.530
 different classes in ten different levels 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.819
 can upgrade 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.470
 guns caterpillar engine and so on 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.430
 known again we can compare 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.599
 efficiency of various modules 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.019
 how much does not suit our style of play 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:18.360
 and so on very cool trick which 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.650
 we have here of tanks blitz 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.980
 these are our touch controls they are not easy 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.720
 so we have them still possible and customized 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.660
 by itself it is actually very convenient 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.060
 can move move reduce and 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.680
 increase any buttons move them in 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.239
 screens how convenient to put on each 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.769
 the player will be able to individually 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.349
 set up management it really 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.579
 very comfortable we even have one 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.209
 small thing 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.099
 ability to customize management for 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.079
 left-handers and right-handers 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.730
 plastic completely user friendly and me 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.819
 I think that anyone will find in it 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.310
 convenient table and the game offers fights 7 on 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.329
 7 unlike fights 15-15 in large 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.350
 so the cards will be a little smaller 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.680
 accordingly the battle will be faster 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.019
 more aggressive more dynamic 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.569
 maximum fight duration 7 minutes but 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.280
 as you noticed on average afraid of course 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.530
 four minutes of the test if you suddenly go 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.239
 in the subway you have some time 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.910
 several fights can be played 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.639
 because in addition to a connection vayf 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.979
 connection game is quite playable 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.870
 on a good 3g connection which is already in 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.300
 Our countries thank God in many 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.760
 places available this is not a problem as we 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.490
 see graphically components of here 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.389
 tanks blitz is quite a fan of 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.650
 mobile platform 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.470
 what an interesting game uses the engine 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.660
 own production is not 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.310
 simplified engine of big tanks it 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.530
 written style engine which is called 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.889
 dom frei Marx that is basically he 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.010
 made only for blitz yet for this 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.909
 moment 8 maps different locations this 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.210
 desert this winter map is urban 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.380
 maps industrial maps have a model 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.280
 physical damage in general 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.590
 physical model 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.289
 it seems that there are big tanks she 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.440
 uses technology bigworld therefore 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.479
 everything is pretty realistic and true as 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.180
 use this control very much 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.669
 just all intuitive and any 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.560
 player even unfamiliar with tanks and 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.140
 generally possible with online mobile 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.900
 shooters learn to play will be very 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.969
 you just said that the exit of the game 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.940
 planned primarily for 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.390
 owners 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.820
 Mobile devices based on ios that 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.690
 android version android version is 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.270
 in developing 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.460
 we are actively working on optimizing for 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.530
 various devices 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.750
 therefore, in general, very soon it can be 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:50.140
 I will not wait for the deadline yet because 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.430
 what is of course with the risks associated with 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.910
 optimization with the development we want 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.920
 bring the game to the ideal therefore in 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.150
 I can say very soon that in 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.150
 this year it is for sure
