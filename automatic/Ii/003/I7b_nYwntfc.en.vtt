00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
this is what we did with it um it's a it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.439 
this is what we did with it um it's a it
was<00:00:25.830> an<00:00:25.949> experiment<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.789> spread

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
was an experiment I spread

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.540 
was an experiment I spread
I<00:00:27.480> added<00:00:28.170> some<00:00:28.410> dates<00:00:30.260> some<00:00:31.260> cut<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.550> dried

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
I added some dates some cut up dried

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
I added some dates some cut up dried
dates<00:00:32.790> pitted<00:00:33.210> dates<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.309> some<00:00:36.469> almonds

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
dates pitted dates and some almonds

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.970 
dates pitted dates and some almonds
little<00:00:38.219> chunks<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.760> almonds<00:00:39.210> okay<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
little chunks of almonds okay so I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.090 
little chunks of almonds okay so I
spread<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.760> out<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.559> see<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.829> would<00:00:43.920> do

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
spread it out to see what it would do

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.970 
spread it out to see what it would do
it's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:45.059> thin<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
it's a little bit thin this is and a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.279 
it's a little bit thin this is and a
little<00:00:47.219> bit<00:00:47.370> crunchy<00:00:47.640> still<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.989> really

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
little bit crunchy still but it's really

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.420 
little bit crunchy still but it's really
good<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.010> sweet

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
good and it's really sweet

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.830 
good and it's really sweet
I<00:00:53.610> didn't<00:00:53.850> add<00:00:53.969> really<00:00:54.239> any<00:00:54.390> sweetener

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
I didn't add really any sweetener

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.790 
I didn't add really any sweetener
besides<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> dates<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.719> made<00:00:58.620> these

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
besides the dates and then I made these

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.590 
besides the dates and then I made these
bars<00:00:59.219> instead<00:01:00.500> or<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.710> well<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.329> what<00:01:03.449> they

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bars instead or as well to see what they

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.350 
bars instead or as well to see what they
would<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.729> indeed<00:01:06.150> just

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
would do and so they be indeed just

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.280 
would do and so they be indeed just
dehydrating<00:01:06.930> overnight<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.729> they<00:01:08.729> really

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
dehydrating overnight and they really

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.250 
dehydrating overnight and they really
they're<00:01:10.290> maybe<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:11.689> 3/4<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.900> inch<00:01:12.990> thick

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
they're maybe like 3/4 of an inch thick

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.999 
they're maybe like 3/4 of an inch thick
or<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.810> there<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.200> wanted<00:01:16.650> them<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.830> be

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
or so and there I wanted them to be

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.820 
or so and there I wanted them to be
chewy<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> inside<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.380> these<00:01:19.590> are

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
chewy on the inside and so these are

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.859 
chewy on the inside and so these are
still<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.840> little<00:01:23.330> chewy<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> inside<00:01:26.869> still

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
still a little chewy on the inside still

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
still a little chewy on the inside still
a<00:01:27.900> little<00:01:28.200> bit<00:01:28.290> flexible<00:01:28.640> but<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.790> hold

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
a little bit flexible but they hold

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.690 
a little bit flexible but they hold
their<00:01:30.360> shape<00:01:30.390> together<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> basically<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.610> was

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
their shape together so basically it was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
their shape together so basically it was
just<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> pulp<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.630> pineapple<00:01:34.369> two

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
