slow-paced like a lot of the wrestling
action<00:00:55.440> didn't<00:00:55.829> even<00:00:55.949> happen<00:00:56.160> until<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> very

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
action didn't even happen until the very

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.939 
action didn't even happen until the very
end<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> movie<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.230> rest<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.770> just

a<00:01:43.409> great<00:01:43.649> voice<00:01:43.860> actor<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> love<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> guy<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.600> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
a great voice actor I love the guy but I

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
a great voice actor I love the guy but I
think<00:01:45.869> his<00:01:46.290> Barney<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.729> bit<00:01:47.880> off

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
think his Barney was a little bit off

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.580 
think his Barney was a little bit off
because<00:01:49.130> he<00:01:50.130> sounded<00:01:50.490> very<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:51.390> high<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.560> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
because he sounded very like high like a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710 
because he sounded very like high like a
little<00:01:52.829> too<00:01:53.040> high<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.610> hey<00:01:53.850> Fred<00:01:54.360> we're

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little too high like hey Fred we're

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.109 
little too high like hey Fred we're
gonna<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.259> do<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> thing<00:01:55.950> or<00:01:56.280> something<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.610> can't

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
gonna go do a thing or something I can't

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
gonna go do a thing or something I can't
I<00:01:57.240> can't<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.719> version<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.229> Barney<00:01:58.469> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
I can't do that version of Barney I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.200 
I can't do that version of Barney I
think<00:01:58.829> I'm<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.040> used<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> Barney<00:01:59.790> sounding<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
think I'm just used to Barney sounding a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.020 
think I'm just used to Barney sounding a
little<00:02:00.659> bit<00:02:00.810> lower<00:02:01.110> like<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.920> remember<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
little bit lower like I remember in the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.120 
little bit lower like I remember in the
old<00:02:03.240> show

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
old show

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.920 
old show
he<00:02:04.460> had<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.640> couple<00:02:04.939> of<00:02:05.090> different<00:02:05.390> voices<00:02:05.750> but

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
he had a couple of different voices but

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.630 
he had a couple of different voices but
I<00:02:05.960> think<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.350> one<00:02:06.560> most<00:02:07.159> people<00:02:07.340> remember

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
I think the one most people remember

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.969 
I think the one most people remember
most<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:09.050> one<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.289> sounds<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.679> little<00:02:09.770> bit

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
most is the one that sounds a little bit

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.150 
most is the one that sounds a little bit
like<00:02:10.720> fruit<00:02:11.720> you're<00:02:11.959> ready<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.349> go<00:02:12.500> bowling<00:02:12.739> or

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
like fruit you're ready to go bowling or

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.199 
like fruit you're ready to go bowling or
you<00:02:13.370> know<00:02:13.489> something<00:02:13.819> like<00:02:13.940> that

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
you know something like that

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:15.820 
you know something like that
there<00:02:14.569> overall<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.900> thought<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.230> voice<00:02:15.410> acting

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
there overall I thought the voice acting

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.229 
there overall I thought the voice acting
was<00:02:15.920> good<00:02:16.099> even<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.459> wrestlers<00:02:16.849> did<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> pretty

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
was good even the wrestlers did a pretty

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.570 
was good even the wrestlers did a pretty
good<00:02:17.420> job<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.140> speaking<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.220> wrestlers

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
good job and speaking of the wrestlers

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
good job and speaking of the wrestlers
let's<00:02:20.060> talk<00:02:20.420> about<00:02:20.750> them<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.620> there<00:02:21.800> were<00:02:21.890> a

rock stood out the most and it makes

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.920 
rock stood out the most and it makes

sense because it's CM Punk he's one of

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.140 
sense because it's CM Punk he's one of
the<00:02:54.049> best<00:02:54.230> mic<00:02:54.500> workers<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.610> wrestling

like<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.380> legitimate<00:03:46.010> graveyard<00:03:46.609> so<00:03:47.769> they

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
like a legitimate graveyard so they

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.009 
like a legitimate graveyard so they
basically<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.489> acknowledged<00:03:50.120> death<00:03:50.480> in<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.900 
he was in what his scene and it was for
one<00:03:59.480> joke<00:04:00.049> and<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.920> reason<00:04:01.519> why<00:04:01.670> is<00:04:01.730> because

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.620 
one joke and the reason why is because
he<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.930> featured<00:04:03.590> right<00:04:04.400> there<00:04:04.760> on<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.329> cover

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
mention that he was named in the trailer

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.430 
mention that he was named in the trailer
whereas<00:04:11.090> Mark<00:04:11.359> Henry<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:11.810> Rey<00:04:12.049> Mysterio

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
whereas Mark Henry and Rey Mysterio

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.050 
whereas Mark Henry and Rey Mysterio
weren't<00:04:12.919> even<00:04:13.340> though<00:04:13.430> they<00:04:13.609> had<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> lot<00:04:14.030> more

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
weren't even though they had a lot more

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.190 
weren't even though they had a lot more
to<00:04:14.449> do<00:04:14.630> in<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.900> movie<00:04:15.109> so<00:04:15.919> he

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
to do in this movie so he

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.930 
to do in this movie so he
just<00:04:16.350> there<00:04:16.530> for<00:04:16.560> one<00:04:16.950> joke<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.700> then<00:04:17.820> he

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
just there for one joke and then he

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.700 
just there for one joke and then he
walked<00:04:18.180> off<00:04:18.390> screen<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.050> we<00:04:19.170> never<00:04:19.350> saw<00:04:19.620> him

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:19.710 
walked off screen and we never saw him

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.320 
walked off screen and we never saw him
again<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.980> even<00:04:22.980> in<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.340> cartoons<00:04:23.850> Daniel

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
again and even in the cartoons Daniel

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.550 
again and even in the cartoons Daniel
Bryan<00:04:24.570> can't<00:04:24.870> get<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> break

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
Bryan can't get a break

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.770 
Bryan can't get a break
so<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> really<00:04:26.640> thought<00:04:26.760> they<00:04:26.970> misused<00:04:27.480> a<00:04:27.600> lot

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
so I really thought they misused a lot

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.240 
so I really thought they misused a lot
of<00:04:27.900> wrestlers<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:28.890> fact<00:04:29.130> they

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
of wrestlers in this in fact they

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.380 
of wrestlers in this in fact they
probably<00:04:29.400> could<00:04:29.700> have<00:04:29.760> gotten<00:04:30.030> some<00:04:30.150> other

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
probably could have gotten some other

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.670 
probably could have gotten some other
ones<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.750> would<00:04:30.870> have<00:04:30.960> been<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.290> much<00:04:31.320> better

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
ones that would have been so much better

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.500 
ones that would have been so much better
made<00:04:32.010> this<00:04:32.160> work<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.550> little<00:04:32.730> bit<00:04:32.820> better<00:04:32.970> like

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
made this work a little bit better like

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.460 
made this work a little bit better like
the<00:04:33.750> rock<00:04:34.250> again<00:04:35.250> why<00:04:35.820> wasn't<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.690> rock<00:04:37.050> in

you<00:05:55.310> know<00:05:55.430> I'm<00:05:55.550> beginning<00:05:55.700> to<00:05:55.850> think<00:05:56.120> the

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
you know I'm beginning to think the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.700 
you know I'm beginning to think the
Flintstones<00:05:56.780> weren't<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.230> great<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.470> begin

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
Flintstones weren't that great to begin

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.490 
Flintstones weren't that great to begin
with<00:05:58.040> so<00:05:58.700> basically<00:05:59.240> all<00:05:59.390> this<00:05:59.750> movie<00:06:00.140> led<00:06:00.350> up

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
with so basically all this movie led up

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.980 
with so basically all this movie led up
to<00:06:00.710> was<00:06:01.010> Fred<00:06:01.460> Flintstone<00:06:02.030> being<00:06:02.330> the<00:06:02.480> founder

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
to was Fred Flintstone being the founder

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.980 
to was Fred Flintstone being the founder
of<00:06:03.170> the<00:06:03.320> WWE<00:06:04.070> like<00:06:04.790> way<00:06:05.030> back<00:06:05.330> in<00:06:05.540> Stone<00:06:05.810> Age

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
of the WWE like way back in Stone Age

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.520 
of the WWE like way back in Stone Age
times<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.650> then<00:06:07.310> mr.<00:06:07.790> mcmack<00:06:08.480> ma<00:06:08.810> showed<00:06:09.320> up

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
times and then mr. mcmack ma showed up

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.650 
times and then mr. mcmack ma showed up
and<00:06:09.830> took<00:06:10.220> over<00:06:10.430> for<00:06:10.760> him<00:06:10.940> who<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.210> guess<00:06:11.510> they

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
and took over for him who I guess they

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.720 
and took over for him who I guess they
implied<00:06:11.960> was<00:06:12.200> an<00:06:12.320> ancestor<00:06:12.710> of<00:06:13.100> Vince<00:06:13.280> McMahon

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
implied was an ancestor of Vince McMahon

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.170 
implied was an ancestor of Vince McMahon
I<00:06:14.390> guess<00:06:14.900> because<00:06:15.200> his<00:06:15.410> business<00:06:15.650> of<00:06:16.190> the<00:06:16.700> raw

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
I guess because his business of the raw

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.150 
I guess because his business of the raw
seafood<00:06:17.750> bar<00:06:18.380> wasn't<00:06:19.220> working<00:06:19.850> so<00:06:19.880> well<00:06:21.160> get

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
seafood bar wasn't working so well get

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:31.840 
seafood bar wasn't working so well get
it<00:06:22.310> raw<00:06:22.790> seafood<00:06:23.950> like<00:06:24.950> Monday<00:06:25.520> Night<00:06:25.760> Raw<00:06:30.850> so

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
it raw seafood like Monday Night Raw so

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.520 
it raw seafood like Monday Night Raw so
overall<00:06:32.120> I<00:06:32.270> would<00:06:32.480> say<00:06:32.570> just<00:06:32.870> skip<00:06:33.290> this<00:06:33.470> one

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.530 
overall I would say just skip this one

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.250 
overall I would say just skip this one
it<00:06:34.220> wasn't<00:06:34.700> really<00:06:35.150> worth<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.630> although<00:06:36.110> the

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
it wasn't really worth it although the

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.020 
it wasn't really worth it although the
Flintstones<00:06:36.740> could<00:06:36.980> have<00:06:37.100> suffered<00:06:37.520> a<00:06:37.640> far

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
Flintstones could have suffered a far

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.020 
Flintstones could have suffered a far
worse<00:06:38.390> fate<00:06:38.750> nice<00:06:39.440> try<00:06:39.830> old<00:06:39.860> man<00:06:40.370> McFarlane
