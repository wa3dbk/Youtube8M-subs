00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
will start right here come there's a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.730 
will start right here come there's a
tree<00:00:18.510> right<00:00:18.539> there<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.170> we're<00:00:19.289> going<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.470> trim

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
tree right there and we're going to trim

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.160 
tree right there and we're going to trim
the<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.000> bottom<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.480> you'll<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:21.810> around<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
the a bottom of it you'll go around the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.980 
the a bottom of it you'll go around the
tree<00:00:22.439> come<00:00:23.310> up<00:00:26.930> if<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.130> launcher<00:00:29.990> land

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
tree come up if you like a launcher land

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.670 
tree come up if you like a launcher land
on<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.500> then<00:00:31.650> ski<00:00:32.040> jump<00:00:33.290> and<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> come

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
on it and then ski jump and you come

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
on it and then ski jump and you come
here's<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.399> pits<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> drivers<00:00:40.590> stand<00:00:42.170> you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
here's the pits the drivers stand you

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.970 
here's the pits the drivers stand you
come<00:00:43.500> around<00:00:43.910> double<00:00:45.170> maybe<00:00:46.170> quad<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.829> you

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
come around double maybe quad if you

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.380 
come around double maybe quad if you
have<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:48.620> 8th<00:00:49.620> scale<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.300> could

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
have a 8th scale and then you could

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.049 
have a 8th scale and then you could
probably<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> 4<00:00:52.289> by<00:00:52.469> 4<00:00:52.699> /<00:00:53.699> or

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
probably do it with a 4 by 4 / or

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.430 
probably do it with a 4 by 4 / or
something<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:57.260> short<00:00:58.260> course

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
something like that like short course

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
truck 4 by 4 don't know about two wheel

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.420 
truck 4 by 4 don't know about two wheel
drive<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.480> then<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> little

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
drive but you know then there's a little

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.039 
drive but you know then there's a little
hump<00:01:05.430> right<00:01:05.670> there<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.900> little<00:01:09.049> so

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
hump right there like just a little so

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.219 
hump right there like just a little so
little<00:01:10.400> roller<00:01:11.420> across<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> corner<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.080> then

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
little roller across the corner and then

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.520 
little roller across the corner and then
you<00:01:13.350> can<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.650> around<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> berm<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.790> then<00:01:15.630> if

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you can go around the berm and then if

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.990 
you can go around the berm and then if
you're<00:01:16.680> wondering<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.790> this

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you're wondering what this is for this

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.760 
you're wondering what this is for this
is<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.650> launcher<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:21.140> up<00:01:22.140> then

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
is just a launcher that you go up then

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.700 
is just a launcher that you go up then
you<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.220> launch<00:01:23.520> off<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:24.450> far<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you don't launch off of it very far you

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.320 
you don't launch off of it very far you
would<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.610> roll<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.060> then

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
would actually kind of roll it and then

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.289 
would actually kind of roll it and then
you<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.810> huge<00:01:28.409> structure<00:01:29.090> to<00:01:30.090> get

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you go down that huge structure to get

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:39.039 
you go down that huge structure to get
speed<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:34.369> 4<00:01:35.369> foot<00:01:35.750> jump<00:01:36.750> across<00:01:37.610> that

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
speed for this a 4 foot jump across that

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.300 
speed for this a 4 foot jump across that
there<00:01:40.049> will<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.200> no<00:01:40.320> tubing<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.070> see<00:01:41.250> it

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
there will be no tubing there see it

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.840 
there will be no tubing there see it
says<00:01:41.490> 4<00:01:41.759> feet<00:01:42.000> note<00:01:42.530> no<00:01:43.530> landing<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.189> tubing<00:01:44.610> so

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
says 4 feet note no landing or tubing so

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
says 4 feet note no landing or tubing so
there<00:01:45.000> will<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.149> no<00:01:45.270> landing<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.229> have

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
there will be no landing so if you have

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.499 
there will be no landing so if you have
a<00:01:46.380> bad<00:01:46.619> battery<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.430> can<00:01:47.460> land<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:48.030> here

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.450 

there's<00:01:51.509> flat<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.350> outside<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.369> can

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there's flat to the outside so you can

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550 
there's flat to the outside so you can
go<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> outside<00:01:54.180> just<00:01:54.689> stay<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:54.930> flat<00:01:55.320> or

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
go to the outside just stay on flat or

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.109 
go to the outside just stay on flat or
you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> small<00:01:57.030> double<00:01:57.530> right<00:01:58.530> there

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
you can do a small double right there

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.840 
you can do a small double right there
then<00:02:00.119> there's<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.409> people<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.009> farm

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
then there's actually people that farm

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.289 
then there's actually people that farm
like<00:02:03.149> right<00:02:03.570> over<00:02:03.829> here<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.009> there<00:02:05.850> combine

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
like right over here and there combine

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.940 
like right over here and there combine
kind<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.719> comes<00:02:06.869> into<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> yard<00:02:07.500> when<00:02:07.770> they

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
kind of comes into the yard when they

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.650 
kind of comes into the yard when they
combine<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.090> we're<00:02:09.209> not<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> put

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
combine so we're not going to put

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.040 
combine so we're not going to put
anything<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:12.090> just

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
anything there so just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.670 
anything there so just
straight<00:02:13.820> straight<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:15.450> down<00:02:15.690> just<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:16.650> it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
straight straight and down just do it

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.870 
straight straight and down just do it
again<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.190> guess<00:02:18.860> now<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> circle<00:02:20.490> track<00:02:20.700> you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
again I guess now the circle track you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.910 
again I guess now the circle track you
will<00:02:21.000> not<00:02:21.150> eat<00:02:21.360> well<00:02:22.080> first<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.530> all<00:02:22.560> here's

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
will not eat well first of all here's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:34.610 
will not eat well first of all here's
the<00:02:23.010> circle<00:02:23.550> track<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.990> then<00:02:34.290> right<00:02:34.590> here

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
the circle track so and then right here

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:52.700 
the circle track so and then right here
is<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:44.420> UM<00:02:47.030> now<00:02:48.030> my<00:02:48.270> gosh<00:02:48.510> oh<00:02:50.450> yeah<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:52.440> then

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
is the UM now my gosh oh yeah and then

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.980 
is the UM now my gosh oh yeah and then
you'll<00:02:53.430> actually<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:54.120> stand<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.690> right
