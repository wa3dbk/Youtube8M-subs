00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
some time in the communities that are

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.300 
some time in the communities that are
suffering<00:01:07.240> from<00:01:07.450> poverty<00:01:07.869> this<00:01:08.170> was<00:01:08.380> nice<00:01:09.159> and

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
suffering from poverty this was nice and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.740 
suffering from poverty this was nice and
refreshing<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.090> made<00:01:10.240> me<00:01:10.330> feel<00:01:10.360> really

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
refreshing and it made me feel really

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.570 
refreshing and it made me feel really
hopeful<00:01:11.080> because<00:01:11.440> we<00:01:11.619> saw<00:01:11.830> so<00:01:12.190> many<00:01:12.369> great

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
hopeful because we saw so many great

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.130 
hopeful because we saw so many great
things<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:13.180> these<00:01:13.300> communities<00:01:13.810> are<00:01:13.840> now

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
things that these communities are now

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.830 
things that these communities are now
doing<00:01:14.800> on<00:01:15.100> their<00:01:15.490> own<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:16.119> with<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.330> help<00:01:16.720> of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
doing on their own but with the help of

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.580 
doing on their own but with the help of
World<00:01:17.050> Vision

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
World Vision

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.490 
World Vision
I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:19.180> World<00:01:19.420> Vision<00:01:19.810> does<00:01:20.140> it<00:01:20.290> right

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
I think World Vision does it right

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.980 
I think World Vision does it right
because<00:01:20.740> they<00:01:21.009> teach<00:01:21.250> people<00:01:21.280> how<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:21.880> make<00:01:22.810> it

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
because they teach people how to make it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.270 
because they teach people how to make it
work<00:01:23.110> for<00:01:23.290> themselves<00:01:23.680> if<00:01:23.890> you're<00:01:24.040> just

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
work for themselves if you're just

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.950 
work for themselves if you're just
giving<00:01:24.490> them<00:01:24.550> handouts<00:01:25.060> they<00:01:25.390> would<00:01:25.570> be<00:01:25.690> ok

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
giving them handouts they would be ok

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240 
giving them handouts they would be ok
for<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.200> day<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.619> then<00:01:26.740> they're<00:01:26.920> right<00:01:27.040> back

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
for a day and then they're right back

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.859 
for a day and then they're right back
where<00:01:27.490> they<00:01:27.759> were<00:01:27.790> before<00:01:27.940> so<00:01:28.509> this<00:01:28.659> is<00:01:28.690> a

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
where they were before so this is a

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.330 
where they were before so this is a
great<00:01:29.350> it's<00:01:29.560> great<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:29.860> see<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.100> progress

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
great it's great to see the progress

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.719 
great it's great to see the progress
this<00:01:31.000> community<00:01:31.450> seen<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:31.869> happy<00:01:32.350> just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
this community seen is happy just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.770 
this community seen is happy just
everything<00:01:33.729> about<00:01:33.909> it<00:01:34.060> seems<00:01:34.270> a<00:01:34.390> bit<00:01:34.509> brighter

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
everything about it seems a bit brighter

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.450 
everything about it seems a bit brighter
and<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.619> think<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.009> some<00:01:36.190> of<00:01:36.220> those

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
and I think that some of those

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.999 
and I think that some of those
communities<00:01:37.000> in<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.570> Blanco<00:01:37.780> area<00:01:38.289> will<00:01:38.590> will

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
communities in the Blanco area will will

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.510 
communities in the Blanco area will will
be<00:01:39.190> closer<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.360> about<00:01:40.690> 10<00:01:40.899> years

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
be closer to this and about 10 years

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.800 
be closer to this and about 10 years
it's<00:01:42.520> changed<00:01:43.030> me<00:01:43.179> I'm<00:01:43.270> gonna<00:01:43.390> go<00:01:43.570> from

it's changed me I'm gonna go from

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's changed me I'm gonna go from
feeling<00:01:44.170> different<00:01:44.470> about<00:01:44.970> everything

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
feeling different about everything

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.730 
feeling different about everything
though<00:01:46.210> every<00:01:46.539> meal<00:01:46.690> I<00:01:46.720> eat<00:01:47.140> about<00:01:47.289> where<00:01:47.619> I'm

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
though every meal I eat about where I'm

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.529 
though every meal I eat about where I'm
sleeping<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.460> night<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.700> mean<00:01:49.119> they're<00:01:49.509> just
