00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.810
 scene seemed number happened here what 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.120
 had done previously not before 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.250
 of making the videotape I had to 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.070
 do the first test and it works and 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.860
 I remembered that I had a lot of time 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.530
 that I did not say I did not do that 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.540
 once he did not appear in the box anymore 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.210
 of dialogue but only that it started like that 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.030

 computer is prompted to create a password 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.000
 that is to say what he has already done so 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.070
 that has already started and did not appear to 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.870
 dialogue box when you do 

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.460
 it will surely appear in the box 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.680
 informal dialogue for you to place 100 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.500
 and setting up a new sentence will not 

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.330
 put none of the science just to ok and 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.140
