the Bale apart what we're trying to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.160 
the Bale apart what we're trying to
prevent<00:00:58.220> is<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:58.730> high<00:00:58.940> density<00:00:59.240> flakes<00:00:59.900> from

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
prevent is the high density flakes from

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.580 
prevent is the high density flakes from
going<00:01:00.380> into<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:01.100> string<00:01:01.490> baler<00:01:02.000> in

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
going into that to string baler in

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.130 
going into that to string baler in
sharing<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.710> pin<00:01:04.010> those<00:01:04.790> fingers<00:01:05.479> will<00:01:05.840> take

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
sharing a pin those fingers will take

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.410 
sharing a pin those fingers will take
the<00:01:06.350> high-density<00:01:07.100> pieces<00:01:07.580> and<00:01:07.820> throw<00:01:08.180> them

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
the high-density pieces and throw them

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.080 
the high-density pieces and throw them
back<00:01:08.690> down<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.500> they<00:01:10.310> will<00:01:10.520> go<00:01:10.670> through<00:01:10.910> the

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
back down and they will go through the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.990 
back down and they will go through the
tearing<00:01:11.450> up<00:01:11.570> procedure<00:01:12.050> a<00:01:12.350> second<00:01:12.770> time<00:01:13.010> this

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
tearing up procedure a second time this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.180 
tearing up procedure a second time this
is<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.210> big<00:01:14.630> difference<00:01:15.020> where<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.770> machine

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
is a big difference where this machine

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.740 
is a big difference where this machine
differs<00:01:16.550> from<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.880> lot<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.150> others<00:01:17.420> on<00:01:17.630> the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
differs from a lot of others on the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.859 
differs from a lot of others on the
market<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:18.380> that<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.100> prevents<00:01:19.580> the

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
market in that it prevents the

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.420 
market in that it prevents the
high-density<00:01:20.869> pieces<00:01:21.530> from<00:01:21.740> going<00:01:22.070> into<00:01:22.280> that

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
high-density pieces from going into that

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.360 
high-density pieces from going into that
to<00:01:23.150> string<00:01:23.540> baler

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.120 

you'll<00:01:31.360> notice<00:01:31.600> now<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.990> hay<00:01:32.440> falling<00:01:32.920> down

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
you'll notice now the hay falling down

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.610 
you'll notice now the hay falling down
to<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.460> conveyor<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.450> all<00:01:34.750> loose<00:01:35.020> say<00:01:35.320> no

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
to that conveyor is all loose say no

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.890 
to that conveyor is all loose say no
chunks<00:01:36.130> this<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:36.970> going<00:01:37.180> right<00:01:37.330> into<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.720> two

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
chunks this is going right into the two

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.580 
chunks this is going right into the two
