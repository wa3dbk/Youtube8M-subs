00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
silly and post a comment saying that's

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.759 
silly and post a comment saying that's
not<00:01:03.239> true<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.809> 16<00:01:04.049> players<00:01:04.409> because

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
not true you can have 16 players because

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.289 
not true you can have 16 players because
obviously<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.820> change<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
obviously it's going to change but I

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
obviously it's going to change but I
don't<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.540> because<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.080> am<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.290> January

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
don't know that because I am in January

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.750 
don't know that because I am in January
so<00:01:08.340> umm<00:01:09.290> hosting<00:01:10.290> servers<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.490> little

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so umm hosting servers are a little

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.890 
so umm hosting servers are a little
harder<00:01:12.090> than<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> might<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.600> thought

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
harder than you might have thought

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
harder than you might have thought

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
especially since there are a lot of lag

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.789 
especially since there are a lot of lag
issues<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> most<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> them<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.259> been<00:01:16.500> fixed

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
issues and most of them have been fixed

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.249 
issues and most of them have been fixed
in<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> newer<00:01:17.970> updates<00:01:18.509> but<00:01:18.990> players

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
through a wireless network one of the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.950 
through a wireless network one of the
issues<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.240> wireless

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
issues with that is that the wireless

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630 
issues with that is that the wireless
signals<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.860> are<00:01:58.979> being<00:01:59.100> sent<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.460> from

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
signals that are being sent out from

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.569 
signals that are being sent out from
your<00:01:59.790> router<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.450> may<00:02:00.930> not<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.649> strong

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
your router it may not be as strong

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.770 
your router it may not be as strong
let's<00:02:03.030> say

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
let's say

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.100 
let's say
your<00:02:04.020> Wi-Fi<00:02:04.950> router<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.970> upstairs<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
your Wi-Fi router is upstairs in the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.749 
your Wi-Fi router is upstairs in the
addict<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.100> you're<00:02:08.280> playing<00:02:08.490> on<00:02:08.729> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
addict and you're playing on the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.400 
addict and you're playing on the
opposite<00:02:09.179> side<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> house<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.170> basement

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
opposite side of house in the basement

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.550 
opposite side of house in the basement
just<00:02:11.130> too<00:02:11.340> far<00:02:11.610> away<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.209> signal<00:02:12.959> strength

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
just too far away so the signal strength

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
just too far away so the signal strength
is<00:02:13.740> going<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:13.980> very<00:02:14.190> weak<00:02:14.490> making<00:02:15.390> the

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
is going to be very weak making the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.110 
is going to be very weak making the
connection<00:02:16.410> slower<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.550> if<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.760> are<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.090> a

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
connection slower so if you are on a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.260 
connection slower so if you are on a
wireless<00:02:18.780> device<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.740> wireless<00:02:20.340> router<00:02:20.700> make

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
wireless device or wireless router make

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.449 
wireless device or wireless router make
sure<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.569> have<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.989> Xbox<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.650> close<00:02:23.040> as<00:02:23.280> you

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
sure to have that Xbox as close as you

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.729 
sure to have that Xbox as close as you
can<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.360> router<00:02:24.690> so<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.590> can

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
can to that router so that you can

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.309 
can to that router so that you can
maximize<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.730> strength<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.720> routers

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
maximize the strength of the routers

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.160 
maximize the strength of the routers
connectivity<00:02:29.069> level<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.690> make<00:02:30.959> sure<00:02:30.989> that

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
connectivity level and to make sure that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.540 
connectivity level and to make sure that
you're<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.560> gonna<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.830> any<00:02:31.950> drops<00:02:32.310> in

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
you're not gonna have any drops in

loading<00:02:38.519> times<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:40.050> would<00:02:40.350> recommend

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
loading times but I would recommend

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.440 
loading times but I would recommend

about<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:48.060> pretty<00:02:48.269> much<00:02:48.390> makes<00:02:48.569> life<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
about that that pretty much makes life a

most of those wired connections were

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.050 
most of those wired connections were
used<00:02:53.010> for<00:02:53.130> computers<00:02:53.550> back<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.940> day

course that's something that if you're
younger<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.230> need<00:03:04.410> parents<00:03:04.920> motion<00:03:05.340> to

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
rather be safe than sorry so that brings

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.750 
rather be safe than sorry so that brings

play Minecraft and host the map pretty

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.699 
play Minecraft and host the map pretty
much<00:03:35.820> because<00:03:36.239> the<00:03:36.600> bandwidth<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.350> being

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
much because the bandwidth that is being

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.099 
much because the bandwidth that is being
used<00:03:38.010> which<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.400> sound<00:03:38.700> like<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.000> highway<00:03:39.600> for

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
used which is sound like the highway for

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.030 
used which is sound like the highway for

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
sent off into the Internet um it's

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.890 
sent off into the Internet um it's
taking<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:49.440> some<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.739> energy<00:03:50.630> I'd<00:03:51.630> call

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
taking up some of that energy I'd call

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.599 
taking up some of that energy I'd call
it<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.380> taking<00:03:52.680> up<00:03:52.739> that<00:03:52.829> energy<00:03:53.040> because<00:03:53.489> it

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
it and taking up that energy because it

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.270 
it and taking up that energy because it
needs<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.030> energy<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.870> stream<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:56.130> only

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
needs that energy to stream and you only

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.009 
needs that energy to stream and you only
have<00:03:56.459> so<00:03:56.670> much<00:03:56.820> energy<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.510> can<00:03:57.660> use<00:03:57.840> so

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
have so much energy that you can use so

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.020 
have so much energy that you can use so
you<00:03:58.079> want<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.380> allocate<00:03:58.590> as<00:03:59.010> much<00:03:59.640> of<00:03:59.820> that<00:03:59.850> as

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
you want to allocate as much of that as

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.100 
you want to allocate as much of that as
you<00:04:00.359> can<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.829> Xbox<00:04:02.280> one

over the place your connection is just
going<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.590> be<00:04:39.650> pretty<00:04:39.830> poor<00:04:40.220> just<00:04:40.730> because

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
going to be pretty poor just because

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.240 
going to be pretty poor just because
it's<00:04:41.240> spread<00:04:41.990> out<00:04:42.020> thousands<00:04:42.950> of<00:04:43.070> miles

how many megabytes you get uploaded and
downloaded<00:05:29.230> in<00:05:29.830> your<00:05:30.010> ping<00:05:30.370> which<00:05:31.060> is<00:05:31.360> the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
downloaded in your ping which is the

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.230 
downloaded in your ping which is the
amount<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:31.960> time<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.410> takes<00:05:32.650> for<00:05:33.130> a<00:05:33.520> signal<00:05:34.210> to

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
amount of time it takes for a signal to

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.830 
amount of time it takes for a signal to
reach<00:05:34.690> your<00:05:35.560> house<00:05:36.040> router<00:05:36.639> so<00:05:37.210> that<00:05:37.540> thing

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
reach your house router so that thing

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.360 
reach your house router so that thing
that<00:05:38.020> connects<00:05:38.260> your<00:05:38.470> house<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.919> the<00:05:39.010> Internet

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
that connects your house to the Internet

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.460 
that connects your house to the Internet
to<00:05:39.850> a<00:05:40.150> let's<00:05:40.750> say<00:05:40.900> Verizon<00:05:41.620> server<00:05:42.100> that<00:05:42.430> is<00:05:42.700> um

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
to a let's say Verizon server that is um

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.980 
to a let's say Verizon server that is um
managing<00:05:44.470> all<00:05:44.680> of<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:45.419> internet<00:05:46.419> connections

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
managing all of the internet connections

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.129 
managing all of the internet connections
in<00:05:47.350> a<00:05:47.470> certain<00:05:47.919> region<00:05:48.570> obviously<00:05:49.570> you<00:05:50.020> would

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
in a certain region obviously you would

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.190 
in a certain region obviously you would
want<00:05:50.380> to<00:05:50.470> have<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.680> ping<00:05:51.280> in<00:05:52.200> milliseconds

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
want to have a ping in milliseconds

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.830 
want to have a ping in milliseconds
usually<00:05:54.190> a<00:05:54.220> good<00:05:54.880> pain<00:05:55.150> would<00:05:55.360> be<00:05:55.389> 10

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
usually a good pain would be 10

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.030 
usually a good pain would be 10
milliseconds<00:05:56.470> so<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.620> takes<00:05:56.800> head

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
milliseconds so it takes head

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.460 
milliseconds so it takes head
millisecond<00:05:57.580> seconds<00:05:58.240> from<00:05:58.750> a<00:05:58.870> signal<00:05:59.350> from

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
millisecond seconds from a signal from

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.580 
millisecond seconds from a signal from
your<00:05:59.620> house<00:05:59.830> to<00:06:00.610> reach<00:06:00.820> a<00:06:01.030> server<00:06:01.630> for<00:06:02.560> a

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
your house to reach a server for a

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.100 
your house to reach a server for a
internet<00:06:03.100> company<00:06:03.610> let's<00:06:03.910> say<00:06:04.060> maybe<00:06:04.720> 40

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
internet company let's say maybe 40

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.420 
internet company let's say maybe 40
miles<00:06:05.290> away<00:06:05.410> and<00:06:05.770> then<00:06:05.860> bounce<00:06:06.130> all<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.340> way

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
miles away and then bounce all the way

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.310 
miles away and then bounce all the way
back<00:06:06.639> it's<00:06:07.120> pretty<00:06:07.300> impressive<00:06:07.660> but<00:06:07.990> um<00:06:08.110> of

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
back it's pretty impressive but um of

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.350 
back it's pretty impressive but um of
course<00:06:08.560> that's<00:06:09.100> the<00:06:09.250> time<00:06:09.610> delay<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.210> you're

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
course that's the time delay that you're

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.600 
course that's the time delay that you're
going<00:06:10.479> to<00:06:10.540> have<00:06:10.720> with<00:06:10.930> any<00:06:11.110> action<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:11.770> do<00:06:12.010> so

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
going to have with any action you do so

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.240 
going to have with any action you do so
if<00:06:12.880> you<00:06:13.000> let's<00:06:13.660> say<00:06:13.810> shoot<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.200> gun<00:06:14.350> in<00:06:14.620> Call<00:06:15.220> of

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
if you let's say shoot a gun in Call of

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.040 
if you let's say shoot a gun in Call of
Duty<00:06:15.550> you<00:06:15.669> press<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.030> trigger<00:06:16.180> button<00:06:16.600> and

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
Duty you press the trigger button and

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.779 
Duty you press the trigger button and
you<00:06:17.110> see<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.380> shot<00:06:17.560> fire<00:06:17.800> on<00:06:17.950> your<00:06:18.100> screen<00:06:18.460> and

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
you see the shot fire on your screen and

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.850 
you see the shot fire on your screen and
you<00:06:18.850> have<00:06:19.479> a<00:06:19.510> ping<00:06:19.900> of<00:06:20.050> let's<00:06:20.229> say<00:06:20.410> 30

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
you have a ping of let's say 30

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.409 
you have a ping of let's say 30
milliseconds<00:06:21.490> it's<00:06:21.669> going<00:06:21.789> to<00:06:21.850> take<00:06:22.060> maybe

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
milliseconds it's going to take maybe

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.279 
milliseconds it's going to take maybe
even<00:06:22.810> more<00:06:23.020> 30<00:06:23.620> milliseconds<00:06:24.419> plus<00:06:25.419> for<00:06:26.169> that

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
even more 30 milliseconds plus for that

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.650 
even more 30 milliseconds plus for that
shot<00:06:26.500> to<00:06:26.650> register<00:06:27.070> on<00:06:27.190> everyone<00:06:27.550> else's<00:06:27.880> um

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
shot to register on everyone else's um

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.529 
shot to register on everyone else's um
Xbox<00:06:29.260> one<00:06:29.380> and<00:06:29.940> that's<00:06:30.940> kind<00:06:31.150> of<00:06:31.180> that<00:06:31.300> how

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
Xbox one and that's kind of that how

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:33.450 
Xbox one and that's kind of that how
that<00:06:31.600> works<00:06:32.050> and<00:06:32.320> obviously<00:06:32.710> I<00:06:33.039> can<00:06:33.160> get<00:06:33.250> into

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
that works and obviously I can get into

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.830 
that works and obviously I can get into
more<00:06:33.550> specifics<00:06:34.090> but<00:06:34.180> you<00:06:34.300> guys<00:06:34.450> don't<00:06:34.720> really

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
more specifics but you guys don't really

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.870 
more specifics but you guys don't really
need<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.140> worry<00:06:35.320> about<00:06:35.470> that<00:06:35.800> obviously<00:06:36.789> if

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 
need to worry about that obviously if

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.460 
need to worry about that obviously if
you<00:06:36.970> have<00:06:37.150> a<00:06:37.180> high<00:06:37.479> ping<00:06:37.840> you<00:06:37.960> might<00:06:38.110> be<00:06:38.289> having

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
you have a high ping you might be having

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.040 
you have a high ping you might be having
some<00:06:38.710> problems<00:06:39.220> with<00:06:39.570> breaking<00:06:40.570> blocks<00:06:40.870> so

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
some problems with breaking blocks so

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.240 
some problems with breaking blocks so
you<00:06:41.110> might<00:06:41.260> break<00:06:41.530> the<00:06:41.770> block<00:06:41.979> and<00:06:42.130> then

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
you might break the block and then

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.219 
you might break the block and then
reappear<00:06:42.850> so<00:06:43.000> you<00:06:43.090> try<00:06:43.240> and<00:06:43.360> put<00:06:43.750> down<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> block

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
reappear so you try and put down a block

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.650 
reappear so you try and put down a block
and<00:06:44.470> then<00:06:44.590> it<00:06:44.680> disappears<00:06:45.190> that<00:06:46.090> obviously<00:06:46.510> is

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
and then it disappears that obviously is

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.240 
and then it disappears that obviously is
very<00:06:46.690> frustrating<00:06:47.650> in<00:06:47.710> Minecraft<00:06:48.130> and

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
very frustrating in Minecraft and

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.650 
very frustrating in Minecraft and
