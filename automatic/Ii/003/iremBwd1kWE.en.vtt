after<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.079> team<00:01:43.350> gets<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.710> kill<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.250> doesn't

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
after one team gets a kill it doesn't

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.510 
after one team gets a kill it doesn't
matter<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.540> an<00:01:45.780> enemy<00:01:46.020> lags<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.829> or<00:01:47.070> even<00:01:47.280> if

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
matter if an enemy lags out or even if

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.039 
matter if an enemy lags out or even if
one<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.820> your<00:01:47.939> teammates<00:01:48.360> lags<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
one of your teammates lags out of the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.800 
one of your teammates lags out of the
game<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.680> can't<00:01:50.100> restart<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.909> match<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
game you can't restart the match if you

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.810 
game you can't restart the match if you
restart<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> match<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.189> means<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.729> you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
restart the match that means that you

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.120 
restart the match that means that you
forfeit<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.990> had<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.320> end<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.860> so

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
forfeit because you had to end it so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.859 
forfeit because you had to end it so
they're<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.880> actually<00:01:57.090> allowed<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
they're not actually allowed to do that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.209 
they're not actually allowed to do that
that's<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.290> with<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.740> wasn't<00:01:59.189> just

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that's just with this wasn't just

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
that's just with this wasn't just
another<00:01:59.490> show<00:02:00.000> matches<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.570> actually<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
another show matches is actually a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
another show matches is actually a
tournament<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.100> they're<00:02:02.340> playing<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.939> if

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
tournament that they're playing in so if

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.670 
tournament that they're playing in so if
any<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.299> were<00:02:03.630> confused<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.259> why<00:02:04.469> they

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
any you were confused as to why they

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.590 
any you were confused as to why they
didn't<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:04.979> restart<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:06.090> exactly

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
didn't just restart it that's exactly

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.529 
didn't just restart it that's exactly
why<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.369> also<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.550> went<00:02:08.879> ahead<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.390> case

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
why I also just went ahead that in case

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.750 
why I also just went ahead that in case
any<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.500> were<00:02:10.649> watching<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.370> stream<00:02:11.520> when

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
any of you were watching the stream when

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
any of you were watching the stream when
wondering<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.599> know<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.900> some

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
wondering because I know that some

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
wondering because I know that some
people<00:02:13.140> were

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
people were

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800 
people were
I I<00:02:14.070> was<00:02:14.460> removed<00:02:14.850> from<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.300> lobby<00:02:15.450> it's

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I I was removed from the lobby it's

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.600 
I I was removed from the lobby it's
because<00:02:16.170> game<00:02:16.620> battles<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.160> tournaments

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
because game battles and tournaments

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.820 
because game battles and tournaments
doesn't<00:02:17.940> allow<00:02:18.120> spectators<00:02:18.510> either<00:02:19.200> unless

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
doesn't allow spectators either unless

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.860 
doesn't allow spectators either unless
you<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.190> an<00:02:20.280> MLG<00:02:20.610> admin<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:21.630> why<00:02:21.840> I

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
you are an MLG admin so that's why I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.990 
you are an MLG admin so that's why I
wasn't<00:02:22.260> allowed<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.860> lobby<00:02:23.070> now<00:02:23.610> I'm<00:02:23.820> as

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
wasn't allowed in the lobby now I'm as

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640 
wasn't allowed in the lobby now I'm as
far<00:02:24.210> as<00:02:24.300> what<00:02:24.450> happened<00:02:24.780> after<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.080> they

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
far as what happened after that they

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.440 
far as what happened after that they
decided<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.160> go<00:02:26.310> ahead<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.910> play<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.180> off

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
decided to go ahead and just play it off

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.420 
decided to go ahead and just play it off
of<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.780> off<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.590> stream<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:28.980> decided

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
of this off of the stream they decided

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.340 
of this off of the stream they decided
that<00:02:29.460> they<00:02:29.550> didn't<00:02:29.880> want<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.120> allow<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.660> D<00:02:31.140> das

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that they didn't want to allow the D das

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.590 
that they didn't want to allow the D das
attacker<00:02:31.770> who<00:02:32.130> kicked<00:02:32.400> EP<00:02:32.760> off<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.210> then

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
attacker who kicked EP off and then

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.240 
attacker who kicked EP off and then
kicked<00:02:33.900> off<00:02:34.050> acheson<00:02:34.590> i<00:02:34.740> want<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:34.980> say<00:02:35.100> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
last minute of that hard point game they

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.600 
last minute of that hard point game they
didn't<00:02:37.650> want<00:02:37.860> him<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.100> know<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.430> they<00:02:38.550> were

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
didn't want him to know that they were

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.030 
didn't want him to know that they were
still<00:02:39.000> playing<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:40.080> know<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.380> exactly

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
still playing and you know like exactly

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.010 
still playing and you know like exactly
what<00:02:41.250> point<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> way<00:02:41.730> they<00:02:42.030> were<00:02:42.090> winning<00:02:42.390> etc

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
what point the way they were winning etc

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.410 
what point the way they were winning etc
etc<00:02:43.080> etc<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.070> basically<00:02:44.820> what<00:02:44.970> they<00:02:45.090> did<00:02:45.240> was

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
etc etc so basically what they did was

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.870 
etc etc so basically what they did was
they<00:02:45.480> played<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.260> other<00:02:46.470> maps<00:02:46.920> offline<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
they played the other maps offline and

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.020 
they played the other maps offline and
they<00:02:47.970> really<00:02:48.240> only<00:02:48.270> made<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.920> CTF<00:02:50.760> on

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
they really only made it to the CTF on

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.290 
they really only made it to the CTF on
what<00:02:51.840> was<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.470> was<00:02:52.620> raid<00:02:52.860> CTF<00:02:53.580> on<00:02:53.730> raid<00:02:54.030> and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
what was it it was raid CTF on raid and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.510 
what was it it was raid CTF on raid and
they<00:02:54.960> did<00:02:55.140> lose<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.530> complexity<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.280> is

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
they did lose that complexity that is

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.980 
they did lose that complexity that is
now<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> note<00:02:57.360> that<00:02:57.390> John<00:02:57.810> was

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
now I want to note that John was

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.690 
now I want to note that John was
actually<00:02:58.410> experiencing<00:02:59.010> some<00:02:59.250> connection

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
actually experiencing some connection

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.490 
actually experiencing some connection
issues<00:02:59.790> as<00:03:00.180> well<00:03:00.360> during<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.720> matches<00:03:00.960> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
issues as well during the matches it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.260 
issues as well during the matches it
wasn't<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:01.950> he<00:03:02.100> was<00:03:02.130> getting<00:03:02.370> hit<00:03:02.730> off<00:03:02.940> but

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
wasn't like he was getting hit off but

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.090 
wasn't like he was getting hit off but
he<00:03:03.390> was<00:03:03.510> simply<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:04.260> having<00:03:04.530> some<00:03:04.740> trouble

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
he was simply just having some trouble

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.280 
he was simply just having some trouble
and<00:03:05.190> he<00:03:05.340> was<00:03:05.490> skipping<00:03:05.760> around<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.330> lot<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.720> they

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
and he was skipping around a lot so they

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.050 
and he was skipping around a lot so they
went<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.890> next<00:03:08.100> map<00:03:08.310> weren't<00:03:08.850> really

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
went on to the next map weren't really

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.060 
went on to the next map weren't really
focused<00:03:09.600> too<00:03:09.750> much<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:10.140> how<00:03:10.320> John<00:03:10.620> was<00:03:10.830> doing

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
focused too much on how John was doing

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.980 
focused too much on how John was doing
with<00:03:11.220> his<00:03:11.340> connection<00:03:11.850> and<00:03:12.030> decided<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.750> play

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
with his connection and decided to play

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.320 
with his connection and decided to play
it<00:03:13.020> now<00:03:13.560> during<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.010> second<00:03:14.460> map<00:03:14.670> crim<00:03:15.090> 6

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
it now during that second map crim 6

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.240 
it now during that second map crim 6
actually<00:03:15.750> got<00:03:15.870> hit<00:03:16.110> off<00:03:16.290> himself<00:03:16.620> i'm<00:03:17.070> not

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
actually got hit off himself i'm not

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.100 
actually got hit off himself i'm not
sure<00:03:17.460> what<00:03:17.610> happened<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.000> TPI<00:03:18.360> i<00:03:18.450> believe<00:03:18.959> that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
sure what happened to TPI i believe that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.320 
sure what happened to TPI i believe that
he<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.350> still<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.950> map<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.730> crim<00:03:21.090> 6

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
he was still in that map but a crim 6

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.150 
he was still in that map but a crim 6
did<00:03:21.540> get<00:03:21.690> hit<00:03:21.870> off<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:22.260> fear<00:03:22.739> ended<00:03:23.040> up

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
did get hit off and fear ended up

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.640 
did get hit off and fear ended up
winning<00:03:23.370> by<00:03:23.640> i<00:03:23.910> believe<00:03:24.330> about<00:03:24.600> three<00:03:25.230> flags

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
winning by i believe about three flags

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.590 
winning by i believe about three flags
so<00:03:25.980> there<00:03:26.430> was<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.670> lot<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.910> banter<00:03:27.180> going<00:03:27.330> back

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
so there was a lot of banter going back

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.750 
so there was a lot of banter going back
and<00:03:27.930> forth<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.650> know<00:03:28.709> obviously<00:03:28.890> a<00:03:29.459> lot

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
and forth and you know obviously a lot

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.180 
and forth and you know obviously a lot
confusion<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.230> why<00:03:31.350> MLG<00:03:31.860> wasn't

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
confusion and as to why MLG wasn't

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.890 
confusion and as to why MLG wasn't
laying<00:03:32.340> them<00:03:32.489> go<00:03:32.640> ahead<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:32.940> restart<00:03:33.330> it<00:03:33.540> but

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
laying them go ahead and restart it but

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.540 
laying them go ahead and restart it but
I<00:03:33.930> will<00:03:34.170> note<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.440> fear<00:03:34.890> was<00:03:35.070> actually<00:03:35.400> nice

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
I will note that fear was actually nice

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.430 
I will note that fear was actually nice
enough<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.910> restart<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.660> match<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:37.050> couple<00:03:37.380> of

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
enough to restart the match a couple of

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.350 
enough to restart the match a couple of
times<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.770> rather<00:03:37.920> restart<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.880> round<00:03:39.120> and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
times a rather restart the round and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.240 
times a rather restart the round and
restart<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.900> lobby<00:03:40.140> whenever<00:03:40.590> one<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.130> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
restart the lobby whenever one of the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.490 
restart the lobby whenever one of the
complexity<00:03:41.880> members<00:03:42.209> lagged<00:03:42.510> out<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.020> even

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
complexity members lagged out so even

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.840 
complexity members lagged out so even
though<00:03:43.590> they<00:03:43.739> weren't<00:03:43.890> technically<00:03:44.400> supposed

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
though they weren't technically supposed

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.729 
though they weren't technically supposed
to<00:03:45.090> do<00:03:45.300> that<00:03:45.510> they<00:03:45.900> ended<00:03:46.050> up<00:03:46.290> doing<00:03:46.350> that

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
to do that they ended up doing that

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.380 
to do that they ended up doing that
anyway<00:03:47.070> out<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.310> common<00:03:47.640> courtesy<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
anyway out of common courtesy so you

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.790 
anyway out of common courtesy so you
know<00:03:48.540> props<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.989> fear<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:49.320> doing<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.620> that

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
know props to fear for doing that that

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.370 
know props to fear for doing that that
was<00:03:49.890> nice<00:03:50.100> of<00:03:50.130> them<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.640> considerate<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:52.200> it

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
was nice of them and considerate but it

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.229 
was nice of them and considerate but it
resulted<00:03:52.830> in<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.070> win<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:53.430> fear<00:03:53.700> for<00:03:53.970> those<00:03:54.090> of

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
resulted in a win for fear for those of

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.820 
resulted in a win for fear for those of
you<00:03:54.330> who<00:03:54.540> didn't<00:03:55.080> already<00:03:55.200> know<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.530> mean<00:03:55.770> I

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
you who didn't already know I mean I

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.590 
you who didn't already know I mean I
kind<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.220> already<00:03:56.370> said<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.850> but<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.420> is

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
kind of already said it but that is

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.210 
kind of already said it but that is
essentially<00:03:58.140> what<00:03:58.170> happened<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.800> started<00:03:59.130> off

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
essentially what happened it started off

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.460 
essentially what happened it started off
with<00:03:59.370> TP<00:03:59.760> getting<00:04:00.060> hit<00:04:00.209> off<00:04:00.360> akes<00:04:00.810> got<00:04:01.140> hit<00:04:01.320> off

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
with TP getting hit off akes got hit off

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.620 
with TP getting hit off akes got hit off
in<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.739> last<00:04:01.920> minute<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.430> hard<00:04:02.760> point<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.300> off

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
in the last minute of hard point and off

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.120 
in the last minute of hard point and off
from<00:04:03.840> there<00:04:04.080> they<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.500> decided<00:04:04.830> we're<00:04:05.010> gonna

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
from there they just decided we're gonna

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.729 
from there they just decided we're gonna
go<00:04:05.340> ahead<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.700> play<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.450> off<00:04:06.720> play<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.440> off<00:04:07.560> of

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
go ahead and play it off play it off of

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.350 
go ahead and play it off play it off of
the<00:04:07.800> stream<00:04:08.100> see<00:04:08.370> if<00:04:08.459> anything<00:04:08.850> will<00:04:09.030> go<00:04:09.060> any

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
the stream see if anything will go any

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.630 
the stream see if anything will go any
differently<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.560> really<00:04:10.980> didn't<00:04:11.370> fear

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
differently and it really didn't fear

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.250 
differently and it really didn't fear
was<00:04:11.820> still<00:04:12.000> experiencing<00:04:12.660> some<00:04:12.840> connection

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
was still experiencing some connection

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.259 
was still experiencing some connection
issues<00:04:13.350> and<00:04:13.800> crim<00:04:14.250> sixx<00:04:14.489> ended<00:04:14.790> up<00:04:14.940> getting

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
issues and crim sixx ended up getting

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.720 
issues and crim sixx ended up getting
hit<00:04:15.480> offline<00:04:16.049> anyway<00:04:16.350> so<00:04:16.590> what<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.459> means

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
hit offline anyway so what this means

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.130 
hit offline anyway so what this means
for<00:04:17.790> complexity<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:18.810> they're<00:04:18.930> going<00:04:19.049> to

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
for complexity is that they're going to

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.300 
for complexity is that they're going to
be<00:04:19.200> bumped<00:04:19.500> down<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.919> loser's<00:04:20.280> bracket

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
be bumped down to the loser's bracket

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.340 
be bumped down to the loser's bracket
they<00:04:20.970> are<00:04:21.180> not<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.140> tournament

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
they are not out of the tournament

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.440 
they are not out of the tournament
they'll<00:04:23.010> simply<00:04:23.310> have<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.729> kind<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.150> like<00:04:24.270> ye

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
they'll simply have to kind of like ye

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.440 
they'll simply have to kind of like ye
OMG<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.110> play<00:04:25.320> basically<00:04:25.860> twice<00:04:26.669> the
