00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.710
 and me what's up we're here imation green 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.810
 and we are going to bring images and images 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.240
 seville that these images come 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.370
 good rivers sponsored in the school of 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.869
 art and such and such a school of 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.630
 design and told these gentlemen and I 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.989
 I can design new champions and we're going to 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.749
 see how it is like this is so handsome no and 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.430
 here we have the result not and we have 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.620
 the result 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.030
 let's take a quick look yes to 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.220
 what do you see and so 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.990
 very well 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.820
 and we see a little better 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.530
 Jarrio liked this 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.230
 character and the truth is that yes it has 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.120
 has potential this 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.550
 these days that he carries with a sword 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 chainsaw and then leads another sword 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.079
 this for example a rehash appears 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.300
 say has mixed with nose and is that 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.340
 clear fuck they do not go to environment to a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 character is the same as it is also 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.989
 is to another such as the universe 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.840
 of the plant not because it is not 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.940
 discarded this has potential 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.850
 this seems to have mixed with brand 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:17.070
 this one does not have 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.680
 it's rare, of course, how much less 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.760
 it would not be bad this would seem a bit 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.760
 dream but it is not dream 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.840
 it is rare that organ has damage 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.670
 but again it is as set by 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.490
 the same thing not crows and those things 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.229
 this we could say that it is also 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.030
 I bring that equal way but the truth is 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.159
 which is quite original and more like 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.090
 I should do is say is an uncle who 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.090
 transform into werewolf 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.370
 a werewolf and he has the pattern and 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.450
 It is also good 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.630
 Well wait it is together I do not have 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.750
 idea because here it appears as together not 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:03.280
 I have no idea this is a scanner but the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.360
 version spider this this but the wow the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.700
 sixth up esther wow 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.530
 so there are things that are very little 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.700
 originals really 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.700
 an archer 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.580
 and have a tail to remember the name of the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.400
 bug but even this character seen 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.520
 several times he mentions a lot I do not know what 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.540
 if you have seen it in another in another art 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.810
 conceptual or with the wow 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.010
 then we have here the water lord not 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.010
 I think I make a character 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.860
 of this kind again 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.060
 this is a stain of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:54.430
 of jeans and lollipop and completely 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.430
 I do not know what I do not know what it is 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.940
 do not be weird 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.400
 and then we have this one that has a 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.220
 similar posture in blue what more 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.510
 man in armor 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:11.750
 an aunt with a spear that would be pretty much 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.180
 original not that he arrived a think now 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:19.319
 I know he's sitting but 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:23.280
 but well this has a song and 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.590
 aside it's there it 's made and then 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200
 we have a battery that leads to a 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.500
 expression of tunnel boring machine in the hand that 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.690
 It is also quite original 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.800
 and the truth that I liked a lot 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.750
 I agree with God that the one who 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.290
 plus 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.540
 the one with the most potential in the day 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.969
 there are some out there rehashed as we have 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.170
 commented but above all it is very cool 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:55.359
 this aunt and the last one also the last 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.049
 he taught us this is also pretty 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.049
 well true 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.920
 Well, gentlemen, you can say a lot about 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.320
 color seems more cool more original today 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.300
 I wanted and what I wanted and that it was a 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.000
 champion 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.860
 nothing is favorite and give a lot of help 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.670
 any cost already go from theft 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.310
 commission crane 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.450
 and I think that I would really stay 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.770
 especially with this 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.819
 and the truth 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.819
 it also takes me 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.880
 I think we'll see you soon now
