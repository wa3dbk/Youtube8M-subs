would have a tongue going underneath a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.309 
would have a tongue going underneath a
groove<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.159> the<00:02:37.220> bench<00:02:37.579> to<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:38.390> ride<00:02:38.659> and<00:02:38.989> slide

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
on but I copied that technique and so

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.280 
on but I copied that technique and so
far<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.849> seems<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.659> worked<00:02:44.900> well<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:47.290> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290
