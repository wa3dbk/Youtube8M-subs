quakecraft<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.989> had<00:00:34.110> no<00:00:34.260> idea<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.620> was<00:00:34.800> at

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
quakecraft I had no idea what it was at

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
quakecraft I had no idea what it was at
the<00:00:35.040> time<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.640> he<00:00:35.730> showed<00:00:35.940> me<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.780> imagine

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the time but he showed me and I imagine

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.450 
the time but he showed me and I imagine
it's<00:00:37.230> supposed<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> Minecraft<00:00:38.340> version

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
it's supposed to be a Minecraft version

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's supposed to be a Minecraft version
of<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> game<00:00:39.149> quake<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:40.110> I've<00:00:40.200> never<00:00:40.350> played

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710

of the game quake now I've never played
quake<00:00:41.100> myself<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.940> have<00:00:42.059> seen<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
quake myself but I have seen it be in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
quake myself but I have seen it be in
play<00:00:42.750> before<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> felt<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
play before and but to me it felt a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.520 
play before and but to me it felt a
little<00:00:44.730> bit<00:00:44.910> like<00:00:45.200> unreal<00:00:46.200> tournament

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
little bit like unreal tournament

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
little bit like unreal tournament
because<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.399> did<00:00:47.550> play<00:00:47.700> quite<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> bit<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
because I did play quite a bit of that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.290 
because I did play quite a bit of that
game<00:00:48.539> when<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.890> younger<00:00:50.300> it's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
game when I was a lot younger it's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
game when I was a lot younger it's
really<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.750> fun<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.500> decided<00:00:52.860> after

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
really really fun and I decided after

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
really really fun and I decided after
winning<00:00:53.730> again<00:00:54.000> hit<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> few<00:00:54.329> games<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> 11<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
winning again hit a few games and 11 and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.180 
winning again hit a few games and 11 and
I<00:00:55.680> decided<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.510> in<00:00:57.510> case<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.930> win<00:00:58.710> again<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
I decided just in case I win again I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
I decided just in case I win again I
should<00:00:59.579> record<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.420> then<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.379> ever

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
should record this and then if I ever

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
should record this and then if I ever
need<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> use<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.460> somewhere<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.359> backing

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
need to use it somewhere as some backing

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
need to use it somewhere as some backing

and<00:02:27.910> Simon<00:02:28.300> are<00:02:28.420> looking<00:02:28.900> at<00:02:29.430> restarting<00:02:30.430> that

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
and Simon are looking at restarting that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.509 
and Simon are looking at restarting that
but<00:02:30.819> on<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> new<00:02:31.209> map<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.170> one<00:02:32.349> thing<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:32.830> we

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
but on a new map the one thing we we

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.210 
but on a new map the one thing we we
don't<00:02:33.760> know<00:02:33.849> what<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.090> do<00:02:34.239> is<00:02:34.450> what<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.870> call<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
don't know what to do is what to call it

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.130 
don't know what to do is what to call it
so<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.340> have<00:02:36.519> cool<00:02:36.790> ideas<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.720> reason<00:02:37.989> why

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
so we have cool ideas the reason why

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.020 
so we have cool ideas the reason why
restart<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.620> map<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:39.190> because<00:02:39.549> there's<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.849> few

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
restart the map is because there's a few

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.960 
restart the map is because there's a few
reasons<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.629> it's<00:02:40.989> been<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> big<00:02:41.349> break<00:02:41.670> too<00:02:42.670> we

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
reasons one it's been a big break too we

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.319 
reasons one it's been a big break too we
lost<00:02:43.239> a<00:02:43.420> good<00:02:43.690> chunk<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.470> map<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:45.329> three

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:46.329 
lost a good chunk of the map and three

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.240 
lost a good chunk of the map and three
it<00:02:46.569> would<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.810> nice<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.200> start<00:02:47.380> fresh<00:02:47.769> having

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
it would be nice to start fresh having

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.059 
it would be nice to start fresh having
learned<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.760> lot<00:02:49.090> about<00:02:49.530> making<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.620> cool<00:02:50.860> map

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
learned a lot about making a cool map

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.699 
learned a lot about making a cool map
and<00:02:51.310> they're<00:02:52.019> designing<00:02:53.019> things<00:02:53.349> me<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and they're designing things me and

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.870 
and they're designing things me and
someone<00:02:53.920> aren't<00:02:54.099> really<00:02:54.340> very<00:02:54.370> creative

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
someone aren't really very creative

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.140 
someone aren't really very creative
people<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.269> in<00:02:55.510> real<00:02:55.660> life<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.150> Korean

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
people in in real life and so a Korean

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.309 
people in in real life and so a Korean
so<00:02:58.269> in<00:02:58.360> Minecraft<00:02:58.750> we<00:02:58.870> learn<00:02:59.079> a<00:02:59.110> lot<00:02:59.260> from

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
so in Minecraft we learn a lot from

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.420 
so in Minecraft we learn a lot from
doing<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.739> think<00:02:59.890> we<00:02:59.950> learned<00:03:00.099> a<00:03:00.250> lot<00:03:00.370> from

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
doing it I think we learned a lot from

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.740 
doing it I think we learned a lot from
that<00:03:00.610> map<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.180> would<00:03:01.269> be<00:03:01.299> really<00:03:01.480> cool<00:03:01.690> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that map and it would be really cool to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.170 
that map and it would be really cool to
start<00:03:02.200> fresh<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.790> give<00:03:03.879> it<00:03:03.940> another<00:03:04.120> go

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
start fresh and you give it another go

going to be so you're not sure if you've
missed<00:04:01.000> one<00:04:01.269> because<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.690> random<00:04:02.049> timing

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
missed one because of the random timing

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.319 
missed one because of the random timing
of<00:04:02.470> when<00:04:02.530> it's<00:04:02.709> released<00:04:02.919> etc<00:04:03.489> if<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:04.180> more
