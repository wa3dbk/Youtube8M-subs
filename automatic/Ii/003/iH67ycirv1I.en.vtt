I<00:01:41.159> talked<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.640> last<00:01:41.880> week<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.299> far<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> guy

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
I talked about last week as far as a guy

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.050 
I talked about last week as far as a guy
that's<00:01:43.229> looking<00:01:43.979> pretty<00:01:44.189> good<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> looking

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that's looking pretty good and looking

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.670 
that's looking pretty good and looking
like<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.420> best<00:01:45.630> riding<00:01:45.990> back<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> Rams

like the best riding back for the Rams
and<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> Rams<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.970> seeing<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.299> same

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and I think the Rams are seeing the same

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
and I think the Rams are seeing the same
thing<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.229> know<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.619> God<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.979> was<00:01:50.100> a

healthy scratch of the first few weeks

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579

what<00:02:39.540> Fred<00:02:39.750> Jackson<00:02:40.230> was<00:02:40.410> Bryce<00:02:41.220> Brown<00:02:41.459> fits

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
what Fred Jackson was Bryce Brown fits

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.610 
what Fred Jackson was Bryce Brown fits
more<00:02:41.970> kind<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.299> what<00:02:42.450> CJ<00:02:42.780> spiller<00:02:43.080> was<00:02:43.319> if<00:02:43.470> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
more kind of what CJ spiller was if it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.289 
more kind of what CJ spiller was if it
was<00:02:43.769> me<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.100> I<00:02:44.160> had<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.489> pick<00:02:44.640> between<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.120> two

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
was me and I had to pick between the two

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.320 
was me and I had to pick between the two
I<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:46.019> go<00:02:46.170> Bryce<00:02:46.470> Brown<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.830> think<00:02:47.250> he's<00:02:47.430> it

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
I would go Bryce Brown I think he's it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.630 
I would go Bryce Brown I think he's it
has<00:02:48.510> more<00:02:48.840> upside<00:02:49.049> i<00:02:49.709> think<00:02:49.980> dixon<00:02:50.340> might<00:02:50.459> be<00:02:50.610> a

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
has more upside i think dixon might be a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.100 
has more upside i think dixon might be a
little<00:02:50.790> bit<00:02:50.940> safer<00:02:51.360> but<00:02:51.510> we're<00:02:51.750> not<00:02:51.870> going<00:02:52.049> to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
little bit safer but we're not going to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.110 
little bit safer but we're not going to
know<00:02:52.200> how<00:02:52.380> this<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.709> shakes<00:02:52.980> out<00:02:53.190> until<00:02:53.580> we

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
know how this one shakes out until we

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.750 
know how this one shakes out until we
see<00:02:54.330> them<00:02:54.510> play<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.980> both<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.430> are<00:02:56.610> worth

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
see them play but both of them are worth

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.430 
see them play but both of them are worth
adding<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.480> pretty<00:02:57.750> much<00:02:57.780> all<00:02:58.049> leagues<00:02:58.290> until

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
adding and pretty much all leagues until

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.830 
adding and pretty much all leagues until
we<00:02:58.739> see<00:02:58.950> how<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.250> one<00:02:59.400> shakes<00:02:59.700> out<00:02:59.910> Jonathan

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
we see how this one shakes out Jonathan

week<00:04:17.680> 7<00:04:18.070> they<00:04:18.190> were<00:04:18.250> playing<00:04:18.519> from<00:04:18.760> behind

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
week 7 they were playing from behind

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.110 
week 7 they were playing from behind
almost<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.019> entire<00:04:20.049> game<00:04:20.530> which<00:04:20.799> was

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
almost the entire game which was

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.610 
almost the entire game which was
surprising<00:04:22.120> against<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.630> rams<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.320> didn't

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
surprising against the rams and I didn't

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.890 
surprising against the rams and I didn't
really<00:04:23.650> see<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:24.160> one<00:04:24.370> coming<00:04:24.700> I<00:04:24.880> think<00:04:25.780> his

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
really see that one coming I think his

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.080 
really see that one coming I think his
targets<00:04:26.410> were<00:04:26.560> weighted<00:04:27.220> but<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.700> one<00:04:27.910> thing

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
targets were weighted but the one thing

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.790 
targets were weighted but the one thing
I<00:04:28.210> do<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.480> about<00:04:28.660> his<00:04:29.020> targets<00:04:29.410> is<00:04:29.500> that<00:04:29.650> he

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
I do like about his targets is that he

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.830 
I do like about his targets is that he
was<00:04:29.950> clearly<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.790> most<00:04:30.940> targeted<00:04:31.450> receiver

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
was clearly the most targeted receiver

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.140 
was clearly the most targeted receiver
and<00:04:32.110> I<00:04:32.139> think<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.590> will<00:04:32.740> continue<00:04:32.940> for<00:04:33.940> the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
and I think that will continue for the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.940 
and I think that will continue for the
see<00:04:34.419> how<00:04:34.570> for<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.080> Seahawks<00:04:35.470> as<00:04:35.650> far<00:04:35.860> as

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
see how for the Seahawks as far as

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.100 
see how for the Seahawks as far as
Baldwin<00:04:36.400> being<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:37.060> most<00:04:37.270> targeted<00:04:37.750> receiver

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
Baldwin being the most targeted receiver

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.810 
Baldwin being the most targeted receiver
for<00:04:38.290> them<00:04:38.440> so<00:04:38.560> I<00:04:38.590> do<00:04:38.710> like<00:04:39.010> him<00:04:39.220> as<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.400> must<00:04:39.639> add

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
for them so I do like him as a must add

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.090 
for them so I do like him as a must add

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.820 
defense that just they take a lot of
Gambel's<00:06:10.690> they<00:06:10.780> might<00:06:10.960> give<00:06:11.169> up<00:06:11.289> a<00:06:11.410> decent<00:06:11.590> lot

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
Gambel's they might give up a decent lot

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.740 
Gambel's they might give up a decent lot
of<00:06:11.919> points<00:06:12.250> but<00:06:12.400> they<00:06:12.520> score<00:06:12.940> fantasy<00:06:13.570> points

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
of points but they score fantasy points

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.270 
of points but they score fantasy points
because<00:06:14.530> they're<00:06:14.680> going<00:06:14.950> for<00:06:15.160> those

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
because they're going for those

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.370 
because they're going for those
interceptions<00:06:16.000> they're<00:06:16.750> returning<00:06:17.200> some

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
interceptions they're returning some

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.010 
interceptions they're returning some
kicks<00:06:17.620> for<00:06:17.860> four<00:06:18.340> touchdowns<00:06:18.520> so<00:06:19.240> I<00:06:19.450> think

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
kicks for four touchdowns so I think

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.930 
kicks for four touchdowns so I think
Billy<00:06:20.229> could<00:06:20.470> be<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:20.770> defense<00:06:21.190> I<00:06:21.340> like<00:06:21.700> them

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
Billy could be that defense I like them

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.879 
Billy could be that defense I like them
from<00:06:22.180> here<00:06:22.389> on<00:06:22.510> out<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.900> think<00:06:23.289> there<00:06:23.410> must<00:06:23.620> add

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
from here on out I think there must add

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:25.890 
from here on out I think there must add
in<00:06:24.010> all<00:06:24.100> leagues<00:06:24.370> and<00:06:25.270> then<00:06:25.360> Miami's<00:06:25.750> defense

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
in all leagues and then Miami's defense

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.080 
in all leagues and then Miami's defense
is<00:06:26.260> my<00:06:26.409> pick<00:06:26.590> up<00:06:26.740> and<00:06:26.890> play<00:06:27.099> it's<00:06:27.460> their<00:06:27.849> chance

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
is my pick up and play it's their chance

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.600
