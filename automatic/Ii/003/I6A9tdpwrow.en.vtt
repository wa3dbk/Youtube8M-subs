00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.690
 good morning dear viewers 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.309
 today's topic is the processing of bulbous 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.370
 before landing in particular we will 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.099
 talking about onions and garlic means to 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.880
 order to save all the same plants from 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.610
 onion flies from thrips and not give and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.950
 virus strike our wonderful 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.540
 plants such as onions and garlic we will 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.590
 use drugs like 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.750
 Karbofos Commander Maxim we already to them 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.239
 used to and how they work you already 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.240
 probably remember it means karbofos need 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 dilute a tablespoon per 10 liters 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.760
 water can be 5 but it is too strong 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.070
 the solution will be there for 2 liters 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.940
 let's literally fill a teaspoon 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.790
 incomplete 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.440
 now we need to dilute maxfilm solution 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.390
 will be bright red 6 solution to 1 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 vial 2 liters divorced this 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.180
 quite enough and what are we going to do 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 farther 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.020
 notice the two solutions are completely different 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.960
 this one from pests this one from diseases 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.479
 it means that we are on a kilo of landing 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 I have half a kilo of material here 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.800
 more I spill out all the onions can it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 trim for the winter can not trim for 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.080
 I'll bathe him in the winter here 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.909
 follows and will leave here for 30 40 minutes 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.530
 this is a mandatory procedure no 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.049
 no trouble for you he 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.060
 lay down the earth the whole winter all substances 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.520
 which we use for processing from 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.740
 pretty they decay naturally and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.229
 when it's about half an hour or forty 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.000
 minutes is the maximum you must necessarily 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.460
 remember that without rinsing in water 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 send this onion into the maxim solution 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.850
 this antiviral fraction of onion you 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.760
 necessarily and dry and slightly 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.580

 must remember planting onions produced 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.769
 three weeks before the onset of sustainable 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.109
 cold onion does not like warm soil he has 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.170
 not difficult to release so plant 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:33.650

 planting material please do not

 buy into a very large fraction 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.560
 onions the point is that a large fraction 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:48.139
 onion gives a good potion remember 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.290
