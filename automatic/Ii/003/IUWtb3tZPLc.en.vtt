what you're making in the answer is yes
in<00:00:39.700> wheel<00:00:39.970> throwing<00:00:40.240> I<00:00:40.480> have<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.720> Center<00:00:41.080> the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
in wheel throwing I have to Center the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.760 
in wheel throwing I have to Center the
clay<00:00:41.320> first<00:00:41.710> I<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.930> to<00:00:43.990> get<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.260> going<00:00:44.410> up<00:00:44.650> and

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
clay first I have to get it going up and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.990 
clay first I have to get it going up and
down<00:00:44.860> so<00:00:45.190> even<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> very<00:00:45.610> core<00:00:45.910> get<00:00:46.210> centered

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.819 

once<00:00:53.000> it's<00:00:53.180> centered

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
once it's centered

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.009 
once it's centered
we're<00:00:55.309> going<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.579> open<00:00:55.670> it<00:00:55.850> up<00:00:55.999> and<00:00:56.210> we're

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
we're going to open it up and we're

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.369 
we're going to open it up and we're
going<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.260> lift<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:58.129> walls<00:00:59.230> lifting<00:01:00.230> as<00:01:00.350> a

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
going to lift the walls lifting as a

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.200 
going to lift the walls lifting as a
term<00:01:00.679> it's<00:01:00.980> really<00:01:01.280> not<00:01:01.399> lifting<00:01:01.789> as<00:01:01.909> much<00:01:02.059> as

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
term it's really not lifting as much as

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.420 
term it's really not lifting as much as
squeezing<00:01:02.690> together<00:01:02.920> pushing<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.070> middle

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
squeezing together pushing to the middle

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:14.380 
squeezing together pushing to the middle
and<00:01:05.180> those<00:01:05.360> walls<00:01:06.159> will<00:01:07.159> rise<00:01:07.340> up

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.780 

now<00:01:14.930> this<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.290> white<00:01:15.530> stoneware<00:01:15.950> stoneware

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
now this is a white stoneware stoneware

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.469 
now this is a white stoneware stoneware
refers<00:01:17.090> to<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.420> temperature<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.080> clay<00:01:19.479> it

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
refers to the temperature of the clay it

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.250 
refers to the temperature of the clay it
fires<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:21.050> about<00:01:21.229> 24<00:01:21.680> hundred<00:01:21.830> degrees<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.260> at

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
fires to about 24 hundred degrees and at

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.320 
fires to about 24 hundred degrees and at
that<00:01:24.409> temperature<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:25.430> glass<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:26.060> melts

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
that temperature the glass and it melts

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.940 
that temperature the glass and it melts
enough<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.110> impervious<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.740> water

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
enough so that it's impervious to water

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.310 
enough so that it's impervious to water
that's<00:01:28.940> important<00:01:29.479> because<00:01:29.600> stoneware<00:01:30.170> is

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
that's important because stoneware is

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.140 
that's important because stoneware is
used<00:01:30.560> for<00:01:30.770> dinners<00:01:31.070> where<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.670> things<00:01:31.970> like

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
used for dinners where and things like

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.640 
used for dinners where and things like
that<00:01:33.250> lower<00:01:34.250> temperature<00:01:34.850> clays<00:01:35.119> are

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
that lower temperature clays are

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.340 
that lower temperature clays are
earthenware<00:01:36.650> clays<00:01:37.270> such<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:38.450> flowerpots<00:01:39.020> and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
earthenware clays such as flowerpots and

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.800 
earthenware clays such as flowerpots and
they<00:01:40.190> no<00:01:40.340> fire<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:41.000> hot<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:41.450> they're<00:01:41.600> not<00:01:41.750> going

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
they no fire is hot so they're not going

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.630 
they no fire is hot so they're not going
to<00:01:42.080> be<00:01:42.290> impervious<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.950> water<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.430> that's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
to be impervious to water and that's

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.969 
to be impervious to water and that's
really<00:01:43.970> what<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:44.810> want<00:01:45.110> when<00:01:45.409> you're<00:01:45.560> using

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
really what you want when you're using

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.930 
really what you want when you're using
flower<00:01:46.850> pots<00:01:47.149> for<00:01:47.270> example<00:01:48.640> so<00:01:49.640> there's<00:01:49.820> many

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
flower pots for example so there's many

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.540 
flower pots for example so there's many
kinds<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:50.630> clay<00:01:50.810> some<00:01:51.170> for<00:01:51.410> sculpture<00:01:51.740> some<00:01:52.220> or

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
kinds of clay some for sculpture some or

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.760 
kinds of clay some for sculpture some or
more<00:01:52.759> plastic<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:53.420> throwing<00:01:54.110> such<00:01:54.500> as<00:01:54.619> I'm

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
more plastic for throwing such as I'm

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.350 
more plastic for throwing such as I'm
doing<00:01:57.369> as<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.490> see<00:01:58.640> I'm<00:01:58.759> lifting<00:01:58.970> that's

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
doing as you see I'm lifting that's

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.520 
doing as you see I'm lifting that's
going<00:01:59.509> to<00:01:59.570> take<00:01:59.720> at<00:01:59.840> least<00:01:59.960> a<00:02:00.110> half<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.410> dozen

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
going to take at least a half a dozen

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.960 
going to take at least a half a dozen
lifts<00:02:01.240> to<00:02:02.240> get<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.539> height<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.380> need

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
lifts to get the height that you need

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.229 
lifts to get the height that you need
and<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.090> goal<00:02:05.330> here<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:06.710> to<00:02:07.490> get<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.060> height

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
and my goal here is to get the height

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.530 
and my goal here is to get the height
and<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:09.380> thinness<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:10.070> want<00:02:10.670> uniform<00:02:11.209> thinness

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and the thinness I want uniform thinness

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.060 
and the thinness I want uniform thinness
from<00:02:11.840> top<00:02:12.050> to<00:02:12.080> bottom<00:02:14.530> reason<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:15.709> that<00:02:15.830> is

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
from top to bottom reason for that is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.479 
from top to bottom reason for that is
that<00:02:16.430> clay<00:02:17.000> shrinks<00:02:17.829> ten<00:02:18.829> eleven<00:02:19.220> percent

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
that clay shrinks ten eleven percent

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.860 
that clay shrinks ten eleven percent
sometimes<00:02:20.060> as<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:21.019> dries<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.650> fires<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.870> so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
sometimes as it dries and fires and so

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.810 
sometimes as it dries and fires and so
in<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.320> drying<00:02:24.590> process<00:02:24.769> if<00:02:25.250> one<00:02:25.430> part<00:02:25.700> is

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
in the drying process if one part is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.880 
in the drying process if one part is
thicker<00:02:26.090> than<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.360> other<00:02:26.600> and<00:02:26.810> dries<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.829> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
thicker than the other and dries it a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.819 
thicker than the other and dries it a
different<00:02:28.040> rate<00:02:28.280> it's<00:02:28.459> going<00:02:28.579> to<00:02:28.670> crack<00:02:29.829> and

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
different rate it's going to crack and

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.990 
different rate it's going to crack and
we<00:02:30.920> don't<00:02:31.010> want<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:33.250> I'm<00:02:34.250> obsessed<00:02:34.760> about

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
we don't want that so I'm obsessed about

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
we don't want that so I'm obsessed about
finished<00:02:35.420> lifting<00:02:35.660> here

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.840 

I'm<00:02:41.189> trying<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.640> keep

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
I'm trying to keep

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.230 
I'm trying to keep
the<00:02:43.450> walls<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.460> center<00:02:45.640> as<00:02:45.880> much<00:02:46.090> as

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
the walls in to the center as much as

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.440 
the walls in to the center as much as
possible<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.800> as<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.490> wheel<00:02:48.790> spins<00:02:49.210> its

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
possible because as this wheel spins its

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.720 
possible because as this wheel spins its
trying<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.750> drive<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.290> clay<00:02:50.440> outward<00:02:50.800> so<00:02:51.580> it's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
trying to drive the clay outward so it's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.120 
trying to drive the clay outward so it's
very<00:02:51.970> easy<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.930> walls<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.710> go<00:02:53.800> outward

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
very easy to get the walls to go outward

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.010 
very easy to get the walls to go outward
not<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:55.090> easy<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.600> keep<00:02:55.900> them<00:02:56.080> tightened<00:02:56.470> in<00:02:58.020> so

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
not so easy to keep them tightened in so

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.660 
not so easy to keep them tightened in so
I<00:02:59.050> have<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> get<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.530> height<00:02:59.800> then<00:03:00.370> you<00:03:00.520> can

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
I have to get that height then you can

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.160 
I have to get that height then you can
shape<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.150> pot<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.850> water<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.330> used<00:03:04.570> as<00:03:05.020> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
shape the pot the water is used as a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.870 
shape the pot the water is used as a
lubricant<00:03:05.800> so<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> clay<00:03:06.340> doesn't<00:03:06.580> stick<00:03:06.850> to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
lubricant so the clay doesn't stick to

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.650 
lubricant so the clay doesn't stick to
it<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.560> my<00:03:08.680> fingers<00:03:09.150> I'm<00:03:10.150> going<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.330> redouble

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it so my fingers I'm going to redouble

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.180 
it so my fingers I'm going to redouble
the<00:03:10.900> wall<00:03:11.080> on<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.590> top<00:03:13.740> that's<00:03:14.740> for<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.010> little

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
the wall on the top that's for a little

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.720 
the wall on the top that's for a little
strength

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.910 

and<00:03:18.090> then<00:03:18.450> we'll<00:03:18.569> start<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.900> widen<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.349> pot

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.710 

as<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.730> gets<00:03:24.849> wider<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.330> probably<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.660> to

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
as it gets wider it's probably going to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.220 
as it gets wider it's probably going to
drop<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.050> height<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.620> bit<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
drop in height a little bit and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.600 
drop in height a little bit and
basically<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.319> can<00:03:32.380> get<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.770> as<00:03:32.860> wide<00:03:33.069> as<00:03:33.280> i<00:03:33.370> want

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
basically I can get it as wide as i want

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.040 
basically I can get it as wide as i want
i<00:03:33.700> can<00:03:33.790> make<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.090> perfect<00:03:34.270> circle<00:03:34.690> if<00:03:34.930> i

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
i can make it a perfect circle if i

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:42.130 
i can make it a perfect circle if i
wanted<00:03:39.030> now

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.470 

it's<00:03:42.860> taken<00:03:43.220> maybe<00:03:43.520> a<00:03:43.700> couple<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.120> minutes<00:03:44.330> to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
it's taken maybe a couple of minutes to

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.949 
it's taken maybe a couple of minutes to
make<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:44.870> but<00:03:45.740> in<00:03:45.980> fact<00:03:46.220> there's<00:03:46.760> five<00:03:47.480> times

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
make this but in fact there's five times

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.590 
make this but in fact there's five times
or<00:03:48.260> even<00:03:48.290> more<00:03:48.740> times<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.370> amount<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.700> work<00:03:49.910> in

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
or even more times the amount of work in

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.980 
or even more times the amount of work in
the<00:03:50.840> studio<00:03:51.110> at<00:03:51.380> home<00:03:51.760> because<00:03:52.900> throwing<00:03:53.900> the

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
the studio at home because throwing the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.750 
the studio at home because throwing the
pot<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:54.350> one<00:03:54.560> thing<00:03:54.830> I<00:03:55.069> have<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.250> trim<00:03:55.610> it

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
pot is one thing I have to trim it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.810 
pot is one thing I have to trim it
decorate<00:03:56.300> it<00:03:56.450> I<00:03:56.660> have<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.500> fire<00:03:57.770> twice<00:03:58.190> once<00:03:58.670> to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
decorate it I have to fire twice once to

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.080 
decorate it I have to fire twice once to
a<00:03:59.270> bisque<00:03:59.750> fire<00:04:00.020> which<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.520> allowing<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.820> clay

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
a bisque fire which is allowing the clay

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.440 
a bisque fire which is allowing the clay
or<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.510> pot<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.050> be<00:04:03.200> used<00:04:04.060> in<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.240> glaze

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
or the pot to be used in the glaze

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.310 
or the pot to be used in the glaze
mixing<00:04:06.050> I<00:04:06.730> add<00:04:07.730> glaze<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.300> it<00:04:08.450> after<00:04:08.959> it's

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
mixing I add glaze to it after it's

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.100 
mixing I add glaze to it after it's
bisque<00:04:09.530> fired<00:04:09.800> I<00:04:10.100> fired<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.820> second<00:04:11.209> time<00:04:11.360> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
bisque fired I fired a second time the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.990 
bisque fired I fired a second time the
first<00:04:12.140> time<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.650> about<00:04:12.800> 2,000<00:04:13.340> degrees<00:04:13.580> second

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
first time is about 2,000 degrees second

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.509 
first time is about 2,000 degrees second
time<00:04:14.120> about<00:04:14.390> 2300<00:04:15.170> degrees<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.739> that's<00:04:16.310> a

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
time about 2300 degrees and that's a

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.350 
time about 2300 degrees and that's a
glaze<00:04:16.760> fire<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:20.239> glaze<00:04:20.480> fire<00:04:20.810> is<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:22.360> point

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
glaze fire and the glaze fire is a point

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.800 
glaze fire and the glaze fire is a point
where<00:04:23.540> the<00:04:23.750> glaze<00:04:24.050> will<00:04:24.350> melt<00:04:24.650> over<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.070> pot

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
where the glaze will melt over the pot

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.370 
where the glaze will melt over the pot
and<00:04:27.760> form<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.910> color<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.450> texture<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.320> I

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
and form the color and texture that I

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.870 
and form the color and texture that I
need<00:04:31.720> for<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.810> final<00:04:33.110> decoration<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.890> whole

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
need for the final decoration the whole

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.220 
need for the final decoration the whole
process<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.419> going<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.720> take<00:04:35.780> about<00:04:35.990> two<00:04:36.290> weeks

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
process is going to take about two weeks

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.690 
process is going to take about two weeks
so<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:39.440> few<00:04:39.680> minute<00:04:39.919> process<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.430> only<00:04:40.610> a

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
so this few minute process is only a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:49.080 
so this few minute process is only a
small<00:04:40.790> part<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.780> what<00:04:42.320> really<00:04:42.770> occurs

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.150 

I<00:04:49.210> think<00:04:49.750> pottery<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.230> kind<00:04:50.470> of<00:04:50.590> unique<00:04:50.710> in<00:04:51.010> the

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
I think pottery is kind of unique in the

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.040 
I think pottery is kind of unique in the
sense<00:04:51.190> that<00:04:51.520> there's<00:04:52.360> very<00:04:52.600> few<00:04:52.690> tools

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
sense that there's very few tools

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.010 
sense that there's very few tools
involved<00:04:53.500> I'm<00:04:54.400> going<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:54.760> have<00:04:54.850> my<00:04:55.030> wheel<00:04:55.270> and

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
involved I'm going to have my wheel and

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.159 
involved I'm going to have my wheel and
I<00:04:56.080> do<00:04:56.199> have<00:04:56.350> kilns<00:04:56.970> but<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.090> make<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.630> just

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
I do have kilns but to make it is just

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.110 
I do have kilns but to make it is just
basically<00:04:59.560> as<00:04:59.830> you<00:04:59.979> can<00:05:00.130> see<00:05:00.280> just<00:05:00.310> my<00:05:00.639> hand<00:05:00.850> so

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
basically as you can see just my hand so

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.620 
basically as you can see just my hand so
far<00:05:01.949> we<00:05:02.949> do<00:05:03.100> have<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.310> few<00:05:03.729> little<00:05:03.970> tools<00:05:04.330> a

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
far we do have a few little tools a

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.480 
far we do have a few little tools a
sponge<00:05:04.960> that<00:05:05.350> takes<00:05:05.680> away<00:05:05.800> water<00:05:06.160> from<00:05:06.370> the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
sponge that takes away water from the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.460 
sponge that takes away water from the
pot<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:06.940> a<00:05:07.660> couple<00:05:07.900> of<00:05:08.190> scraping<00:05:09.190> tools<00:05:10.470> to

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
pot and a couple of scraping tools to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.780 
pot and a couple of scraping tools to
use<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.650> take<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.010> little<00:05:12.250> extra<00:05:12.400> from<00:05:12.639> the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
use to take a little extra from the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.040 
use to take a little extra from the
bottom<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.940> basically<00:05:16.479> take<00:05:16.750> out<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
bottom and to basically take out the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.400 
bottom and to basically take out the
finger<00:05:17.290> lines<00:05:17.500> make<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:17.860> pot<00:05:18.010> smooth<00:05:19.410> other

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
finger lines make the pot smooth other

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.659 
finger lines make the pot smooth other
than<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.740> although<00:05:21.130> there<00:05:21.280> are<00:05:21.340> other<00:05:21.460> tools

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
than that although there are other tools

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.820 
than that although there are other tools
you<00:05:21.910> can<00:05:22.060> use<00:05:22.090> you<00:05:22.660> don't<00:05:22.870> really<00:05:23.110> need<00:05:23.380> them<00:05:23.560> I

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
you can use you don't really need them I

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.159 
you can use you don't really need them I
think<00:05:24.580> other<00:05:24.729> crafts<00:05:25.150> require<00:05:25.479> a<00:05:25.510> lot<00:05:25.750> more<00:05:25.780> in

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
think other crafts require a lot more in

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:35.190 
think other crafts require a lot more in
that<00:05:26.590> respect

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.200 

so<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.830> think<00:05:36.010> I'm<00:05:36.310> just<00:05:36.550> about<00:05:36.730> finished<00:05:36.790> with

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
so I think I'm just about finished with

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:47.090 
so I think I'm just about finished with
this<00:05:37.450> one

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.950 

and<00:05:47.640> again<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:47.910> can<00:05:48.120> make<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.330> a<00:05:48.390> perfect<00:05:48.570> circle

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
and again I can make it a perfect circle

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.080 
and again I can make it a perfect circle
but<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.290> think<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.920> sort<00:05:50.460> of<00:05:50.580> like<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.730> more<00:05:50.970> of<00:05:51.030> a

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
but I think I sort of like a more of a

00:05:51.090 --> 00:06:00.770 
but I think I sort of like a more of a
classic<00:05:51.240> Greek<00:05:51.690> kind<00:05:52.260> of<00:05:52.470> earn<00:05:53.330> when<00:05:54.330> I<00:05:54.360> throw

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.510 

so<00:06:01.380> again<00:06:01.620> this<00:06:01.740> will<00:06:01.920> take<00:06:02.010> about<00:06:02.160> a<00:06:02.310> week<00:06:02.460> to

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
so again this will take about a week to

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.730 
so again this will take about a week to
dry<00:06:02.820> to<00:06:02.850> firings<00:06:03.630> later<00:06:03.900> two<00:06:04.260> weeks<00:06:04.440> later

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
dry to firings later two weeks later

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.570 
dry to firings later two weeks later
it'll<00:06:05.430> be<00:06:05.580> ready<00:06:05.910> for<00:06:06.210> sale<00:06:07.310> this<00:06:08.310> will<00:06:08.490> be
