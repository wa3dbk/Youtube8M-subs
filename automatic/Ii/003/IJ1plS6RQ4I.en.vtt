to a moment in the film without it being
exact<00:01:13.020> screengrab<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:14.070> we<00:01:14.189> decided<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> do

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
exact screengrab when we decided to do

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.010 
exact screengrab when we decided to do
Boromir<00:01:15.149> there<00:01:15.299> were<00:01:15.390> several<00:01:15.600> scenes<00:01:15.869> we

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
Boromir there were several scenes we

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.240 
Boromir there were several scenes we
could<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.229> picked<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.039> we<00:01:17.130> actually

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
could have picked from but we actually

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
could have picked from but we actually
thought<00:01:17.609> it<00:01:17.729> would<00:01:17.820> be<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> lot<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.149> fun<00:01:18.329> to<00:01:18.509> do<00:01:18.719> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
thought it would be a lot of fun to do a
