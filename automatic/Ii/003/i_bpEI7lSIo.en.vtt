like the inner third and it's going to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.070 
like the inner third and it's going to
really<00:02:20.430> open<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.850> my<00:02:21.210> eyes<00:02:21.390> make<00:02:21.750> them<00:02:21.840> look<00:02:21.930> a

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
really open up my eyes make them look a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.720 
really open up my eyes make them look a
lot<00:02:22.200> brighter<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:22.830> just<00:02:23.100> answer<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.520> look

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
lot brighter and just answer the look

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and it's more like a cream color so I

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.010 
and it's more like a cream color so I
think<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> sport<00:02:27.090> do<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.360> mac<00:02:27.540> fix+

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
think when you sport do it the mac fix+

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.710 
think when you sport do it the mac fix+
like<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.860> did<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.310> really<00:02:29.700> makes<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.150> pop<00:02:30.210> and

the outer portion of my eye and using a

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:05.309
