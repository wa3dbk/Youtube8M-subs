00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
see it but it's it's a pretty good

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.140 
see it but it's it's a pretty good
concave<00:01:32.280> too<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:34.729> yeah

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
concave too so and yeah

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300

the<00:01:36.329> wheels<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.810> okay<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:38.040> want<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the wheels are okay I don't want to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.609 
the wheels are okay I don't want to
really<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> wheels<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.140> tensor

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
really like the wheels but the tensor

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
really like the wheels but the tensor
trucks<00:01:40.920> are<00:01:41.070> amazing<00:01:41.670> probably<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> best

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
trucks are amazing probably the best

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.999 
trucks are amazing probably the best
part<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> board<00:01:44.689> and<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.500> thing<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> I

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
part of the board and the thing that I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.310 
part of the board and the thing that I
do<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.340> like<00:01:47.640> about<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.119> board<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.170> it

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
do not like about this board is that it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.609 
do not like about this board is that it
chips<00:01:49.710> good<00:01:50.430> sear<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:52.259> chips<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:53.009> bad<00:01:54.619> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
chips good sear it chips pretty bad and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.670 
chips good sear it chips pretty bad and
another<00:01:56.520> thing<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.170> gets<00:01:58.350> pressure

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
another thing is that it gets pressure

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
another thing is that it gets pressure
cracks<00:01:59.100> I'm<00:02:00.090> not<00:02:00.240> sure<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.780> see<00:02:01.049> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
cracks I'm not sure if you can see it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.780 
cracks I'm not sure if you can see it
but<00:02:02.509> do<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.600> probably<00:02:03.899> see<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:05.610> like

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
but do you probably see it it's like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.760 
but do you probably see it it's like
right<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.509> right<00:02:07.069> here<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.459> pretty<00:02:08.700> bad

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
right here right here it's pretty bad

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.280
