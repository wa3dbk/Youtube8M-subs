00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
still considering maybe going a little

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.859

bit shorter now that I've done it and I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.420 
bit shorter now that I've done it and I
did<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.170> because<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.829> guys<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.250> I've
