00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
really much in here now it's a red case

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.450 
really much in here now it's a red case
oh<00:00:17.600> yeah<00:00:18.600> that's<00:00:18.810> pretty<00:00:19.260> interesting<00:00:19.470> look

you can't you can only hear it but wow
that<00:00:24.810> feels<00:00:24.990> pretty<00:00:25.560> good<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.949> mean<00:00:26.250> it's<00:00:26.430> like

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
that feels pretty good I mean it's like

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.820 
that feels pretty good I mean it's like
a<00:00:26.609> like<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.240> vibrating<00:00:27.779> lucky<00:00:28.170> ripping<00:00:28.470> open<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a like a vibrating lucky ripping open a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.259 
a like a vibrating lucky ripping open a
present<00:00:29.130> or<00:00:29.429> something<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.789> Christmas<00:00:29.820> it's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
present or something at Christmas it's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.330 
present or something at Christmas it's
just<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.929> was<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> nice<00:00:31.230> feel<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:32.009> wasn't

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
just that was a nice feel that wasn't

you

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.950 
you
I<00:00:32.610> reckon<00:00:33.030> there's<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.329> engineering<00:00:33.780> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I reckon there's some engineering that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
I reckon there's some engineering that
goes<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.680> they<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.100> these<00:00:35.309> boxes

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
goes into the way they make these boxes

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.690 
goes into the way they make these boxes
in<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.300> way<00:00:36.420> they<00:00:36.570> open<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:38.160> has<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> be

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
in the way they open just it has to be

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310 
in the way they open just it has to be
it's<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.360> not<00:00:39.600> many<00:00:39.750> products<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.260> there

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
it's just not many products out there

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.600 
it's just not many products out there
that<00:00:40.530> I've<00:00:40.649> seen<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.309> kind<00:00:41.370> of

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610

iPhone anyway I digress back to this a
little<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.660> instruction<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.410> showing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
little bit of instruction here showing

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
I brought some covers for my iPhone 4 in

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
I brought some covers for my iPhone 4 in

around the edges scratch them
third-party<00:01:24.060> ones<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.600> they'll<00:01:24.990> from

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
third-party ones and they'll from

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.800 
third-party ones and they'll from
well-known<00:01:25.530> brands<00:01:26.240> get<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> was

well-known brands get go I think it was

well-known brands get go I think it was
anyway<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> field<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.390> feels<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
anyway so this is the field this feels a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.080 
anyway so this is the field this feels a
lot<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:31.229> grippier<00:01:31.860> than<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.579> leather<00:01:32.820> case

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
lot more grippier than the leather case

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.899 
lot more grippier than the leather case
I<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> admit<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.040> wow<00:01:35.040> yeah<00:01:35.490> really

pops<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> color<00:01:38.970> pops<00:01:39.390> when<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
pops the color pops when you when you

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
pops the color pops when you when you
put<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> white<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.909> why<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
put it to the white and that's why I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.120 
put it to the white and that's why I
went<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> guess<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.409> green<00:01:43.710> also

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
went for this one I guess the green also

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
went for this one I guess the green also
got<00:01:44.670> me<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.210> there<00:01:45.540> might<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.899> green

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
got me I think there might be a green

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
got me I think there might be a green
coming<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.920> again<00:01:47.189> if<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.939> search<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.240> my

and all the silicon in different cover

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
and all the silicon in different cover
cases<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.619> reviewed<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.130> did<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
cases that I have reviewed I did them in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.719 
cases that I have reviewed I did them in
the<00:01:56.579> store<00:01:57.560> it<00:01:58.560> was<00:01:58.680> quite<00:01:58.920> quick<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.549> you'll

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the store it was quite quick but you'll

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
the store it was quite quick but you'll
get<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.030> idea<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.540> used<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.140> demo<00:02:01.530> white<00:02:01.710> phone

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
get an idea I used a demo white phone

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.230 
get an idea I used a demo white phone
that<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.640> popped<00:02:02.850> them<00:02:02.939> all<00:02:03.090> on

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
that was there and I popped them all on

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.490 
that was there and I popped them all on
so<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> look<00:02:03.750> into<00:02:03.899> my<00:02:03.990> channel<00:02:04.170> and

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
so have a look into my channel and

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.730 
so have a look into my channel and
you'll<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:05.149> every<00:02:06.149> case<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:07.079> sort<00:02:07.710> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you'll see every case was sort of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.710 
you'll see every case was sort of
compared<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.190> put<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.060> see<00:02:09.270> but

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
compared and put on so you can see but

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.180 
compared and put on so you can see but
these<00:02:09.869> are<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.110> ones<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.410> chose<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.890> went<00:02:11.069> for

these are the ones I chose I went for

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.350 
these are the ones I chose I went for
the<00:02:11.250> red<00:02:11.430> silicon<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:11.940> that's<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> looks

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the red silicon so that's what it looks

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.460 
the red silicon so that's what it looks
like<00:02:12.720> again

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
like again

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.890
