00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
bit difficult to fly with but let's do a

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.139 
bit difficult to fly with but let's do a
beta<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.520> weapons

beta so here we are it has the weapons
to<00:00:42.750> FF<00:00:43.290> our<00:00:43.530> pods<00:00:45.980> we<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> test<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:53.690> as

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to FF our pods we can test them now as

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.939 
to FF our pods we can test them now as
you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.110> those<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:56.039> deadly<00:00:56.219> ones<00:00:56.579> and

work<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:16.240> got<00:03:16.420> our<00:03:16.740> VTOL<00:03:17.740> and<00:03:18.430> we<00:03:18.670> got<00:03:18.910> some

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
work we got our VTOL and we got some

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.970 
work we got our VTOL and we got some
targets<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.170> destroy<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:24.100> material<00:03:24.730> is

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.880

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
using my opinion way better than the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.700 
using my opinion way better than the
mi-28<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:37.450> might<00:03:37.660> want<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.990> wait<00:03:38.140> still<00:03:38.680> a

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
mi-28 but it might want to wait still a

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.560 
mi-28 but it might want to wait still a
better<00:03:38.950> remember<00:03:39.670> um<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:42.730> one<00:03:43.000> got<00:03:43.240> its

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
better remember um so this one got its

00:03:43.570 --> 00:04:28.080 
better remember um so this one got its
rockets<00:03:44.200> and<00:03:44.680> got<00:03:45.250> its<00:03:45.460> machine<00:03:45.910> gun

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:37.310 

it<00:04:29.090> must<00:04:29.450> aim<00:04:29.750> to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.760 

so<00:04:38.670> this<00:04:39.670> is<00:04:39.820> my<00:04:40.060> creations<00:04:41.040> this<00:04:42.040> was<00:04:42.190> at<00:04:42.400> work
