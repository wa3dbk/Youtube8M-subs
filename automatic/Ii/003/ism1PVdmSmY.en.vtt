measure<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> braddock<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:58.109> believe

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
measure on the braddock and I believe

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.710 
these these are the rod laver shoes no
these<00:01:50.280> are<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> old<00:01:50.850> versions<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.480> actually

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
these are the old versions I actually

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.560 
these are the old versions I actually
have<00:01:52.050> had<00:01:52.170> these<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.760> probably<00:01:53.760> like<00:01:53.910> 7<00:01:54.330> years

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
have had these for probably like 7 years

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.150 
have had these for probably like 7 years
or<00:01:54.720> something<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.230> sort<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.590> hesitant<00:01:56.100> to

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
or something and I'm sort of hesitant to

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.190 
or something and I'm sort of hesitant to
get<00:01:56.370> rid<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.670> them<00:01:56.820> because<00:01:57.690> what<00:01:57.870> happened

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
get rid of them because what happened

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.110 
get rid of them because what happened
was<00:01:58.230> during<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.620> time<00:01:58.910> adidas

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
was during that time adidas

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.510 
was during that time adidas
stopped<00:02:00.930> making<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.440> Rod<00:02:01.620> Laver<00:02:01.800> shoe<00:02:02.190> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
stopped making the Rod Laver shoe and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
stopped making the Rod Laver shoe and
then<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.390> recently<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.900> think<00:02:04.200> within<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
then just recently I think within the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
then just recently I think within the
last<00:02:04.680> year<00:02:05.010> or<00:02:05.100> so<00:02:05.130> brought<00:02:05.910> them<00:02:06.120> back<00:02:06.270> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
last year or so brought them back so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.090 
last year or so brought them back so
these<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.080> old<00:02:07.260> versions<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.830> these<00:02:07.950> are

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
these are the old versions and these are

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.600 
these are the old versions and these are
definitely<00:02:09.470> kind<00:02:10.470> of<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.679> need<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> replacing

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
definitely kind of in need of replacing

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.190 
definitely kind of in need of replacing
they're<00:02:11.730> kind<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.570> getting<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:12.900> little<00:02:13.020> bit

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
they're kind of and getting a little bit

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.420 
they're kind of and getting a little bit
long<00:02:13.350> on<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> tooth<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.890> worn<00:02:14.130> out<00:02:14.250> but

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
long on the tooth and worn out but

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.190 
long on the tooth and worn out but
they're<00:02:15.180> very<00:02:15.390> comfortable<00:02:15.570> shoes<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.140> you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
they're very comfortable shoes and you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.130 
they're very comfortable shoes and you
can<00:02:16.350> kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.280> difference<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.760> that

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
can kind of see the difference is that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.260 
can kind of see the difference is that
these<00:02:19.140> don't<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:20.340> full<00:02:20.670> leather<00:02:20.880> upper

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
these don't have a full leather upper

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.600 
these don't have a full leather upper
these<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.720> morals<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.320> under<00:02:23.010> an<00:02:23.070> all<00:02:23.160> nylon

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
these have morals up under an all nylon

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.680 
these have morals up under an all nylon
or<00:02:24.320> something<00:02:25.640> I'm<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.850> sure<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.209> material

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
or something I'm not sure the material

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.730 
or something I'm not sure the material
but<00:02:28.820> sort<00:02:29.820> of<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.970> more<00:02:30.150> open<00:02:30.300> designing<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.080> more

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
but sort of a more open designing a more

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.790 
but sort of a more open designing a more
light<00:02:31.980> feel<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.850> also<00:02:33.300> probably<00:02:33.630> more<00:02:34.500> cool

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
light feel and also probably more cool

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800 
light feel and also probably more cool
