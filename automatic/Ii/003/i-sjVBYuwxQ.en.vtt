00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
you mid dash anymore so you know you can

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.140 
you mid dash anymore so you know you can
auto<00:01:29.790> attack<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> then<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.810> Q<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.060> know

when you're dashing around like this

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.190 
when you're dashing around like this
using<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> passive<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.810> swipe<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.020> cool

I<00:01:57.930> suppose<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.640> basically<00:01:59.640> old<00:02:00.329> rend<00:02:00.899> used<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I suppose but basically old rend used to

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
I suppose but basically old rend used to
be<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.680> each<00:02:02.250> additional<00:02:02.729> sphere<00:02:03.000> used<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
be that each additional sphere used to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
be that each additional sphere used to
deal<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> very<00:02:03.869> specific<00:02:04.170> amount<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> damage

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
percent of 30 total attack damage sixty

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.840 
percent of 30 total attack damage sixty
percent<00:03:23.820> total<00:03:24.270> attack<00:03:24.450> damage<00:03:25.850> fifty

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
percent total attack damage fifty

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.540 
percent total attack damage fifty
percent<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.330> 60<00:03:27.960> is<00:03:28.080> obviously<00:03:28.410> 30<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.520> that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
percent of 60 is obviously 30 so that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.140 
percent of 60 is obviously 30 so that
just<00:03:30.240> kind<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.540> remains<00:03:30.810> unchanged<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:33.120> i

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
just kind of remains unchanged so i

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.720 
just kind of remains unchanged so i
don't<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.630> know<00:03:33.810> why<00:03:33.960> they<00:03:34.110> did<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.320> but

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
don't really know why they did that but

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.040 
don't really know why they did that but
yeah<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.540> attack<00:03:37.260> damage<00:03:37.470> bonus<00:03:37.860> on<00:03:38.660> rent<00:03:39.660> no

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
yeah the attack damage bonus on rent no

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.260 
yeah the attack damage bonus on rent no
longer<00:03:40.350> scales<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:40.980> it's<00:03:41.190> essentially<00:03:41.940> rent

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
longer scales so it's essentially rent

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.380 
longer scales so it's essentially rent
is<00:03:42.480> better<00:03:42.870> at<00:03:43.170> pretty<00:03:44.070> much<00:03:44.250> all<00:03:44.460> ranks<00:03:45.000> will

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
is better at pretty much all ranks will

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.430 
is better at pretty much all ranks will
add<00:03:45.690> all<00:03:45.870> ranks<00:03:46.230> except<00:03:46.800> for<00:03:46.940> max<00:03:47.940> rank<00:03:48.440> where

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
add all ranks except for max rank where

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.950 
add all ranks except for max rank where
total<00:03:49.920> attack<00:03:50.070> damage<00:03:50.280> bonus<00:03:50.790> evens<00:03:51.360> out<00:03:51.600> and

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
total attack damage bonus evens out and

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.410 
total attack damage bonus evens out and
it<00:03:52.680> deals<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:53.310> less<00:03:53.670> damage<00:03:54.090> which<00:03:54.270> is

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
it deals to less damage which is

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.760 
it deals to less damage which is
essentially<00:03:54.690> nothing<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.260> i<00:03:55.290> mean<00:03:55.440> i<00:03:55.560> wouldn't

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
essentially nothing so i mean i wouldn't

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.230 
essentially nothing so i mean i wouldn't
even<00:03:55.920> think<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.670> that's<00:03:56.820> kind<00:03:57.180> of

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
even think about that that's kind of

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.750 
even think about that that's kind of
meaningless<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.590> essentially<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> ren<00:03:59.460> buff

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
meaningless so essentially a ren buff

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.050 
meaningless so essentially a ren buff
now<00:04:00.720> what<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:01.440> means<00:04:01.800> in<00:04:01.950> terms<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.280> what<00:04:02.490> you

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
now what that means in terms of what you

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.030 
now what that means in terms of what you
put<00:04:03.300> you<00:04:03.420> know<00:04:03.450> skill<00:04:03.960> points<00:04:04.260> into<00:04:04.440> first<00:04:04.740> I

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
put you know skill points into first I

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.460 
put you know skill points into first I
don't<00:04:05.640> really<00:04:06.090> know<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.420> mean<00:04:06.750> maybe<00:04:07.020> you<00:04:07.290> might

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
don't really know I mean maybe you might

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.190 
don't really know I mean maybe you might
consider<00:04:07.620> putting<00:04:08.070> them<00:04:08.690> points<00:04:09.690> into<00:04:09.870> Pierce

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
consider putting them points into Pierce

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.720 
consider putting them points into Pierce
because<00:04:10.530> Pierce<00:04:10.770> is<00:04:10.920> actually<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.550> good

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
because Pierce is actually a really good

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.460 
because Pierce is actually a really good
skill<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.420> know<00:04:12.570> if<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:12.900> land<00:04:13.260> it

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
skill you know if you can land it

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.990 
skill you know if you can land it
effectively<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.370> you<00:04:14.490> know<00:04:14.610> you're<00:04:14.790> not<00:04:14.880> in

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
effectively and you know you're not in

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.580 
effectively and you know you're not in
the<00:04:15.060> position<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.420> continue<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.960> reset<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
the position to continue to reset the

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.200 
the position to continue to reset the
rain<00:04:16.770> thing<00:04:18.710> you<00:04:19.710> know<00:04:19.830> since<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:21.000> know<00:04:21.090> you

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
rain thing you know since you know you

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.610 
rain thing you know since you know you
just<00:04:21.299> put<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.660> point<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.169> rand<00:04:22.350> at<00:04:22.500> this

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
just put one point in the rand at this

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.950 
just put one point in the rand at this
point<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.210> have<00:04:24.360> two<00:04:24.479> total<00:04:24.750> attack

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
point and you have two total attack

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.990 
point and you have two total attack
damage<00:04:25.229> scaling<00:04:25.650> right<00:04:26.070> off<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.370> bat

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
damage scaling right off the bat

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.210 
damage scaling right off the bat
now<00:04:27.780> again<00:04:28.170> I'm<00:04:28.260> not<00:04:28.290> saying<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.980> know<00:04:29.070> you'd

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
now again I'm not saying you know you'd

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.290 
now again I'm not saying you know you'd
want<00:04:29.280> to<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:29.640> that<00:04:29.760> I'm<00:04:30.000> just<00:04:30.030> kind<00:04:30.270> of

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
want to do that I'm just kind of

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.490 
want to do that I'm just kind of
thinking<00:04:30.510> out<00:04:30.750> loud<00:04:30.780> here<00:04:32.540> no<00:04:33.540> sort<00:04:34.440> of

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
thinking out loud here no sort of

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.160 
thinking out loud here no sort of
whether<00:04:35.040> or<00:04:35.130> not<00:04:35.370> this<00:04:35.700> balance<00:04:36.510> is<00:04:36.660> clustered

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
whether or not this balance is clustered

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.170 
whether or not this balance is clustered
all<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.680> general<00:04:38.040> now<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.340> might<00:04:38.550> note<00:04:38.910> from

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
all in general now you might note from

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.150 
all in general now you might note from
my<00:04:39.420> tone<00:04:39.660> at<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.900> beginning<00:04:40.170> this<00:04:40.380> video<00:04:40.680> I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
my tone at the beginning this video I

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.040 
my tone at the beginning this video I
don't<00:04:41.760> like<00:04:42.090> Calista<00:04:42.510> from<00:04:42.630> a<00:04:42.690> balanced

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
don't like Calista from a balanced

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.050 
don't like Calista from a balanced
perspective<00:04:43.230> at<00:04:43.800> all<00:04:43.980> I<00:04:44.010> think<00:04:44.250> she's<00:04:44.790> kind<00:04:44.940> of

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
perspective at all I think she's kind of

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.940 
perspective at all I think she's kind of
ridiculous<00:04:45.270> she<00:04:45.660> has<00:04:45.840> stupid<00:04:46.560> amounts<00:04:46.860> of

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
ridiculous she has stupid amounts of

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.130 
ridiculous she has stupid amounts of
mobility<00:04:47.190> she<00:04:47.940> had<00:04:48.060> a<00:04:48.090> long<00:04:48.360> range<00:04:48.630> poke<00:04:48.960> in

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
mobility she had a long range poke in

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.220 
mobility she had a long range poke in
the<00:04:49.230> queue<00:04:49.440> she<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:49.800> an<00:04:49.860> infinitely<00:04:50.460> scaling

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
the queue she is an infinitely scaling

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.610 
the queue she is an infinitely scaling
basically<00:04:52.580> exploding<00:04:53.580> rend<00:04:53.910> thing<00:04:54.360> which<00:04:55.050> if

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
basically exploding rend thing which if

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.960 
basically exploding rend thing which if
you're<00:04:55.860> you<00:04:56.340> know<00:04:56.430> if<00:04:56.640> you're<00:04:56.790> targeting

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
you're you know if you're targeting

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.370 
you're you know if you're targeting
neutral<00:04:57.510> mobs<00:04:57.780> uh<00:04:59.390> basically<00:05:00.390> kind<00:05:01.020> of<00:05:01.110> it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
neutral mobs uh basically kind of it

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.110 
neutral mobs uh basically kind of it
almost<00:05:01.500> feels<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:01.950> invalidates<00:05:02.550> jungler

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
almost feels like it invalidates jungler

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.880 
almost feels like it invalidates jungler
half<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.540> time<00:05:03.720> is<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:03.990> why<00:05:04.230> bother<00:05:04.470> way<00:05:04.770> you

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
half the time is it why bother way you

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.320 
half the time is it why bother way you
know<00:05:05.010> with<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.160> smite<00:05:05.460> we've<00:05:05.669> got<00:05:05.820> a<00:05:05.850> Calista<00:05:06.270> on

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
know with a smite we've got a Calista on

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.400 
know with a smite we've got a Calista on
our<00:05:06.480> team<00:05:06.630> kind<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:06.960> thing<00:05:08.780> he's<00:05:09.780> got<00:05:09.960> percent

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
our team kind of thing he's got percent

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.630 
our team kind of thing he's got percent
damage<00:05:10.560> on<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.950> wo<00:05:11.280> I<00:05:11.310> should<00:05:11.550> probably

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
damage on the wo I should probably

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.890 
damage on the wo I should probably
mention<00:05:11.880> that<00:05:12.180> there's<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.419> weird<00:05:12.570> thing<00:05:12.810> with
