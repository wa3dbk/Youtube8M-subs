begin<00:01:00.860> to<00:01:01.070> good<00:01:01.580> day<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:01.790> mean<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:02.210> would<00:01:03.020> use<00:01:03.200> a

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
begin to good day I mean I would use a

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.010 
begin to good day I mean I would use a
rangefinder<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.250> know<00:01:04.369> a<00:01:04.670> laser<00:01:04.940> thing<00:01:05.479> I've

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
rangefinder you know a laser thing I've

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.810 
rangefinder you know a laser thing I've
got<00:01:06.229> a<00:01:06.259> Knick<00:01:06.470> on<00:01:06.619> one<00:01:06.830> mid<00:01:07.130> bounced<00:01:07.430> it<00:01:07.700> off

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
got a Knick on one mid bounced it off

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.490 
got a Knick on one mid bounced it off
and<00:01:08.090> then<00:01:08.660> when<00:01:08.869> you're<00:01:09.020> hitting<00:01:09.170> if<00:01:09.350> it's

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
and then when you're hitting if it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.590 
and then when you're hitting if it's
blind<00:01:09.950> tee<00:01:10.280> shots<00:01:10.610> I<00:01:10.820> mean<00:01:11.000> there's<00:01:11.270> no<00:01:11.360> way<00:01:11.509> of

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
blind tee shots I mean there's no way of

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.270 
blind tee shots I mean there's no way of
knowing<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:11.960> you've<00:01:12.080> just<00:01:12.290> got<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.470> hit<00:01:12.979> it<00:01:13.160> way

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
knowing it you've just got a hit it way

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.950 
knowing it you've just got a hit it way
you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.550> see<00:01:13.759> it<00:01:13.880> and<00:01:14.030> take<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.180> longer<00:01:14.509> shot<00:01:14.720> or

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
you can see it and take a longer shot or

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.950 
you can see it and take a longer shot or
you've<00:01:15.650> got<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:16.190> just<00:01:17.119> hope<00:01:17.390> that<00:01:17.690> you<00:01:17.780> can

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
you've got to just hope that you can

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.749 
you've got to just hope that you can
kind<00:01:18.320> of<00:01:18.410> guess<00:01:18.680> where<00:01:18.979> it<00:01:19.130> goes<00:01:19.310> but<00:01:19.610> there's

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
kind of guess where it goes but there's

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.130 
kind of guess where it goes but there's
no<00:01:19.880> way<00:01:20.030> really<00:01:20.300> of<00:01:20.450> playing<00:01:20.720> without<00:01:20.900> the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
no way really of playing without the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.020 
no way really of playing without the
yardage<00:01:21.380> book<00:01:21.590> apartment<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.550> I<00:01:22.580> never<00:01:22.790> use

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
yardage book apartment and I never use

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.740 
yardage book apartment and I never use
the<00:01:23.180> yardage<00:01:23.450> book<00:01:23.600> anyway<00:01:23.930> no<00:01:24.350> I<00:01:24.560> use<00:01:24.979> my

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
the yardage book anyway no I use my

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.150 
the yardage book anyway no I use my
rangefinder<00:01:26.750> you're<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.410> same<00:01:27.560> it's<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:28.009> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
rangefinder you're the same it's in the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.609 
rangefinder you're the same it's in the
live<00:01:28.790> got<00:01:29.000> GPS<00:01:29.450> unit<00:01:29.810> as<00:01:29.899> well<00:01:30.050> it's<00:01:30.259> kind<00:01:30.530> of

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
live got GPS unit as well it's kind of

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:31.749 
live got GPS unit as well it's kind of
would<00:01:30.770> solve<00:01:30.979> this<00:01:31.160> problem

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
would solve this problem

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.670 
would solve this problem
yeah<00:01:32.000> but<00:01:32.180> I'm<00:01:32.450> presuming<00:01:32.810> he<00:01:33.050> hasn't<00:01:33.410> got<00:01:33.530> one

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
yeah but I'm presuming he hasn't got one

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.800 
yeah but I'm presuming he hasn't got one
of<00:01:33.800> them<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.100> ask<00:01:34.280> them<00:01:34.460> because<00:01:34.640> it<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
of them to ask them because it the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.630 
of them to ask them because it the
things<00:01:36.140> got<00:01:36.319> to<00:01:36.410> be<00:01:36.440> really<00:01:36.890> careful<00:01:37.069> of<00:01:37.399> is

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
things got to be really careful of is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.480 
things got to be really careful of is
when<00:01:38.149> an<00:01:38.990> architect<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.619> designing<00:01:40.190> a<00:01:40.250> golf

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
when an architect is designing a golf

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.370 
when an architect is designing a golf
course<00:01:40.670> they<00:01:40.880> try<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:41.270> put<00:01:41.509> in<00:01:41.660> humps<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
course they try and put in humps and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.960 
course they try and put in humps and
hollows<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.890> actually<00:01:43.190> make<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.610> look<00:01:43.789> like

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
hollows to actually make it look like

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.820 
hollows to actually make it look like
it's<00:01:44.149> a<00:01:44.240> different<00:01:44.360> yardage<00:01:44.869> yeah<00:01:45.110> yeah<00:01:45.259> yeah

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's a different yardage yeah yeah yeah

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.160 
it's a different yardage yeah yeah yeah
so<00:01:46.039> if<00:01:46.729> you<00:01:47.060> haven't<00:01:47.300> got<00:01:47.539> a<00:01:47.569> yardage<00:01:47.990> you

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
so if you haven't got a yardage you

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.050 
so if you haven't got a yardage you
could<00:01:48.560> come<00:01:48.890> up<00:01:49.009> file<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.459> that<00:01:49.640> yeah<00:01:49.910> yeah

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
could come up file to that yeah yeah

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.460 
could come up file to that yeah yeah
because<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.539> false<00:01:50.750> fronts<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.289> things

20 yards shorter stuff like get a

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:56.650 
20 yards shorter stuff like get a
rangefinder

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
rangefinder

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.639 
rangefinder
a<00:01:56.869> laser<00:01:57.440> one<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:58.340> is<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.520> only<00:01:59.289> time<00:02:00.289> I'm

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
a laser one really is the only time I'm

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
it in let them in the rubbish that one's

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:12.180 
it in let them in the rubbish that one's
gone<00:02:04.850> gone<00:02:05.060> wrong<00:02:05.360> cup<00:02:07.899> always<00:02:08.899> get<00:02:09.110> steamed

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.040 

he<00:02:13.190> doesn't<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.550> close<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.060> fairway<00:02:14.510> so

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
he doesn't get close to the fairway so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.770 
he doesn't get close to the fairway so
yeah<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> get<00:02:15.590> rangefinder<00:02:16.250> really<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:17.480> apart

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
yeah I get rangefinder really and apart

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.150 
yeah I get rangefinder really and apart
from<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.990> may<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.260> played<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.740> course<00:02:18.770> I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
from that may be played if of course I

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.460 
from that may be played if of course I
only<00:02:19.459> ever<00:02:19.849> used<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> range<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.870> book<00:02:21.080> if<00:02:21.349> I

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
only ever used the range the book if I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.500 
only ever used the range the book if I
literally<00:02:21.920> can't<00:02:22.340> see<00:02:22.790> what's<00:02:23.000> over<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.360> hill

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
literally can't see what's over the hill

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.880 
literally can't see what's over the hill
and<00:02:23.599> I'd<00:02:23.720> look<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.110> pictures<00:02:24.470> since<00:02:24.650> there

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
and I'd look at the pictures since there

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
and I'd look at the pictures since there
is<00:02:25.069> no<00:02:25.250> ditch<00:02:25.520> there<00:02:25.819> anything<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.240> but

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
is no ditch there anything like that but

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.860 
is no ditch there anything like that but
not<00:02:27.560> really<00:02:27.830> get<00:02:28.580> rangefinder<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.720> good

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
not really get rangefinder it's a good

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.940 
not really get rangefinder it's a good
question<00:02:30.020> isn't<00:02:30.319> it<00:02:30.470> because<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.830> could

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
question isn't it because it could

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.650 
question isn't it because it could
something<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.060> could<00:02:32.180> save<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.540> loads

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
something like that could save you loads

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.480 
something like that could save you loads
of<00:02:32.810> shots<00:02:33.050> well<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.470> think<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.220> a<00:02:34.370> good

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
of shots well I think it's a good

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.860 
of shots well I think it's a good
question<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.060> different<00:02:35.300> level<00:02:35.450> as<00:02:35.690> well<00:02:35.810> I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
question on a different level as well I

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.360 
question on a different level as well I
think<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> good<00:02:36.500> question<00:02:36.800> because<00:02:36.890> lots<00:02:37.250> of

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
think is a good question because lots of

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.670 
think is a good question because lots of
people<00:02:37.670> who<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:38.810> books<00:02:39.080> or<00:02:39.290> have<00:02:39.410> range

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
people who have books or have range

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
people who have books or have range
riders<00:02:40.010> don't<00:02:40.069> think<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.549> silly

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
riders don't think this is a silly

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.759 
riders don't think this is a silly
question<00:02:40.790> what<00:02:41.209> does<00:02:41.299> it<00:02:41.390> mean<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:41.720> for<00:02:41.930> me<00:02:42.470> it

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
question what does it mean but for me it

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.110 
question what does it mean but for me it
just<00:02:42.829> shows<00:02:43.250> you<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.489> importance<00:02:43.879> of<00:02:43.970> making

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
just shows you the importance of making

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.490 
just shows you the importance of making
sure<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:44.510> know<00:02:44.629> some<00:02:44.840> yardages<00:02:45.260> we

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
sure you know some yardages we

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.350 
sure you know some yardages we
a there<00:02:46.280> are<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:46.430> many<00:02:46.490> amateurs<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.000> mean<00:02:47.300> I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
a there are so many amateurs I mean I

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.670 
a there are so many amateurs I mean I
played<00:02:47.570> most<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.960> my<00:02:48.020> amateur<00:02:48.320> golf<00:02:48.530> because

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
played most of my amateur golf because

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
played most of my amateur golf because
rangefinders<00:02:49.280> women<00:02:49.490> out<00:02:49.610> there<00:02:49.820> no<00:02:49.940> but<00:02:50.200> 150

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
rangefinders women out there no but 150

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.390 
rangefinders women out there no but 150
s<00:02:51.440> kind<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.770> up<00:02:51.920> there

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
s kind of up there

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.220 
s kind of up there
it<00:02:52.700> looks<00:02:52.910> like<00:02:53.060> 20<00:02:53.390> yards<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.900> let's<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.110> a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
it looks like 20 yards and let's have a

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.660 
it looks like 20 yards and let's have a
whack<00:02:54.380> how<00:02:54.590> wise<00:02:54.800> that<00:02:55.010> gone<00:02:55.160> over<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.460> green

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
well because I can't judge 20 yards and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.410
