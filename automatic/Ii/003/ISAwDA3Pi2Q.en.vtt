at it is I've got a 95 litre fridge mate
fridge<00:01:54.299> which<00:01:54.750> goes<00:01:55.020> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> fridge<00:01:55.530> slide

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fridge which goes in the fridge slide

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.260 
fridge which goes in the fridge slide
and<00:01:57.229> it's<00:01:58.229> just<00:01:58.469> pretty<00:01:58.729> pretty<00:01:59.729> tall<00:02:00.030> where

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and it's just pretty pretty tall where

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.120 
and it's just pretty pretty tall where
to<00:02:00.420> try<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:00.960> stuff<00:02:01.200> out<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> fridge

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
to try and get stuff out of the fridge

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.280

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
come up with an idea to make it work for

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.970 
come up with an idea to make it work for
you<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.580> basically<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.210> under<00:02:27.450> $500<00:02:28.350> I've<00:02:28.770> got

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
you so basically for under $500 I've got

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.810 
you so basically for under $500 I've got
a<00:02:29.010> draw<00:02:29.280> system<00:02:29.760> here<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.520> as<00:02:32.790> I

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
a draw system here that you know as I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.190 
a draw system here that you know as I
said<00:02:33.060> it's<00:02:33.180> pretty<00:02:33.330> rough<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.870> does<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
said it's pretty rough but it does the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.610 
said it's pretty rough but it does the
job<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.710> didn't<00:02:35.280> use<00:02:35.460> slides<00:02:36.390> drawer<00:02:37.200> slides

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
job I didn't use slides drawer slides

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.020 
job I didn't use slides drawer slides
I've<00:02:37.830> got<00:02:37.950> this<00:02:38.070> idea<00:02:38.280> off<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.730> boys<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
I've got this idea off the boys a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420 
I've got this idea off the boys a
drifter<00:02:39.630> who<00:02:39.660> do<00:02:39.900> fantastic<00:02:40.230> draw<00:02:40.860> system<00:02:41.310> so

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
drifter who do fantastic draw system so

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880 
drifter who do fantastic draw system so
they<00:02:41.550> just<00:02:41.730> didn't<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.890> Toronto

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
they just didn't have it for the Toronto

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.760 
they just didn't have it for the Toronto
to<00:02:44.090> teflon<00:02:45.090> strips<00:02:45.480> down<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.870> bottom<00:02:46.200> nothing

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
to teflon strips down the bottom nothing

kitchen shop up in Keynes I made once
they're<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.510> slide<00:02:57.900> mostly<00:02:59.030> you<00:03:00.030> know

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
they're in they slide mostly you know

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.020 
they're in they slide mostly you know
probably<00:03:02.680> not<00:03:02.800> quite<00:03:02.950> as<00:03:03.100> smooth<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.790> if<00:03:03.910> you

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
probably not quite as smooth as if you

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.460 
probably not quite as smooth as if you
had<00:03:04.180> runners<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.690> there<00:03:04.810> but<00:03:04.960> you<00:03:05.020> don't<00:03:05.170> lose

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
had runners in there but you don't lose

larger<00:03:21.550> one<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.760> can<00:03:22.120> go<00:03:22.420> in<00:03:22.630> also<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:23.260> idea

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
larger one that can go in also the idea

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.420 
larger one that can go in also the idea
there<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:25.360> take<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.930> camping<00:03:26.860> table<00:03:27.280> out

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
when camping but you can also use it as

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.850 
when camping but you can also use it as
a<00:03:31.210> van<00:03:31.480> should<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.750> tackle<00:03:32.170> box<00:03:32.320> or<00:03:32.650> if<00:03:32.770> you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
a van should be a tackle box or if you
