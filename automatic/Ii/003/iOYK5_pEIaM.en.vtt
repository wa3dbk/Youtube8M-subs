00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 hello friends this so that the rubber and the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.290
 tarragon video on how to make or sew 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.769
 weapons and that's a flamethrower a framework 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:20.170
 ax 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:22.289
 a grenade launcher a bazooka and a 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.800
 detonator for 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.869
 for the pumps to stop both 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.869
 good pumps with many 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.410
 but to be a sniper we're going to 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.410
 need this piece 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.660
 from one to one that brings in all 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.990
 other sides 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.340
 or not 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.550
 now let's flip like that 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.060
 in the top part is here and 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.600
 We are going to put a stick like the 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.900
 that you use to make the umbrella what 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.900
 we put 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.950
 those digits 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:22.050
 and then we are going to put 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.050
 a piece of these from a driver 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.790
 burke 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.610
 today 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.030
 and the back is going to put a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.030
 of these 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.650
 then up we'll put another one like 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.600
 what is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.600
 yes but now normal 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.840
 to stay then we are going to put 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.840
 around or several pieces one by one 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 there 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.790
 Y 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.060
 and a tear 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.440
 and it's over 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:23.420
 well then fried when for a blue one like that 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.420
 and back 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.540
 you already bring two others 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.540
 with you 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.220
 if in this part we are going to put 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:49.500
 a cylinder 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:53.960
 and then finally what would be 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.960
 the gray legs 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 and so 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.459
 it's how our sniper looks 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.820
 it's the one they just go to bed with and all the 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.820
 thing 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.390
 good to do the detonator is very 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.790
 easy we're going to need a radio and the 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:42.050
 what are we going to put a piece of 1 x 2 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:46.310
 with a button nothing else 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:50.080
 red button is either the donor or 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.360
 another way that is using these controls 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.260
 it seemed a little good to me 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.290
 they seemed the two normal one the two 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.720
 which is moving to make a flamethrower 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.870
 it's very easy, we're going to need the same 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:11.519
 you are red 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.519
 back we're going to put a red cylinder 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.580
 and then we call play 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.829
 with what 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.450
 a cone of silver color and then we're going 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.590
 to put a flame 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.300
 and remains 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.300
 If it is our message more 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.000
 it looks a bit blue 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.910
 good now the bazooka that is very easy 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.980
 I need this 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.660
 and all we have to do is 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:58.250
 put a transparent button and red 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.250
 the times that are very good 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.320
 what to contravene 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:15.820
 to be finally the 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.390
 and grenade launchers we're going to need this 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.490
 piece that is the one that comes to you 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:28.320
 in the jockey of the planets ship 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.320
 we put a piece of these 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.810
 then we put this here and so I go to 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.530
 make it what the gun looks at it and 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.530
 the hike degrees 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.580
 good friends and so we conclude with this 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.580

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.310
