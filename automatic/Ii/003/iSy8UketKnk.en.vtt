membership for xbox live there is a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
membership for xbox live there is a
simple<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.160> believe

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
simple way to do this and I believe

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
simple way to do this and I believe
there<00:00:47.700> should<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.910> many<00:00:48.210> videos<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.780> YouTube

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there should be many videos on YouTube

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.080 
there should be many videos on YouTube
about<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.860> I'm<00:00:50.039> glad<00:00:50.219> he<00:00:50.340> specifically

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
about this but I'm glad he specifically

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
video on it I'm pretty sure there is but

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.389

even used codes I mean so I'm I start
with<00:01:26.189> X<00:01:26.490> oops<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.140> actually<00:01:28.320> blacked<00:01:28.710> out

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
my bad sorry and but basically I like to

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.710 
my bad sorry and but basically I like to
do<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.950> enter<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.250> code<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.970> got<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
do is enter the code that you got on the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.940 
do is enter the code that you got on the
card<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:37.530> whatever<00:01:38.119> um<00:01:39.320> whatever<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.740> got

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
card or whatever um whatever you got

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.639 
card or whatever um whatever you got
card<00:01:41.340> piece<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.820> paper<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> mean<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.619> could

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
card piece of paper so I mean it could

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.460 
card piece of paper so I mean it could
be<00:01:43.950> X<00:01:44.189> W<00:01:44.850> 3<00:01:45.590> R<00:01:46.590> T<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.479> 25<00:01:48.960> character

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
be X W 3 R T and it's a 25 character

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.060 
be X W 3 R T and it's a 25 character
code<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.700> definitely<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.540> code

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
code so that's definitely not to code

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.370 
code so that's definitely not to code
but<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> idea<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.899> mean<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.140> could

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
but you get the idea I mean you could

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
but you get the idea I mean you could
use<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.490> keyboard<00:01:56.939> or<00:01:57.149> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> have

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
use the that keyboard or if you have

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
use the that keyboard or if you have
like<00:01:57.630> an<00:01:57.780> attachment<00:01:58.110> keyboard<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
like an attachment keyboard which you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.580 
like an attachment keyboard which you
can<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.149> right<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.320> could

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
can see right there you know you could

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.719 
can see right there you know you could
use<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.070> way<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.549> don't<00:02:02.969> know<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
use it that way I don't know you know I

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.520 
use it that way I don't know you know I
don't<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.450> not<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> code<00:02:06.960> definitely

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
don't know it's not a code definitely

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.910 
don't know it's not a code definitely
but<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.599> that's<00:02:09.599> my<00:02:09.780> point<00:02:10.050> that's<00:02:10.440> how

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
but you know that's my point that's how

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.449 
but you know that's my point that's how
you<00:02:10.979> put<00:02:11.340> codes<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
you put codes in

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.209 
you put codes in
