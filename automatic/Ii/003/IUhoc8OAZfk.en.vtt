filter<00:00:41.780> suck<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:43.010> lava<00:00:44.010> too<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
filter suck up lava too and if that is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.250 
filter suck up lava too and if that is
the<00:00:46.079> case<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:48.030> might<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.719> useful<00:00:49.020> for

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the case then that might be useful for

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.119 
the case then that might be useful for
you<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.430> can<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.940> make<00:00:51.390> whatever

so what do I need for steel tanks steel

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.189 
so what do I need for steel tanks steel
tanks<00:00:57.000> require<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:58.940> while<00:00:59.940> stale<00:01:00.300> ingots<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
tanks require a while stale ingots to

make yourself cold coke and Crescent oil
could<00:01:21.330> be<00:01:21.420> useful<00:01:21.810> later<00:01:21.840> keep<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> in<00:01:22.830> mind

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
could be useful later keep that in mind

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.999 
could be useful later keep that in mind
so<00:01:25.640> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.330> one<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> started<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.350> not

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
too long ago and we have a steam boiler

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
too long ago and we have a steam boiler
pushing<00:01:33.090> steam<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.990> guy<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.530> he<00:01:34.860> has

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
pushing steam into this guy and he has

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.380 
pushing steam into this guy and he has
four<00:01:35.520> million<00:01:35.820> okay<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.430> these<00:01:38.909> two<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
four million okay now these two are the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.740 
four million okay now these two are the
same<00:01:39.570> size<00:01:41.030> why<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.090> they<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> same<00:01:42.689> size

there's that
now<00:02:16.629> steel<00:02:17.080> tank<00:02:17.590> holds<00:02:18.129> at<00:02:19.090> 1<00:02:19.150> million<00:02:20.040> 150<00:02:21.040> mm

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
now steel tank holds at 1 million 150 mm

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.580 
now steel tank holds at 1 million 150 mm
that's<00:02:22.330> double<00:02:23.140> from<00:02:23.800> what<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.430> thing<00:02:24.670> holds

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
that's double from what this thing holds

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.100 
that's double from what this thing holds
so<00:02:26.590> depending<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.060> want<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.540> hold<00:02:28.780> in

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
so depending on what you want to hold in

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.400 
so depending on what you want to hold in
it<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.590> how<00:02:29.800> much<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.190> want<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.519> hold<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
it and how much you want to hold in it

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.300 
it and how much you want to hold in it
depends<00:02:32.410> on<00:02:32.500> how<00:02:32.769> much<00:02:34.260> cost<00:02:35.260> worthy<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:36.010> is

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
depends on how much cost worthy it is

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.150 
depends on how much cost worthy it is
now<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:38.230> guy<00:02:38.500> here<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.220> 7<00:02:39.549> by<00:02:39.670> 7<00:02:39.730> by<00:02:40.180> 6<00:02:40.569> and

is what you do what you guys can build

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.699 
is what you do what you guys can build
now<00:02:56.560> for<00:02:57.549> example<00:02:58.170> before<00:02:59.170> I<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.530> show

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709

now for example before I have you show
you<00:02:59.769> guys<00:03:00.040> how<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.250> build<00:03:00.519> it<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.410> build

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
you guys how to build it you can build

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.150 
you guys how to build it you can build
these<00:03:02.739> in<00:03:02.950> any<00:03:03.190> way<00:03:03.700> shape<00:03:04.000> or<00:03:04.209> size<00:03:04.450> really

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
these in any way shape or size really

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.460 
these in any way shape or size really
but<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.670> only<00:03:06.849> thing<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.150> really<00:03:07.540> has<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.319> be

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
but the only thing that really has to be

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.800 
but the only thing that really has to be
the<00:03:08.709> same<00:03:08.920> is<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.459> top<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:10.000> bottom<00:03:10.150> and<00:03:10.599> these

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
the same is the top the bottom and these

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.160 
the same is the top the bottom and these
little<00:03:11.110> pillars<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:12.269> side<00:03:13.269> well<00:03:13.720> not<00:03:13.989> that

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
little pillars on the side well not that

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.520 
little pillars on the side well not that
one

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
one

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.849 
one
but<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:15.639> one<00:03:15.880> this<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.109> pillars<00:03:17.440> have<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.769> be

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
but this one this the pillars have to be

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.550 
but this one this the pillars have to be
like<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:19.120> tank<00:03:19.420> walls<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.109> just

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
like this the tank walls have to be just

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.800 
like this the tank walls have to be just
like<00:03:20.709> that<00:03:20.739> but<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.700> glass<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.600> everything

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
like that but the glass and everything

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.319 
like that but the glass and everything
else<00:03:23.230> could<00:03:23.590> be<00:03:23.680> different<00:03:24.160> it's<00:03:24.609> really

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
else could be different it's really

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.580 
else could be different it's really
endless<00:03:26.139> and<00:03:26.500> it's<00:03:26.650> up<00:03:26.829> to<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:29.290> we'll<00:03:29.470> go

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
endless and it's up to you so we'll go

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.390 
endless and it's up to you so we'll go
over<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:30.010> this<00:03:30.100> guy<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.700> example<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:32.440> have

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
over to this guy for example and I have

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.490 
over to this guy for example and I have
tank<00:03:33.700> walls<00:03:33.940> going<00:03:34.239> here<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.660> have<00:03:35.049> tank<00:03:35.290> walls

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
tank walls going here I have tank walls

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.400 
tank walls going here I have tank walls
going<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:36.069> way<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.609> have<00:03:36.880> tank<00:03:37.209> valves<00:03:37.660> doing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
going that way I have tank valves doing

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.110 
going that way I have tank valves doing
that<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.100> doing<00:03:39.250> that<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:41.530> still<00:03:41.739> have<00:03:42.120> 2

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
that and doing that and you still have 2

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.930 
that and doing that and you still have 2
million<00:03:43.389> I<00:03:43.780> mean<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.500> could<00:03:44.769> get<00:03:44.920> rid<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.190> one<00:03:45.910> of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
million I mean I could get rid of one of

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.910 
million I mean I could get rid of one of
these<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.420> make<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.720> glass<00:03:47.019> it'll<00:03:47.590> change

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
these and make this glass it'll change

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.910 
these and make this glass it'll change
it<00:03:48.100> back<00:03:48.250> still<00:03:49.209> 2<00:03:49.389> million<00:03:49.750> all<00:03:50.440> right

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
it back still 2 million all right

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.789 
it back still 2 million all right

example real quick if you have steel
walls<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.340> steel<00:04:01.920> tank<00:04:03.599> there<00:04:04.599> it's<00:04:04.900> glass

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
walls and a steel tank there it's glass

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.089 
walls and a steel tank there it's glass
of<00:04:05.650> some<00:04:05.859> sort<00:04:06.099> it's<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.459> gauge<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.919> have

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
of some sort it's a gauge and you have

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.659 
of some sort it's a gauge and you have
iron<00:04:09.340> gauge<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.690> can't<00:04:10.989> do<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:12.459> do<00:04:12.639> that

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
iron gauge you can't do that you do that

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.970 
iron gauge you can't do that you do that
at<00:04:13.030> all<00:04:13.150> what<00:04:13.660> happens<00:04:13.959> if<00:04:14.079> I<00:04:14.169> make<00:04:14.380> this<00:04:14.590> just

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
at all what happens if I make this just

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.420 
at all what happens if I make this just
like<00:04:15.160> this<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.849> don't<00:04:16.150> work<00:04:16.530> just<00:04:17.530> keep<00:04:18.280> that

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
like this it don't work just keep that

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.399 
like this it don't work just keep that

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
crafting table they'll be used to make

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.279 
crafting table they'll be used to make
your<00:04:37.810> iron<00:04:38.169> plates<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.889> your<00:04:39.580> steel<00:04:39.909> plates

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
your iron plates and your steel plates

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.529 
your iron plates and your steel plates
to<00:04:41.289> make<00:04:41.470> iron<00:04:41.650> plates<00:04:42.069> and<00:04:42.310> steel<00:04:42.520> plates<00:04:42.729> you

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:43.539 
to make iron plates and steel plates you

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:46.290 
to make iron plates and steel plates you
put<00:04:43.810> iron<00:04:44.229> in<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.979> rolling<00:04:45.490> machine<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:46.150> make

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
put iron in the rolling machine to make

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.529 
put iron in the rolling machine to make
iron<00:04:46.539> plates<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:48.030> same<00:04:49.030> for<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.300> steel

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
iron plates and same for the steel

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.909 
iron plates and same for the steel
plates<00:04:49.840> just<00:04:49.990> with<00:04:50.319> steel<00:04:50.560> ingots<00:04:52.620> what's<00:04:53.620> fun

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
plates just with steel ingots what's fun

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:59.219 
plates just with steel ingots what's fun
is<00:04:53.949> empty<00:04:54.370> okay<00:04:54.909> so<00:04:57.090> basically<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.810> recipes

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
is empty okay so basically the recipes

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.550 
is empty okay so basically the recipes
are<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.530> same<00:04:59.740> for<00:05:00.009> steel<00:05:00.340> and<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.840> iron

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
are the same for steel and the iron

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.309 
are the same for steel and the iron
tanks<00:05:02.979> so<00:05:03.370> I<00:05:03.400> didn't<00:05:03.699> have<00:05:03.819> to<00:05:04.000> do<00:05:04.509> to<00:05:05.050> a

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
tanks so I didn't have to do to a

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.480 
tanks so I didn't have to do to a
chemical<00:05:05.770> chest<00:05:06.159> here<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.710> iron<00:05:09.069> tank

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
chemical chest here and so the iron tank

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.140 
chemical chest here and so the iron tank
gauge<00:05:09.759> is<00:05:10.240> five<00:05:10.870> glass<00:05:11.349> panes<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:12.099> four<00:05:12.849> iron

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
gauge is five glass panes and four iron

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.719 
gauge is five glass panes and four iron
plates<00:05:13.960> if<00:05:14.289> you<00:05:14.409> want<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:14.650> do<00:05:14.770> steel<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.520> only

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
plates if you want to do steel the only

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.469 
plates if you want to do steel the only
difference<00:05:16.090> would<00:05:16.240> be<00:05:16.300> steel<00:05:16.870> plates<00:05:18.389> for<00:05:19.389> the

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
difference would be steel plates for the

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.480 
difference would be steel plates for the
iron<00:05:19.630> tank<00:05:19.960> wall<00:05:20.199> you're<00:05:20.710> going<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.009> need<00:05:21.159> four

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
iron tank wall you're going to need four

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.480 
iron tank wall you're going to need four
iron<00:05:21.789> plates<00:05:22.210> same<00:05:23.169> with<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.469> steel<00:05:23.740> steel

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
iron plates same with the steel steel

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.149 
iron plates same with the steel steel
for<00:05:25.090> place<00:05:25.659> I'm<00:05:26.169> not<00:05:26.409> going<00:05:26.590> to<00:05:26.650> say<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.919> keeps

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
for place I'm not going to say it keeps

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.279 
for place I'm not going to say it keeps
saying<00:05:27.430> steel<00:05:27.759> plates<00:05:28.060> because<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.509> this<00:05:29.110> is

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
saying steel plates because just this is

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.640 
saying steel plates because just this is
going<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.710> take<00:05:29.889> too<00:05:30.039> much<00:05:30.190> time<00:05:31.380> iron<00:05:32.380> tank

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
going to take too much time iron tank

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.980 
going to take too much time iron tank
valves<00:05:33.750> for<00:05:34.750> iron<00:05:35.080> bars<00:05:35.440> and<00:05:36.030> for<00:05:37.030> iron<00:05:37.419> plates

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
valves for iron bars and for iron plates

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.680 
valves for iron bars and for iron plates
with<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.319> lever<00:05:38.650> saying<00:05:39.340> for<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.759> steel<00:05:40.240> tank

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
with a lever saying for the steel tank

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.490 
with a lever saying for the steel tank
valve<00:05:41.669> just<00:05:42.669> what's<00:05:43.120> steel<00:05:43.979> so<00:05:45.930> that<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.169> about
