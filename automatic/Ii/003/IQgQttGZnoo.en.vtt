00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:04.819
 forward the little ones 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.609
 Something for once, a few cents of media appeared 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.529
 abbreviated activity that 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.570
 or also known as cushing's disease is a common one 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
 disorder in the horses older than 15 years 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.399
 the most common clinical symptoms are first it is me 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.739
 for example, muscle loss shows how many of them have and secondary infections 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.370
 called the condition with cushing's disease 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.830
 until it was discovered that the disease mechanism in the horse 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.830
 deviates from cushing's disease in humans and dogs 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.190
 To better understand the cause of the ipy he will be the first 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.630
 explain how the healthy pituitary gland of a horse works 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.710
 the pituitary gland in common human language known as the repair appendix 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.520
 lies at the bottom of the brain 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.640
 It is responsible for the production of a comprehensive one 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.720
 amount of hormones 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.850
 these hormones then circulate through the body, but they do 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.760
 regulate the functioning of various organs 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.000
 the release of hormones through the pituitary gland is controlled by the hypothalamus 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.040
 The hypothalamus produces stimulating and inhibiting factors that are each the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.230
 excretion of specific pituitary hormones or stimulate it 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.230
 brake 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.730
 The pituitary gland of the horse consists of three came 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.080
 the press that is steel 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.060
 the pearce intermediar 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.590
 and the pax nervosa 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.400
 the middle class or el pais intermediar 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.560
 is involved with the library that 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.619
 for healthy horses, the production of hormones is reduced 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 middle class inhibited by dopamine 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.280
 dopamine is released in the middle class by those who live now 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280
 find origin in the hypothalamus 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.489
 then has this specific to the dopamine receptors on the wall of the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.329
 cells of the middle class 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.329
 like a key fits on a lock 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:27.209
 as soon as that the sector is occupied by dopamine 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.590
 Work this as a free man who is responsible for the production and release of hormones 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 the middle class reduced 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.850
 only healthy horse is there dopamine shots 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.850
 strongly intimidate the sector 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.629
 so that exactly the right amount of alpha msh 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.799
 Delta Endorphin RKC against hair is produced by the middle class 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.109
 Pipi Haiti is caused by the degeneration of the dopamine producing 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.769
 neurons in the hypothalamus 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.579
 there is a lack of sufficient dopamine in the middle class 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.579
 that leads to an increase in hormone production 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.549
 This results in mirrors of middle blow hormones in a horse with 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.829
 typically he who can be up to 100 times higher than with a healthy horse 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.899
 The absence of dopamine admits dwm cells from the middle class 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:27.969
 turn of 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.859
 takes two to six months both physically and mentally 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.659
 this hypertension of the middle class 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.549
 ensures that the other scratch of the pituitary gland is compressed 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:45.759
 the lack of dopamine in the horses suffering from dibi eighty 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
 can be remedied by the use of tournament hospitals 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:52.939
 missed perth glory days and dopamine 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:56.879
 it acts as a substitute for the dopamine deficiency indie pituitary gland 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.879
 blow of horses with spikes that you 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:05.699
 by binding to the dope amine receptor reduced with the excretion of the 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.699
 middle class hormones 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.989
 where you treat nature reserves such an improvement from a clinical one 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.719
 symptoms such as a better coat 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:18.199
 muscle mass 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.409
 and alertness 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.699
 horses with ideas that are treated with the means opportunity per municipality 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.179
 development of hoof confiscation and secondary infections 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.750
 but with the help of that time that can have a long and good quality life 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.750
 when the disorder treats the craats 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.349
 forward if you have it
