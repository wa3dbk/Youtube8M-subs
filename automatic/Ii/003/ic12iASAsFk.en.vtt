know that last winter a comment almost
twice<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.309> size<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.510> Jupiter<00:00:34.550> flew<00:00:35.550> through

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
twice the size of Jupiter flew through

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.889 
twice the size of Jupiter flew through
our<00:00:36.480> solar<00:00:37.020> system<00:00:40.820> yeah<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:42.390> didn't<00:00:42.660> talk

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
our solar system yeah they didn't talk

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.549 
our solar system yeah they didn't talk
about<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:44.059> they<00:00:45.059> release<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.750> data<00:00:46.230> at

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
about that one they release the data at

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.709 
about that one they release the data at
the<00:00:46.980> last<00:00:47.219> minute<00:00:47.520> let<00:00:47.760> me<00:00:47.879> pull<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.390> for

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the last minute let me pull it out for

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
the last minute let me pull it out for
you<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.950> people<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:51.030> know

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you just so you see it people don't know

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.220 
you just so you see it people don't know
about<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.690> unbelievable<00:00:53.930> they<00:00:54.930> didn't<00:00:55.170> even

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
about this unbelievable they didn't even

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.279 
about this unbelievable they didn't even
talk<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.989> on<00:00:57.989> TV<00:01:00.289> because

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
talk about it on the on on TV because

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.179 
talk about it on the on on TV because
they<00:01:01.469> thought<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:02.039> were<00:01:02.070> toast<00:01:03.680> the<00:01:04.680> size<00:01:04.949> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
they thought we were toast the size of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.350 
they thought we were toast the size of
Jupiter<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.270> trivial<00:01:08.119> Jupiter<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
Jupiter is not trivial Jupiter is the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.670 
Jupiter is not trivial Jupiter is the
largest<00:01:10.250> planet<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.610> our<00:01:11.880> solar<00:01:11.939> system<00:01:12.869> an

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
largest planet in our solar system an

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.700 
largest planet in our solar system an
object<00:01:14.220> twice<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.090> size<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.960> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
object twice the size of that is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.749 
object twice the size of that is
extremely<00:01:17.520> massive<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:19.040> there's<00:01:20.040> no<00:01:20.400> doubt

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
extremely massive and there's no doubt

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.749 
extremely massive and there's no doubt
that<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.570> should<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:21.960> disrupted<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
that it should have disrupted many of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
that it should have disrupted many of
the<00:01:23.939> orbits<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.720> solar<00:01:25.020> system<00:01:25.590> and

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
the orbits in our solar system and

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.370 
the orbits in our solar system and
created<00:01:26.549> huge<00:01:26.880> tidal<00:01:27.270> wave<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.320> planet<00:01:28.640> I

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
created huge tidal wave on this planet I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.600 
created huge tidal wave on this planet I
don't<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:34.310> here<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.960> this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.610> many

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
don't know here it is this is the many

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.600 
don't know here it is this is the many
levels<00:01:39.000> given<00:01:39.479> by<00:01:39.659> NASA<00:01:39.960> about<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.680> they

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
levels given by NASA about it they

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.399 
levels given by NASA about it they
didn't<00:01:41.850> talk<00:01:42.060> about<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.990> put<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.229> on

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
didn't talk about it they just put it on

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.460 
didn't talk about it they just put it on
the<00:01:43.470> net<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> south<00:01:44.369> side<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:46.320> know

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the net on the south side and you know

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.660 
the net on the south side and you know
basically<00:01:48.259> you<00:01:49.259> were<00:01:49.439> looking<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.520> know

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
basically you were looking at you know

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.230 
basically you were looking at you know
the<00:01:50.909> basic<00:01:51.630> telemetry<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> Sun<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> then

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the basic telemetry of the Sun and then

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
the basic telemetry of the Sun and then
all<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.570> sudden<00:01:54.600> oh<00:01:54.990> what's<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.420 

okay<00:01:59.740> this<00:02:00.340> is<00:02:00.580> called<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:01.000> V<00:02:01.270> 1<00:02:01.600> comment<00:02:03.720> and

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
okay this is called a V 1 comment and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.580 
okay this is called a V 1 comment and
you<00:02:06.430> can<00:02:06.640> see<00:02:06.970> that<00:02:07.659> this<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:08.020> not<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> trivial

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
you can see that this is not a trivial

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.699 
you can see that this is not a trivial
object<00:02:09.399> look<00:02:10.090> at<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.420> Sun<00:02:10.750> flare<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.410> goes

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
object look at the Sun flare that goes

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.380 
object look at the Sun flare that goes
at<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.430> actually<00:02:13.209> disrupted<00:02:14.200> its<00:02:14.380> path

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
at it and actually disrupted its path

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.540 
at it and actually disrupted its path
and<00:02:17.489> this<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> size<00:02:19.030> of<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.330> Sun<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.600> guys

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and this is the size of the Sun you guys

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.290 
and this is the size of the Sun you guys
okay<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:22.480> Sun<00:02:22.750> is<00:02:22.900> enormous<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:25.030> earth

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
okay the Sun is enormous this the earth

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.229 
okay the Sun is enormous this the earth
looks<00:02:26.080> like<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.350> little<00:02:26.830> bitty<00:02:27.100> dog<00:02:27.489> beside<00:02:27.850> the

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
looks like a little bitty dog beside the

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.020 
looks like a little bitty dog beside the
Sun<00:02:29.160> right<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.140> huge<00:02:32.709> object<00:02:33.580> flying

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
Sun right this is a huge object flying

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.110 
Sun right this is a huge object flying
right<00:02:34.660> towards<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> Tsar<00:02:36.010> actually<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.670> went

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
right towards the Tsar actually and went

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.740 
right towards the Tsar actually and went
around<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.630> Sun<00:02:38.760> astronomers<00:02:39.760> thought<00:02:40.540> it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
around the Sun astronomers thought it

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.500 
around the Sun astronomers thought it
was<00:02:40.870> going<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.140> hit<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.410> Sun<00:02:41.910> that's<00:02:42.910> why<00:02:43.209> they

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
was going to hit the Sun that's why they

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.270 
was going to hit the Sun that's why they
thought<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:43.900> were<00:02:43.930> toast<00:02:44.350> oh<00:02:46.500> but<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.769> looks

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
thought we were toast oh but it looks

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.420 
thought we were toast oh but it looks
and<00:02:48.610> I'm<00:02:48.940> not<00:02:49.209> sure<00:02:49.239> about<00:02:49.569> this<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:51.220> is

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
and I'm not sure about this I this is

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.610 
and I'm not sure about this I this is
extremely<00:02:52.000> difficult<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.840> data<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.380> this

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
extremely difficult to get data of this

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.440 
extremely difficult to get data of this
they<00:02:54.310> won't<00:02:54.549> talk<00:02:54.819> about<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.180> much<00:02:55.510> but<00:02:56.100> I

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
they won't talk about it much but I

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.479 
they won't talk about it much but I
think<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.959> didn't<00:02:59.350> hit<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.680> Sun<00:02:59.950> because

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
think that it didn't hit the Sun because

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.910 
think that it didn't hit the Sun because
of<00:03:00.819> this<00:03:01.720> Sun<00:03:02.049> flare<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:03.340> actually<00:03:04.560> moved<00:03:05.560> it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
of this Sun flare that actually moved it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.410 
of this Sun flare that actually moved it
away<00:03:06.450> did<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.570> see<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.780> oh<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.150> arm

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
away did you see that oh that's the arm

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.920 
away did you see that oh that's the arm
that<00:03:14.079> holds<00:03:14.739> that<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.519> disk<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
that holds that little disk so that the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.910 
that holds that little disk so that the
lens<00:03:17.320> doesn't<00:03:17.650> get<00:03:17.950> burned<00:03:19.200> but<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.380> can<00:03:20.590> see

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
lens doesn't get burned but you can see

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.259 
lens doesn't get burned but you can see
that<00:03:21.720> thats<00:03:22.720> unfair<00:03:23.350> moved<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.940> um<00:03:25.890> that

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
that thats unfair moved that um that

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.090 
that thats unfair moved that um that
comment<00:03:28.269> away<00:03:28.480> from<00:03:29.079> it

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
comment away from it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.940 
comment away from it
oh<00:03:34.120> well<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.240> Vatican<00:03:35.810> has<00:03:36.140> a<00:03:36.440> large

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
oh well the Vatican has a large

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.830 
oh well the Vatican has a large
investment<00:03:37.700> in<00:03:37.820> most<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.390> probes<00:03:38.690> that

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
investment in most of the probes that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.680 
investment in most of the probes that
observe<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:39.530> Sun<00:03:39.800> and<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.100> teller<00:03:40.940> days<00:03:41.270> when

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
observe the Sun and the teller days when

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.590 
observe the Sun and the teller days when
he<00:03:41.780> was<00:03:41.900> going<00:03:42.020> to<00:03:42.110> come<00:03:42.350> back<00:03:43.000> will<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.030> missed

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
he was going to come back will be missed

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.790 
he was going to come back will be missed
by<00:03:44.990> two<00:03:45.050> weeks<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:47.170> all<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.320> people<00:03:48.500> are

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
by two weeks and all the people are

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.560 
by two weeks and all the people are
looking<00:03:49.160> for<00:03:49.190> Planet<00:03:49.700> X<00:03:49.940> they<00:03:50.390> all

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
looking for Planet X they all

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.240 
looking for Planet X they all
disappointed<00:03:51.080> because<00:03:51.410> they<00:03:51.680> say<00:03:51.860> planet

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
disappointed because they say planet

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.440 
disappointed because they say planet
Hank<00:03:52.430> same<00:03:52.640> show<00:03:52.850> up<00:03:53.290> they<00:03:54.290> didn't<00:03:54.650> notice<00:03:55.100> a

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
Hank same show up they didn't notice a

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.330 
Hank same show up they didn't notice a
comment<00:03:56.450> twice<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:57.020> size<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.440> Jupiter<00:03:57.980> showed

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
comment twice the size of Jupiter showed

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.260 
comment twice the size of Jupiter showed
up<00:03:58.870> they<00:03:59.870> were<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.680> comment<00:04:01.490> was<00:04:01.550> two<00:04:02.000> weeks

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
up they were the comment was two weeks

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.720 
up they were the comment was two weeks
in<00:04:02.570> advance<00:04:02.960> from<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.410> Sumerian<00:04:03.980> texts<00:04:04.550> but

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
in advance from the Sumerian texts but

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.020 
in advance from the Sumerian texts but
hey<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.300> the<00:04:06.110> 10,000<00:04:06.920> year<00:04:07.130> prediction<00:04:07.880> I

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
hey on the 10,000 year prediction I

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.420 
hey on the 10,000 year prediction I
think<00:04:08.510> that's<00:04:08.690> pretty<00:04:08.960> dang<00:04:09.170> good<00:04:10.630> right<00:04:12.430> yeah

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
think that's pretty dang good right yeah

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.630 
think that's pretty dang good right yeah
exactly<00:04:16.180> it<00:04:17.180> was<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:18.560> yotta<00:04:18.770> was<00:04:19.010> observable

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
exactly it was the yotta was observable

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.770 
exactly it was the yotta was observable
from<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:21.380> west<00:04:22.130> coast<00:04:22.310> here<00:04:22.880> very<00:04:23.210> early<00:04:23.450> in

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
from the west coast here very early in

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.220 
from the west coast here very early in
the<00:04:23.990> morning<00:04:24.520> at<00:04:25.520> sunrise<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.720> believe<00:04:29.230> they

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
the morning at sunrise I believe they

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.300 
the morning at sunrise I believe they
thought<00:04:30.470> we<00:04:30.650> were<00:04:30.680> done<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:32.080> plan<00:04:33.080> a<00:04:33.310> comment

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
thought we were done I plan a comment

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:42.990 
thought we were done I plan a comment
what<00:04:37.000> februari<00:04:38.000> yeah<00:04:39.820> yeah<00:04:40.820> last<00:04:41.360> winter<00:04:41.630> and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
what februari yeah yeah last winter and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.130 
what februari yeah yeah last winter and
here's<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:46.390> here's<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.720> map<00:04:49.480> when<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.510> updated

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
here's the here's the map when I updated

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.460 
here's the here's the map when I updated
it<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.890> showed<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.310> comments<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:53.470> there

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
it and it showed the comments and there

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.400 
it and it showed the comments and there
is<00:04:54.590> two<00:04:54.950> comments<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.670> went<00:04:55.880> by<00:04:56.200> one<00:04:57.200> after

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
is two comments that went by one after

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.490 
is two comments that went by one after
the<00:04:57.770> other<00:04:58.510> now<00:04:59.510> let<00:04:59.780> me<00:04:59.810> play<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:01.150> in<00:05:02.150> slow

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
the other now let me play this in slow

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.500 
the other now let me play this in slow
mo<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.710> first<00:05:04.070> comment<00:05:04.610> came<00:05:04.820> by<00:05:05.030> which<00:05:05.300> is

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
mo this first comment came by which is

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.240 
mo this first comment came by which is
already<00:05:05.720> ignore<00:05:06.530> me<00:05:07.960> then<00:05:08.960> this<00:05:09.200> one<00:05:09.530> check

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
already ignore me then this one check

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.120 
already ignore me then this one check
this<00:05:10.430> out<00:05:13.090> no<00:05:14.090> they're<00:05:14.840> on<00:05:15.050> an<00:05:15.230> angle<00:05:15.710> coming

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
this out no they're on an angle coming

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.910 
this out no they're on an angle coming
in<00:05:17.920> yeah<00:05:19.270> however<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.900> gravitational<00:05:21.650> field

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
in yeah however the gravitational field

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.080 
in yeah however the gravitational field
of<00:05:22.070> an<00:05:22.160> object<00:05:22.580> dad<00:05:22.760> being<00:05:23.230> going<00:05:24.230> inside<00:05:25.090> the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
of an object dad being going inside the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.650 
of an object dad being going inside the
mercury<00:05:26.600> orbit<00:05:27.160> should<00:05:28.160> have<00:05:28.310> pulled<00:05:28.670> mercury

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
mercury orbit should have pulled mercury

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.120 
mercury orbit should have pulled mercury
right<00:05:29.990> into<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.410> Sun<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:32.480> look<00:05:33.200> at<00:05:33.410> look<00:05:33.890> at

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
right into the Sun and look at look at

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.870 
right into the Sun and look at look at
the<00:05:34.370> tail<00:05:35.300> when<00:05:36.110> it's<00:05:36.290> at<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.710> Sun<00:05:37.040> the<00:05:37.580> tail

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
the tail when it's at the Sun the tail

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:44.950 
the tail when it's at the Sun the tail
is<00:05:38.180> still<00:05:38.630> in<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.200> Earth's<00:05:39.380> orbit

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.610 

the<00:05:45.960> gravitational<00:05:46.650> influence<00:05:47.160> was<00:05:48.320> yeah<00:05:49.320> we

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
the gravitational influence was yeah we

00:05:49.620 --> 00:06:06.430 
the gravitational influence was yeah we
did<00:05:50.389> we<00:05:51.389> shouldn't<00:05:51.870> be<00:05:51.900> here<00:05:58.009> for<00:05:59.009> me<00:06:05.180> then

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
did we shouldn't be here for me then

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.260 
did we shouldn't be here for me then
because<00:06:07.440> if<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:08.009> did<00:06:08.310> change<00:06:08.759> the<00:06:08.970> orbit<00:06:09.090> of

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
because if it did change the orbit of

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.860 
because if it did change the orbit of
the<00:06:09.539> earth<00:06:09.600> it<00:06:10.350> would<00:06:10.949> have<00:06:11.130> changed<00:06:11.160> the

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:11.870 
the earth it would have changed the

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.939 
the earth it would have changed the
calculation<00:06:12.870> so<00:06:13.110> they<00:06:13.289> would<00:06:13.500> have<00:06:13.650> changed

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
calculation so they would have changed

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.680 
calculation so they would have changed
significantly<00:06:14.669> and<00:06:16.400> a<00:06:17.400> significant<00:06:18.330> change

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
significantly and a significant change

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.409 
significantly and a significant change
in<00:06:18.990> our<00:06:19.199> orbit<00:06:19.470> would<00:06:20.130> have<00:06:20.310> generated<00:06:20.550> tidal

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
in our orbit would have generated tidal

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.360 
in our orbit would have generated tidal
waves<00:06:21.690> and<00:06:22.050> all<00:06:22.169> sorts<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:22.650> events<00:06:22.800> on<00:06:23.280> the

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
waves and all sorts of events on the

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.279 
waves and all sorts of events on the
surface<00:06:23.729> of<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:23.970> planet<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:25.380> we<00:06:25.560> didn't<00:06:25.800> see

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:27.289 
surface of the planet that we didn't see

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:35.270 
surface of the planet that we didn't see
well<00:06:28.310> mostly<00:06:29.310> necessarily<00:06:30.150> yes<00:06:33.889> it<00:06:34.889> wouldn't

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
well mostly necessarily yes it wouldn't

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.430 
well mostly necessarily yes it wouldn't
be<00:06:35.370> a<00:06:35.400> small<00:06:35.760> change<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.780> would<00:06:36.930> be<00:06:37.110> a<00:06:37.139> large

Sun behind the comment you develop your
talking<00:06:46.110> a<00:06:46.229> huge<00:06:46.680> gravitational<00:06:47.610> field<00:06:48.510> here

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
talking a huge gravitational field here

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.650 
talking a huge gravitational field here
extremely<00:06:50.430> large<00:06:51.169> I<00:06:52.169> believe<00:06:53.010> that<00:06:53.449> we<00:06:54.449> were

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
extremely large I believe that we were

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:00.010 
extremely large I believe that we were
given<00:06:55.650> another<00:06:55.949> chance

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.029 

well<00:07:00.770> I<00:07:00.800> think<00:07:01.280> we're<00:07:01.430> floating<00:07:01.940> in<00:07:02.060> grace

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039 
well I think we're floating in grace

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.100 
well I think we're floating in grace
we're<00:07:04.039> definitely<00:07:04.490> floating<00:07:05.449> in<00:07:05.599> grace<00:07:05.840> at

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
we're definitely floating in grace at

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.800 
we're definitely floating in grace at
this<00:07:06.319> point<00:07:06.620> and<00:07:06.919> somebody<00:07:07.879> is<00:07:07.970> taking<00:07:08.360> care

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
this point and somebody is taking care

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:53.070 
this point and somebody is taking care
of<00:07:08.870> us

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080
