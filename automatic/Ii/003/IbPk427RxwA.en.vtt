 we two work perfectly 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.920
 but we have my friends on a tip 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.920
 Go ahead 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400
 and 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.020
 m 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.880
 it is good good good good tranqui 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.880
 listen to me 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.080
 They have played 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.060
 get me 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.900
 they are not listening we have a 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.690
 problem that I would have never spoken and we 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.730
 we married that she does not know for those 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.840
 men beach more what we do with this 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.150
 which is how they listened to the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.150
 exciting but we can not ethically 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.190
 which is good 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:31.930
 it's a match to finish a lot but 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.930
 we have to withdraw and retire 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.530
 the ethics is that the rating 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:53.589
 but it was terrible it rotted everything and it was 

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:55.179
 terrible because he started and I did not 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:58.019
 he gave time here I talked to him before as 

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:58.019
 if it were to be given 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.149
 the cut 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:21.560
 ah 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:25.220
 them in 53 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.730
 Turkish celebration of if we get into a 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:35.350
 moment for which we are we hope 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.350
 they are telling you, you never said it 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.850
 we just heard it but only 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.110
 listened because we get the air 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.610
 because it was all talk was in the air 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:51.070
 it seems to us that the peat does not correspond 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.070
 he never knew he was in the clear air 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.040
 late 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.000
 He listened to everything is taken care of as he ripped 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.740
 principle was very strong his face more 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.190
 maybe it's a tree you need a lot 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.190
 cute 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:16.130
 a little bit but has a powerful voice 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.130
 has a candy 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:28.050
 answer something with everything you get 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.490
 everything and there we could not create but I the 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.550
 I would call back there is no time but yes 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.550

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.900
 the best moment 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.230
 two 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.010
 minutes it was very strange exciting but not 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:36.200
 we had what it would be like to talk 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:41.249
