the right things I i got the science of
black<00:02:13.610> hair<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.270> i<00:02:15.080> believe<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.770> it<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.160> can<00:02:17.120> say

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
black hair and i believe in it I can say

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.000 
black hair and i believe in it I can say
that<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.570> believe<00:02:17.780> in<00:02:18.290> what<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.530> was<00:02:18.680> what<00:02:18.890> it's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that I believe in what it was what it's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.479 
that I believe in what it was what it's
talking<00:02:19.310> about<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.100> what<00:02:22.220> I'm<00:02:22.310> going<00:02:22.430> to

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
talking about and so what I'm going to

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.920 
talking about and so what I'm going to
do<00:02:22.610> is<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:23.060> each<00:02:23.090> section<00:02:23.600> of<00:02:23.690> already

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
do is for each section of already

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.479 
do is for each section of already
moisturize<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.500> first<00:02:24.860> section<00:02:25.220> I'm<00:02:25.280> going<00:02:25.310> to

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
moisturize it first section I'm going to

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:37.320 
moisturize it first section I'm going to
put<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:25.760> leave<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.980> that

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.170 

I'm<00:02:37.900> making<00:02:38.260> sure<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.940> concentrate<00:02:39.940> on

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I'm making sure that I concentrate on

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
I'm making sure that I concentrate on
the<00:02:40.510> ends<00:02:43.020> at<00:02:44.020> one<00:02:44.350> point<00:02:44.710> when<00:02:45.250> my<00:02:45.400> hair<00:02:45.640> was

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the ends at one point when my hair was

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.750 
the ends at one point when my hair was
sure<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.540> had<00:02:46.720> dyed<00:02:47.050> it<00:02:47.260> red<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.430> I'm<00:02:48.490> always

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
sure I had dyed it red and so I'm always

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.430 
sure I had dyed it red and so I'm always
trying<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.210> make<00:02:49.240> sure<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.720> my<00:02:49.840> ends<00:02:50.320> are

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
trying to make sure that my ends are

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
trying to make sure that my ends are
good<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.860> go<00:02:50.890> from<00:02:51.820> be<00:02:52.000> dying<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.570> red<00:02:53.820> this<00:02:54.820> is

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
good to go from be dying it red this is

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.470 
good to go from be dying it red this is
moisture<00:02:55.840> ology<00:02:56.430> infusium<00:02:57.430> 23<00:02:57.760> moisture

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480

ologies<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.290> what<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:02:59.950> going<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.190> also<00:03:00.430> do<00:03:00.760> as

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
ologies and what I'm going to also do as

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.760 
ologies and what I'm going to also do as
part<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.180> my<00:03:01.300> challenges<00:03:01.600> basically<00:03:02.380> keep<00:03:02.590> up

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
part of my challenges basically keep up

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.790 
part of my challenges basically keep up
with<00:03:02.890> my<00:03:03.040> washes<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:03.940> this<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.900> my<00:03:05.050> one<00:03:05.410> wash

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
with my washes so this is my one wash

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.140 
with my washes so this is my one wash
this<00:03:06.280> week<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:07.480> was<00:03:08.200> all<00:03:08.470> moisture<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.520> so

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
this week that was all moisture and so

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.800 
this week that was all moisture and so
then<00:03:10.390> next<00:03:10.900> week<00:03:11.350> I<00:03:11.740> will<00:03:12.160> involve<00:03:13.120> protein

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
then next week I will involve protein

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.930 
then next week I will involve protein
but<00:03:14.470> not<00:03:14.680> really<00:03:14.890> reconstructor<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.700> don't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
but not really reconstructor I don't

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.630 
but not really reconstructor I don't
feel<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.270> needed<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.870> reconstructor<00:03:17.830> but

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
feel like I needed a reconstructor but

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.300 
feel like I needed a reconstructor but
it<00:03:18.850> will<00:03:19.030> involve<00:03:19.470> protein<00:03:20.470> next<00:03:20.890> week<00:03:21.040> so

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it will involve protein next week so

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.090 
it will involve protein next week so
every<00:03:21.640> other<00:03:21.760> week<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.870> moisture<00:03:23.530> one<00:03:23.800> week

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
every other week so moisture one week

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.300 
every other week so moisture one week
protein<00:03:24.910> more<00:03:25.750> protein<00:03:26.260> based<00:03:26.500> products<00:03:27.100> than

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
protein more protein based products than

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.630 
protein more protein based products than
next<00:03:27.700> week<00:03:27.910> as<00:03:28.180> well<00:03:29.140> as<00:03:29.350> co-washing<00:03:30.190> as

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
next week as well as co-washing as

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.010 
next week as well as co-washing as
needed<00:03:31.150> during<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.870> week<00:03:32.820> okay<00:03:33.820> now<00:03:34.420> laggin

obviously this wrong yang laen so in my

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:36.400 
obviously this wrong yang laen so in my
hand<00:04:31.310> on<00:04:34.630> what<00:04:35.630> I'm<00:04:35.720> doing<00:04:35.960> here<00:04:36.169> I'm

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
hand on what I'm doing here I'm

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.010 
hand on what I'm doing here I'm
basically<00:04:36.740> using<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.370> oil<00:04:37.940> type<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.570> mixture

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
basically using the oil type of mixture

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.629 
basically using the oil type of mixture
after<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:41.090> leave-in<00:04:41.599> and<00:04:42.490> after<00:04:44.320> the

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
after the leave-in and after the

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.560 
after the leave-in and after the
water-based<00:04:47.080> moisturizer<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:48.949> this<00:04:49.849> is<00:04:50.180> to

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
water-based moisturizer and this is to

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.089 
water-based moisturizer and this is to
seal<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.650> moisture<00:04:52.449> this<00:04:53.449> is<00:04:53.720> new<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.919> what

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
seal in the moisture this is new to what

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.430 
seal in the moisture this is new to what
I'm<00:04:55.340> doing<00:04:56.740> but<00:04:57.740> I<00:04:58.660> believe<00:04:59.660> in<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.020> science

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
I'm doing but I believe in the science

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.909 
I'm doing but I believe in the science
behind<00:05:00.590> it<00:05:03.160> this<00:05:04.160> is<00:05:04.310> what<00:05:04.490> I'm<00:05:04.639> doing<00:05:05.919> all

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
behind it this is what I'm doing all

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.140 
behind it this is what I'm doing all
