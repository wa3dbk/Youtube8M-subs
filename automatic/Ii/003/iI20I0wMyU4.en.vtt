00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
you could just as easily dice it a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.570 
you could just as easily dice it a
couple<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.050> nice<00:01:40.230> slices<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.890> top<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.370> and

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
couple of nice slices on top there and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.210 
couple of nice slices on top there and
then<00:01:41.910> we're<00:01:42.030> going<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> seal<00:01:42.510> it<00:01:42.920> we<00:01:43.920> want<00:01:44.100> to

that as the pasta is cooking none of the
mixture<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.230> uses<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.760> make<00:01:50.790> sure

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
mixture it uses out we want to make sure

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.500 
mixture it uses out we want to make sure

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
it down on top and then just use a fork

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.210 
it down on top and then just use a fork
to<00:01:56.700> crimp<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> edges<00:01:57.650> pressing<00:01:58.650> it<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.770> as

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
to crimp the edges pressing it down as

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.300 
to crimp the edges pressing it down as
you<00:01:59.340> go<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> seals<00:02:01.620> together<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
you go so that it seals together and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.580 
you go so that it seals together and
