00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.119
 hi live is one more day to my channel and 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.550
 As you can see, I changed the color of 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:19.279
 hair if instagram is not available then 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.090
 a picture of a girl is a few days ago 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.720
 with the hair with a black color rather 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.029
 bluish and was that he had in mind and is the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.470
 that really has been how you know 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.780
 whenever I dye my hair I 've done 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.629
 a color bath I always use the brand of 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.379
 candle for me his dyes and his baths 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.379
 Fabulous colors do not dry out almost anything 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.860
 the veil is even noticeable that it moisturizes 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.770
 this one concretely is the number 28 is 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.980
 as I tell you a bluish black this color 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.120
 of hair I already had it about ten years ago and 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.269
 this the tone with which I had then with 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.710
 the wicks and now I liked it a lot 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.469
 How hair had the appearance of hair 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.460
 he did not see himself saying so sanz the 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:11.660
 tips were seen as more yellow by 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.659
 the wicks and I do not know I did not like it anymore 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.520
 I had it so I decided on 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.340
 of color the truth is that to me it is a 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.319
 color that I love there will be people to the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.030
 that you like and there will be people that you do not 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.039
 but the truth is that I'm 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.829
 very happy with the color that has 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.810
 I do not see it too blue when 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.329
 I was having it, my mother did. 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.270
 I almost got something because I saw it very blue 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.369
 but yes it is true that he avenged some 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.259
 reflex but it's not a thing that calls 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.969
 a lot of good attention and how will you 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.590
 seen by the title of the video today I'm going 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.560
 to also talk about how to get a 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.319
 smooth and silky hair rather with 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.969
 affordable products I think these 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:52.000
 points that I will show you the set 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:55.060
 of all of them makes the hair is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.129
 very, very soft, I tell you that 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.509
 so far I had never had the 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.429
 hair like that and the truth is that I'm 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.020
 very happy but first of all 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.739
 I teach the shampoo I'm using that is 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.079
 this one from pantene the smooth one from silky 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:11.170
 I've been using it about 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.599
 three months and that you noticed that you have contributed 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.819
 a lot of softness to my hair after 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.769
 shampoo what I use is a conditioner 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.420
 concretely is this one of l'orÃ©al 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.890
 keratin the truth is that just like 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.500
 the shampoo gives me a lot of hair 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.299
 and mostly unravels super well as 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.220
 you know, I always got sun, but 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.500
 that after washing it and using the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.860
 conditioner before using it what 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.230
 use is a thermal protector that you know 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.150

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.840

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.270
