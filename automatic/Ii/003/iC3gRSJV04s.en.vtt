00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.740
 Hello everyone and be welcome to a 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.120
 new video game with my toys 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.040
 for children 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.250
 they will wonder what all these are 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.620
 utensils that I have here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.200
 today we are not going to talk about toys 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.960
 but I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.910
 make fake mucus 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.890
 for that they need 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.560
 something that is a liquid but at the same 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.880
 time that has consistency for that 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 serves liquid silicone 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:38.980
 You can also use white paste here 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:43.020
 I have water and paintings 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.020
 now I will show you how it is done 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.810
 to think we need a container and a 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.510
 teaspoon 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.820
 when they have it, everyone can use 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.270
 other utensils to be able to mix everything 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.580
 all right 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.340
 The first thing we are going to use is the 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.700
 silicon we are going to empty everything in the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700
 container 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.350
 how this lasts a lot 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:19.899
 try to chop the tube I already did it in 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.270
 the bottom part and that's how it goes 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.250
 easy 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.250
 I'm going to use the whole tube 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.590
 can use a second but first 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.409
 I will try with this 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.719
 can use liquid silicone of any 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.719
 brand that does not matter 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.010
 A) Yes 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.659
 I think everything went 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.690
 a complete silicone package 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.420
 now 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.420
 we will put 50 milliliters of water 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.340
 A) Yes 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.989
 and now the colors come, I decide 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.319
 I decided to use blue we use some 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.319
 drops 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.820
 and yellow 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.290
 so 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.820
 now comes the starch for clothes 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.280
 for that I'm going to use a spoon 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.280
 of starch 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.370
 and we started to mix everything 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.190
 or not 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.530
 I think the color could be a little more 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.580
 intense so I'm going to put a 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.580
 little bit more blue 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.560
 and also a couple of drops of yellow 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.980
 I think it's already good, what happens is that 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.050
 the consistency is not perfect I think 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:11.690
 that is very liquid we are going to try 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:16.510
 put more silicone the liquid 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:19.680
 the most important thing is that it is washable 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.680
 and that does not stain 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.990
 let's throw it out little by little while 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.830
 we mix until they have the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.830
 desired consistency 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.440
 the truth is that I think they need two 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:18.169
 liquid silicone packs 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:21.560
 because this is already the second that I use 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.810
 let's empty the complete but as 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.229
 you see the consistency is not yet 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.229
 perfect 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.710
 3 should try a second time but 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.270
 Now I'm going to try to mix it with the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.410
 hand to see how it feels 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.410
 now with your hand 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:57.110
 looks good 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.110
 it looks like mucus 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.160
 the consistency feels good in the 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.140
 hands if it seems little really 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.530
 as I told them they could use more 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.730
 liquid silicone but so is it 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.730
 very cool 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.679
 I think I estimate 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.679
 we do not use enough liquid silicone 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.680
 because it's very liquid but I think that 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.419
 it looks pretty good 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.570
 maybe I should try it in a 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.660
 second time and use more silicone 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.660
 liquid 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.469
 I hope you have learned how to do it 

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:45.250
 the fake mucus how can they do it 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.250
 yourselves 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:52.449
 I think it was very good 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:56.870
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:07:00.300
