just<00:00:30.720> thought<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.500> simple<00:00:31.859> that

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
just thought that it was so simple that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.979 
just thought that it was so simple that
you<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.329> need<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> hair<00:00:33.840> tutorial

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you don't really need a hair tutorial

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.139 
you don't really need a hair tutorial
but<00:00:34.290> I<00:00:34.320> guess<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.680> kind<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.100> um<00:00:35.370> if<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.030> don't

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
but I guess it's kind of um if you don't

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.520 
but I guess it's kind of um if you don't
understand<00:00:36.660> it's<00:00:36.809> kind<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> technique<00:00:37.380> just

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
understand it's kind of a technique just

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.139 
understand it's kind of a technique just
like<00:00:37.710> braiding<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.160> braiding<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.790> easy<00:00:39.000> to

piece that looks like this so roots oh
so<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.470> about<00:03:01.500> how<00:03:01.860> much<00:03:02.010> you're<00:03:02.160> going

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
split this down in half so split right

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.340 
split this down in half so split right
in<00:03:07.950> half<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.430> have<00:03:08.520> two<00:03:08.730> pieces<00:03:09.110> um<00:03:10.140> and

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
in half so you have two pieces um and

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.800 
in half so you have two pieces um and
mine's<00:03:10.680> kind<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.070> like<00:03:11.250> bang<00:03:11.880> length<00:03:12.510> but

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
mine's kind of like bang length but

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.940 
mine's kind of like bang length but
doesn't<00:03:13.110> really<00:03:13.200> matter<00:03:13.470> if<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.710> have<00:03:13.800> layers

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
doesn't really matter if you have layers

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.770 
doesn't really matter if you have layers
or<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.400> because<00:03:14.730> it's<00:03:15.240> all<00:03:15.330> going<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.540> end<00:03:15.690> up

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
or not because it's all going to end up

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.870 
or not because it's all going to end up
getting<00:03:16.140> incorporated<00:03:16.410> together<00:03:16.860> so<00:03:17.280> once

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
getting incorporated together so once

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.610 
getting incorporated together so once
you<00:03:18.000> have<00:03:18.120> your<00:03:18.180> two<00:03:18.480> pieces<00:03:18.510> you're<00:03:19.440> going<00:03:19.530> to

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
length hair I'm sure it'd be easier with

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.160 
length hair I'm sure it'd be easier with
one<00:06:32.340> length<00:06:32.550> hair<00:06:32.880> or<00:06:33.120> longer<00:06:33.660> layers<00:06:33.870> that

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
one length hair or longer layers that

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.380 
one length hair or longer layers that
would<00:06:34.320> be<00:06:34.380> with<00:06:34.620> really<00:06:34.860> short<00:06:35.100> bangs<00:06:35.280> but<00:06:35.700> um

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:37.880 
would be with really short bangs but um
it<00:06:36.600> all<00:06:36.690> gets<00:06:36.870> kind<00:06:37.080> of<00:06:37.140> tucked<00:06:37.350> in<00:06:37.530> there<00:06:37.680> and
