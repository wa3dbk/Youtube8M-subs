00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.760
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.400
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.680
 Solmecke and next to me is the money 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.530
 together with diana also fenaco the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.010
 traffic law supervised by us and today 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.760
 let's talk about red light violations 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.300
 and it's about what's up when I turn on 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.519
 Do not stop at a traffic light when red 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.420
 but it can perhaps go 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.379
 Give us a little something sometimes 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.479
 place 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.819
 So comes in red light violations 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:41.129
 of course the question how long the traffic light 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:43.589
 or signage instructed formally 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.850
 correctness was already red as the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.799
 concerned driver with his vehicle 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.329
 the stop line has run over completely 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.460
 decisive meaning too because there is 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.969
 it makes a difference ok where are the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.989
 border 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.549
 So the time intervals are such that 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.379
 as soon as you passed one second 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.209
 it already has a qualified one 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.459
 Red light violation exists and then already 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:04.949
 driving ban is arranged which considerably 

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:07.530
 that is actually pretty blatant 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.100
 that means to run over red light is one 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.010
 the delicate one where you can quickly 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.900
 rag if you can come 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.970
 maybe a little story 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 i was in my last week 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.980
 hometown gevelsberg and was mine 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 Parents visited and it was like that 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.920
 actually the yellow phases in cologne 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 that means they are relatively long 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.310
 The traffic lights are used to green and yellow and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.070
 you drive over it and that in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.560
 Gevelberg the traffic lights turn yellow and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.970
 Immediately , the red I could still 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.650
 but that was pretty much 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.580
 scarce one was therefore quite another 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.590
 yellowphase 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.390
 that must somehow in the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.890
 Appraisal when it turns red also one 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.390
 play role so there is also 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.550
 regulations for how long the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.170
 yellowphase must be the we look 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.550
 in the red light violations, of course, too 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.070
 always not only the red light time 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.230
 but also the previous money 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.690
 phase because of course the yellow phase completely 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.820
 Significant influence on the decision 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.770
 the car driver to drive on 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.250
 or not absolutely heard in the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.080
 check in there and maybe you can 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.410
 can you tell me what the technology is like 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.670
 Measure at all when I'm based 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.200
 about it down 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.450
 Of course there are different ones 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.420
 measuring instruments in general, but it is so 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.520
 that behind the stop line average 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.090
 are two to three meters 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.220
 Induction loops in the roadway 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.030
 are admitted and this at 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.580
 run over 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.650
 the red light flashers activate straight 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.700
 said the lie behind the stop line 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 12 meters, that's what it means when you do 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.300
 my first mature this 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.800
 induction loop then rolls over 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 I have already been the traffic light 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.209
 the time should be measured exactly 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.950
 that's what the exam is all about 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.810
 namely the recalculation because 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.570
 Accusable red light time may be natural 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.190
 Only the time will be the red light traffic light 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.140
 The affected driver already knows in red 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.340
 with his vehicle the stop line 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.410
 has run over and not the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.180
 induction loops has touched and the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.920
 must be calculated back and there 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.140
 of course, as always, too 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 Fails and that is our job 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.360
 of course, to control 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.100
 that means you know the whole 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.660
 Of course you get calculation methods 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.450
 even the calculator out and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.090
 Look , here's a moment 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.110
 in fact, the two meters are correct 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.360
 calculated 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.739
 because even there depends exactly on the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.750
 Speed is not constant either 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.370
 changes all these factors exactly and 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.410
 Of course, we have to do that too first 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.330
 again, request all documents 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.820
 how manuals that 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.530
 test report the documents the life 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.250
 These are the maintenance and repair files 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.440
 were subject to the training certificates of 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.530
 Messbeamten because of course from the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.420
 knife underlay the parameters revealed 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.180
 We should use this for our calculations 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.750
 need is not always like that but must 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.890
 actually be that way and it is 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.769
 we can not do anything anymore 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.730
 One second is clear 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.980
 Nevertheless, do not give up 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.870
 that is of course our motto and 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.459
 At least you can always do something about it 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.030
 The ban on driving are currently in the 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.609
 Red light violations it is so that the 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.229
 legislature due to the elapsed time 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.000
 red light time so the qualified 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.490
 Red light violations of the red light violation 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.770
 over a second is from the 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.270
 Elapsed time an abstract 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.240
 dangerous traffic behavior 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.970
 So just accept it anyway 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.350
 Do it at night was with the weak 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.729
 I would like the elapsed red light time 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.770
 with an abstract danger 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.940
 then it will be on the 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.770
 driving ban supported 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.570
 only it is natural if one 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.520
 abstract danger usually 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.680
 Of course, it can always be accepted 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.810
 There are no concrete cases 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.690
 Danger occurred completely means 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.970
 the country without any people and 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.919
 that makes with sundays at night time 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.600
 such cases and exactly these 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.800
 individual circumstances must then 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.780
 be carried forward 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.580
 and that also sees the jurisdiction so 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.520
 we did not come up with that and 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.139
 exactly the things then just before the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.090
 authority or the district court 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.860
 must be carried forward and then can 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.750
 it may well be that then in 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.729
 the specific case is lifted because 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.550
 there was no concrete hazard 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.260
 You also see simple facts like 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.090
 Driving a car can then be complicated 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.599
 when lawyers are first 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.580
 meddle and then clarify the details 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.199
 but maybe we can you 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.180
 an agreement is also made by others 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.250
 be helpful next week there you go 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.780
 around the logbook when that imposed 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.000
 can and what the 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.169
 conditions we are hoping that you 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.180
 then be there again 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.419
 Thank you for watching and happy until then 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.419
 bye
