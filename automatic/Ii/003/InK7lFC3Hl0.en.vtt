perfecting<00:02:04.270> just<00:02:04.690> a<00:02:04.810> few<00:02:05.020> basic<00:02:05.440> steps<00:02:05.590> it's

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
perfecting just a few basic steps it's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.639 
perfecting just a few basic steps it's
great<00:02:06.970> though<00:02:07.240> because<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.810> two<00:02:08.170> disciplines

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
great though because the two disciplines

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.220 
great though because the two disciplines
really<00:02:09.069> complement<00:02:09.909> each<00:02:10.060> other<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:10.959> not

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
really complement each other it's not

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.110 
really complement each other it's not
like<00:02:11.409> gymnastics<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.250> acrobatics<00:02:12.819> or

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like gymnastics and acrobatics or

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.750 
like gymnastics and acrobatics or
gymnastics<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.080> trampoline<00:02:14.709> which<00:02:15.310> clash

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
gymnastics and trampoline which clash

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.160 
gymnastics and trampoline which clash
with<00:02:16.150> each<00:02:16.180> other<00:02:16.569> because<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:17.019> learn

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
with each other because you learn

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.899 
with each other because you learn
different<00:02:17.500> techniques<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.519> some<00:02:18.730> really

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
different techniques and some really

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.110 
different techniques and some really
basic<00:02:19.209> moves<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.980> anyway<00:02:21.400> here's<00:02:21.849> what<00:02:22.000> the
