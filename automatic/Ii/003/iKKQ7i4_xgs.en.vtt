today<00:00:06.960> I'm<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.560> show<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.429> know

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
today I'm going to show you how to know

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.029 
today I'm going to show you how to know
when<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.179> need<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> change<00:00:09.780> your<00:00:10.320> exhaust

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:11.039 
when you need to change your exhaust

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.690 
when you need to change your exhaust
support<00:00:11.639> brackets<00:00:12.209> and<00:00:13.129> we'll<00:00:14.129> be<00:00:14.249> performing

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
support brackets and we'll be performing

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.510 
support brackets and we'll be performing
this<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.419> a<00:00:16.400> ford<00:00:17.400> windstar<00:00:17.760> minivan<00:00:19.520> from

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
this on a ford windstar minivan from

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.660 
this on a ford windstar minivan from
this<00:00:20.730> side<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.300> can<00:00:21.750> see<00:00:21.920> the<00:00:22.920> cracks<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
this side you can see the cracks in it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.850 
this side you can see the cracks in it
but<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:25.230> obviously<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.400> was<00:00:26.670> initially

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
but more obviously it was initially

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.400 
but more obviously it was initially
connecting<00:00:28.860> like<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.539> but<00:00:30.539> one<00:00:30.960> side<00:00:31.230> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
connecting like this but one side is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.560 
connecting like this but one side is
completely<00:00:31.920> deteriorated<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.789> snapped<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
completely deteriorated and snapped and

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.210 
completely deteriorated and snapped and
it's<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:33.840> being<00:00:34.079> held<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.470> by<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.650> other<00:00:34.800> side

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
it's now being held up by the other side

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's now being held up by the other side
so<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.060> is<00:00:36.120> definitely<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:37.650> of<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so this is definitely in need of a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.180 
so this is definitely in need of a
replacement<00:00:40.010> we<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.220> these<00:00:42.110> rol<00:00:43.190> support

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
replacement we got these rol support

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.760 
replacement we got these rol support
brackets<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.790> our<00:00:44.820> exhaust<00:00:45.329> pipe<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:46.530> seem

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
brackets for our exhaust pipe they seem

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.250 
brackets for our exhaust pipe they seem
to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.340> they'd<00:00:47.520> fit<00:00:47.790> just<00:00:47.970> fine<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:49.050> we're

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to be like they'd fit just fine so we're

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.710 
to be like they'd fit just fine so we're
about<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> find<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.390> we're<00:00:51.390> putting

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
about to find out here we're putting

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.840 
about to find out here we're putting
this<00:00:51.840> crate<00:00:52.260> here<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:53.040> an<00:00:53.220> extra<00:00:53.520> measure<00:00:53.670> of

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
this crate here as an extra measure of

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.580 
this crate here as an extra measure of
safety<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.020> case<00:00:55.170> Oh

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
safety and just in case Oh

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.470 
safety and just in case Oh
so<00:00:55.710> what's<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.100> support<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.149> removed

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
so what's this support is removed

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.780 
so what's this support is removed
there's<00:00:58.079> nothing<00:00:58.380> to<00:00:58.470> hold<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> up<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.399> we

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
there's nothing to hold it up here so we

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.549 
there's nothing to hold it up here so we
need<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> have<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.450> there<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.809> catch<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.020> this

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
need to have that there to catch it this

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.650 
need to have that there to catch it this
is<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> looks<00:01:02.850> like<00:01:02.940> without<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is what it looks like without the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.950 
is what it looks like without the
bracket<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> bracket<00:01:05.460> is<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.750> our

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
bracket on so the bracket is this is our

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.180 
bracket on so the bracket is this is our
rol<00:01:07.830> bracket<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.510> sits<00:01:09.510> connected<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.590> you

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
rol bracket here sits connected here you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.080 
rol bracket here sits connected here you
have<00:01:11.370> to<00:01:11.520> take<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.030> pull<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.370> push<00:01:14.370> up<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
have to take it pull it and push up and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
have to take it pull it and push up and
it<00:01:15.690> will<00:01:15.840> slide<00:01:16.200> off<00:01:16.440> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> bracket<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it will slide off of the bracket and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
it will slide off of the bracket and
after<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.390> will<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.600> it'll<00:01:19.020> still<00:01:19.260> be

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
after that it will be it'll still be

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
after that it will be it'll still be
attached<00:01:19.680> down<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.790> let's<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.180> grab

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
attached down here now let's just grab

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.649 
attached down here now let's just grab
this<00:01:22.340> little<00:01:23.340> piece<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> outside<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this little piece here on the outside to

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.600 
this little piece here on the outside to
keep<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> from<00:01:25.080> sliding<00:01:25.260> off<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.100> takes<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
keep it from sliding off it just takes a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
keep it from sliding off it just takes a
lot<00:01:26.760> of<00:01:26.820> pressure<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> push<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.440> over<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> but

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
lot of pressure to push it over that but

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
lot of pressure to push it over that but
just<00:01:29.790> apply<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.210> much<00:01:30.360> pressure<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.900> can

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
just apply as much pressure as you can

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
just apply as much pressure as you can
and<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.310> won't<00:01:32.549> hit<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.820> exhaust

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and you know you won't hit the exhaust

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:59.249 
and you know you won't hit the exhaust
pipe<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:33.930> hurt<00:01:34.080> your<00:01:34.229> fingers

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.440 

it<00:02:00.259> doesn't<00:02:00.680> matter<00:02:01.159> which<00:02:01.460> side<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.939> on<00:02:02.240> the

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it doesn't matter which side is on the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.090 
it doesn't matter which side is on the
upside<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.110> which<00:02:03.200> side<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.409> on<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.680> downside

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
upside and which side is on the downside

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.600 
upside and which side is on the downside
so<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:05.299> going<00:02:05.479> to<00:02:05.570> apply<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:05.899> like<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:09.610> put

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
so just going to apply it like so put

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:20.890 
so just going to apply it like so put
this<00:02:10.729> top<00:02:11.000> side<00:02:11.269> on<00:02:11.450> first<00:02:19.540> there<00:02:20.540> we<00:02:20.690> go

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
this top side on first there we go

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.890 
this top side on first there we go
managed<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.709> get<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.160> just<00:02:22.519> by<00:02:22.670> making

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
managed to get that on just by making

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.270 
managed to get that on just by making
twisting<00:02:23.900> motions<00:02:24.380> we're<00:02:24.860> going<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.099> add<00:02:25.250> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
twisting motions we're going to add a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.119 
twisting motions we're going to add a
little<00:02:25.519> bit<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.819> oil<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:26.590> make<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.769> easier

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
little bit of oil to this make it easier

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:33.940 
little bit of oil to this make it easier
to<00:02:28.220> come<00:02:28.400> off<00:02:29.769> easier<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:30.830> put<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.069> rather<00:02:32.950> and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
to come off easier to put on rather and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.100 
to come off easier to put on rather and
apply<00:02:34.370> some<00:02:36.099> around<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.510> exhaust<00:02:38.810> part<00:02:39.260> here

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
apply some around the exhaust part here

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.559 
apply some around the exhaust part here
as<00:02:42.110> well<00:02:42.410> as<00:02:42.680> some<00:02:43.010> and<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.459> openings<00:02:44.239> of<00:02:44.450> that

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
as well as some and the openings of that

00:02:44.569 --> 00:03:01.009 
as well as some and the openings of that
bracket<00:02:44.840> there

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.140 

we're<00:03:01.500> not<00:03:01.680> making<00:03:02.099> good<00:03:02.129> progress<00:03:02.549> so<00:03:03.000> we're

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
we're not making good progress so we're
