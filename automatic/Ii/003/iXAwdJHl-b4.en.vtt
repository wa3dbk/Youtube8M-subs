00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
elements a couple different things when

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
chord on its own if we're playing an F

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.170 
chord on its own if we're playing an F
let's<00:00:34.200> play<00:00:34.380> an<00:00:34.500> F<00:00:34.620> chord<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:36.680> major

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
now we're playing something that could

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
now we're playing something that could
be<00:00:49.649> qualified<00:00:49.860> as<00:00:50.399> jazz<00:00:50.670> strictly<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
be qualified as jazz strictly because of

the the rub notes let's let's throw

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.910 
the the rub notes let's let's throw
something<00:00:56.190> else<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.750> slip<00:00:58.289> note

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
something else in there it's a slip note

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.340 
something else in there it's a slip note
which<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.370> kind<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> cousin<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> rub

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
which is a kind of a cousin of a rub

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
which is a kind of a cousin of a rub
note<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.800> basically<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
note it's basically it's more of a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.230 
note it's basically it's more of a
stylistic<00:01:03.780> thing<00:01:04.290> than<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:05.360> structure

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
stylistic thing than it is a structure

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.520 
stylistic thing than it is a structure
theory<00:01:09.240> term<00:01:09.900> however<00:01:10.909> it's<00:01:11.909> equally<00:01:12.510> used<00:01:12.840> in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
theory term however it's equally used in

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.740 
theory term however it's equally used in
jazz<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.430> very<00:01:14.610> important<00:01:15.030> part<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.299> let's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
jazz and a very important part so let's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.550 
jazz and a very important part so let's
run<00:01:16.439> some<00:01:16.850> some<00:01:17.850> rub<00:01:18.119> notes<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:19.200> slip

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
run some some rub notes and some slip

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.420 
run some some rub notes and some slip
notes<00:01:19.799> together<00:01:20.930> I'll<00:01:21.930> show<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.650> quick<00:01:23.070> slip

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
notes together I'll show one quick slip

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.789 
notes together I'll show one quick slip
note<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> would<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.960> from<00:01:25.170> what<00:01:25.590> would

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
note it would be going from what would

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
note it would be going from what would
be<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.040> major<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.729> dropping<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
be a major and dropping it into a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
be a major and dropping it into a
seventh<00:01:28.229> or<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> minor<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:30.119> would<00:01:30.240> be

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
seventh or a minor so there would be

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.060 
seventh or a minor so there would be
that<00:01:30.479> F<00:01:30.689> chord<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.220> run<00:01:32.689> or

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.160 

slipping<00:01:38.070> off<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.670> top<00:01:38.880> key<00:01:39.119> or<00:01:39.479> off<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
slipping off of the top key or off of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.890 
slipping off of the top key or off of
the<00:01:40.530> bottom<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:42.320> giving<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.590> feel<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
the bottom and giving it that feel so

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.840 
the bottom and giving it that feel so
you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.539 

and<00:01:54.850> there's<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.450> basic<00:01:56.110> introduction<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.920> slip

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
and there's a basic introduction to slip

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.100 
and there's a basic introduction to slip
and<00:01:57.729> rub<00:01:58.299> notes<00:01:58.600> when<00:01:59.080> playing<00:01:59.380> jazz<00:01:59.740> piano
