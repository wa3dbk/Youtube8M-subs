00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello guys are precise flesh if that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.549
 with attached to this new video and after 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.500
 the last crackling where there was the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.600
 signor brambilla who was doing the phenomenon 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.850
 with g8 networks it is a transport watch 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.769
 we're dead you exact fans today 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.170
 Let's go back with a video just for you 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 because you deserve my advice 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.929
 to plow on battlefield martelive here 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.579
 one thing can never be said of this 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620
 t-shirt that you saw in a fracco 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.630
 of video is that it is good given directly 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
 a colony but a developer's date 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.920
 of the visceral virtually hidden 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.239
 its own frigate from a closet not 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.309
 could have because they are not gods 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.780
 gadgets that give the public, however, I don't know 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 I don't know, I worked this for a while 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.719
 that we talked a lot then I did 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.250
 a couple videos of battlefield 4 ha 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.989
 He knew right away as it was to the course and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.469
 buckets or a datum in a closet 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.770
 that is not true, that is, everything except the last 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770
 part 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.910
 fantastic then we did it inside 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 now the advice they saw will be 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.540
 those for plowing boys on battlefields 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.460
 atlan ie not what to pull so a 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.870
 compass volemose well no son of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.060
 watch this video would be of the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.340
 fucking war machines on qsfp 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.350
 s actually they will be a lot of things 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.760
 simple very basic for those not yet 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 a bat has understood us now I tell you the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.960
 truth, however, are all things in other words 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.850
 they are fundamental things that I hold 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.590
 in mind it is well in mind when I try to 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.120
 make a good match be useful 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.350
 never take action 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.600
 shitty figure ok 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.670
 first of all to have fun in this 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.080
 game you will have to know how to adapt to 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.540
 situations that you have to be 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.220
 chameleons ok guys because we are 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.780
 back in a certain sense I said it 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 so many times at battlefield 3 then 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.010
 coexistence of the means in most parts 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.570
 of the modalities in short toto the tdm that 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.090
 do n't play it because it has banks 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.890
 really made ad minchiam in 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.590
 most of the maps in short 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.630
 modalities and cohabit great and means 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.490
 and infantry so you will have to know yourself 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.459
 adapt to situations otherwise 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.019
 you will really cork a beast 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.940
 become familiar with the new mini 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.470
 map that I think is much improved 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.019
 compared to the previous bhatti phil 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.700
 because for two reasons it is not very important 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.280
 but anyway it can be useful anyway 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.600
 the range of is shown on the mini map 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.519
 flash capture so there is a 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.470
 square a rectangle do a little bit like 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.140
 it seems to you that indicates that in 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.540
 that area starts the capture of the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.860
 fantastic flag though even more 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.290
 important on the mini map now 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.420
 finally there is a distinct distinction 16 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.220
 zisis and says that regarding i 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.019
 enemies if they are above below I have to 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.880
 battlefield 4 many times it is not clear 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.590
 a bat as these of the adise 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.570
 of the visceral I like so much now 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.190
 develop maps on multiple levels no 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.570
 so maybe you know there is a skyscraper 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.760
 a seventh very slowly 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.580
 on the sixth floor that is really balls 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.860
 at least here it makes you understand if there is an enemy 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.019
 above or below ok if the signals yes 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.120
 however overlap guys if you have 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.100
 a neighbor you understand is very useful 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.810
 this thing i played a game in 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.549
 battlefield 4 for the video or the one there 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.130
 of the return of a few days ago now 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.930
 and I no longer understood a mass with fate 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.150
 days the counters because I was used to 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.730
 the mini hardline map what 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.970
 fundamental to the boys you must know 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.020
 where cabbage sprouts and all and all 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.080
 weapons that you take 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:48.200
 map then rpg but above all stinger 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.360
 and smau is a fundamental player who knows 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.850
 playing guys knows perfectly well 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.490
 that particular map that leaves rpg 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.400
 vice will push him but above all smart 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.680
 the smog to give you an idea is a rpg 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.350
 pissed off really that is stuff 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.750
 meaningless in this one shot game a 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.700
 everything and it is balanced because it is found 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.850
 only on maps you can't sign 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.320
 on the vabbÃ¨ machine that brambilla has 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.690
 already done but you will understand that he is 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.350
 bought only in the characters behind the hood 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.750
 of the car 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.640
 us and do shit and the rest he is 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.620
 learned to be pg from the trunk and on 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.910
 forty 7500 low will probably be 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.710
 the last purchase he made was worth 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.480
 then the life will never go to pull 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.910
 transport reps but do it too 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.410
 ie fundamental because it is a way to 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.000
 you to caution maybe a 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.160
 good helicopter driver because you can 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.720
 also put the stinger or one that 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.400
 can guide the cat well 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.320
 in short, that would be that kind of 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.920
 ie tank for the purposes of the game is a 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.050
 tank 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.060
 so smav ie smog is a struggle 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.740
 meaningless rega 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.530
 you have a transport or that breaks you 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.300
 asshole bam away at home there's a skinny one 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.190
 which is bringing the package to its destination 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.580
 away they also make out what the is 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.980
 problem 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.480
 this is really strong so this 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.130
 because it's important because maybe 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.370
 you want to play a game with cate says 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.620
 today I want to go with the armored vehicle 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.970
 over power I kill all yes but they are 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.650
 be careful that you went to that area 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.510
 and if you don't know that smog is there and 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.130
 all for elderly in half a second 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.160
 because you don't defend yourself from smog 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.100
 therefore fundamental knowledge of the points 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.720
 has these infernal gadgets 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.940
 about the means I have just 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.550
 quoted I love the media in this game 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.220
 and I don't understand how most do it 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.600
 of people to say that there are not 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.930
 means in this fps 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.660
 I perhaps know why for many for 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.490
 in short, many the conception of the 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.410
 means is the medium is only that there that 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.910
 jean cannon that shoots and messes no 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.380
 or the helicopter that fires rockets at 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.270
 not everything is spying 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.400
 here there are means but they are gods 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.820
 light armored vehicles of armored vehicles 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.470
 light but agazzi we do the massacres there 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.720
 I see the people who take the suv 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.630
 in short, an armored vehicle that is not wine 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.190
 the big one 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.200
 but what the milligan has for 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.080
 by default we take it for 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.880
 move from abi and leave it there then there 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.590
 one of his enemies goes it was because he puts himself 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.660
 on the rear side machine guns 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.400
 or on the mini Kantiana because I am 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.200
 very strong that is whatever it takes 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.030
 to pull down and it's not these maps 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.320
 They are full of engineers if there are any 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.270
 engineers but many may not have 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.210
 lemme 320 then boys 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.010
 the means are fundamental and above all 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.040
 they are much more balanced than 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.900
 battlefield 4 because if you for example 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.700
 you want to play with that to you or with one 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.170
 these means you have another against 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.940
 so if you know that it has ter areas 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.860
 only gone killing if home brinati 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.360
 you ass everyone 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.070
 same thing regarding 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.960
 the attack helicopter, that is if you are 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.180
 good at piloting it you may have it too 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.740
 a gunner of category c gc c is 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.570
 really guys you can do the 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.310
 difference in game 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.420
 I'll make you a video anyway 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.820
 on means for this thing really 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.440
 that is to say, paradoxical means always 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.030
 left in disarray so but I know 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.220
 the mobile spawn is also very strong 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.950
 beautiful because anyway if you are 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.930
 inside and you don't get grenades and m3 20 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.160
 boys that are arranged on 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.230
 right and left machine gun e 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.580
 big massacre fouls anyway I repeat vi 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.290
 I'll make a video just because it's too much 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.960
 fun then there is already a couple of ideas 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.000
 in mind other advice not played 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.190
 I've already told you this in tdm why 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.440
 sponsors or really done at 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.120
 cabbage de cannes so don't do it is 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.790
 rather wait for the peace that will come out 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.450
 I think I don't know if I shoot a case at the end of 

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.310
 end of April 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.470
 or like that in early May before which one 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.480
 they will do where we say they will fix a 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.880
 some things will balance the weapons a little and 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.570
 finally settle sti cabbage 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.880
 spawn 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.230
 as for the deathmatch team 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.420
 last thing guys but whatever 

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.130
 important I recommend 

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.350
