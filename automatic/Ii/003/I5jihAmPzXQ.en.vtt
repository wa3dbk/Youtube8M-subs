00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
trusting to the F 24 is a great solution

trusting to the F 24 is a great solution
now<00:00:20.369> may<00:00:20.520> not<00:00:20.550> be<00:00:20.730> because<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.060> have

back in the day when global Trust used
to<00:00:50.879> sell<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.360> arch<00:00:51.719> system<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
to sell the arch system well this is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
to sell the arch system well this is
exactly<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> brand<00:00:55.410> new

exactly what it is this is the brand new
arch<00:00:55.860> system<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> may<00:00:57.000> be<00:00:57.059> wondering<00:00:57.570> why

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
arch system so you may be wondering why

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
arch system so you may be wondering why
did<00:00:58.109> they<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.649> away<00:00:58.710> why<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.370> coming

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
did they take it away why is it coming

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.549 
did they take it away why is it coming
back<00:00:59.699> now<00:00:59.940> there's<00:01:00.539> some<00:01:00.780> new<00:01:00.989> improvements

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
back now there's some new improvements

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.200 
back now there's some new improvements
on<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.250> I'll<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.699> only<00:01:02.850> make<00:01:03.090> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
on here but I'll not only make this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
on here but I'll not only make this
easier<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:03.899> together<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.769> also

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
easier to put together but it's also

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.679 
easier to put together but it's also
going<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:06.090> versatile<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
going to be more versatile in the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
going to be more versatile in the
features<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.260> decide<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.799> add<00:01:07.950> more<00:01:08.280> pieces

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
features you decide to add more pieces

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
features you decide to add more pieces
let's<00:01:09.240> take<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> look<00:01:09.720> what's<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> box<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
let's take a look what's in the box and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.320 
let's take a look what's in the box and
then<00:01:11.250> we'll<00:01:11.400> take<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.180> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
then we'll take it all and put it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.870 
then we'll take it all and put it
together<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:14.070> when<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.280> open<00:01:14.460> up<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> box

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
together and when you open up the box

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.460 
together and when you open up the box
and<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.180> kind<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> already<00:01:15.600> put<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.049> halfway

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and I kind of already put this halfway

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
and I kind of already put this halfway
together<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.670> idea<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
together just so you can get an idea you

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.200 
together just so you can get an idea you
have<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:19.170> main<00:01:19.740> leg<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.220> course<00:01:20.490> you've<00:01:21.180> got

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
have your main leg of course you've got

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
have your main leg of course you've got
your<00:01:21.630> cross<00:01:21.960> spanning<00:01:22.500> you'll<00:01:22.619> notice<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
your cross spanning you'll notice that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.249 
your cross spanning you'll notice that
the<00:01:23.340> top<00:01:23.670> span<00:01:23.970> over<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.450> how<00:01:24.960> it's

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the top span over here how it's

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.410 
the top span over here how it's
basically<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.310> individual<00:01:26.880> pieces<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
basically two individual pieces and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.980 
basically two individual pieces and
we'll<00:01:28.259> cover<00:01:28.409> later<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.799> why<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.400> is

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
we'll cover later on why that is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.700 
we'll cover later on why that is
now<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> actual<00:01:31.710> arch<00:01:32.549> part<00:01:33.259> you'll<00:01:34.259> notice

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
now the actual arch part you'll notice

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.230 
now the actual arch part you'll notice
on<00:01:34.950> Hanah<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.820> pretty<00:01:35.939> cool

added another couple of longer pieces on
here<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:02.130> use<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:04.229> make<00:02:04.380> this

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
here you can now use these to make this

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.190 
here you can now use these to make this
just<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.490> little<00:02:05.610> bit<00:02:05.759> taller<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.360> Global<00:02:07.020> Trust

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
just a little bit taller so Global Trust

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
just a little bit taller so Global Trust
has<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.799> thought<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.399> all<00:02:08.550> out<00:02:08.789> when<00:02:09.209> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
has really thought this all out when it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.750 
has really thought this all out when it
comes<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> mobile<00:02:10.200> DJ<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.920> ones<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.459> grow

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
comes to the mobile DJ the ones to grow

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.309 
comes to the mobile DJ the ones to grow
with<00:02:11.970> they're<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> trust<00:02:12.510> versus<00:02:12.959> getting<00:02:13.140> a

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
with they're a trust versus getting a

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.660

whole

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.199 
whole
system<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.599> replace<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.880> let's<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.150> ahead

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
system to replace it so let's go ahead

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.240 
system to replace it so let's go ahead
and<00:02:17.330> kind<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.599> build<00:02:17.780> it<00:02:17.900> now<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:18.980> raining

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.100 

now<00:03:19.790> at<00:03:19.940> this<00:03:20.090> point<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.630> this<00:03:20.870> where<00:03:21.080> I

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
now at this point this is this where I

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.380 
now at this point this is this where I
take<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.130> basis<00:03:22.550> which<00:03:22.760> already<00:03:23.150> pre

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
take the basis which already pre

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.840 
take the basis which already pre
manufacture<00:03:24.050> with<00:03:24.200> these<00:03:24.290> nice<00:03:24.500> little

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
manufacture with these nice little

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.740 
manufacture with these nice little
plastic<00:03:25.850> edges<00:03:26.150> so<00:03:26.209> you<00:03:26.270> know<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.510> sharp

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
plastic edges so you know the sharp

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.960 
plastic edges so you know the sharp
edges<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.080> cut<00:03:27.260> yourself<00:03:27.410> on<00:03:27.890> polish<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
edges to cut yourself on polish the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.280 
edges to cut yourself on polish the
lumen<00:03:29.209> all<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.390> way<00:03:29.510> through<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.080> nice

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
lumen all the way through with a nice

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.260 
lumen all the way through with a nice
slant<00:03:30.680> up<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.190> again<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.550> won't<00:03:31.670> trip<00:03:31.970> over

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
slant up so again you won't trip over

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.910 
slant up so again you won't trip over
them<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.690> it'll<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:33.020> really<00:03:33.200> easy<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.709> tape

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
them and it'll be really easy to tape

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.030

it<00:03:39.230> all<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.560> now<00:03:39.769> remember<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.700> triangle

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
it all up now remember that a triangle

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.000 
it all up now remember that a triangle
is<00:03:41.150> also<00:03:41.300> easier<00:03:41.750> to<00:03:41.810> pack<00:03:42.080> as<00:03:42.290> well<00:03:42.320> so

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
is also easier to pack as well so

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.920 
is also easier to pack as well so
instead<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.550> surface<00:03:43.880> area<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.269> square

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
instead of the surface area that square

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.930 
instead of the surface area that square
would<00:03:45.050> normally<00:03:45.410> take<00:03:45.620> just<00:03:46.310> pack<00:03:46.489> these<00:03:46.700> side

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
would normally take just pack these side

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.390 
would normally take just pack these side
by<00:03:47.120> side<00:03:47.150> and<00:03:47.750> you're<00:03:48.320> good<00:03:48.500> to<00:03:48.650> go<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:49.310> know

they<00:03:49.550> take<00:03:49.700> up<00:03:49.880> not<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.390> much<00:03:50.600> more<00:03:50.810> room

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
they take up not that much more room

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.770 
they take up not that much more room
than<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.709> would<00:03:51.860> expect<00:03:51.950> so<00:03:52.430> really<00:03:53.420> easy<00:03:53.600> to

to<00:04:26.660> make<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.960> little<00:04:27.080> bit<00:04:27.260> wider<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.979> is

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
to make it a little bit wider this is
