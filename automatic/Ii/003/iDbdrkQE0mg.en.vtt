here<00:01:24.600> has<00:01:25.020> been<00:01:25.229> added<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.640> is<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
here has been added so that this is the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
here has been added so that this is the
actual<00:01:27.630> x-force<00:01:28.350> Wolverine<00:01:28.830> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
uncanny x-force over een so that's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
uncanny x-force over een so that's
basically<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> main<00:01:32.880> difference<00:01:33.360> right

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
basically the main difference right

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.020 
basically the main difference right
there<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.729> pretty<00:01:35.909> obvious

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
there and you know it's pretty obvious

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.210 
there and you know it's pretty obvious
and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.780> other<00:01:36.960> thing<00:01:37.290> are<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.920> claws

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and then the other thing are the claws

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.270 
and then the other thing are the claws
the<00:01:38.880> claws<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:39.720> shinier<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.530> SDCC

I<00:01:58.530> switched<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.189> claws<00:01:59.460> out<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.720> pop

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
I switched the claws out and you can pop

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.469 
I switched the claws out and you can pop
these<00:02:01.290> claws<00:02:01.650> off<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.340> had<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:02.909> had<00:02:03.060> said

very very nice this one has no painted

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.240 
very very nice this one has no painted
buckles<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:13.140> don't<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:13.709> if<00:03:13.800> I<00:03:13.890> could<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.220> it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
buckles so I don't know if I could do it

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.860 
buckles so I don't know if I could do it
I<00:03:14.520> don't<00:03:14.790> know<00:03:14.850> I've<00:03:15.090> never<00:03:15.330> really<00:03:15.570> popped

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
I don't know I've never really popped

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.630 
I don't know I've never really popped
these<00:03:16.110> off<00:03:16.410> or<00:03:16.650> anything<00:03:16.830> but<00:03:17.160> maybe<00:03:17.280> if<00:03:17.550> I

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
these off or anything but maybe if I

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.560 
these off or anything but maybe if I
could<00:03:17.790> switch<00:03:17.970> them<00:03:18.120> out<00:03:18.240> that<00:03:18.420> would<00:03:18.510> be

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
could switch them out that would be

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.240 
could switch them out that would be
pretty<00:03:18.780> awesome<00:03:18.840> who<00:03:19.290> knows<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.890> silver<00:03:20.160> on

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
pretty awesome who knows the silver on

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.610 
pretty awesome who knows the silver on
the<00:03:20.340> sdcc<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:21.180> actually<00:03:21.570> does<00:03:21.840> match<00:03:22.200> this

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the sdcc one actually does match this

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.230 
the sdcc one actually does match this
one<00:03:22.800> right<00:03:22.950> here<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.000> want<00:03:24.180> to

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
one right here and if you want to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.290 
one right here and if you want to
compare<00:03:24.510> them<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.500> x-force<00:03:26.070> warpath<00:03:26.670> the

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
compare them to the x-force warpath the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.140 
compare them to the x-force warpath the
color<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.080> same<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:29.130> it's<00:03:29.880> pretty<00:03:30.030> much

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
color is the same so it's pretty much

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.510 
color is the same so it's pretty much

see through the figure a little bit but

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.460 
see through the figure a little bit but
not<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.460> big<00:04:35.729> deal<00:04:35.940> rotate<00:04:36.390> side<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.660> side<00:04:36.990> and

yeah so you get a decent amount of
movement<00:04:39.510> right<00:04:39.780> there<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:40.560> diaphragm<00:04:41.010> he

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550
