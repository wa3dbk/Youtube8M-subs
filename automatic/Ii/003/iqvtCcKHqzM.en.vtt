00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello to all youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.309
 tutorial I will show you how to measure the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.570
 charge a battery without tools 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.269
 strange gadgets, however, then you will have to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.949
 have your battery 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.949
 in this case or a hard cell 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.390
 however then a thread 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.560
 a wire a copper wire 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.269
 everything 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.079
 nicolina obviously any thread that 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:40.040
 conduct electricity and then a light bulb 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:43.110
 of these small ones you see so 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.570
 then we must first of all 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.550
 take the iron children and the battery 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.670
 stick them together like that when you have 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.149
 keep the tip of the battery connected 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.350
 at the ends of the cable then in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.670
 meanwhile you keep both things together 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 the other end we have to attack it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.689
 keep them together with the light bulb then 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.100
 we put on the thread of the 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.100
 light bulbs in this way and we keep 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.049
 Now and then be wasted once 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.020
 we all hold together 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.380
 you have to do this you have to attack 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.970
 part of the bottom of the bulb starts 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.820
 this with this part the bottom of the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.579
 battery and you see that the light bulb is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:44.490
 turn on then based on how much you do 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.259
 turn on the light bulb you will understand counts 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 battery charged 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.270
 well now the battery is hemidium charged 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.430
 charge because it didn't turn on much 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.810
 strong if it turned on much stronger 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 because if there is and is stronger 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.820
 light bulb means that it was charged at 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.579
 maximum if it doesn't turn on it means that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.810
 the battery is low or here is simple 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.229
 thanks for watching 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.229
 to the next
