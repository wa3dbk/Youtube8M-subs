this this is one of these things you
would<00:05:01.800> learn<00:05:02.040> from<00:05:02.070> trial<00:05:02.700> and<00:05:02.850> error<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.360> know

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
would learn from trial and error I know

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.020 
would learn from trial and error I know
there's<00:05:04.200> supposed<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.070> be<00:05:05.130> like<00:05:05.310> teeth<00:05:05.610> on<00:05:05.910> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
there's supposed to be like teeth on the

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.030 
there's supposed to be like teeth on the
bottom<00:05:06.210> or<00:05:06.510> something<00:05:06.690> but<00:05:07.320> it's<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.590> floating

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
bottom or something but it's a floating

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.750 
bottom or something but it's a floating
thing<00:05:08.550> with<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.910> completely<00:05:09.720> smooth<00:05:10.169> surface

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
thing with a completely smooth surface

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.140 
thing with a completely smooth surface
thus<00:05:11.760> any<00:05:12.150> sane<00:05:12.810> rational<00:05:13.200> gamer<00:05:13.890> would<00:05:14.760> think

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
thus any sane rational gamer would think

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.490 
thus any sane rational gamer would think
it<00:05:15.419> could<00:05:15.930> be<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.200> platformer

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
it could be a platformer

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.619 
it could be a platformer
fucking-a<00:05:19.500> alright

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629

did you see that there was no way for me
to<00:05:26.969> avoid<00:05:27.209> my<00:05:27.629> death<00:05:27.899> in<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.259> particular

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
to avoid my death in that particular

to avoid my death in that particular
situation<00:05:29.119> and<00:05:30.119> listen<00:05:30.389> to<00:05:30.449> this<00:05:30.539> even<00:05:30.959> in

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
situation and listen to this even in

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.679 
situation and listen to this even in
slow<00:05:31.499> motion<00:05:31.829> you<00:05:32.249> know<00:05:32.849> what<00:05:33.029> I<00:05:33.059> think<00:05:33.539> this

00:05:33.679 --> 00:05:33.689 
slow motion you know what I think this

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.600 
slow motion you know what I think this
game<00:05:33.869> actually<00:05:34.199> sounds<00:05:34.860> better<00:05:35.189> in<00:05:35.459> slow

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
game actually sounds better in slow

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.350 
game actually sounds better in slow
motion<00:05:36.499> see<00:05:37.499> I<00:05:37.529> jump<00:05:38.129> right<00:05:38.610> there<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:39.119> avoid

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
motion see I jump right there to avoid

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.379 
motion see I jump right there to avoid
that<00:05:39.569> thing<00:05:39.749> on<00:05:39.899> the<00:05:39.989> ground<00:05:40.319> and<00:05:40.769> that<00:05:41.759> I<00:05:42.059> land

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
that thing on the ground and that I land

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.539 
that thing on the ground and that I land
I'm<00:05:42.719> gonna<00:05:42.899> land<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.409> in<00:05:43.559> time<00:05:43.829> to<00:05:44.189> avoid<00:05:44.489> the

on<00:05:46.769> the<00:05:46.860> ground<00:05:47.069> comes<00:05:47.249> after<00:05:47.519> me<00:05:47.669> and<00:05:47.789> if<00:05:47.909> I

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:47.999 
on the ground comes after me and if I

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.999 
on the ground comes after me and if I
jump<00:05:48.269> now<00:05:48.299> you<00:05:48.539> see<00:05:48.959> right<00:05:49.079> now<00:05:49.259> I<00:05:49.499> would<00:05:49.979> have

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
jump now you see right now I would have

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.399 
jump now you see right now I would have
hid<00:05:50.279> the<00:05:50.459> projectile<00:05:51.119> in<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.539> air<00:05:51.689> there<00:05:52.259> was
