[Intro Music]

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.920
Go, g-go, g-go, go, go!

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.000
Alright! So what the fuck is this?!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.580
Oh, look at that, it's like a red white and blue.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.580
For AMERICA.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.400
Sonic. 'Merican.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.940
And- whoa. Shit.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.540
Oh my God, there's another fucking loading screen already?!

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.320
Yeah, 'long time no see.'

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.340
I ran into him four seconds into the game.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.960
Really?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.060
Are you fucking kidding me?!

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.060
So...? [chokes on confusion]

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.180
Hm.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.180
What the fuck am I doing?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.300
Huhuh! Watch out kids!

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600
It's not the Sonic your grandma used to play!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.160
WHAT IS THIS GAME?!

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT FUCKING COLLECTING RINGS!

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.260
THIS SUCKS!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.800
I gotta fucking go on a quest,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.600
to fucking play the game?!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.380
What the fuck?

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.140
Whu-?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.860
How are you screaming underwater?!

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.880
You falling off a fucking cliff or drowning?!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.800
He can't even do the fucking spin thing!

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.440
That's the whole point of Sonic,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.800
is he goes "WHEWHEWHEWHEWHE"

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.620
and then fucking shoots!

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.280
Now he just runs around with his arms hanging out like an idiot!

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.640
Who the fuck wants to do this?!

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.340
I wanna run real fast and fucking smash into shit!

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.780
Not dance around a fucking town talking to people!

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.940
It's not fucking Zelda 2!

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.100
I'm not playing Simon's Quest!

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.620
WHY ARE THE FUCKING guh- CAMERAS INVERTED?!

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.080
Braid looking- OH MY GOD!

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.980
OHHHHH IT'S FUCKING MITOSIS!

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.800
SHIT!

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.180
Fucking astonishing.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.180
You ever wonder what the inside of a tree looks like?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.780
Wuhbam, there it is.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.720
Yeah, I can see it!

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.040
I don't know how to fucking get there!

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.980
Ohhh my God.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.780
I gotta go to the store.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.780
To buy a fucking boat, apparently,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.140
to cross the fucking sea!

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.740
No, I wanna talk to the other guy!

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.940
TALK TO THE FUCKING OTHER GUY!

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.100
WHAT THE FUCK?!

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.840
THANK YOU!

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.480
(Making fun of the narrator)
With "the money" you can shop in town!

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.240
With "the items" you can do things with "the game!"

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.200
Great! Time to get a fucking job!

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560
Sonic the Hedgehog, fucking working class man.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.420
Oh my God.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.500
I need the fucking thing to cross the river,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.380
but I need the money to buy the fucking thing!

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.040
I just wanna fucking play the game!

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.520
I wanna kill Dr. Robotnik.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100
It's Robotnik, not Eggman!

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.520
I don't give a shit if you changed your name!

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.500
You're fucking stupid!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.520
Fuckin making shoes.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.840
Let's make some fucking shoes!

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.360
Get the shoe fairy in this!

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.000
Fucking shoe fairy! The game!

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.240
It fu- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.900
IT TOOK ME OUT OF THE LOADING SCREEN

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.140
TO SHOW ME THAT!?

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.720
AND THEN PUT ME BACK IN THE FUCKING LOADING SCREEN?!

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.100
JESUS CHRIST!

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.580
Oh my... God!

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.920
This is so fucking slow!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.120
What-eh What did anyone like about this?!

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.100
What is fucking fast about this?!

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.740
This SUCKS!

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.780
Apparently, Robert here,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.100
is the best shoe maker in the fucking world.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.080
Yea, ya did great,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.780
Good job!

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.480
Oh my god, there's a score board?!

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.040
We got the stupid... oh.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.700
Fucking things in our shoes.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.200
Okay.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.700
What the-?!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.160
Uh. That didn't do shit.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.600
How do I fucking use the thing?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.400
I just bought it!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.380
I- I ca- I'm staring at the map.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.980
This game, you can't even look at the game!

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.460
You have to look at the fucking mini-map!

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.080
Because the camera will fuck your mouth!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.220
I can't control this asshole!

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.160
Christ.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.440
OH MY GOD I MADE IT!

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.120
I'm gonna play it?!

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.920
Am I gonna play?!

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.580
GET IN THE FUCKING THING.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.380
Holy fuck, this is shitty.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.700
This is just shit.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.600
WHAT THE FUCK?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.820
WHEN DOES HE DO THIS?!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.780
I don't remember Sonic doing this in the original goddamn game!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.740
Look! What a fucking speedster!

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.060
He's just walking!

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.780
He's just fucking walking,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.420
through a fucking loop-de-loop!

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.680
You fucking stupid shit!

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.600
There's a fucking shark...

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.840
flying by.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.540
Don't worry about it.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.040
It's cool.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.560
Man, this game sure is fast!

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:28.740
