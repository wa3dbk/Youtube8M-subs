looks<00:03:08.239> like<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.780> works<00:03:08.870> by<00:03:09.110> means<00:03:09.320> of

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
looks like this it works by means of

looks like this it works by means of
magnetic<00:03:09.739> induction<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:12.080> power<00:03:13.070> mat

works<00:03:14.030> when<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:15.050> bat<00:03:15.260> itself<00:03:15.680> comes<00:03:16.220> into

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
works when the bat itself comes into

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.770 
works when the bat itself comes into
contact<00:03:16.640> with<00:03:16.880> the<00:03:17.030> receiver<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.600> we've
