00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.960
 and hello that such youtube and good friends 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.029
 you are welcome here to a guide 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.040
 achievements and good this time we're going to do the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.170
 achievement of saving the marlins to all 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.640
 the marines proust cores or brothers 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 until the end that as you want to call 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.390
 and good for this mission 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 we have to avoid all the deaths of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.529
 the marines at the beginning are going to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.510
 deliver a packet of two marines and 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.640
 you have to save them and well a guy 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.800
 important in this achievement is that what 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 play cooperatively in this way is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.390
 a little easier that they can cover 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 a little more more ground so that 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.079
 they were so they do not accept the marines 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.690
 and another thing is that they give them weapons 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.660
 powerful ones kill a prometheus and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.290
 they remove people and that their weapons 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.059
 advisable to give them to the 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.579
 marines since they have infinite ammunition 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.770
 and good in this section we will have 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.780
 another pack of marines and only that 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.210
 this time there will be four to have a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.140
 total of six marines this is very 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.880
 important 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.500
 because if they kill one 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.780
 just restart the point of 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.670
 control and good nothing happens anymore 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.430
 so they're going to restart and their 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.770
 marines are going to continue there another trick is 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.340
 that they are advancing with care but that 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.840
 if they move fast so to speak this 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.430
 why because in this way you 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.530
 they go and all the banner bullets towards 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.420
 you have to play this in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.040
 heroic that's why two is more 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 easy since not all bullets go 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.659
 the one for you and the Marines hold a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.240
 lot of bullets so it is not 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.759
 So much trouble but you have to take care 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.710
 much that detail this section can be 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.450
 say that it is one of the most difficult because 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.789
 this is where they most simply die 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.380
 the marlins as there is morillo but 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.140
 I have my partner that's a great 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.759
 advantage now and when you get to 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.110
 the area where you have to activate and 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.670
 where you have to put cortana and then 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.229
 so you have a turret here there is a 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.780
 turret opposite and the engines are at 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.880
 covered this position is very important 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.130
 if you are playing it from 2 recommended 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.860
 of 100% playing it from 2 since you can 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.329
 cover this part totally covering 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.600
 this part you can kill all those who 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.360
 they are coming and really 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.770
 and Marines will be very little that is 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.090
 your partner if he is going to be shot and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.860
 controlling is going to be like fire of 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.350
 suppression while everything is fucking 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.300
 to all enemies is very important 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.150
 this section at the moment when you 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.380
 You see that a man died, you repeat the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.000
 scene do not go to activate the button 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 because then I will load a point of 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.380
 control and then it's going to be inevitable and you 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.270
 you'll have to start again 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.100
 then how did you mention this part is 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.540
 very important this position who is going to 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.490
 take this position is very important 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.990
 that makes it to cover very well that 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.060
 have then now that a good 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.610
 skill with the turret so you do not 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.250
 I warm him up and he can keep shooting 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.230
 but more important is that in certain 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.970
 part your partner like mine does not go 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.370
 up there because you see that the Marines 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.500
 follow them so you must be 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.660
 super say that absent in the same 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.160
 zone without you moving about all your 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.750
 partner if you are here the monkeys do not 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.360
 nothing happens they stay on the other side of the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.980
 barraca but it is important that your 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.230
 partner stays there and is not 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.730
 running to the top empire for 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.960
 that it seems that the monkeys do not 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.850
 pursue and well really the most 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.930
 difficult is the previous one where then where 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.969
 you arrive 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.400
 against the other four marines and 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:24.650
 well once you see that you count that 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.109
 There are six of them and they did not kill you 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.359
 as there are two bodies thrown away do not go 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.400
 to confuse active this part where that 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.530
 house cut there then managed to unlocked 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.379
 No, and I hope you have served them 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.150
 well so this guide we see in a 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.150
 next video and chicken
