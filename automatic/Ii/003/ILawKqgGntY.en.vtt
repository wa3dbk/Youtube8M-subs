00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
are some wire lights and I got these

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.780 
are some wire lights and I got these
from<00:01:05.930> Amazon<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.070> they're<00:01:07.280> about<00:01:07.430> seven

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
from Amazon and they're about seven

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.640 
from Amazon and they're about seven
dollars<00:01:08.060> per<00:01:08.090> strand<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.020> it's<00:01:09.200> relatively

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
dollars per strand so it's relatively

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.140 
dollars per strand so it's relatively
inexpensive<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:10.580> they<00:01:10.820> come<00:01:11.000> in<00:01:11.120> different

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
colors you're also gonna need aluminum

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.460 
colors you're also gonna need aluminum
wire<00:01:13.610> I<00:01:13.880> got<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.150> at<00:01:14.330> Michael's<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:14.990> I<00:01:15.290> went

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
wire I got this at Michael's and I went

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.440 
wire I got this at Michael's and I went
for<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.890> thickest<00:01:16.430> wire<00:01:16.700> that<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.000> could<00:01:17.210> find

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
for the thickest wire that I could find

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.780 
for the thickest wire that I could find
because<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:17.990> going<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:18.409> act<00:01:18.650> as<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.010> face<00:01:19.460> or

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
because it's going to act as the face or

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.760 
because it's going to act as the face or
a<00:01:19.820> neon<00:01:20.120> sign<00:01:20.320> finally<00:01:21.320> you're<00:01:21.440> going<00:01:21.560> to<00:01:21.650> need

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
a neon sign finally you're going to need

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.200 
a neon sign finally you're going to need
some<00:01:21.979> clear<00:01:22.190> string<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.640> can<00:01:22.700> get<00:01:22.909> this<00:01:23.030> at

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
some clear string you can get this at

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.450 
some clear string you can get this at
Michael's<00:01:23.630> or<00:01:23.840> jo-ann<00:01:24.229> fabric<00:01:24.590> store<00:01:24.800> so<00:01:25.280> the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
Michael's or jo-ann fabric store so the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.310 
Michael's or jo-ann fabric store so the
first<00:01:25.640> thing<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:25.909> did<00:01:26.060> was<00:01:26.240> draw<00:01:26.510> out<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.990> sign

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
first thing I did was draw out the sign

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.410 
first thing I did was draw out the sign
on<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.890> piece<00:01:28.159> of<00:01:28.400> scrap<00:01:28.729> paper<00:01:28.760> and<00:01:29.360> I

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
on a piece of scrap paper and I

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.730 
on a piece of scrap paper and I
recommend<00:01:29.810> doing<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.140> just<00:01:30.380> because<00:01:30.620> it

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
recommend doing this just because it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.320 
recommend doing this just because it
makes<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.070> lot<00:01:31.250> easier<00:01:31.700> when<00:01:31.729> you're<00:01:32.000> taking

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
makes it a lot easier when you're taking

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.969 
makes it a lot easier when you're taking
your<00:01:32.479> wire<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:33.080> you're<00:01:33.200> molding<00:01:33.350> it<00:01:33.620> into<00:01:33.890> the

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
your wire and you're molding it into the

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.770 
your wire and you're molding it into the
shape<00:01:34.220> you<00:01:34.370> want<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.180> I'll<00:01:35.420> link<00:01:35.510> the<00:01:35.659> image

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
shape you want so I'll link the image

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.149 
shape you want so I'll link the image
down<00:01:36.080> below<00:01:36.350> if<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.530> guys<00:01:36.650> want<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.920> do<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
down below if you guys want to do the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.890 
down below if you guys want to do the
same<00:01:37.370> thing<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:37.820> draw<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.180> out<00:01:38.270> first<00:01:38.600> but<00:01:38.870> I

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
same thing and draw it out first but I

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.080 
same thing and draw it out first but I
highly<00:01:39.170> recommend<00:01:39.260> doing<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.159> so<00:01:40.790> I'm<00:01:40.940> taking

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
highly recommend doing so so I'm taking

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.820 
highly recommend doing so so I'm taking
my<00:01:41.240> wire<00:01:41.510> straightening<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.229> out<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.710> then

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
my wire straightening it out and then

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.289 
my wire straightening it out and then
I'm<00:01:42.920> gonna<00:01:43.040> start<00:01:43.250> curving<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:44.060> kind<00:01:44.240> of

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
I'm gonna start curving it just kind of

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.359 
I'm gonna start curving it just kind of
around<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.750> outline<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.380> I've<00:01:45.560> drawn<00:01:45.860> the

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
around the outline that I've drawn the

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.100 
around the outline that I've drawn the
hardest<00:01:46.700> part<00:01:46.850> here<00:01:47.090> is<00:01:47.240> getting<00:01:47.510> both<00:01:47.750> of<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
hardest part here is getting both of the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.930 
hardest part here is getting both of the
wings<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:48.560> match<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.040> I<00:01:49.070> recommend<00:01:49.520> doing<00:01:49.760> one

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
wings to match so I recommend doing one

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.120 
wings to match so I recommend doing one
side<00:01:50.180> first<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.020> using<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.500> other<00:01:51.770> side

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
side first and then using the other side

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.590 
side first and then using the other side
as<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.369> reference<00:01:52.909> when

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
as a reference when

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.960 
as a reference when
creating<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.049> second<00:01:54.439> wing<00:01:54.820> once<00:01:55.820> you're

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
creating the second wing once you're

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.719 
creating the second wing once you're
done<00:01:56.119> creating<00:01:56.330> both<00:01:56.869> of<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.560> wire<00:01:57.950> kind<00:01:58.640> of

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
done creating both of the wire kind of

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.850 
done creating both of the wire kind of
bases<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.540> our<00:01:59.780> neon<00:02:00.080> sign<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.560> can<00:02:00.710> go<00:02:00.799> ahead

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
bases to our neon sign you can go ahead

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.590 
bases to our neon sign you can go ahead
and<00:02:00.950> take<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.369> lights<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.090> we're<00:02:02.360> going<00:02:02.540> to

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
and take the lights and we're going to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.990 
and take the lights and we're going to
attach<00:02:03.049> them<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.770> wire<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.580> do<00:02:04.729> so<00:02:04.970> I

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
attach them to the wire to do so I

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.880 
attach them to the wire to do so I
bought<00:02:05.360> some<00:02:05.570> clear<00:02:05.900> string<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.619> what's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
bought some clear string and what's

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.380 
bought some clear string and what's
great<00:02:07.009> about<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.430> is<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.670> you<00:02:07.909> can<00:02:08.119> tie<00:02:08.330> the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
great about this is that you can tie the

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.510 
great about this is that you can tie the
wire<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:09.020> it<00:02:09.050> but<00:02:09.649> it's<00:02:09.770> not<00:02:09.830> permanent<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.369> if

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
wire to it but it's not permanent so if

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.770 
wire to it but it's not permanent so if
you<00:02:10.610> wanted<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.940> use<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.330> lights<00:02:11.569> for

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
you wanted to use the lights for

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.300 
you wanted to use the lights for
something<00:02:12.110> else<00:02:12.290> in<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.500> future<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.950> totally

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
something else in the future you totally

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
something else in the future you totally
could<00:02:13.489> what's<00:02:13.940> also<00:02:14.120> nice<00:02:14.360> is<00:02:14.420> because<00:02:14.660> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
could what's also nice is because the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.199 
could what's also nice is because the
string<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:15.440> clear<00:02:15.920> it's<00:02:16.130> not<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.880> like

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
string is clear it's not going to like

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.090 
string is clear it's not going to like
get<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.020> way<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.380> your<00:02:18.500> light<00:02:18.739> shining

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
get in the way of your light shining

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.860 
get in the way of your light shining
through<00:02:19.220> or<00:02:19.520> anything<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.209> I'm<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.450> tying

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
through or anything so I'm just tying

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.530 
through or anything so I'm just tying
little<00:02:21.290> basic<00:02:21.739> knots<00:02:21.980> throughout<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.940> whole

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
little basic knots throughout the whole

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
little basic knots throughout the whole
fixture<00:02:24.080> this<00:02:24.709> process<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.250> kind<00:02:25.459> of<00:02:25.520> tedious

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
fixture this process is kind of tedious

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.420 
fixture this process is kind of tedious
but<00:02:26.209> it<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.900> simple<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.739> recommend

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
but it really is simple so I recommend

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.680 
but it really is simple so I recommend
just<00:02:28.519> putting<00:02:28.700> your<00:02:29.000> favorite<00:02:29.330> show<00:02:29.480> on

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
just putting your favorite show on

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.449 
just putting your favorite show on
Netflix<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.290> tying<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.890> bunch<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.220> little

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
Netflix and tying a bunch of little

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.970 
Netflix and tying a bunch of little
knots<00:02:31.670> until<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.360> have<00:02:32.569> this<00:02:32.810> all<00:02:33.110> nice<00:02:33.680> and

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
knots until you have this all nice and

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860 
knots until you have this all nice and
attached<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.640> then<00:02:35.090> finally<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:35.569> can<00:02:35.720> go

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
attached and then finally you can go

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.320 
attached and then finally you can go
ahead<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.470> take<00:02:36.800> your<00:02:37.040> neon<00:02:37.340> sign<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.030> mount

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
ahead and take your neon sign and mount

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.540 
ahead and take your neon sign and mount
it<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.780> wall<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.769> really<00:02:40.010> light<00:02:40.280> so

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550
