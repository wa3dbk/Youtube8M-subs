00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
competitive advantage for us frankly we

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
competitive advantage for us frankly we

we can match their words in their
comments<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> way<00:00:40.170> they<00:00:40.320> use<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> car

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
comments but the way they use the car

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
packs about 30 pounds lighter than the

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.060 
packs about 30 pounds lighter than the
car<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.660> we<00:01:52.780> originally<00:01:53.290> introduced<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.950> in

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
car that we originally introduced it in

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.450 
car that we originally introduced it in
and<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.520> have<00:01:54.700> two<00:01:55.420> new<00:01:55.600> motors<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.460> powering

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
and you have two new motors of powering

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.210 
and you have two new motors of powering
the<00:01:57.670> car<00:01:57.880> yeah<00:01:58.330> we<00:01:58.480> do<00:01:58.660> the<00:01:59.080> entire<00:01:59.410> drive<00:01:59.860> unit

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the car yeah we do the entire drive unit

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.800 
the car yeah we do the entire drive unit
in<00:02:00.310> fact<00:02:00.490> except<00:02:00.850> for<00:02:00.970> one<00:02:01.150> little<00:02:01.330> shipping

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
in fact except for one little shipping

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.220 
in fact except for one little shipping
cap<00:02:02.020> is<00:02:02.290> all<00:02:02.710> new<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.870> know<00:02:04.900> not<00:02:05.200> only

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
cap is all new and so you know not only

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.219 
cap is all new and so you know not only
the<00:02:05.830> power<00:02:06.100> flow<00:02:06.580> or<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:06.970> kinematics<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.990> that

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the power flow or the kinematics of that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.360 
the power flow or the kinematics of that
drive<00:02:08.590> unit<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.490> electric<00:02:10.119> motors<00:02:10.570> are

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
drive unit the electric motors are

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.310 
drive unit the electric motors are
completely<00:02:12.370> new<00:02:12.550> and<00:02:12.820> then<00:02:13.570> we<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.050> an

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
completely new and then we have an

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.050 
completely new and then we have an
arrangement<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.430> mechanical<00:02:15.970> arrangement

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
arrangement a mechanical arrangement

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.760 
arrangement a mechanical arrangement
that<00:02:16.600> lets<00:02:16.750> us<00:02:16.870> couple<00:02:17.260> those<00:02:17.410> motors

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
that lets us couple those motors

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.680 
that lets us couple those motors
together<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.730> drive<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.209> car<00:02:19.450> all

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
together to drive the car all

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.680 
together to drive the car all
electrically<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.670> really<00:02:21.730> allows<00:02:22.420> you

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
electrically and so it really allows you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.970 
electrically and so it really allows you
know<00:02:22.780> lighter<00:02:23.590> stronger<00:02:24.209> more<00:02:25.209> efficient

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
know lighter stronger more efficient

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.699 
know lighter stronger more efficient
faster<00:02:26.980> I'm<00:02:27.430> car<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.240> end<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.709> should

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
faster I'm car in the end I should

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.440 
faster I'm car in the end I should
mention<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.190> drive<00:02:30.520> unit<00:02:30.820> is<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:30.970> hundred

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
mention this drive unit is a hundred

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.750 
mention this drive unit is a hundred
pounds<00:02:31.630> lighter<00:02:32.260> than<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.430> replaces

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
pounds lighter than the one it replaces

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.880 
pounds lighter than the one it replaces
so<00:02:34.660> what's<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.050> total<00:02:35.230> weight<00:02:35.470> out<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.830> the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
so what's the total weight out of the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.130 
so what's the total weight out of the
car<00:02:36.130> compared<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.910> old<00:02:37.060> car<00:02:37.360> yeah<00:02:37.840> there's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
car compared to the old car yeah there's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.320 
car compared to the old car yeah there's
more<00:02:38.290> than<00:02:38.440> 270<00:02:39.280> pounds<00:02:39.640> out<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.970> car<00:02:40.150> so

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
more than 270 pounds out of the car so

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.840 
more than 270 pounds out of the car so
we've<00:02:40.450> gone<00:02:40.630> down<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.470> test<00:02:42.010> weight<00:02:42.250> class<00:02:42.489> and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
we've gone down a test weight class and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.060 
we've gone down a test weight class and
you<00:02:42.910> also<00:02:43.060> have<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.330> new<00:02:43.450> engine<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:44.050> regen<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:45.040> a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
you also have a new engine to regen be a

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.120 
you also have a new engine to regen be a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.660 
kill now you're the executive chief
engineer<00:03:02.200> but<00:03:02.350> tell<00:03:03.130> us<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.340> bit<00:03:03.459> about

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
engineer but tell us a little bit about

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.420 
engineer but tell us a little bit about
the<00:03:03.880> yeah<00:03:04.030> new<00:03:04.209> design<00:03:04.510> right<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:06.100> hotter

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
the yeah new design right so it's hotter

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.330 
the yeah new design right so it's hotter
than<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.940> last<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.019> absolutely<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.830> and

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
than the last one it absolutely is and

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.650 
than the last one it absolutely is and
so<00:03:09.519> when<00:03:09.700> you<00:03:09.790> stand<00:03:10.060> back<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.420> look<00:03:10.450> in

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
so when you stand back and you look in

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.740 
so when you stand back and you look in
the<00:03:10.750> car<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:10.959> can<00:03:11.290> see<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.769> it's<00:03:12.130> longer<00:03:13.120> its

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the car you can see that it's longer its

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.490 
the car you can see that it's longer its
lower<00:03:14.200> its<00:03:14.950> sleeker<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.970> more<00:03:16.060> sporty<00:03:16.840> you

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
lower its sleeker and more sporty you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.320 
lower its sleeker and more sporty you
know<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.739> really<00:03:17.950> went<00:03:18.340> after<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:19.090> things

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
know we really went after the things

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.620 
know we really went after the things
that<00:03:19.600> cause

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
that cause

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.810 
that cause
so<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.260> think<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.740> so<00:03:21.860> great<00:03:22.070> it's<00:03:22.700> a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
so I think it's just so great it's a

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.030 
so I think it's just so great it's a
fresh<00:03:23.180> car<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:23.900> still<00:03:24.200> didn't<00:03:24.560> give<00:03:24.740> up<00:03:24.890> a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
fresh car but still didn't give up a

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.310 
fresh car but still didn't give up a
little<00:03:25.160> bit<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.520> our<00:03:25.670> a<00:03:26.210> little<00:03:26.900> bit<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.170> our

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
little bit of our a little bit of our

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.170 
little bit of our a little bit of our
bulbs<00:03:27.740> well<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.160> guys<00:03:28.280> better<00:03:28.340> looking<00:03:28.940> car
