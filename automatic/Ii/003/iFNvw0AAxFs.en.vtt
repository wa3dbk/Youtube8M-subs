00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
I still wanted the I'd be the focus so I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.310 
I still wanted the I'd be the focus so I
didn't<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.680> too<00:01:52.979> much<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.840> just<00:01:54.840> did<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
didn't do too much I just did a lot of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.740 
didn't do too much I just did a lot of
hairspray<00:01:56.119> and<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.360> look<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.719> I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
hairspray and then you look like I

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.700 
hairspray and then you look like I
haven't<00:01:58.079> even<00:01:58.979> touched<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.610> hair<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.119> years
