00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 2008 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.559
 Keio University 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.959
 Faculty of Environmental Information 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.439
 Short essay 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.439
 Research subject at university and how to proceed 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 Explain 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.259
 Defended the task 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.380
 Compared with 2007 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.539
 Is there any change in examination time 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.949
 Answer book digest of 2007 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.120
 Against four 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.600
 In this year, it depends on the method of omission but with 10 or more places 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.910
 Has increased significantly 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 Because there are many good parts just to write the season words 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 There is no big change to understand that you have to hit it 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.050
 Division of treatment to treatment compared to 2007 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.070
 Last year 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.020
 Other than that, it is the face texture that focuses on what part of the feed 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.380
 I only have to give up 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.309
 This time 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.139
 One leaf 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.139
 I need to read all the materials 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.540
 Also due to the division of labor for treatment 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.250
 It can be said that there is no big change 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.010
 In the usual essay, it is the same as seven years 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.130
 Yamase for dispensing 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 It is comparable to write about 1,500 people 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.460
 It can be said that it is almost the same amount of work as the comprehensive policy department 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 Analysis of the question format 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.969
 This failure 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:34.210
 Examinee's 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.660
 What kind of ability required 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.680
 Think about what you're trying to strengthen 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.690
 The final request for this party proposal is 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.899
 Voluntary research project 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.830
 To launch 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.780
 Environmental Information Faculty 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.120
 It is a system that emphasizes 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.300
 What is required of you after admission 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.420
 It is essentially the same task 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.020
 Issues to be addressed after admission 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.790
 It is important to ask questions at the entrance exam stage 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.670
 7 years 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.430
 Moreover 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.430
 Often seen before that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.129
 In this year's private university 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.549
 Voluntary research project 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.039
 Subdivide the process of launching 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:20.009
 Appropriate judgment at each stage 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.009
 I'm asking if I can work 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:24.579
 Never before 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.239
 It is a tendency to win 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.559
 The difference with 7 years is the problem Mito 3 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:33.509
 Respondents at high school 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:36.939
 Must port a simple self-analysis 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.189
 Different types of analysis results 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.879
 I assumed friends 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.839
 What kind of collaboration should be with them 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.749
 Furthermore, is it a respondent among them? 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.069
 What are the rules you should buy and have a cart 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.209
 Research content 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.009
 Not only its social impact 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:59.059
 In the house 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.279
 When advancing research 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.409
 Organizational and interpersonal 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.409
 It is something that makes you think 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:08.440
 7th year 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.820
 We went as a point to touch the number of members in the snow question of sun 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.210
 This time 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.899
 More than that 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 Consideration is required 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.999
 Not only the Faculty of Environment and Information Studies 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.459
 Included the comprehensive policy department 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.379
 Keio sfc 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.909
 Problems of contemporary society 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.310
 Efforts to solve specifically 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.019
 Gazing 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.149
 Many factors are intricately intertwined 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:40.349
 To solve current social problems 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.800
 From multiple fields 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.849
 It will be necessary to approach 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.179
 For that purpose not only individual effort but also professional 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.919
 To 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.919
 Multiple people have to cooperate 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.569
 The ability to think about this problem 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.669
 The question side is trying to judge 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:03.819
 Faculty of Environmental Information 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.129
 More than the general policy department 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.839
 University research 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:09.859
 For the education policy 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.159
 It can be said that it is because it emphasizes the enemy 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.009
 To answer this 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.139
 With so-called exam study 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.139
 Different measures are needed 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.090
 This is a reading book 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.029
 How to listen to the preparatory school's winter season 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.789
 It is difficult to request 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.469
 It may sound paradoxical 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.430
 Yearly harvest of past questions 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.279
 It can be said that it is the most effective measure 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.279
 Because 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.479
 To be familiar with the skills required by the university 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.930
 To that ability 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.569
 Required work 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.569
 Because it is the best to actually try 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.199
 that time 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.729
 I want you to be careful 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.279
 It is to read the request of Yukimon correctly 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.080
 Before high school 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.009
 Unwanted work or 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.009
 Consideration is required 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.270
 Through exercises of past questions 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.529
 What is the subject song of the Environmental Information Faculty? 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.789
 Someone who does not practice reading 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.449
 What to do 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.460
 It will be grasped from now on 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.370
 If you can not understand from what is required here 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.999
 How do I use the materials 

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:25.080
 I have no idea 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.970
 Actually 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.749
 Attending students also 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.930
 When I first saw the past questions, I agreed 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930
 Many people have the impression that it is a blank sheet 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.729
 Through exercises of the past questions 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.729
 I want you to become a privately-owned university in the department of environmental information 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.460
 Moreover 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.249
 Questioner or what is intended 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.120
 What kind of student do you want to enter 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.380
 I want you to understand
