00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
your yarn and just wrap it around your

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.760 
your yarn and just wrap it around your
fork<00:00:29.359> approximately<00:00:30.359> fifty<00:00:30.900> times<00:00:33.649> once<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
fork approximately fifty times once you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.650 
fork approximately fifty times once you
have<00:00:35.070> your<00:00:35.219> 50<00:00:35.670> reps<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.180> want<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> go<00:00:36.540> ahead

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
have your 50 reps you want to go ahead

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.010 
have your 50 reps you want to go ahead
and<00:00:37.110> clip<00:00:37.440> your<00:00:37.710> yarn<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.790> then<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> want<00:00:39.899> to

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
and clip your yarn and then you want to

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.650 
and clip your yarn and then you want to
take<00:00:40.520> approximately<00:00:41.520> 12<00:00:41.850> inch<00:00:42.090> piece<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
take approximately 12 inch piece and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.279 
take approximately 12 inch piece and
thread<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:44.070> needle<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.989> that<00:00:45.989> just

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
thread it on to a needle and that just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.080 
thread it on to a needle and that just
makes<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.620> easier<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> poke<00:00:47.550> your<00:00:47.820> yarn

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
makes it easier to poke your yarn

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
makes it easier to poke your yarn
through<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> needle

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
through you don't have to have a needle

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
through you don't have to have a needle
but<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.850> does<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.329> easier<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.930> poke<00:00:52.230> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
but it does make it easier to poke it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
but it does make it easier to poke it
through<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.620> center<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
through the center here so that we can

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
through the center here so that we can
tie<00:00:54.510> around<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:56.070> center<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.579> those<00:00:57.239> wraps<00:00:57.920> and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
tie around the center of those wraps and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.709 
tie around the center of those wraps and
you<00:00:59.039> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.340> tie<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.000> tightly<00:01:00.480> as

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you want to tie that as tightly as

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.070 
you want to tie that as tightly as
possible<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.420> then<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.930> ahead

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
possible and then you want to go ahead

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.450 
possible and then you want to go ahead
and<00:01:04.290> slide<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.250> off<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.820> your<00:01:05.970> fork<00:01:07.460> your

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and slide that off of your fork your

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.539 
and slide that off of your fork your
next<00:01:08.880> step<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:10.320> trim<00:01:10.590> through<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> ends<00:01:11.430> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
next step is to trim through the ends of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.929 
next step is to trim through the ends of
all<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.180> loops<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:13.409> here<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.850> I'm

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
all of these loops right here so I'm

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
all of these loops right here so I'm
going<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.180> take<00:01:15.360> my<00:01:15.540> scissors<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:17.009> just

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
going to take my scissors and I'm just

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.640 
going to take my scissors and I'm just
going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> trim<00:01:17.729> through<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.439> loops

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
going to trim through all of the loops

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
going to trim through all of the loops
and<00:01:23.180> here<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.659> beginning<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> shape

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and here is the beginning of the shape

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.649 
and here is the beginning of the shape
of<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:25.890> pom-pom<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.299> you're<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.630> to
