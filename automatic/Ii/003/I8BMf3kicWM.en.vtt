Batcave MOC which is coming up very very

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.120 
Batcave MOC which is coming up very very
well<00:03:03.510> I'll<00:03:03.810> insert<00:03:04.200> some<00:03:04.440> pictures<00:03:04.800> around

which was a convention and I brought a

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.900 
which was a convention and I brought a
mini<00:03:29.030> Batcave<00:03:30.030> which<00:03:30.510> I'm<00:03:30.690> showing<00:03:31.050> right<00:03:31.200> now

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
mini Batcave which I'm showing right now

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.030 
mini Batcave which I'm showing right now
hopefully<00:03:32.910> if<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.210> get<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.600> up<00:03:33.810> there<00:03:34.040> so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
hopefully if I can get that up there so

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.530 
hopefully if I can get that up there so
it's<00:03:35.310> actually<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.880> was<00:03:36.120> actually<00:03:36.240> pretty

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
it's actually I was actually pretty

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.080

proud<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.020> built<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.590> like<00:03:38.550> three

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
proud of it I built that and like three

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.270 
proud of it I built that and like three
hours<00:03:39.480> maybe<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.590> installed<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.070> lights

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
hours maybe and I installed the lights

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.130 
hours maybe and I installed the lights
while<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.550> was<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.360> kind<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.600> expanded

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
while I was there and I kind of expanded

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.770 
while I was there and I kind of expanded
upon<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.860> plan<00:03:44.700> to<00:03:44.970> bring<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.480> other

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
upon that and plan to bring it to other

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.330 
upon that and plan to bring it to other
conventions<00:03:46.350> like<00:03:46.470> brick<00:03:46.680> roll<00:03:46.860> Chicago

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
conventions like brick roll Chicago

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.970 
conventions like brick roll Chicago
hopefully<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.050> more<00:03:49.050> brick<00:03:49.230> fairs<00:03:49.500> down<00:03:49.800> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
hopefully and more brick fairs down the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.710 
hopefully and more brick fairs down the
road<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:50.820> if<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.030> guys<00:03:51.120> would<00:03:51.270> like<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.570> see
