00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello so many urban girls after 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.760
 have seen my relationship history 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.490
 I'm going to teach you how to look for indicators 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.740
 in your letter so they understand that they should 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.390
 learn with your relationships because 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.490
 we attract what we are that is the 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.740
 principle of venus through what 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.320
 you are not what you will be that we are going to look for 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.449
 of course unless and the interactions 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 they have in your natal chart we are going to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.859
 puntocom do you introduce your data 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.270
 click to show your letter and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.510
 is going to come out to this circle this is a 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.059
 model which is fast - looks like a mirror 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.220
 It is a circle and it has a handle 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 the symbol of women everywhere 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.480
 it's extremely easy to get here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 we have venus in diego and what are 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.070
 the configurations alignments more 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 easy to see that is in conjunction with 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.530
 Mars are less than 10 degrees one from 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 another notes on a separate paper venus 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.100
 with mars function 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 virgo we also know that less is in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 Quadrature with Neptune because already here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.160
 Neptune at 90 degrees good 87 degrees 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.910
 almost perfect as we identify the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.129
 alignments 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.570
 the important thing is that you know the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.330
 mathematical degree 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 - It's the first indicator we see here 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 in the 24th grade I'm going to look at 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.410
 the table below 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.290
 which planets are from degree 20 to 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.630
 grade 29 because we're going to have a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.570
 Orb with a 10-degree separation 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 difference in this letter the moon is in 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.360
 grade 22 I write it down in a separate paper 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.550
 venus is on the 24th Tuesday in the 21st and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.140
 we speak that they are in conjunction 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.509
 night is in the 27th and we talk about that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.820
 is in square pluto is in 29 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.920
 then I need to identify what 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.640
 type of alignment has with pluton and 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.250
 with the moon 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.619
 I return to the letter from Venus in the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.350
 24 degree glass to the moon in the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.619
 22nd grade of pounds there is a semi sexting 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 from belgrade 24 glass to pluto in 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.390
 the 29 pound grade there is a semi sexting 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340
 you must know the alignments in a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.039
 basic audio of astrology that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.039
 find my astral now on soundcloud 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.740
 well the semi sex tiles are strong the 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.350
 nothing to see strong is the conjunction that 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.360
 has venus with mars and the square 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.940
 that has connect 1 is extremely 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.550
 because the square is internal tension 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.080
 that requires external action let's see 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.690
 an example the letter of this person 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.080
 have a venus square with night 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.720
 means that it tends to over idealize 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.140
 the relationships to the people to whom 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.760
 admires tends to see in that other all 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.320
 the wonder of things that already believe or 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.450
 have especially when we see is in 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.700
 video that Virgo has grieved because 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.890
 virgo is all the detail let's look 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.740
 the defect in anything and speed wants 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.900
 feel beautiful then you will notice that 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.300
 if they take out their boyfriend's astral chart 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.580
 her dad from her best friend of her partner 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.770
 they will find indicators that are 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.780
 mirrors that they have in their letter 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.090
 natal as they saw it in mine that my 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.700
 lesson to learn was to integrate 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.680
 Saturn and already bringing people for a 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.140
 side by another to understand what it was 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.850
 maturity order learn to open my 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.910
 hips learn to allow because I 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.920
 saturated natal being in scorpio like this two 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.500
 weeks to have a client who had to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.300
 less in conjunction with Pluto and her boyfriend 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.820
 it was someone ascending scorpio with 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.140
 pluto in the ascendant right there is 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.000
 easy to notice 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.650
 what she has close to goes up is not what 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.780
 same thing that is bringing in that person 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.160
 which is going to get married is not so much 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.140
 so you can identify who you are going with 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.970
 marry whom not or who is your 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.610
 zombie and who does not what we want 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.620
 identify is what is the planet that is 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.350
 you have to integrate and as you are not 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.660
 integrated continues to attract people in 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.480
 which that planet is very strong 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.430
 because they want to show you how 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.500
 it works how you can apply it in your 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.510
 life all the people that I worked 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.000
 that they had strong Saturn of some 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.860
 way they made me understand that I had to 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.810
 work with this planet and how could 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.180
 integrate it clear that learning 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.489
 never ends in growth 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.080
 staff there are no days off but once 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.910
 that we are aware we can not be 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.400
 indifferent and at least we have a 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.170
 first and last name on that planet that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.150
 we have to integrate once what 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.130
 you know you can look for proactive ways 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.470
 to work it for example on this girl 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.880
 in this model that you see in this empower 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.370
 with neptune she will tend to 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.530
 attract people neptunia nash or if she 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.109
 is the person dispersed neptunia goes to 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.580
 attract people venus type in video that 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.180
 They are beautiful who like beauty 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.060
 who like like symmetry 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.729
 until she learns to organize and 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.979
 sits through the organization 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.229
 important valuable and strengthen your 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.180
 self-esteem that happens once you already 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.039
 identify instead of waiting for it to come 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.710
 a best friend to put her in order 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.600
 can proactively try to start 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.729
 certain activities in your life like 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.560
 man and minder as an agenda a 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.449
 reminder on the cell phone every so often 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.030
 time to do your homework that makes it 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.610
 feel that your life is changing because 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.650
 so we feel more comfortable and with more 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.720
 certainty that we are working on 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.539
 we ourselves always do that 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.720
 feel much better that they have excellent 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.720
 day
