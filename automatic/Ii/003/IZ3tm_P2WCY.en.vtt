00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
the squat rack we're going to use a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.580 
the squat rack we're going to use a
barbell<00:00:29.150> had<00:00:29.390> also<00:00:29.630> done<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:29.900> exercise<00:00:30.140> that

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590 
barbell had also done this exercise that

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.650 
barbell had also done this exercise that
melts<00:00:30.950> very<00:00:31.039> effective<00:00:31.580> to<00:00:32.330> that<00:00:32.480> miles

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
melts very effective to that miles

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.330 
melts very effective to that miles
actually<00:00:33.080> what<00:00:33.739> you're<00:00:33.860> going<00:00:34.010> to<00:00:34.070> do<00:00:34.190> is

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
actually what you're going to do is

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.640 
actually what you're going to do is
basically<00:00:34.550> pulled<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.120> bottom<00:00:35.480> position<00:00:36.020> of

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
basically pulled that bottom position of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.950 
basically pulled that bottom position of
the<00:00:36.830> deadlift<00:00:37.220> with<00:00:38.000> a<00:00:38.150> barrage<00:00:38.330> stomach<00:00:38.840> and

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
the deadlift with a barrage stomach and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.630 
the deadlift with a barrage stomach and
you<00:00:39.020> get<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.170> brace<00:00:39.410> against<00:00:39.949> that<00:00:40.160> bar<00:00:40.370> because

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
you get a brace against that bar because

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.610 
you get a brace against that bar because
the<00:00:40.790> weighted<00:00:41.330> bar<00:00:41.480> here<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:42.260> pulling<00:00:42.560> you

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
the weighted bar here is pulling you

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.340 
the weighted bar here is pulling you
down<00:00:42.770> this<00:00:43.070> is<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.220> perfect<00:00:43.790> spot<00:00:43.850> to<00:00:44.780> trade<00:00:45.260> the

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
down this is a perfect spot to trade the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.960 
down this is a perfect spot to trade the
weakest<00:00:45.680> point<00:00:45.920> deadlift<00:00:46.460> which<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:46.700> usually

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
weakest point deadlift which is usually

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.580 
weakest point deadlift which is usually
the<00:00:47.090> court<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.809> get<00:00:47.899> into<00:00:48.079> heavier<00:00:48.350> weights

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
the court and get into heavier weights

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.920 
the court and get into heavier weights
intends<00:00:49.010> to<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.220> full<00:00:49.610> board<00:00:49.940> which<00:00:50.660> is<00:00:50.809> what

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
intends to a full board which is what

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.180

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.020 
doing this exercise you trade in that
exact<00:00:57.320> spot<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:58.040> strengthen<00:00:58.610> that<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:58.910> that

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
doing this with a barbell it's a very

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:19.270 
doing this with a barbell it's a very
exercise<00:01:53.479> specific

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.860 

that's<00:02:20.280> what<00:02:20.430> you're<00:02:20.489> doing<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.690> want

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
that's what you're doing this you want

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.300 
that's what you're doing this you want
to<00:02:21.930> almost<00:02:22.319> trying<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> pick<00:02:22.799> your<00:02:22.920> feet<00:02:23.069> above

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
to almost trying to pick your feet above

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.350 
to almost trying to pick your feet above
the<00:02:23.370> floor<00:02:23.489> which<00:02:24.030> we<00:02:24.150> were<00:02:24.209> actually

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the floor which we were actually

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.360 
the floor which we were actually
enforced<00:02:24.870> more<00:02:25.049> attention<00:02:25.409> under<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.220> ABS

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
enforced more attention under the ABS

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.699 
enforced more attention under the ABS
because<00:02:27.030> once<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.420> try<00:02:27.629> to<00:02:27.690> take<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.530> tension

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
because once you try to take the tension

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.339 
because once you try to take the tension
off<00:02:28.950> your<00:02:29.129> legs<00:02:29.280> put<00:02:30.239> more<00:02:30.450> drift<00:02:31.019> managed

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
off your legs put more drift managed

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.170 
off your legs put more drift managed
owner<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.890> that's<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.670> reason<00:02:32.700> being<00:02:32.970> there

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
owner so that's the reason being there

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.729 
owner so that's the reason being there
you<00:02:33.750> never<00:02:33.930> get<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.140> lift<00:02:34.319> your<00:02:34.440> feet<00:02:34.530> off<00:02:34.709> the

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
you never get a lift your feet off the

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.009 
you never get a lift your feet off the
ground<00:02:34.890> obviously<00:02:35.459> but<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.120> imagining<00:02:36.959> is

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
ground obviously but just imagining is

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.509 
ground obviously but just imagining is
that<00:02:37.140> you're<00:02:37.260> releasing<00:02:37.470> attention<00:02:37.950> it's

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
that you're releasing attention it's

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.970 
that you're releasing attention it's
very<00:02:38.640> effective<00:02:39.030> way<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.150> go<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.690> can<00:02:39.810> also

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
very effective way to go you can also

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.880 
very effective way to go you can also
shift<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.540> borrow<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.870> sits<00:02:43.379> on<00:02:43.470> your<00:02:43.560> stomach

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
shift the borrow it sits on your stomach

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.210 
shift the borrow it sits on your stomach
by<00:02:44.670> shifting<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.030> upper<00:02:45.239> body<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.510> little<00:02:45.629> bit

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
by shifting the upper body a little bit

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.789 
by shifting the upper body a little bit
like<00:02:47.220> up<00:02:47.730> here<00:02:47.970> forward<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.560> middle

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
like up here forward in the middle

00:02:49.799 --> 00:03:03.050 
like up here forward in the middle
however<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:51.030> find<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.360> works<00:02:51.510> best<00:02:51.599> for<00:02:51.959> you

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.150 

well<00:03:04.060> you're<00:03:04.510> doing<00:03:04.599> this<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:05.140> brace<00:03:05.709> probably

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
well you're doing this to brace probably

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.350 
well you're doing this to brace probably
you<00:03:06.220> want<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.459> hold<00:03:06.670> your<00:03:06.790> breath<00:03:06.910> and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
you want to hold your breath and

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.530 
you want to hold your breath and
basically<00:03:08.170> solidify<00:03:09.160> your<00:03:09.280> stomach<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.450> know

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
basically solidify your stomach you know

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.180 
basically solidify your stomach you know
like<00:03:10.810> trying<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.140> push<00:03:11.349> out<00:03:11.500> against<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:11.920> F<00:03:12.040> or

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
like trying to push out against the F or

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.949 
like trying to push out against the F or
anything<00:03:12.430> like<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:12.580> this<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.569> trying<00:03:13.900> to

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
anything like that this is trying to

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.440 
anything like that this is trying to
format<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.590> very<00:03:15.250> solid<00:03:15.670> block<00:03:16.060> with<00:03:16.420> your

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
format a very solid block with your

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.360 
format a very solid block with your
entire<00:03:16.810> core<00:03:17.050> that's<00:03:17.830> sort<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.069> finding<00:03:18.340> a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
entire core that's sort of finding a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.720 
entire core that's sort of finding a
diagram<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:20.010> not<00:03:21.010> really<00:03:21.310> in<00:03:21.370> trouble<00:03:21.459> you

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
diagram and not really in trouble you

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.850 
diagram and not really in trouble you
exhale<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> little<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:23.380> find<00:03:23.560> their<00:03:23.709> blood

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
exhale a little bit to find their blood

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.890 
exhale a little bit to find their blood
pressure<00:03:23.890> from<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.400> do<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.900> that's

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
pressure from that do I that's

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.840 
pressure from that do I that's
essentially<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.410> exercise<00:03:26.769> we're<00:03:27.640> going<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
essentially the exercise we're going to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.280 
essentially the exercise we're going to
train<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.060> bottom<00:03:28.540> weak<00:03:29.410> point<00:03:29.709> in<00:03:30.069> the
