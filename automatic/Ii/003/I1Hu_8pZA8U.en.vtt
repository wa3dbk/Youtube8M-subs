00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.759
 winning this award means 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.759
 be scary 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.600
 long 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.449
 Of course I would have been very satisfied because of it 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.449
 to get 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.090
 out 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.900
 At best , I still believe that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900
 media 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.940
 fill the carriage back 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.940
 to you 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.220
 the beautiful something as a prize winner on the 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.220
 media art of europe important 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:19.939
 you always think film peer steinbr端ck 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.899
 was bad but that is not so 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.909
 of course now had out of the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.340
 retired from political daily business 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.369
 but the broadcast with peer steinbr端ck in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.600
 the main role was nominated for the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.219
 medicoos absolutely like soy the gypsum quasi 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.020
 So I can not believe that 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.390
 that's why it came after that again 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.899
 is really pinching times and it is the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.200
 no dream 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.200
 to ask the media policy tips 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.049
 that still rewards the traffic 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.459
 so we say if we were the 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.159
 to win the media cabbage of the year 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.439
 have shared with peer steinbr端ck 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.239
 anyway a third of us think that up 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.069
 We then spend a week of vacation 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.270
 week is with us always look like times 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:03.200
 maybe we could fix that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.159
 pick up for us 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.299
 we do not have that much time now 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.450
 true and who has the currently so 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.720
 we have to go with the spd board 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.950
 Exploitation if the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.450
 coalition bargaining to an end are 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.709
 also returned a bit quiet one 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.180
 and then we'll see if it's peer 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.319
 Steinbr端ck can sometimes lose sight 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.600
 in the background still as 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.769
 act as a consultant 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.700
 Are you glad you can 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.310
 also just three media 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.430
 Cooler manufacturers always get the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.430
 Always prizes only a 3 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.660
 i think that get my violence yes 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.590
 also rightly 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.639
 I thought that too I have to get some 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.930
 songs from other present ultimately 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.760
 well deserves then i can live with it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.319
 then if he is like that then I want too 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.950
 not get any if the manager 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.840
 went 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.880
 good but a little bit very important 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:02.710
 set on it 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:05.050
 somewhere there as one could go deep somewhere 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.370
 but look deep into the eyes 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.420
 eyes and then the viewers may even 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.510
 vote if winter separates the 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.980
 Coal price harms bobo track so that 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.180
 his research is 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.180
 that knew
