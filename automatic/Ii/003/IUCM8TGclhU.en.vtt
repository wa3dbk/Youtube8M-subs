00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
from Lebanon so a lot of her signature

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.229 
from Lebanon so a lot of her signature
recipes<00:00:18.950> are<00:00:19.279> from<00:00:19.700> the<00:00:19.880> Middle<00:00:20.119> East

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:20.239

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
although I used the term recipes very

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.210 
although I used the term recipes very
loosely<00:00:23.210> because<00:00:23.480> her<00:00:23.930> idea<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.590> recipe<00:00:24.950> is

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
loosely because her idea of a recipe is

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.010 
loosely because her idea of a recipe is
oh<00:00:25.489> oh<00:00:25.640> just<00:00:25.910> put<00:00:26.090> in<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.239> little<00:00:26.599> bit<00:00:26.779> of<00:00:26.809> this

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.960 
oh oh just put in a little bit of this
and<00:00:27.320> a<00:00:27.439> lot<00:00:27.649> of<00:00:27.860> that<00:00:28.040> and<00:00:28.340> not<00:00:28.550> too<00:00:28.759> much<00:00:28.910> of

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
and a lot of that and not too much of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.069 
and a lot of that and not too much of
this<00:00:29.360> so<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.649> actually<00:00:31.220> put<00:00:31.520> her<00:00:32.000> terms<00:00:32.450> into

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
this so I actually put her terms into

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.950 
this so I actually put her terms into
more<00:00:33.290> Universal<00:00:34.160> standard<00:00:34.700> terms<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:35.780> that<00:00:35.809> I

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
yolks our first step is to preheat the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800 
yolks our first step is to preheat the
oven<00:01:09.620> according<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.820> directions<00:01:11.360> on<00:01:11.600> your

oven according to the directions on your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.910 
oven according to the directions on your
biscuit<00:01:12.229> dough<00:01:12.440> mine<00:01:13.280> says<00:01:13.720> 450<00:01:14.720> degrees<00:01:15.050> so

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
biscuit dough mine says 450 degrees so

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.580 
biscuit dough mine says 450 degrees so
I'm<00:01:16.280> going<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.610> preheat<00:01:17.620> up<00:01:18.620> to<00:01:19.450> 450<00:01:21.850> and<00:01:23.590> then

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
I'm going to preheat up to 450 and then

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.789 
I'm going to preheat up to 450 and then
the<00:01:24.740> next<00:01:25.070> step<00:01:25.250> is<00:01:25.549> to<00:01:26.240> heat<00:01:26.690> our<00:01:26.960> olive<00:01:27.620> oil

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
the next step is to heat our olive oil

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:42.420 
the next step is to heat our olive oil
over<00:01:28.220> medium-high<00:01:28.700> heat<00:01:28.940> in<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:30.020> saute<00:01:30.440> pan

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.950 

because<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.610> sizzles<00:01:44.120> when<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.570> put<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.750> little

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
because it sizzles when we put a little

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.770 
because it sizzles when we put a little
bit<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.230> water<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.730> so<00:01:46.730> we<00:01:47.150> can<00:01:47.330> add<00:01:47.540> the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
bit of water on it so we can add the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:57.840 
bit of water on it so we can add the
onions<00:01:48.290> to<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.130> pan<00:01:55.840> starting<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.990> cook<00:01:57.170> and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140 
we're going to need to cook them until
they're<00:02:00.440> translucent<00:02:00.760> which<00:02:01.760> will<00:02:01.940> take

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
they're translucent which will take

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.630 
they're translucent which will take
about<00:02:02.300> five<00:02:02.750> minutes<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.950> now<00:02:04.130> we're<00:02:04.340> going<00:02:04.520> to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
fingers to give more surface area take a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.970 
fingers to give more surface area take a
small<00:03:24.700> spoonful<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.900> meat<00:03:26.080> mixture<00:03:26.290> that
