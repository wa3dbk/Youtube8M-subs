00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.429 
other cars and kind of come up with our
own<00:01:25.890> design<00:01:26.040> which<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.049> resembles<00:01:28.049> another

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
own design which is resembles another

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
own design which is resembles another
chassis<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.210> lot<00:01:30.420> of

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
chassis but really there's a lot of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
chassis but really there's a lot of
differences<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> them<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.740> soon<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
differences to them as soon as you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.740 
differences to them as soon as you
change<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.460> couple<00:01:32.610> bars<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.150> these<00:01:33.270> cars<00:01:33.570> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
change a couple bars in these cars it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.149 
change a couple bars in these cars it
becomes<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.170> whole<00:01:34.290> different<00:01:34.619> animal<00:01:34.680> doesn't

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
becomes a whole different animal doesn't

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.460 
becomes a whole different animal doesn't
it<00:01:35.310> yeah<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> cars<00:01:36.000> any<00:01:36.360> any<00:01:36.810> car<00:01:37.110> they're

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
also equal here it's a matter of almost

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.020
