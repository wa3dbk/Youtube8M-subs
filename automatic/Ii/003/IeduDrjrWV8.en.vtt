tapestry needle scissors and cotton or

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.689 
tapestry needle scissors and cotton or
linen<00:00:18.240> yarn<00:00:18.750> which<00:00:19.109> both<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.890> natural

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
linen yarn which both have a natural

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.250 
linen yarn which both have a natural
absorbent<00:00:21.510> property<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> first<00:00:24.810> you'll<00:00:24.990> cast

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
absorbent property so first you'll cast

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.970 
absorbent property so first you'll cast
on<00:00:25.560> 40<00:00:26.039> stitches<00:00:27.019> when<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.050> did<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> project<00:00:28.859> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
on 40 stitches when I did the project I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.910 
on 40 stitches when I did the project I
decided<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:30.000> test<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.539> 20<00:00:30.840> stitches<00:00:31.080> but

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
decided to test on 20 stitches but

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.470 
decided to test on 20 stitches but
afterwards<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.430> regretted<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:32.940> because<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.390> was

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
afterwards I regretted it because it was

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.510 
afterwards I regretted it because it was
too<00:00:33.660> small<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.320> that's<00:00:34.829> why<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.070> recommend<00:00:35.160> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
too small so that's why we recommend you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520 
too small so that's why we recommend you
guys<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.700> cast<00:00:36.210> on<00:00:36.390> 40<00:00:36.809> stitches<00:00:37.050> but

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
guys to cast on 40 stitches but

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500 
guys to cast on 40 stitches but
whichever<00:00:38.070> number<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.489> decide<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.059> cast<00:00:39.270> on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
whichever number you decide to cast on

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.410 
whichever number you decide to cast on
it<00:00:40.020> has<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.500> an<00:00:40.649> even<00:00:40.950> number<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:42.270> this

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it has to be an even number so for this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.930 
it has to be an even number so for this
project<00:00:42.690> we'll<00:00:43.320> use<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.890> rib<00:00:44.100> stitch<00:00:44.430> pattern

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
project we'll use the rib stitch pattern

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:54.930 
project we'll use the rib stitch pattern
which<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.750> knit<00:00:45.930> 1<00:00:46.230> purl<00:00:46.440> 1<00:00:47.629> pattern

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.790 

so<00:00:55.940> we'll<00:00:56.150> continue<00:00:56.570> with<00:00:57.080> the<00:00:57.260> white<00:00:57.470> yarn

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
so we'll continue with the white yarn

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:07.020 
so we'll continue with the white yarn
for<00:00:58.160> Feroze<00:00:58.580> using<00:00:59.180> the<00:00:59.510> rib<00:00:59.870> stitch<00:01:00.170> pattern

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.460 

after<00:01:08.030> knitting<00:01:08.180> four<00:01:08.600> rows<00:01:08.840> with<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.290> white

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
after knitting four rows with the white

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.340 
after knitting four rows with the white
yarn<00:01:09.710> you'll<00:01:10.040> cut<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.520> yarn<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:10.970> use<00:01:11.390> your

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
yarn you'll cut the yarn and use your

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.980 
yarn you'll cut the yarn and use your
blue<00:01:12.710> yarn<00:01:13.150> you'll<00:01:14.150> use<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.510> same<00:01:14.750> pattern

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
blue yarn you'll use the same pattern

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.010 
blue yarn you'll use the same pattern
which<00:01:15.380> is<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.710> rib<00:01:15.860> stitch<00:01:16.100> pattern<00:01:16.550> for<00:01:17.150> four

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
which is the rib stitch pattern for four

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:33.710 
which is the rib stitch pattern for four
rows

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.149 

don't<00:01:34.720> worry<00:01:34.869> about<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.320> ends<00:01:35.650> we'll<00:01:35.979> weave

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
don't worry about the ends we'll weave

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:54.149 
don't worry about the ends we'll weave
them<00:01:36.400> in<00:01:36.520> at<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.760> end<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.180> this<00:01:37.330> video

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
we'll knit two rows so continue

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.440 
we'll knit two rows so continue
interchanging<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.600> colors<00:02:05.990> four<00:02:06.560> more<00:02:06.710> times

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
with the white yarn will knit two rows

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.509 
with the white yarn will knit two rows
and<00:02:11.239> with<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.170> blue<00:02:12.349> yarn<00:02:12.620> will<00:02:13.040> knit<00:02:13.250> four
