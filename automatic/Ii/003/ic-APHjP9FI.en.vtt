00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.330
 often even trite and being in 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.879
 sitting position also leads to overload 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.740
 I often complain about a long trip to 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.780
 the car 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.280
 long train ride when 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.030
 here are these straight backs in this person 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.170
 sits and can not get up for this 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:23.310
 trite there is a fixture 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.090
 take a pillow why happens 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.490
 Overload I already showed a snapshot 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.350
 see our spine 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:37.609
 side view indirect as scrap a has 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.539
 physiological bends bend forward 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:44.460
 lumbar deflection called ordos here it is 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:47.940
 bend back of the thoracic region 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.429
 called kyphosis and again will sort into 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 area 5 of the cervical-chest transition 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:56.539
 no wonder our spine 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.170
 so wavy to 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:03.229
 do inject the spine as a whole 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.979
 like 7 and structure 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.950
 maximum effective depreciation 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.800
 properties 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 the spine should have a wavelike 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.860
 the structure is exactly the wave structure 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.210
 is a factor that even more 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.660
 contributes to vertical depreciation 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.000
 loads 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.010
 even many people especially 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.540
 deals with sports like 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.210
 gymnastics gymnastics 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 ballet from childhood form from childhood 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.880
 wrong posture and their back 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.770
 absolutely straight 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.220
 so here have a straight back this is very 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.990
 bad intervertebral discs while 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 experience a very powerful load even 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.850
 just standing and here 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.680
 undulating 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.800
 structure undulating structure 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.960
 spine standing position is not 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.850
 only most effectively compensates 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.250
 that is, it is like a spring to act until 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.830
 she is of some degree ska spring therefore 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.160
 lordosis we always have and when we 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:09.350
 sit with a stiff back 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:13.230
 Here I sit, and I often between 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:17.489
 back support and lower back is obtained 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.720
 bending it in long-term this is not 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.130
 seat comfort 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:26.910
 muscles too become overloaded 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:31.250
 hard tired trite to take 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:34.709
 a small pad just like that or another 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.670
 to choose for themselves here and fill this 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:42.720
 ordos this trough something like right there these 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.400
 muscles are unloaded absolutely and very 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680
 Often here people who often go on 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.890
 electric train and who started this 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.310
 use impact pad 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.970
 for them three or four hours is no longer 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.930
 hard labor pleasure because muscles 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.180
 not overloaded not overworked by the way 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.049
 this is true not only for travel this 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.480
 true if we say your chair your 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.940
 chair is the place where you sit enough 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.220
 long not comfortable and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.579
 pad filled and yourself perfectly 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.579
 feel
