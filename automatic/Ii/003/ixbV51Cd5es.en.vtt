00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.469
 Good day friends in touch 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.500
 Jaroslav Bryn 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.910
 Now we will understand the French press 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.150
 dumbbell story and so exercise 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.090
 aimed at developing our with you 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.740
 triceps namely on his criminal case 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.260
 each muscle group has its own 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.930
 problem for example biceps exercises 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.449
 I tell almost everything 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.420
 rise to the whole and stimulates the inner 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.980
 head and not fully load the external 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.230
 block so you have to cheat and 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.929
 add exercises for example press 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.089
 dumbbell sitting at a 45 degree angle for 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.519
 order to run the lower head either 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.949
 divert your elbows lost another 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:52.370
 the problem is all the triceps exercises 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:56.530
 and the three most in my opinion the best 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.350
 exercise is bench press narrow grip 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.449
 lifting bars with triceps emphasis 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.440
 and isolate the exercise French press 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.799
 they all 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:14.110
 load external middle head 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.539
 i.e. 30 we have three bundles 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.740
 outer inner and middle and here's 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.840
 long head 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.460
 she is about all the exercises very bad 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.170
 involved and usually lags behind and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.890
 this muscle group can be used 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.450
 only 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.880
 in several ways and the most 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.580
 optimal most common is 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.160
 if we raise the elbow above the head if 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.660
 we can lifted above the head fix 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.570
 shoulder joint moving occurs in 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.900
 asset joint and then we have to work 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.730
 the long triceps head comes on 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.310
 Well naturally accented 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.350
 will feel the work of one or another pads 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 you cant that is 30 will develop 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.800
 all three beams at once 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:07.760
 only able to shift the focus and so 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:13.190
 highlights how you can perform press 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.190
 french history can be done with 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.610
 vulture can be straightened to perform with 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.980
 straight bar 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.490
 can be bent and secret that is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.570
 straightened elbows fixed elbows 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.210
 parallel to each other 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:34.800
 shoulders do not move and performed 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:37.200
 can be performed straight bar with dumbbells 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.700
 take a dumbbell with two hands for 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.610
 head 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.020
 also setting bast performs 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.040
 can perform 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:50.850
 one hand as he is more comfortable 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.400
 try all these methods and select 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.459
 for yourself the one where you feel 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.980
 two points first is stretching 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.050
 triceps in the ultimate soil so your 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.420
 triceps stretched well to straight 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.330
 I feel like he stretches and the second is 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.510
 shrinking your triceps top point 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.430
 here are the two points in which exercise 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
 you feel better stretching and 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.080
 reduction here are the top exercises 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.239
 use for me these two 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.090
 exercise is either a bench press with dumbbells 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.160
 two hands or one by one 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.230
 dumbbells 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.890
 we will understand the French bench press 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.989
 dumbbells from the head starting position 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.130
 raise arm shoulder does not move 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.019
 shoulder fixed 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:41.190
 elbow joint is also fixed and 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.750
 contraction movements occur only in 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.720
 tray 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.459
 what can be done can be held 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.769
 yourself here in the area 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:54.090
 for not moving badly from 1 ha 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.980
 you touch this long head 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.700
 triceps and feel like she 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.190
 tenses up 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.160
 itself can keep itself 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.690
 fix your elbow here's that background and 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.790
 don't move to work only 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:11.040
 triceps down the trajectory 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.590
 it is necessary to lower so that is dumbbells why 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.570
 one more convenient you can customize 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.890
 lowering the dumbbell so that 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.230
 feel the maximum stretch 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.230
 your 30 that is, you can away 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:25.560
 try to get closer here here then 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.840
 eat try as you like this 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.450
 eat down should maximize stretch 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.870
 your and muscle groups when we lift 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:36.150
 up we go beyond amplitude ie we 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.000
 insert our elbow and additionally 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.890
 we transfer the load to our triceps so that 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.720
 its extra strain at this point 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:48.120
 we try and on static jump 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.950
 our triceps additionally give him 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:56.010
 tension and then drove down 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:59.640
 we stretch it we stretch it 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.550
 such movement we raise the exhale lower 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.100
 inhale your back keeping straight curled 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.070
 can not help collect in the fireplace to take 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.230
 i.e. everything is fixed moving 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.560
 only the elbow and here itself 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.220
 exercise french dumbbell bench 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.220
 with one hand 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.660
 This exercise dismantled go to 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.660
 the next
