minutes at the oil into the mixing bowl
and<00:01:36.770> keep<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.670> kneading<00:01:38.030> up<00:01:38.390> another<00:01:38.810> ten

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
and keep on kneading up another ten

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.160 
and keep on kneading up another ten
minutes<00:01:39.790> when<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:40.970> dough<00:01:41.150> is<00:01:41.180> ready<00:01:41.540> put<00:01:41.960> that

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
minutes when the dough is ready put that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.080 
minutes when the dough is ready put that
in<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.470> greased<00:01:42.680> bowl<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:43.460> leave<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.790> in<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.060> warm

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
in a greased bowl and leave it in a warm

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.370 
in a greased bowl and leave it in a warm
place<00:01:44.450> until<00:01:45.250> doubled<00:01:46.250> in<00:01:46.399> size<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.170> dough

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
place until doubled in size so the dough

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.030 
place until doubled in size so the dough
is<00:01:48.590> double<00:01:48.979> in<00:01:49.100> size<00:01:49.600> add<00:01:50.600> some<00:01:51.409> flour<00:01:51.680> onto

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
is double in size add some flour onto

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.700 
is double in size add some flour onto
the<00:01:52.250> bench<00:01:52.490> top<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.240> put<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.810> dough<00:01:54.020> onto<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
the bench top and put the dough onto the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.180 
the bench top and put the dough onto the
bench<00:01:55.040> top<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.610> then<00:01:56.570> put<00:01:57.259> more<00:01:57.560> flour<00:01:57.770> onto

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
bench top and then put more flour onto

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.270 
bench top and then put more flour onto
the<00:01:58.429> bench<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.000> this<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.050> tricky<00:02:00.440> part<00:02:00.470> so

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the bench and this is the tricky part so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.380 
the bench and this is the tricky part so
when<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:02.679> divide<00:02:03.679> the<00:02:03.950> door<00:02:04.390> equally

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
when you do this divide the door equally

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.470 
when you do this divide the door equally
into<00:02:05.840> two<00:02:05.869> halves<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.209> then<00:02:09.459> divide<00:02:10.459> one<00:02:11.000> half

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
into two halves and then divide one half

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.729 
into two halves and then divide one half
again<00:02:12.140> into<00:02:12.620> two<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:14.239> after<00:02:14.780> dividing<00:02:15.319> the

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
again into two so after dividing the

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.910 
again into two so after dividing the
dough<00:02:15.950> into<00:02:16.190> three<00:02:17.000> equal<00:02:17.300> three<00:02:18.200> parts<00:02:18.680> and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
dough into three equal three parts and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.080 
dough into three equal three parts and
two<00:02:19.580> equal<00:02:20.060> parts<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.750> one<00:02:21.050> half<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.040> for<00:02:22.940> the

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
two equal parts with one half so for the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.120 
two equal parts with one half so for the
half<00:02:23.569> add<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.709> red<00:02:24.980> food<00:02:25.010> coloring<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.120> two

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
half add the red food coloring and two

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.819 
half add the red food coloring and two
1/4<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.420> green<00:02:29.720> food<00:02:30.079> coloring<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
1/4 and the green food coloring and

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.060 
1/4 and the green food coloring and
leave<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.549> one<00:02:32.239> without<00:02:32.570> any<00:02:33.079> coloring<00:02:33.769> so

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
leave the one without any coloring so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.759 
leave the one without any coloring so
I'm<00:02:34.549> going<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.000> leave<00:02:35.150> one<00:02:35.480> aside<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.290> going

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
I'm going to leave one aside and going

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.490 
I'm going to leave one aside and going
to<00:02:36.890> put<00:02:37.040> green<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.269> little<00:02:38.660> ones<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
to put green for the little ones and the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.710 
to put green for the little ones and the
red<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.100> other<00:02:40.220> one<00:02:40.519> were<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.209> knead<00:02:41.480> this

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
red for the other one were to knead this

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.970 
red for the other one were to knead this
again<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:43.459> do<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.820> rest<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.420> recipe<00:02:44.980> put

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
again to do the rest of the recipe put

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
again to do the rest of the recipe put
some<00:02:46.310> more<00:02:46.640> flour<00:02:46.970> onto<00:02:47.390> the<00:02:47.510> bench<00:02:47.750> top<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
some more flour onto the bench top and

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.800 
some more flour onto the bench top and
do<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.019> middle<00:02:51.410> first<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.430> for<00:02:52.820> that<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.299> mix

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
do the middle first so for that I mix

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.229 
do the middle first so for that I mix
this<00:02:54.049> with<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.560> red<00:02:54.799> food<00:02:55.070> coloring<00:02:55.549> if<00:02:55.940> you

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.660 
this with the red food coloring if you
like<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.720> can<00:02:56.900> always<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.859> beforehand

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
like you can always do this beforehand

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.140 
like you can always do this beforehand
too

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
too

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.690 
too
after<00:02:59.900> kneading<00:03:00.320> divide<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.280> dough<00:03:01.459> into

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
after kneading divide the dough into

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.530 
after kneading divide the dough into
three<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.420> then<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.500> can<00:03:03.769> do<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.970> same<00:03:05.180> thing

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
three and then you can do the same thing

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.099 
three and then you can do the same thing
before<00:03:05.890> leaving<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.190> pro<00:03:07.430> or<00:03:07.790> you<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.930> do

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109 
before leaving it to pro or you can do

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.180 
before leaving it to pro or you can do
this<00:03:09.350> way<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.160> now<00:03:10.430> I'm<00:03:10.700> going<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.120> make<00:03:12.190> this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
this way so now I'm going to make this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.660 
this way so now I'm going to make this
to<00:03:13.489> a<00:03:13.519> rectangular<00:03:14.209> shape<00:03:14.829> after<00:03:15.829> doing<00:03:16.459> that

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
to a rectangular shape after doing that

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.550 
to a rectangular shape after doing that
to<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.910> rectangular<00:03:17.510> shape<00:03:17.959> take<00:03:18.350> the
