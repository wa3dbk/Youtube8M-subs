00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.559
 what we learned then of course that too 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.480
 with other things so always help 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.150
 if you want to write music 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.470
 you benefit from it but very special 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.740
 worked out what here 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.000
 romantic music and love songs 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 as we see in the content we catch 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.230
 Equal to emotional harmonies 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.689
 That's where you learn that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.939
 Emotional moods and harmonies 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.009
 how you create feelings in others but 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 also share your feelings with others 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.210
 can talk about your harmony over the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.399
 chords in the second chapter we look 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.120
 something similar for your moving 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.550
 melodies 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.950
 what makes a melody especially like 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.239
 structured to your tune like how 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.100
 are you doing when you are with the melody 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.870
 what if you are with the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.090
 chords begin this is the method 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.399
 I recommend the structure once 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.969
 take and then out of the chords out of the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.350
 emotional tones of the chords yours 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 beautiful moving melodies too 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.979
 then shape in the third chapter 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.900
 ancestral accompaniment to how structured 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 you the whole song rhythmically what it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 better where blows are so suitable 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.799
 pattern was how to draw the whole 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.950
 interesting how do you structure that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.600
 dynamics and so on then there is also 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.390
 a few hints must go back 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.820
 Accompaniment play and that's easy 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.799
 that's why the show is really great and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.340
 then get really brilliant and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.990
 that with simple means in chapter 4 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
 do you learn special harmonic 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 style elements that are from the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.810
 melody first of all there are there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.030
 different ones do not always fit only the ones 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.400
 sounds that already occur in the chord 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.950
 Often it is the melody that makes it so 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.750
 Sounds that are always short , eg 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 if the melody if the melody tone 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.619
 it always eats the basic tone then it sounds 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.750
 not great it even sounds 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.729
 relatively boring or if it is a lot 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.740
 It's often not the case with clinton 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.710
 exciting then it 's a good thing too 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 For example, sandals music 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.979
 the one in such a rough movie or something 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.250
 but it is not always expected 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.590
 Great for romantic songs if you are 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.869
 emotions move and transmit 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.459
 want to create there are others 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.280
 possibilities and reserves play one 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.870
 very big role if that the quad 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.700
 soon the victory and the end and so on 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.240
 continue as you do it here 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.240
 explained 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 after that we go to special yes 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.640
 harmonious style elements actually in 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.410
 in relation to the chords and there completely 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.959
 especially we treat the media 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.640
 this place related what that is 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.760
 Do you really learn this whole thing? 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.100
 part and that is a medium from the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.739
 Filmmusik comes and is often used 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.410
 quite a lot of music, that's what you are 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.600
 after working through this year 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.040
 from this course also after the after you 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.630
 some songs the knowledge written in 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.180
 the film music also recognize and also in 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.190
 some romantic music you so im 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.530
 can hear radio and is one 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.930
 something very special 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.030
 However, one must respond to emotions 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.319
 use a bit sparingly otherwise 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.630
 is the effect look at something under then 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.750
 we still like you at certain places 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.430
 major and minor exchange or everything after 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.090
 can move up and the tension too 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.920
 increase 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.900
 and there are tricks that one should 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.910
 maybe use it once in the song or 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 once in the stanza and then stop in 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.780
 the catastrophe again but these are 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.700
 even so all these elements this 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.980
 harmonious special style elements 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.500
 are all elements that you are very economical 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.959
 must use and how that is exactly and 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.730
 where do you put the good and which 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.940
 possibilities or hates that you learn 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.290
 right here in this fourth chapter in the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.450
 fifth chapter we come to 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.100
 practical cheating help but what 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.510
 in principle written by me and there 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.160
 I show you how you all that you do 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.630
 until then have learned theoretically and 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.850
 also understood and of course already 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.549
 have practiced how you take this together 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.280
 and thus after a scheme raging 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.049
 fast again just write that 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.549
 it is clear that is true 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.019
 schematic and you put the things 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.390
 Just enter and it will go fast 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.120
 and easy anyway is of course if 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.799
 you have great invasions that should not 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.590
 mean that your creativity or 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.900
 your musical genius you 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.000
 hopefully developed over time 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.380
 the which would not be important this 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.799
 of course already important and gives that 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.930
 all yours your own touch and it 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.970
 But it is important that you still the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.970
 possibilities probably know that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.560
 sound good then that to use around 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.040
 express yourself that you have to 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.260
 of course still do 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.940
 only it is much easier and much easier 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.230
 faster if you already know what you are 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.360
 and if you are not so gloomy 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.910
 we have to fish and that's what we do 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.260
 here in a very specific topic 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.960
 Step by step 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.570
 there he goes once the checklist there 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.790
 it's really step by step, so to speak 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.380
 so you make the first step in 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.510
 second third fourth, etc 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.060
 and then there is the second part of the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.250
 Checklist as you see the tables 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.810
 I say that's what you have 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.910
 Tables that I have worked out for 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.620
 you can see it right there, okay me 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.780
 I know what I'm in now 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.840
 this part of the song i have now 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.770
 these harmonies i am in this key 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.260
 that sounds okay 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.540
 And that sounds very good to harmonies 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.670
 now what is it a good or something 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.760
 are good melody to take a toll on what 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.380
 is here if I say a little bit 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.820
 that was the first stanza and then 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.190
 I want in the second part of the first one 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.020
 stanzas, for example, small changes 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.120
 should have a special place 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.350
 what will I take what chords 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.300
 I can take it and so on 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.860
 immediately out of the checklist you have 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.600
 always several possibilities that is 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.640
 the possibilities of combination are always 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.770
 still very many but it is just 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.150
 something completely different than when you have us 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.220
 The guitar would sit there then 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.470
 just try around so you know completely 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.010
 that's exactly what I can do that 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.650
 try 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.930
 they are probably good and so 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.460
 comes so fast to the goal 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.810
 okay one more thing maybe people 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.940
 always ask if you need knowledge 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.040
 needs and yes you need 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.600
 Skills to do this 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.040
 it just can not be done without you 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.770
 did not understand properly if you 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.260
 can not read and write 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.970
 but you do not have to be a composer 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.830
 have knowledge of notes but it is so 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.890
 that's enough basic knowledge 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.540
 there is also here to this course 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.700
 I'll give you a quick course for 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.140
 As you learn what you do completely 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.360
 you urgently need to do that 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.890
 if you can go through and everything 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.510
 want to understand exactly then you have to 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.270
 go deeper as you do it 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.190
 you get here in the same course 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.380
 another tip on the way where still 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.050
 hints where you can deepen that 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.090
 For example, you look like the one here 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.100
 terz is explained as chords 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.170
 are built and so on for that 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.070
 you just need basic knowledge 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.910
 at the same time, the 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.370
 implementation on the guitar the same 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.290
 participated in very simple in 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.960
 chord symbols or a taboo latour 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.090
 partly so there you are not alone 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.100
 left but these are fast 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.750
 Either you have the rhi if you have 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.670
 not so sure until the notes would 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.990
 I recommend to do or deeper 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.170
 if you know everything exactly 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.760
 I want to understand the show 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.950
 I'll go through it myself 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.290
 say goodbye and thus a bit 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.850
 I can see what's coming up to you 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.890
 I wish you a lot of fun and 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:13.570
 that your flame just succeed 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.480
 blushes and falls around the neck and down to the valley 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.730
 mouth open there if you are yours 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.850
 song before play his first miracle 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:24.010
 nice romantic song and that you 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.650
 just have fun with this success 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.060
 whole thing and told me about it 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.920
 and maybe your result too 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.310
 soon with us partly through a video 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.310
