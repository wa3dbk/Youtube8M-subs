when you're traveling because I find

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.580 
when you're traveling because I find
that<00:03:27.610> this<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.240> convenient<00:03:28.720> I've<00:03:29.320> been

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
that this is so convenient I've been

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.910 
that this is so convenient I've been
actually<00:03:29.950> putting<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.370> in<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:31.810> gym<00:03:32.080> bag<00:03:32.140> but

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
actually putting this in my gym bag but

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.590 
actually putting this in my gym bag but
also<00:03:33.100> when<00:03:33.340> I'm<00:03:33.460> going<00:03:33.640> away<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.420> get

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
also when I'm going away you get

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.800 
also when I'm going away you get
basically<00:03:35.050> just<00:03:35.590> a<00:03:35.710> round<00:03:35.950> case<00:03:36.280> like<00:03:36.520> that

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
basically just a round case like that

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.800 
basically just a round case like that
and<00:03:37.830> also<00:03:38.830> comes<00:03:39.160> with<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.340> barn<00:03:39.610> side<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.300> then

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
and also comes with a barn side and then

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.810 
and also comes with a barn side and then
you<00:03:40.990> can<00:03:41.170> have<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.830> faceting<00:03:42.280> like<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.640> when

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
you can have the faceting like this when

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.250 
you can have the faceting like this when
you're<00:03:42.940> traveling<00:03:43.330> so<00:03:43.510> it's<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.870> soap

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
you're traveling so it's like a soap

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.220 
you're traveling so it's like a soap
tray<00:03:44.860> like<00:03:45.460> this<00:03:45.490> so<00:03:46.450> all<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.750> water<00:03:46.990> will

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
tray like this so all the water will

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.990 
tray like this so all the water will
actually<00:03:47.260> drain<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.220> wouldn't<00:03:48.580> sit<00:03:48.850> in

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
actually drain and wouldn't sit in

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.120 
actually drain and wouldn't sit in
underneath<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.660> bottom<00:03:49.990> and<00:03:50.260> then<00:03:50.560> once<00:03:50.920> it's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
underneath the bottom and then once it's

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.850 
underneath the bottom and then once it's
dry<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.730> can<00:03:51.820> just<00:03:52.060> close<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.020> case<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.680> you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
dry you can just close the case and you

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.560 
dry you can just close the case and you
just<00:03:54.100> throw<00:03:54.370> this<00:03:54.490> new<00:03:54.670> bag<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.420> could
