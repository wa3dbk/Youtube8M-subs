this because you can now customize the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.260 
this because you can now customize the
color<00:02:26.420> of<00:02:26.510> literally<00:02:27.230> anything<00:02:28.180> placing<00:02:29.180> it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
color of literally anything placing it

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.140 
color of literally anything placing it
down<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.720> same<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.110> any<00:02:30.260> CTR<00:02:30.770> if<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.760> don't

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
down is the same as any CTR if you don't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.210 
down is the same as any CTR if you don't

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
know how to place down a CT arm like

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.120 
know how to place down a CT arm like
this<00:02:34.250> i<00:02:34.670> will<00:02:34.820> show<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.060> a<00:02:35.360> few<00:02:36.080> minutes<00:02:36.650> later

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
this i will show you a few minutes later

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.540 
this i will show you a few minutes later
into<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:37.550> video<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:39.620> again<00:02:39.890> let<00:02:40.459> me<00:02:40.490> just

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
into this video then again let me just

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.100 
into this video then again let me just
explain<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:41.030> few<00:02:41.209> more<00:02:41.360> things<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.990> way

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
explain a few more things so the way

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.260 
explain a few more things so the way
this<00:02:42.260> works<00:02:42.320> is<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:43.220> colors<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.910> change

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
this works is that the colors you change

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.560 
this works is that the colors you change
all<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.709> Royal<00:02:45.920> texture<00:02:46.370> files<00:02:46.580> for<00:02:47.120> this<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
all the Royal texture files for this and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.890 
all the Royal texture files for this and
when<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.560> change<00:02:48.830> those<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.510> basically<00:02:50.510> this

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
when you change those it basically this

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.960 
when you change those it basically this
program<00:02:51.350> or<00:02:51.620> like<00:02:52.010> these<00:02:52.250> strains<00:02:52.670> will

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
program or like these strains will

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.000 
program or like these strains will
detect<00:02:53.270> that<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.690> then<00:02:53.900> they<00:02:54.020> will<00:02:54.170> adapt<00:02:54.530> to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
detect that and then they will adapt to

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.460 
detect that and then they will adapt to
it<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.120> meaning<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.690> can<00:02:56.840> change<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.140> any

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
it so meaning you can change to any

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.410 
it so meaning you can change to any
color<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:58.010> like<00:02:58.040> any<00:02:58.400> color<00:02:58.640> scheme<00:02:58.910> any<00:02:59.150> type

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
color you like any color scheme any type

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.150 
color you like any color scheme any type
and<00:02:59.690> all<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.110> have<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.320> do<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.650> apply<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:00.980> like

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
and all you have to do is apply it like

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.990 
and all you have to do is apply it like
a<00:03:01.190> regular<00:03:01.370> train<00:03:03.190> once<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.340> is<00:03:04.519> loaded<00:03:04.730> i

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
a regular train once this is loaded i

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 
a regular train once this is loaded i
will<00:03:05.150> show<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.360> how<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.540> apply<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.959> but<00:03:06.890> there

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
will show you how to apply it but there

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.170 
will show you how to apply it but there
are<00:03:07.040> a<00:03:07.160> few<00:03:07.250> things<00:03:07.400> need<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:07.730> keep<00:03:07.880> in<00:03:08.000> mind

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
are a few things need to keep in mind

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.970 
are a few things need to keep in mind
first<00:03:08.390> when<00:03:08.660> you're<00:03:09.230> applying<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.830> need

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
first when you're applying it you need

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.140 
first when you're applying it you need
to<00:03:10.010> make<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.340> coast<00:03:10.519> of<00:03:10.670> style<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:10.970> it's

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
to make the coast of style that it's

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.530 
to make the coast of style that it's
applying<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.720> a<00:03:11.959> mac<00:03:12.470> coaster<00:03:13.070> like<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.610> mac

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
applying to a mac coaster like the mac

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.030 
applying to a mac coaster like the mac
coaster<00:03:14.840> stone<00:03:15.050> and<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.350> can<00:03:15.500> see<00:03:15.650> here<00:03:15.860> look

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
coaster stone and you can see here look

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.120 
coaster stone and you can see here look
the<00:03:16.730> part<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.209> was<00:03:17.300> Green<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.660> no<00:03:17.780> red<00:03:18.130> like

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
the part that was Green is no red like

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.890 
the part that was Green is no red like
you<00:03:19.400> can<00:03:19.550> see<00:03:19.730> here<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.120> it<00:03:20.989> needs<00:03:21.170> to<00:03:21.320> be<00:03:21.880> 0.01

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you can see here and it needs to be 0.01

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.810 
you can see here and it needs to be 0.01
meters<00:03:23.900> above<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.410> heart<00:03:24.560> line<00:03:24.800> so<00:03:25.130> just<00:03:25.640> take

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
meters above the heart line so just take

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.280 
meters above the heart line so just take
whatever<00:03:26.000> hardline<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.660> currently<00:03:27.019> have<00:03:27.170> on

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
whatever hardline you currently have on

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.699 
whatever hardline you currently have on
your<00:03:27.380> coaster<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:27.980> do<00:03:28.430> negative<00:03:29.090> 0.01<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.590> it

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
your coaster and do negative 0.01 to it

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.130 
your coaster and do negative 0.01 to it
and<00:03:30.860> then<00:03:31.370> you<00:03:31.519> will<00:03:31.640> have<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.880> like<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.239> they

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
and then you will have it like this they

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.300 
and then you will have it like this they

all you have to do is place the trains

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.259 
all you have to do is place the trains
on<00:03:34.489> top<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.940> then<00:03:35.720> leave<00:03:36.110> editor<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.709> play

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
on top and then leave editor and play

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.280 
on top and then leave editor and play
and<00:03:38.269> hopefully<00:03:38.480> you'll<00:03:38.810> know<00:03:38.930> them<00:03:39.019> into<00:03:39.230> a

and hopefully you'll know them into a

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.229 
and hopefully you'll know them into a
crash<00:03:39.590> you<00:03:40.160> can<00:03:40.340> see<00:03:40.489> those<00:03:40.670> the<00:03:40.880> ordering

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
crash you can see those the ordering

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.620 
crash you can see those the ordering
rider<00:03:41.420> trains<00:03:42.790> and<00:03:43.790> you'll<00:03:43.940> see<00:03:44.120> look<00:03:44.330> they

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
placed out 0 car is bit so basically

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.870 
placed out 0 car is bit so basically
just<00:05:38.889> hard<00:05:39.040> to<00:05:39.130> take<00:05:39.280> the<00:05:39.400> noble<00:05:39.580> cause<00:05:39.729> you

want minus 1 to it and then place it
down<00:05:42.190> because<00:05:42.430> seven<00:05:43.090> is<00:05:43.180> actually<00:05:43.540> eight

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720
