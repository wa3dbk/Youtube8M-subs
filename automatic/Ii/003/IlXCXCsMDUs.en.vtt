 today our video lesson will be about the 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:24.760

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.620
 Let's take it upside down. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.960
 remembering the body 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.710
 a metal part grounded by a menu 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.170
 10 seconds ten seconds is enough 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.050
 so let's remove the battery from the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.630
 it is important to always remove the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 the battery before performing maintenance and 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.020
 any notebook 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:16.210

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.479
 drawer 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.950
 Let's take them off with a lot of 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.950
 caution

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.890
 with a one key you can see there 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:48.430
 I have to lock the magnet to get our 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 here we come here 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.090
 first screw 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:08.829

 you can see that this microphone and microphone 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:54.090
 that only finish 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:03:03.030
 You can see inside you have nothing to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:06.000
 see there was camera on this side there is 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.950
 another side here then let's make the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.950
 removing a camera 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.590
 so let's do the removal 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.590
 removed to remove the other 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:32.510
 side of the other side we see here is 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:36.840
 perfectly and now we can 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.940
 we can take the hard drive in the drawer 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:04:07.079
 We can not do it here at the tip. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:04:11.220

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:51.780
 ready let's put a screw 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:05:00.590
 on the other side ready let's go 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:05:03.060
 put back into the corresponding part 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.490
 remembering that the part where the 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.979
