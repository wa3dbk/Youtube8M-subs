 hi to all and greedy x301 and we get 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.990
 found for a new tutorial so south 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.130
 early it consists of cracking terraria 1.2.2 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 what is the difference of work 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
 1.2.2 to earlier versions this is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.939
 very simple it adds full said m of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
 new bios and new modes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.630
 So here is more crack it's hyper 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 simple throws in the description wants 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.460
 put a link so the link there you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.440
 will take you here this terror she cracks 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.020
 terraria 1.2.2 and to prove that it is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.489
 not bullshit but I clicked on it 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.539
 I will download a dish it is when 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.190
 even heavy enough for a short crack that 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.079
 will take you on a folder like this 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.609
 so that terra nothing you will have to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:02.219
 plot your office sdra folder here 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.140
 so I was loaded crack djÃ©dja 100 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:18.080
 euros it's okay we'll put them 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:18.080
 here copy and replaced here is internet 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.310
 if he wants to be tense and sometimes 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.700
 ah ben there and so that it will create you 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.350
 this folder is in but the most serious 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.040
 it's a guy who's here so my 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.040
 extreme keyboard 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.710
 I do not leave you and so here is 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.930
 this is exactly like them and therefore 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.940
 after that it's super simple you do not 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.440
 hold that terraria points were doing 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.140
 the rest will make a server 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.240
 besides the class will surely do 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.850
 a tutorial on how to make a server 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.179
 terrarium which Quebec will put I will put 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.570
 the link in the video when this video 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.340
 will be released how do you do it 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.080
 just double click on it you do not 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.840
 do not touch the guests a fair ta 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.340
 answer is double click on terraria 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.340
 point excess and that will open you 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.440
 be careful so that opens you up 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.820
 terror and air to show you that 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:40.520
 it's 1.6.2 so that's 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.520
 the loading screen 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.050
 here he can here you can see 1.2.2 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.120
 and the server 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.959
 so as you are you noticed the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.390
 class is among us multiplayer 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.769
 join then you can see 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.280
 the ipemed way I could not come 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.700
 you need access to the machine 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.700
 1 2 3 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.600
 so here we are sure then I just 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:16.280
 wait for jesus only with two windows 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.280
 So I'm here coltan 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.540
 ok so we are sure terraria so there not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
 at all optimized so goes away that it does not 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.690
 did not change like I'm going to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.960
 see I believe this animal is a 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:35.350
 new so to say it works there is 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:39.550
 the doors that and it works perfectly 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.500
 well as well in as well as solo and 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.320
 novelty especially they do not sell 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.690
 wrong is that here you have a map 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.390
 this map can be put on 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.240
 the screen in very low opacity you 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.820
 want to do either ok here it was it 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.790
 a little bones very short and I hope that 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.230
 it will serve more than one so benevit is 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.510
 not to share the video for more than 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.460
 benzema saw to like and to see 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.550
 the 2nd place chain to the east has pleased all the 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.550
 world
