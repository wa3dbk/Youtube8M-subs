00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:12.290
 now try to install the pipes 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:24.700
 from a compress instead of a regular signal in 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:24.700
 set of 2 pipes 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.660
 connecting tube 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.989
 hardware 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:43.670
 tee and relyuha it is not useful 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.640
 because cars are already installed 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.340
 relay for the signal to start soldered 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.210
 standard wiring wires fornication 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:01:00.350
 soldered to shrink and brought mom 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.149
 Separately, plus or minus I certainly do not 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.840
 eager to try out immediately as you 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:13.130
 buzzing hooked compresses connected to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:16.750
 dooms and alas ah frustration sound 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.170
 dull weak not at all 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.170
 tried to make separate most 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.909
 big tube that's sound powerful good 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.950
 loud 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.990
 here kosyachok turned out so that the hose 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.000
 cut here take your time cut a 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.970
 connect I did not find such a way out 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.360
 provisions drowned out with a bolt six 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.009
 very firmly stood Tuga 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.400
 from the outside it will not be visible now 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.570
 need to determine the attachment points 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.229
 compressor need to put so 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.460
 so that it is protected from moisture 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.009
 accidentally saw two come out here 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.659
 studs for what they do not know and just 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.549
 the compressor here from here will be good 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.549
 will be behind the bumper is securely closed 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.020
 and the booth itself and where is the grain here I 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.670
 I tried not to put it very nicely 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.420
 to a regular place 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.130
 but this plate is just anal so 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.520
 It will be and will be beautiful through the mesh 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.520
 prominent 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.530
 here is the lug nut so convenient 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.420
 stop and on the pin nut eight 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:36.730
 connected 13 turn on the hairpin 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:38.130
 a little bit and then put everything on the nut 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:58.530
 to twist 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:03:04.890
 cranking the compressor itself the pipe 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:13.019
 also mortgage nut on the back side 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.019
 I insert a bolt and we twist 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:57.210
 you connect angie 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.210
 and here it is the moment of truth
