00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 ok and my teknos friends in this 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.500
 moment we are going to start the review of 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.450
 that gentleman who is here that is the engine 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.539
 and second generation there was a first 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.930
 generation that was delivered in 2013 and 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.230
 this second generation that comes from 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.290
 year 2014 the year that has just gone has 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 a 5.5-inch screen with 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:33.329
 resolution hd a resolution hd of 1280 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.810
 x 720 points and a qualcomm processor 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.380
 quad-core snapdragon 400 nothing 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:43.110
 wrong that runs at 1.2 gigahertz a gpu 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.829
 adreno 305 that takes care of all the 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.570
 graphic part is dedicated to the development 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 from graphics to movements to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.500
 effects that is the part that is responsible 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.270
 that gpu takes care of it the system 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.010
 operative good let's do the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 operating system search then 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.570
 to know which one is coming from 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.769
 factory we see here about the phone 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.450
 good system updates 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.460
 no updates so far 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.090
 but here is the android version and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.640
 says 4.4 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.829
 point 4 and if we hit several times no 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
 there will appear the same face 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.109
 kitkat and if we tap txu txu 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.780
 txu txu txu txu moves android 4.4 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:26.310
 point 4 are waiting at that moment 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.719
 the official update for lollipop 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.729
 5.0 but gentlemen like that they have us from 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.560
 Three weeks ago, the 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.469
 update is about to leave 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.329
 the update now yes that the engine and 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.649
 is receiving the update in the usa 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.200
 which is receiving the update in 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.569
 Chinese and here I do not finish arriving 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.479
 personally, I get the 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.959
 configuration every day to see if yes 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.179
 the version has come the latest version 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.099
 of android to install it or if the TV 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.649
 or waiting for the phone to tell me 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.530
 automatically if there was already drop that 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.149
 remember that another is over the air something 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.709
 as well as through the air a 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.319
 installation of the operating system that does not 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.509
 requires that we connect the terminal to the 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.489
 computer but the system 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.929
 operative is downloaded directly to the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.549
 phone and we can see here 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 system updates looking 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.319
 valid update then 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.230
 the last times he told me there is 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.689
 your device is updated I say 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.970
 do not accept ok let's see how long 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.170
 my god and I want it to be updated to 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.689
 lollipop but experience with kitkat 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.379
 4 points 4.4 really has not been 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:37.359
 bad as we can see here the front is 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:38.799
 bright is in bright black here 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.560
 there is the front camera of 2 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.200
 megapixels 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.060
 and the screen that comes on the screen 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.720
 it really looks pretty good has 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.959
 a density per inch of 280 pixels 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.760
 per inch of truth that nothing bad 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.010
 we can not compare remember that your 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.810
 medium range phone almost almost range 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.390
 medium-low is still in bed 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.040
 media is a phone that can not not 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.380
 we can compare this screen that he pulled 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.099
 the nexus x the samsung galaxy s 5 the know 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.900
 3 we can not or less with the iphone 6 that 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.819
 they already have that retina technology 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.920
 but it really looks very good and like 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.769
 can see on the screen the colors are 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.810
 really deep outer part 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.269
 back as you can we can see this is 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 a carcass if they have let's proceed to 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.230
 open the quickie terminal here so that 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.230
 see the back we're going to see 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.800
 as we can see the big surprise there 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.170
 has battery removable battery 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.770
 gentlemen is there in there and not 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.130
 we will be able to extract it here goes the sim 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.690
 card and here goes the memory that we 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.520
 we want to expand to 16 or 32 gigabytes 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.350
 but that of taking out the battery in these 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.840
 models does not go 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.500
 here we have the microusb entry for 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.790
 load the terminal 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.910
 and the minijack hole precisely for 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.100
 we listen to music or share 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.350
 contained to other devices by 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.690
 half of the auxiliary cable is in 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.030
 the top precisely so that 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.010
 we can enter the terminal in 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.060
 our pockets and still the cable 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.400
 can stay intact 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.800
 has a gigabyte of ram memory nothing 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.630
 wrong for this type of gamma device 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.880
 mean and really that handles them 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.600
 really good the phone has a 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.669
 pretty acceptable performance the weight 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.820
 it is also quite comfortable is a 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.060
 lightweight terminal is not very heavy weigh 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.740
 only 149 almost 150 grams weighs the 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.300
 terminal and really we can 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.850
 put in the pockets we can load 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.610
 without any problem even though the 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.190
 screen is 5.5 inches is maintained 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.950
 really good in a matter of weight and 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.540
 also in portability now we're going to 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.160
 see how it behaves as we can see 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.270
 here on the screen I have several 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.660
 Applications 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.250
 the good thing about this kitkat desk or 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.050
 of the main screen is that we 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.110
 allows to save several applications 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.840
 inside a kind of bubbles or 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.850
 folders then in those folders or 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.500
 little bubbles we are going to keep 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.120
 I have here all the news 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.880
 google apps in one place 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.340
 this comes by default and see how 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.560
 went from an application window to the 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.449
 another and it really behaves quite 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.639
 well in no time has been guided 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.710
 a moment has stuck here I open all 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.449
 the applications that I have open today 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.110
 closing applications that I have open 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:42.550
 also and then note that not in any 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.550
 moment has presented a lac 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.610
 there we have the volume and the best is 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.949
 that as he had told them they are 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.840
 stereo channels is to say what comes out in 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.030
 the right channel is the same as it comes out in 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.750
 the left channel then each channel 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.509
 because it is here or ejects or projects some 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.400
 different sound what allows us to 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.650
 we enjoy a wealth is not 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.780
 monkey that goes out the same for both the 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.449
 channels but here they differ 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.460
 clearly and best of all is that 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.340
 we can take the terminal like this and if 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.770
 we have an iphone a samsung galaxy not 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.509
 we will be able to listen to the content and 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.560
 notice that I can take my terminal 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.720
 so so 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.669
 I can also listen to everything that is 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.090
 is playing and I hear it well 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:32.310
 then it is a really positive point 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.050
 for the part I'm going for the people for the 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.510
 motorola engineering really is the 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.580
 ate because I can take the terminal 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:42.090
 well without any problem and continue 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.970
 listening to the audio sometimes we can 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.470
 get in 150 and in 180 dollars in a 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.710
 terminal that is at a price 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.690
 quite quite affordable now one of 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.110
 the things that he's definitely missing 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.800
 is the 4g signal to be able to work with lte 4g 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.010
 at this time work with signals hs 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.540
 of pea and also 3g is the speed 

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.120
 maximum that you can register this 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:08.850
 terminal but if we are going to work with 4g 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.160
 The gentlemen there we can go to mourn 

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.350
 for the valley however the speed 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.320
 download is also very acceptable 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.889
 whether we are on the street with 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:22.229
 3g or if we connect to a wifi network in 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:23.910
 the house and I repeat the price sir is 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:28.500
 good you can get it on offer at 

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:31.260
 140 dollars or up to 180 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.230
 it's a real bargain prices 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:38.070
 of this terminal we are talking about the 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:40.800
 engine and version then 2014 with a 

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:43.110
 really wide screen that we 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.480
 will allow us to enjoy both 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.040
 of the content that we are reading the 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.750
 messages 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.210
 as well as the content 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.190
 multimedia really very well for the 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.070
 motorola people and then we're going to 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:58.590
 look for the moto x and the nexus 6 for 

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:01.670
 make them their then their respective 

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.670
 review also
