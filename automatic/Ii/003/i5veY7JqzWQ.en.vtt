00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hello, good afternoon Roger speaks 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.870
 VelÃ¡squez we are in a video tutorial 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.260
 how to install ares in a system 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.560
 operative mac as we know areces is a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.590
 program software 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.490
 d 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.960
 of p2p which means sharing the 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.560
 Files when sharing files 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 obviously with users who have a 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 link to the same software then 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.649
 it is not recommended per se 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.629
 in computer science it is not recommended 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:43.309
 precisely because they say that you 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.979
 translates virus obviously if the other 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.559
 person has virus on his other computer 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.960
 the files they are sharing 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.700
 they will also be infected then 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.750
 It will go second 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:04.059
 to infect your good team we know that 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.960
 we do not have a lot of malware yet 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.960
 so then 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.960
 maybe I can recommend them 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.280
 itself and in the good guys I think that 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.000
 we have to do is go to our 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.180
 obviously I'm going to pass a browser 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.670
 link 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.590
 a link in the description of the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.079
 video description 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.189
 we have to wait for 5 seconds and so 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:38.090
 we know how to jump publication we go down 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.219
 from track box dropbox so what 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.939
 download very fast I have it 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.939
 Discharged 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.130
 it does not matter much to us that he says 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.900
 it's a point yes 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.620
 sex club or will not take long 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.620
 downloads 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.110
 no yes yes 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.069
 good as we tell them is it is a 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.140
 software that compartment 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.190
 files then sometimes it's not very 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.530
 recommended by 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.590
 the type d 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.819
 as it gives a sun to the other people to 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.860
 Your equipment sometimes does not install 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.940
 antivirus and all that and how we know how to use 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.400
 it is a software that are good 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.400
 and I understand that it was only made for 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.409
 windows 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.409
 I tried to install it with 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.990
 wenski the truth I could not 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.960
 but good 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.710
 orthodox I bring them nothing else 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.830
 Passing it to your applications folder 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.670
 there is no need to open the wine skin 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.670
 so 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.560
 failure of this 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.560
 that what 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.450
 it takes a while to open 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.240
 let's go to the download 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.850
 we passed him 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.959
 we already have it downloaded we go to our 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.959
 binder 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.840
 Resist dmg double click 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.600
 in April 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.280
 we wait 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:36.389
 and I do not know, I recommend them 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.389
 that is 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.419
 Pass it to the applications folder 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.370
 for example I already have it there 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.680
 what is the problem of being is that 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.680
 it takes about 10 minutes to connect 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.800
 but see, I've already downloaded 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.210
 is connected I also connect 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:41.670
 well you already know doubts comments in the 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.670
