00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello everyone and welcome one more day to the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.270
 chronicle channel of a mediator today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.259
 I come with the review of a book so 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.259
 let us begin 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.050
 the book that I am going to review today is called 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.360
 of the knight of the seven kingdoms of 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.000
 george rr martin and this is a prequel 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.680
 to ice song and fire stories 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.150
 that appear in this book take place 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.400
 100 years before the events 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.410
 of the game of thrones that is the first 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.730
 book of the saga and good here 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.739
 we found three stories 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.720
 starred by some characters a 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.090
 little curious one of these characters is 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.309
 call dong or as we know more 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.050
 ahead pig never on the high because 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.030
 he knights himself and 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.190
 others and there is another character called 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.140
 the way the egg is written in 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.210
 English well so these two characters 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.399
 they are quite different as I said 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.050
 Don is a newly armed gentleman 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.210
 who decide to be like a gentleman 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.850
 fast like his teacher in his time 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.680
 and travels through a lot of the places of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.350
 west and the seven kingdoms but 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.690
 really not very well versed in art 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.149
 of the cavalry or of the jousts or of 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.920
 the fights the only thing that has this good 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.539
 man is that he is super high and super 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.550
 big then it has a lot of strength 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.100
 in hand-to-hand combat 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.680
 that's a little silly lacks a bit of 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.590
 excesses is more force than yes yes that is 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.590
 that on the other hand is he is a boy 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.360
 of 10 12 years that one day especially a 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.520
 cancer finds it out there and says how 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.650
 Well, he wants to be my squire and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.020
 Boy says yes, well, I'm your squire 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.500
 but beyond that efe hides a 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.360
 secret and is your true identity not 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060
 I'm going to tell you who it is because I 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.910
 let's say one of the great twists of 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.190
 plot that have these stories but 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.810
 let's say it's an identity that one 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.750
 he never imagines but then he has 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.040
 meaning and it 's like wow that person is 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.740
 making is power of a gentleman 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.600
 wandering or because then these two 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.560
 characters are going to start as I said 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.270
 to travel together all over the west as 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.130
 because that's what the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 errant knights in the middle of everything 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 this these three stories tell us 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.990
 let's say different episodes that 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.750
 include fair marriages, wars for 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.030
 the water for the territories appear 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.410
 many characters of the targaryen and 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.290
 the first king appears 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.080
 eris appears in the gong may carbon 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.270
 all these princes targaryen appears 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.800
 also in body of blood I think that 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.290
 call that is the hand of the king in that 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.760
 good moment appears in the widow 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.260
 scarlet which is a woman to whom 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 many men are afraid of him because 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.420
 they are only 25 years old and three of their 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.040
 husbands have died under strangers 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.310
 circumstances and good in the middle of all 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.810
 these stories where they look like 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.370
 dragged in the middle of them like what 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 we are doing here because always 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.390
 we end up in the middle of the problems 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.160
 but well beyond that are stories 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.930
 super interesting that allow you 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.210
 know a little how it was west one hundred 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.730
 years before game of thrones I thought 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.530
 very curious about this book that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.210
 basically in all the stories where 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.990
 he says he has a lot very much 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.970
 very hot and this the stark say 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.000
 what windows they eat but in this book 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 winter jasmine with jets and good in short 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.870
 are things that seem curious to me they say 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.430
 well these are 100 years before so 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.709
 the big day has not yet arrived 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.989
 and none of those things but good this 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.299
 I loved the book, it fascinates me 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.640
 I wrote yesterday yesterday Martin because beyond 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.409
 that describes a point is not a 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.000
 description that bothers me but that of 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.620
 truth makes you put in situation and 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.390
 you know that we are at that moment in 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.150
 means of ford defining knowing the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.790
 lists in the jousts and seeing how it 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.439
 he married and he preached them lúcio they want us not 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.090
 I know it's a description that gets you in 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.120
 situation and that for me it's nothing 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.920
 exaggerated nor does it spare anything in addition 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.019
 two marketing stories always 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.849
 have as a reason for being and I know that 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.620
 later if I have not understood in a 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.290
 detail of these are going to make sense in 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.569
 my head so it returns nothing if you're a 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.790
 fan of the out song of the fire you 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.620
 you need to read something george para martín 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.840
 because give the five books and they're 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.609
 desperate because this man does not know 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.709
 feel to write and take out the sixth and the 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:11.530
 seventh then meanwhile you can read 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:13.000
 this book that I highly recommend and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.439
 well I think that has been all for the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.790
 today's review I hope you have them 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:18.759
 liked I do not know 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.009
 leave me in the comments of that house 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.139
 Game of Thrones wanted to be or 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.539
 what case do they feel or do I know one thing 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.370
 well and if it already arrived in this book or if 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.380
 have already read the saga do not forget about 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.360
 like the video subscribe to my tan 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.220
 high gym in all my social networks and 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.289
 see you in a next occasion in 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.289
 chronicles of a marauder to chao
