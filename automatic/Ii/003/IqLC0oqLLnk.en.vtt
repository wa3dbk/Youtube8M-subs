renovation the main issue that had to be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.980 
dealt with was the drought that their
area<00:02:37.230> was<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.100> going<00:02:38.430> through<00:02:38.820> we've<00:02:39.810> been

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.840 
in a drought for quite a while now in
California<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.740> there<00:02:43.920> was<00:02:44.040> obviously<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.670> very

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
California so there was obviously a very

California so there was obviously a very
limited<00:02:45.030> resource<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.680> our<00:02:47.310> our

limited resource and it's our our

poppy Hills decided has delay the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.460 
poppy Hills decided has delay the
seeding<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.940> order<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.630> get<00:02:57.780> closer<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.320> a

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
seeding in order to get closer to a

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.910 
seeding in order to get closer to a
winter<00:02:58.800> months<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.910> be<00:03:00.060> able<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.330> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
winter months to be able to and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.710 
winter months to be able to and
typically<00:03:01.920> water<00:03:02.100> usage<00:03:02.550> was<00:03:02.700> down<00:03:02.880> from<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
typically water usage was down from the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.870 
typically water usage was down from the
middle<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.050> summer<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:05.250> basically<00:03:05.730> to

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
middle of the summer to basically to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.790 
middle of the summer to basically to
avoid<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.330> May<00:03:06.540> June<00:03:07.070> heavy<00:03:08.070> usage<00:03:08.310> months<00:03:08.820> so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
avoid the May June heavy usage months so

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.949 
avoid the May June heavy usage months so
they<00:03:10.940> decided<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.030> push<00:03:12.209> back<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.450> seeding

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
they decided to push back the seeding

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.910 
they decided to push back the seeding
and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.260> once<00:03:13.709> July<00:03:14.040> hit<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.709> golf

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.000 
and then once July hit we the golf

had the whole project closed up in

it<00:03:27.060> enough<00:03:27.239> time<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.540> grow<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.930> case<00:03:28.170> we<00:03:28.290> did

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
it enough time to grow in case we did

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.490 
it enough time to grow in case we did
get<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.680> quite<00:03:28.890> a

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
get it quite a

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.810 
get it quite a
a<00:03:29.560> bad<00:03:29.830> winter<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.270> decision<00:03:32.580> was<00:03:33.580> made

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
a bad winter so that decision was made

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.060 
a bad winter so that decision was made
the<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.960> golf<00:03:35.140> course<00:03:35.380> superintendents<00:03:35.980> got

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
the the golf course superintendents got

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.510 
the the golf course superintendents got
together<00:03:36.250> well<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.780> area<00:03:38.080> and<00:03:38.260> decided<00:03:38.920> to

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
together well in the area and decided to

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.450 
together well in the area and decided to
put<00:03:39.700> themselves<00:03:40.350> under<00:03:41.350> water<00:03:41.890> restriction

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
put themselves under water restriction

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.660 
put themselves under water restriction
so<00:03:43.020> superintendents<00:03:44.020> and<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.440> clubs<00:03:44.740> are<00:03:45.250> all

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
so superintendents and the clubs are all

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.190 
so superintendents and the clubs are all
in<00:03:45.790> agreement<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.330> they<00:03:46.570> were<00:03:46.660> going<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.959> use

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
in agreement that they were going to use

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.980 
in agreement that they were going to use
a<00:03:47.530> certain<00:03:47.800> amount<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:48.010> water<00:03:48.160> per<00:03:48.820> day<00:03:49.060> so<00:03:49.750> we

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
a certain amount of water per day so we

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.500 
a certain amount of water per day so we
could<00:03:50.200> have<00:03:50.709> more<00:03:50.740> water<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.970> be<00:03:52.090> able<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.330> grow

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
could have more water to be able to grow

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.910 
could have more water to be able to grow
in<00:03:52.660> this<00:03:52.840> golf<00:03:53.080> course<00:03:53.290> because<00:03:53.440> obviously

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
in this golf course because obviously

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.490 
in this golf course because obviously
you<00:03:54.040> need<00:03:54.190> more<00:03:54.580> water<00:03:54.910> per<00:03:55.209> day<00:03:55.240> for<00:03:56.140> growing

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
you need more water per day for growing

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.850 
you need more water per day for growing
than<00:03:57.010> necessarily<00:03:57.430> maintenance<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.680> was

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
than necessarily maintenance so it was

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.620 
than necessarily maintenance so it was
it<00:04:00.160> was<00:04:00.250> probably<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.670> best<00:04:00.790> example<00:04:01.420> of

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
it was probably the best example of

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.270 
it was probably the best example of
superintendents<00:04:02.440> getting<00:04:02.650> together<00:04:02.770> and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
superintendents getting together and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.440 
superintendents getting together and
coming<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.360> common<00:04:04.810> ground<00:04:05.020> and<00:04:06.360> it's<00:04:07.360> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
coming to a common ground and it's the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.350 
coming to a common ground and it's the
best<00:04:07.630> example<00:04:08.020> I've<00:04:08.140> ever<00:04:08.320> seen<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:10.239> it

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
best example I've ever seen so and it

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.430 
best example I've ever seen so and it
was<00:04:10.420> great<00:04:10.630> to<00:04:10.720> be<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> part<00:04:10.900> of<00:04:11.200> them<00:04:11.350> and

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
was great to be a part of them and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.800 
was great to be a part of them and
you're<00:04:11.560> talking<00:04:11.950> about<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.220> lot<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.810> very

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
you're talking about a lot of very

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.490 
you're talking about a lot of very
premier<00:04:14.260> golf<00:04:15.070> properties<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:17.019> know<00:04:17.109> the

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
premier golf properties and you know the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.349 
premier golf properties and you know the
superintendent's<00:04:18.280> put<00:04:18.400> themselves<00:04:18.790> in<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.120> in

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
superintendent's put themselves in a in

it doesn't feel like it necessarily has

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.330

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
natural sandy areas it feels like you're

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.230 
natural sandy areas it feels like you're
more<00:05:14.380> inside<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.130> taking<00:05:15.729> a<00:05:15.790> walk<00:05:15.820> through<00:05:16.180> the

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
more inside of taking a walk through the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.690 
more inside of taking a walk through the
park<00:05:16.510> then

park then

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.300 
park then
that<00:05:18.270> necessarily<00:05:18.690> just<00:05:18.990> uh<00:05:19.310> shooting

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
that necessarily just uh shooting

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.160 
that necessarily just uh shooting
fairways<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.120> it<00:05:21.210> really<00:05:21.660> feels<00:05:21.870> like<00:05:21.930> the

whole<00:05:22.290> thing<00:05:22.590> is<00:05:22.620> much<00:05:22.950> more<00:05:23.160> natural<00:05:23.670> than<00:05:24.110> in

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
whole thing is much more natural than in

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:31.760 
whole thing is much more natural than in
most<00:05:25.260> golf<00:05:25.500> courses
