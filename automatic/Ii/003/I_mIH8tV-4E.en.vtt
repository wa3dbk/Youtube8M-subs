00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
so I'm going to attempt to make the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.110 
so I'm going to attempt to make the
blade<00:00:04.920> cover<00:00:05.990> for<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.140> sheath<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:08.670> just

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
blade cover for this sheath of just

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.900 
blade cover for this sheath of just
plain<00:00:09.480> cardboard<00:00:09.840> you<00:00:10.620> know<00:00:10.740> you<00:00:11.550> know<00:00:11.639> cover

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
plain cardboard you know you know cover

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.350 
plain cardboard you know you know cover
it<00:00:12.059> later<00:00:12.269> see<00:00:12.900> if<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.110> works<00:00:14.000> of<00:00:15.000> course<00:00:15.059> all

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
it later see if it works of course all

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.670 
it later see if it works of course all
this<00:00:15.480> stuff<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.839> new<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.170> me<00:00:16.199> I've<00:00:16.529> never

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
this stuff is new to me I've never

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.540 
this stuff is new to me I've never
really<00:00:17.039> tried<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.580> but<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:18.500> you<00:00:19.500> know<00:00:19.560> put

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
really tried it but I just you know put

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.070 
really tried it but I just you know put
things<00:00:20.730> together<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.210> see<00:00:21.420> how<00:00:21.449> how<00:00:21.930> they

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
things together and see how how they

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.429 
things together and see how how they
turn<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.730> three<00:00:24.119> pieces<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.900> mean

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
turn out so just three pieces I mean

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.820 
turn out so just three pieces I mean
four<00:00:25.680> four<00:00:26.279> pieces<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.970> two<00:00:27.269> then<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.650> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
four four pieces one two then one for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.870 
four four pieces one two then one for
each<00:00:28.890> side<00:00:29.330> thin<00:00:30.330> piece<00:00:31.250> I'm<00:00:32.250> gonna<00:00:32.520> draw<00:00:32.730> this

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
each side thin piece I'm gonna draw this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.420 
each side thin piece I'm gonna draw this
out<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:35.270> see<00:00:36.270> how<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.390> looks<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.129> have<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
out and see how it looks so we have the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.780 
out and see how it looks so we have the
first<00:00:38.700> side<00:00:39.230> I'm<00:00:40.230> gonna<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.649> trace<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.520> out

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
first side I'm gonna just trace it out

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540 
first side I'm gonna just trace it out
for<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> second<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.590> after<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:44.309> do

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
for the second and after that I'll do

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.090 
for the second and after that I'll do
the<00:00:45.230> two<00:00:46.230> pieces<00:00:46.640> between<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> turns<00:00:49.920> into

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the two pieces between so it turns into

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.660 
the two pieces between so it turns into
the<00:00:50.670> sheath<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.110> pieces<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the sheath so the two pieces and then I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.790 
the sheath so the two pieces and then I
need<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> make<00:00:54.570> something<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.320> goes<00:00:55.500> around

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
need to make something that goes around

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
need to make something that goes around
the<00:00:56.010> whole<00:00:56.539> deal<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.469> I'll<00:00:58.559> tape<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.949> up<00:00:59.210> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the whole deal and I'll tape it up so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
the whole deal and I'll tape it up so
here<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> two<00:01:00.840> sides<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> centerpiece

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
here the two sides and the centerpiece

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
here the two sides and the centerpiece
it's<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.270> long<00:01:03.480> enough<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.049> I'll<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.409> add

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
it's not long enough but I'll just add

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's not long enough but I'll just add
some<00:01:04.650> extra<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.540> we<00:01:06.630> went<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> try<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.439> get<00:01:07.560> as

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
some extra and we went to try to get as

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.090 
some extra and we went to try to get as
much<00:01:07.770> tape<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> inside<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.850> possible<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
much tape on the inside as possible just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
much tape on the inside as possible just
because<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.280> probably<00:01:11.610> difficult<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.320> paper

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
because it's probably difficult to paper

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.950 
because it's probably difficult to paper
mache<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.770> whatever<00:01:14.310> over<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.970> tape<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
mache or whatever over the tape so the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
mache or whatever over the tape so the
interior<00:01:16.290> tape<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.740> wasn't<00:01:17.159> holding<00:01:17.310> too

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
interior tape just wasn't holding too

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.359 
interior tape just wasn't holding too
well<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.360> took<00:01:18.840> some<00:01:19.040> electrical<00:01:20.040> tape<00:01:20.070> we

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
well it took some electrical tape we

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.749 
well it took some electrical tape we
started<00:01:20.729> wrapping<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.960> ran<00:01:22.140> out

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
started wrapping it then it ran out

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.429 
started wrapping it then it ran out
take<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.869> work<00:01:25.110> right<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.070> I'm<00:01:26.189> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.670> just

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
take a work right now I'm going to just

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.170 
take a work right now I'm going to just
trim<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> edges<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:29.220> these<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
trim the edges of these to make it a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
trim the edges of these to make it a
little<00:01:30.299> bit<00:01:30.450> more<00:01:30.570> rounded<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.409> fit<00:01:31.619> this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
little bit more rounded to fit this

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.420 
little bit more rounded to fit this
interior<00:01:32.549> section<00:01:33.110> wasn't<00:01:34.110> quite<00:01:34.290> quite<00:01:35.159> long

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
interior section wasn't quite quite long

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
interior section wasn't quite quite long
enough<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.880> think<00:01:36.290> so<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.540> it<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.900> taped

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
enough I think so here is it all taped

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.030 
enough I think so here is it all taped
up<00:01:40.880> thing<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.329> really<00:01:42.840> large<00:01:45.409> space<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.920> could

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
up thing it's really large space I could

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.440 
up thing it's really large space I could
stick<00:01:47.399> some<00:01:47.640> foam<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.329> something<00:01:49.070> inside<00:01:50.450> but

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
stick some foam or something inside but

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.750 
stick some foam or something inside but
I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.020> want<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.230 

I<00:01:54.820> don't<00:01:55.510> know<00:01:55.630> maybe<00:01:56.200> trim<00:01:56.650> cut<00:01:57.370> this<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:58.180> half

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
I don't know maybe trim cut this in half

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
I don't know maybe trim cut this in half
again<00:01:59.070> and<00:02:00.070> and<00:02:00.640> try<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.940> make<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.780> fit<00:02:01.990> better

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
again and and try to make it fit better

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.340 
again and and try to make it fit better
it's<00:02:03.310> what<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.550> figured<00:02:03.910> out<00:02:04.030> after<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.990> cut<00:02:05.230> it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
it's what I figured out after I cut it

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.650 
it's what I figured out after I cut it
in<00:02:05.410> half<00:02:07.410> is<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.649> if<00:02:08.830> I<00:02:09.070> put<00:02:09.430> one<00:02:10.360> over<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
in half is that if I put one over the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.340 
in half is that if I put one over the
other<00:02:10.980> if<00:02:11.980> will<00:02:12.640> fit<00:02:13.360> nicely<00:02:13.570> especially<00:02:14.230> in

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
other if will fit nicely especially in

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.410 
other if will fit nicely especially in
the<00:02:14.440> bottom<00:02:14.770> because<00:02:15.460> it'll<00:02:15.970> be<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> lot

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the bottom because it'll be a lot

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.800 
the bottom because it'll be a lot
thinner<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.550> you'll<00:02:18.730> it'll<00:02:19.060> have<00:02:19.240> a<00:02:19.270> curve<00:02:19.600> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
thinner so you'll it'll have a curve to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.810 
thinner so you'll it'll have a curve to
it<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.100> gonna<00:02:21.280> use<00:02:21.460> some<00:02:21.490> more

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
it I'm just gonna use some more

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.970 
it I'm just gonna use some more
substantial<00:02:22.510> tape<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.500> tape<00:02:23.650> around<00:02:23.710> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
substantial tape to tape around the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.010 
substantial tape to tape around the
whole<00:02:24.130> thing<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.180> that'll<00:02:25.510> work

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
whole thing and I think that'll work

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.980 
whole thing and I think that'll work
so<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.040> taped<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.550> up<00:02:27.700> quite<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> bit<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.780> it's

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
so I taped it up quite a bit and it's

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.210 
so I taped it up quite a bit and it's
see<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:29.770> it<00:02:29.890> fits<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.490> lot<00:02:31.150> better<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
see you see it fits a lot better and it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.910 
see you see it fits a lot better and it
looks<00:02:33.460> more<00:02:33.850> like<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.450> actual<00:02:34.960> prop<00:02:35.440> that<00:02:35.740> it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
looks more like the actual prop that it

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.520 
looks more like the actual prop that it
or<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.460> mean<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.940> sword<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.570> he<00:02:37.780> should<00:02:37.990> have

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.000 

so<00:02:44.070> I'm<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.910> probably<00:02:45.660> try<00:02:45.990> some<00:02:46.380> paper

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
so I'm going to probably try some paper

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.530 
so I'm going to probably try some paper
mache<00:02:47.430> over<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:47.970> thing

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
mache over this thing

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.430 
mache over this thing
see<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.590> dicks<00:02:50.310> -<00:02:50.610> this<00:02:50.850> might<00:02:51.750> sand<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.350> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
see if it's dicks - this might sand it a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.180 
see if it's dicks - this might sand it a
little<00:02:52.620> bit<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> started<00:02:55.170> using<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:55.980> paper

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
little bit so I started using the paper

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.500 
little bit so I started using the paper
mache<00:02:56.640> on<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:58.470> sheath<00:02:58.770> or<00:02:59.670> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> Dekker

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.240 

what<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.600> do<00:03:03.660> usually<00:03:04.020> don't<00:03:04.680> really<00:03:04.860> know<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
what I do usually don't really know the

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.990 
what I do usually don't really know the
prepper

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
prepper

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.420 
prepper
you<00:03:09.000> know<00:03:09.120> percentages<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.870> flour<00:03:10.800> in<00:03:11.040> Li<00:03:11.280> but

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
you know percentages of flour in Li but

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.690 
you know percentages of flour in Li but
I<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:11.670> use<00:03:11.850> simple<00:03:12.060> flour<00:03:12.480> with<00:03:13.350> water<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:14.190> I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
I just use simple flour with water and I

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.580 
I just use simple flour with water and I
want<00:03:14.880> it<00:03:14.970> pretty<00:03:15.350> thin

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
want it pretty thin

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.780 
want it pretty thin
I<00:03:16.620> don't<00:03:16.920> want<00:03:17.100> super<00:03:17.550> thick<00:03:17.850> paste<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:20.220> this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
I don't want super thick paste so this

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.140 
I don't want super thick paste so this
time<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.090> had<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:22.040> phonebook<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.610> use<00:03:23.790> and

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
time I had a phonebook to use and

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.470 
time I had a phonebook to use and
actually<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.080> phone<00:03:25.320> book<00:03:25.500> paper

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
actually I think the phone book paper

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.449 
actually I think the phone book paper
works<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.570> little<00:03:27.630> bit<00:03:27.870> better<00:03:28.080> than<00:03:28.459> newspaper

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
works a little bit better than newspaper

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.880 
works a little bit better than newspaper
it's<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.420> little<00:03:30.600> thinner<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:33.150> here<00:03:33.890> decided

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's a little thinner so here decided

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.870 
it's a little thinner so here decided
just<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:35.900> two<00:03:36.900> coats<00:03:37.400> right<00:03:38.400> off<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.670> bat

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
just to put two coats right off the bat

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.730 
just to put two coats right off the bat
maybe<00:03:39.270> that's<00:03:39.540> probably<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.900> bad<00:03:40.020> idea<00:03:40.200> but

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
maybe that's probably a bad idea but

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.480 
maybe that's probably a bad idea but
we'll<00:03:41.100> see<00:03:41.280> how<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.550> turns<00:03:41.700> out<00:03:43.370> leave<00:03:44.370> it

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
we'll see how it turns out leave it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.009 
we'll see how it turns out leave it
overnight<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:45.150> then<00:03:45.990> I'll<00:03:46.230> do<00:03:46.550> two<00:03:47.550> more

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
overnight and then I'll do two more

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.910 
overnight and then I'll do two more
probably<00:03:49.019> want<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.200> put<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> little<00:03:49.620> bit<00:03:49.739> more

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
probably want to put a little bit more

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.360 
probably want to put a little bit more
than<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.430> did<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.090> sword<00:03:51.769> here's<00:03:52.769> a<00:03:52.860> sword

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
than I did on this sword here's a sword

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.940 
than I did on this sword here's a sword
with<00:03:54.080> fully<00:03:55.080> dry<00:03:55.290> there<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.450> except<00:03:57.450> was

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
with fully dry there and except was

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.090 
with fully dry there and except was
gesso<00:03:59.780> as<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.900> can<00:04:01.050> see<00:04:01.260> her<00:04:01.350> here<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.650> headed

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
gesso as you can see her here I headed

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.930 
gesso as you can see her here I headed
on<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.450> coat<00:04:03.450> hanger<00:04:04.430> just<00:04:05.430> trying<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.760> finish

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
on a coat hanger just trying to finish

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.100 
on a coat hanger just trying to finish
up<00:04:06.209> bits<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.140> they're<00:04:08.150> fully<00:04:09.150> gesso<00:04:09.780> de

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
up bits and they're fully gesso de

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.440 
up bits and they're fully gesso de
sheath<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:13.010> two<00:04:14.010> or<00:04:14.040> three<00:04:14.160> layers<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.209> gesso

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
sheath put two or three layers of gesso

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.890 
sheath put two or three layers of gesso
now<00:04:16.109> I'm<00:04:16.229> going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.650> start<00:04:17.690> painting<00:04:18.690> with

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
now I'm going to start painting with

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.580 
now I'm going to start painting with
this<00:04:19.229> black<00:04:20.930> hopefully<00:04:21.930> there'll<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.229> enough

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
this black hopefully there'll be enough

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.920 
this black hopefully there'll be enough
it<00:04:22.919> seems

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.450 

to<00:04:27.930> food<00:04:28.140> coats<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.740> then<00:04:28.890> I'll<00:04:29.130> think<00:04:29.400> about

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
to food coats and then I'll think about

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.350 
to food coats and then I'll think about
the<00:04:30.420> accents<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.730> goldfish<00:04:32.730> and<00:04:32.970> on<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
the accents of goldfish and on the

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.700 
the accents of goldfish and on the
actual<00:04:35.540> dagger<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.750> he<00:04:36.900> uses<00:04:37.020> in<00:04:37.230> show<00:04:37.500> and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
actual dagger that he uses in show and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
actual dagger that he uses in show and
such<00:04:37.860> here's<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.700> first<00:04:38.880> layer<00:04:39.300> of<00:04:39.330> black

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
such here's the first layer of black

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.270 
such here's the first layer of black
crow<00:04:41.730> paint<00:04:42.120> I<00:04:44.450> think<00:04:45.450> I<00:04:45.750> might<00:04:46.020> need<00:04:46.350> three

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
crow paint I think I might need three

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.430 
crow paint I think I might need three
coats<00:04:47.580> or<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.150> hopefully<00:04:48.810> they'll<00:04:49.050> be<00:04:49.200> enough

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
coats or so hopefully they'll be enough

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.140 
coats or so hopefully they'll be enough
let's<00:04:50.010> see<00:04:51.200> here<00:04:52.200> is<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.680> fully<00:04:53.070> painted<00:04:53.520> the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
let's see here is it fully painted the

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.380 
let's see here is it fully painted the
black<00:04:54.360> paint<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:55.580> started<00:04:56.580> trying<00:04:56.820> to<00:04:57.060> make<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
black paint I started trying to make the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.230 
black paint I started trying to make the
details<00:04:57.780> using<00:04:58.170> just<00:04:58.620> some<00:04:58.800> simple<00:04:59.010> tape<00:04:59.370> as<00:05:00.180> a

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
details using just some simple tape as a

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.630 
details using just some simple tape as a
guide<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:01.080> can<00:05:01.380> get<00:05:01.500> straight<00:05:01.860> lines<00:05:01.890> for

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
guide so it can get straight lines for

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.870 
guide so it can get straight lines for
the<00:05:02.700> most<00:05:02.880> part<00:05:03.120> let's<00:05:03.900> see<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.620> tape<00:05:04.800> on<00:05:05.040> the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
the most part let's see the tape on the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.910 
the most part let's see the tape on the
top<00:05:06.060> one<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.330> took<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.750> tape<00:05:07.140> off<00:05:07.320> it<00:05:07.620> works

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
top one I took the tape off it works

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.190 
top one I took the tape off it works
decently<00:05:08.400> well<00:05:10.520> here<00:05:11.520> I'm<00:05:11.700> doing<00:05:11.970> more<00:05:12.210> moving

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
decently well here I'm doing more moving

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.910 
decently well here I'm doing more moving
down<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.770> other<00:05:13.830> area<00:05:14.310> it's<00:05:15.120> just<00:05:15.330> kind<00:05:15.840> of

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
down to the other area it's just kind of

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.920 
down to the other area it's just kind of
guesstimating<00:05:16.920> and<00:05:17.160> how<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.700> should<00:05:17.880> look

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
guesstimating and how it should look

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.430 
guesstimating and how it should look
because<00:05:18.930> there's<00:05:19.110> so<00:05:19.230> many<00:05:19.320> different

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
because there's so many different

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.210 
because there's so many different
designs<00:05:20.010> of<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.580> one<00:05:20.790> sheet<00:05:21.750> thing<00:05:22.220> either

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
designs of the one sheet thing either

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
designs of the one sheet thing either
the<00:05:23.370> manga<00:05:23.760> or<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.060> anime<00:05:24.950> so<00:05:25.950> I<00:05:25.980> did<00:05:26.250> his<00:05:26.610> the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240
