00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
 have you got someone else jumped on 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.290
 I have an android screensaver with this 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.340
 the table is that here and so sides 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.340
 how to watch it 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.740
 oh my god you surely won't see it 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.130
 really 3d but eyes in a bunch and to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.439
 tune in here on this 3d right need 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.590
 so at that distance then focus 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.550
 all this is not this horror of such an eye scrap 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.259
 I have not yet seen 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.530
 I have to look from afar now I see three 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:39.989
 d appl all out of the screen but when 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.470
 stand close 3 you see true miracles 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.680
 such up 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.600
 right hand right from the screen got out here they are 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.250
 here they look tablets tablets screens 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.130
 which is possible without putting raw right 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.990
 look let me hold closer 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.320
 will find 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.320
 poems 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.140
 and 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.510
 This is actually a 3d screen. I don't know how. 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.250
 tell you that it is 3d 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.790
 because the picture you are watching is flat 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.170
 I wonder how much this is worth it first 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 3g tablet which i see 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.870
 ask how much is the cost of the project 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.010
 advertising 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.010
 or not only screen 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.930
 she says it 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.930
 at 200 american dollar 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.230
 pumps 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:41.610
 cool yes the sun or looking straight 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.610
 here somewhere before us here flies 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.010
 how is it done interesting 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.979
 below this is probably a project horde or dance 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.530
 and this is some kind of glass which somehow 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.469
 refracts and it seems that the sun is hanging in 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.990
 the air is new, too, again this is not visible 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.890
 it will be necessary to look with two eyes 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.890
 it is also 3 reached 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.769
 and this phone and ideas do not know about 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.769
 written works is not well here 3d tablet 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.700
 shorter from this 3d in my eyes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.700
 all ribbit went further
