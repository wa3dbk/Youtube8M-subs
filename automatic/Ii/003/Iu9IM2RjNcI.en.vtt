thought<00:01:03.480> they're<00:01:03.660> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.960> pretty<00:01:04.110> low

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
thought they're going to be pretty low

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.730 
thought they're going to be pretty low
but<00:01:04.860> they're<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.610> good<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
but they're actually pretty good I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.679 
but they're actually pretty good I
minded<00:01:07.740> um<00:01:08.090> think<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.210> were<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.390> true<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
minded um think they were on true to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.440 
minded um think they were on true to
size<00:01:10.010> they<00:01:11.010> were<00:01:11.070> tight<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.460> first<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.180> just

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
size they were tight at first but I just

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.010 
size they were tight at first but I just
released<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> they<00:01:13.350> were<00:01:13.409> fine<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.890> so

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
released them and they were fine now so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.730 
released them and they were fine now so
that's<00:01:16.020> how<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.470> fit<00:01:18.049> maybe<00:01:19.049> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> have

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740

really<00:01:20.070> wide<00:01:20.280> feet<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.970> might<00:01:21.270> need<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> go
