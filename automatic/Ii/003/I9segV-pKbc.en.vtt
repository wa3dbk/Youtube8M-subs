 the saying perfectionist populated 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.100
 symbolic part of the 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.160
 company philosophy to the claim 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.160
 Just vertical you know yourself that 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.790
 He covered it from wet and neighbors 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.790
 and independent technologies 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.190
 mummy 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.819
 The theme with it currently has 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.850
 very much together with my team 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.170
 tested and no third vehicle for 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 single wheel bigger 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.960
 let big runs through better 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.310
 and offers the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:10.300
 extreme situations 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:14.910
 that is meant when the balance 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.910
 brakes and I quickly go the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.450
 a tire deforms the driver 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:43.170
 bigger wheel of study reform tire 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:48.750
 and resistance reduced pad area 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:52.760
 i'm great heavier for paul nok you 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.760
 several stolle at the same time in use 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.910
 it seemed like I was in one 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:15.510
 advantageous compared to 16 20 inches but rad 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.140
 definitely wrong line just a lot 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.400
 strongly 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.880
 Stiff and agile tom is between dimensions 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.810
 27/2 should've been developed 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.810
 advantage over
