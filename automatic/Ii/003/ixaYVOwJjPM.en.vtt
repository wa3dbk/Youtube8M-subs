00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
what you're getting now this technology

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.730 
what you're getting now this technology
uses<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> colored<00:01:56.009> lens<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.170> meant<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
uses a colored lens and it is meant to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.580 
uses a colored lens and it is meant to
really<00:01:59.100> decrease<00:02:00.060> eye<00:02:00.630> fatigue<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.439> my

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
really decrease eye fatigue this was my

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.690 
really decrease eye fatigue this was my
primary<00:02:02.070> interest<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:03.210> wearing<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:04.079> and

primary interest in wearing these and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.059 
primary interest in wearing these and
the<00:02:05.700> design<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:07.140> surprised<00:02:07.530> me<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.799> didn't

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the design really surprised me I didn't

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.309 
the design really surprised me I didn't
think<00:02:08.190> I'd<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.670> design<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.840> I<00:02:09.869> love

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319

the<00:03:38.580> yellow<00:03:38.910> tint<00:03:39.300> filtering<00:03:39.930> out<00:03:40.080> some<00:03:40.830> of

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
the yellow tint filtering out some of

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.610 
the yellow tint filtering out some of
these<00:03:41.130> sort<00:03:41.460> of<00:03:41.720> rightness<00:03:42.720> of<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.230> screen

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
these sort of rightness of the screen

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.520

now<00:03:44.370> my<00:03:44.760> video<00:03:45.330> is<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.690> didn't<00:03:45.990> suffer<00:03:46.230> in<00:03:46.410> any

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
now my video is in didn't suffer in any

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.830 
now my video is in didn't suffer in any
way<00:03:46.770> with<00:03:47.010> regards<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.850> color<00:03:48.060> accuracy<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.630> did

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
way with regards to color accuracy I did

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.260 
way with regards to color accuracy I did
some<00:03:48.990> photo<00:03:49.290> editing<00:03:49.770> as<00:03:49.920> well<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.340> even<00:03:51.180> when

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
some photo editing as well and even when

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.330 
some photo editing as well and even when
I<00:03:51.300> lifted<00:03:51.720> these<00:03:51.900> up<00:03:52.170> they<00:03:52.740> didn't<00:03:53.040> really

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
I lifted these up they didn't really

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.190 
I lifted these up they didn't really
make<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> difference<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.660> color<00:03:54.900> shift

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
make a difference to the color shift

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.310 
make a difference to the color shift
maybe<00:03:55.530> a<00:03:55.650> tiny<00:03:56.010> bit<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.850> not<00:03:57.420> anything

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
maybe a tiny bit but not anything

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.590 
maybe a tiny bit but not anything
noticeable<00:03:59.130> really<00:03:59.730> I<00:03:59.760> think<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.300> just<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
noticeable really I think that just the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.830 
noticeable really I think that just the
Tim<00:04:00.900> really<00:04:01.770> did<00:04:02.100> help<00:04:02.340> reduce<00:04:02.820> my<00:04:03.120> eye<00:04:03.150> strain

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
Tim really did help reduce my eye strain

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.410 
Tim really did help reduce my eye strain
and<00:04:04.020> I<00:04:04.680> did<00:04:04.890> feel<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.130> lot<00:04:05.370> fresher<00:04:05.640> after

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
and I did feel a lot fresher after

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.090 
and I did feel a lot fresher after
wearing<00:04:06.630> these<00:04:06.870> now<00:04:07.050> they're<00:04:07.230> super<00:04:07.710> light<00:04:07.860> as
