00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.130
 the gigaset brand is mainly in the netherlands 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.750
 known from a dect phones for the 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.460
 land line 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.910
 company is now on the first steps 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.040
 tablet market with the qv830 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.630
 it is an affordable tablet of 8 inches 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.330
 he is not perfect but about it 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.430
 generally it is a great entry-level tablet 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.080
 the gigaset tablet looks a bit different 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.609
 then a standard tablet 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.369
 that is due in the first place to his bubble 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.660
 design of the sides ok you see 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.570
 the top and bottom a chrome 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.800
 finish and all connections and 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.170
 Buttons are at the top 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.700
 you don't see that often , there is 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.320
 also buttons on the side or 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.930
 connections 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.230
 the tablet that only weighs 340 grams 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.770
 thanks to its thin housing and beautiful 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.070
 design 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.210
 yes it is nice to hold him 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.739
 to hold 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.550
 and he just doesn't feel so strong 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.379
 to 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.450
 You certainly don't have the idea that he is each 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.640
 moment falls apart 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.160
 but yes good if your heart presses then 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.160
 you can hear him cracking a bit 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.479
 furthermore there is a black back and yes 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.660
 it is a bit sensitive 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.660
 fingerprints 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.090
 The QV830 has a screen resolution of 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.280
 1024 by 768 pixels which amounts to 160 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.830
 pixels per inch and is not too sharp 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.570
 and you see that during use 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.820
 he is very unfortunate because there is no further 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 much wrong with screen has a good one 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 color rendering and also the viewing angles 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 reasonable 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.960
 however, the maximum brightness is not 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.130
 enough to take the tablet outside without 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.590
 use problems 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.300
 the touch screen is pretty good for one 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.310
 tablet of this price range 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.500
 and therefore the operation never becomes 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 really frustrating the beating heart of it 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.360
 the gigaset consists of a 1.2 gigahertz 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.070
 quadcore processor and 1 gigabyte 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.900
 random access memory 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.670
 he does all tasks without protest and 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.670
 think, for example, of browsing through 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 websites and video playback 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.960
 he only has some problems with the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.700
 run heavy android games 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.870
 the heavy games don't run smoothly 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.470
 enough to really get a hold of 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.929
 to enjoy 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:17.820
 simple games such as candy crush 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:20.340
 he however without a problem on a few 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.190
 apps to the qv830 seems to run on 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.840
 a bare version of android jelly bean 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.420
 This means that there is no own peel 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.060
 sit around it as seen with others 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.459
 Brands tablets, the flexibility in 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.860
 good but don't expect a gigaset 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.930
 specific characteristics in the control 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.730
 of this tablet 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.459
 the storage memory is 8 gigabytes 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.920
 pretty scanty but only 5 gigabytes 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.570
 from over because the operating system and 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.650
 the standard apps also need space 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.420
 to have 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.920
 luckily you can use the storage memory 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.660
 easily expand with a 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.370
 memory card 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.010
 the gigaset doesn't look like it 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.020
 is about the sound and the cameras 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.000
 the tablet has only one speaker and 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.670
 therefore gives mono sound 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.739
 the camera on the back is satisfactory 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.989
 just as quickly an unexpected 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.690
 photo but probably not that he is competing 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.239
 with cameras from smartphones or from 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.550
 cheap compact cameras 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.560
 the front camera meets only 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.489
 for video calling 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.489
 but yes we see that often 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.300
 Well the first user test seems to be the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.760
 battery life of this tablet in the vicinity 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.560
 come from what the manufacturer states 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.010
 means it will last around 8 hours 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.510
 and yes that is certainly not a bad score me 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.690
 how the tablet will actually do it 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.590
 from our comprehensive tablet test 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.060
 in our lab 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.340
 results will be within a few weeks 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.640
 after recording this video 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.560
 expected conclusion gigaset succeeded 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.840
 to get a good 8 inch tablet on the market 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.630
 to put it there you do for a couple 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.180
 tens of fewer 7 inch tablets 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.340
 buy that are almost as good but yes 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.750
 those are not 8 inch tablets and we 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.630
 find the image size that comes with an 8 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.940
 inch tablet type are very fine or 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.099
 better 8 inch tablets on the market but 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.290
 the gigaset is relatively low 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.640
 price tag considering it absolutely 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.260
 worth 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.780
 I am curious what tablet formats 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.280
 did you and why did you choose it 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.600
 are still behind your choice 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.090
 let it know in a comment below this 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.010
 video well you are curious about yourself 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.430
