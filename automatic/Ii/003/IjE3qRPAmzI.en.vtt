00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.920
 hello friends with you raven and this 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.440
 review fights in world of tanks on 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.320
 american server if you saw 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 previous videos that I shot there 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 I promised you that I will show how to play 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.609
 Americans but I made a mistake met 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.550
 on European Americans server I 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.000
 I decided that the developers were driven to one 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.739
 server and americans europeans 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.070
 Now, I basically pointed to this 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.120
 the defect did not make the remark that 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.149
 there is an american server i created 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.829
 your account on the american server you 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.829
 see that here I am still a principle 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.140
 practically in the sandbox so about the very 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.360
 I will not tell you anything here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.170
 tell your impressions american 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.300
 the server on which I am located means that 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.239
 I want to say about the American server 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.729
 First people play here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.210
 little that is, the game is not as popular as 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.330
 she is popular with us the game is not so even 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.010
 popular as it is popular in europe 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.520
 because there is only one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.659
 only server and few people 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.970
 extremely few people moreover very much 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.310
 On the American server they play Russians 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.829
 if you remove the Russians from here in principle 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.590
 it will probably be 25 percent here 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.409
 every fight i go in 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.570
 There are Russian players who are in 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.909
 principle write here was even in this when 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.220
 the man wrote there all the Russians on the left 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.140
 flank and six tanks turned not 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.840
 gone to the left flank yes it says 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.420
 Well, in principle, Russian pretty still 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.450
 could 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.850
 on the American server everyone wanted 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.210
 brought to see how everything is played 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.880
 Wanted to see how the principle plays 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.020
 people from another country and so here 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.259
 we are here 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.460
 they kind of flooded the American 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.470
 the service should look for 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.390
 if you see topping pretty 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.450
 high attached with american 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.610
 servers to play it too much of course 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.720
 interferes in principle you see that no 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.209
 lags and jerks game goes well means 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.560
 what's different here 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.100
 talk about 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.040
 the difference between fights yes is in principle a sandbox 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.090
 it's too early to talk about the difference between fights 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.940
 what I see now is different from 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.630
 European server but very similar to 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.750
 the game in Russian gray bridge effect 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.790
 a large number of Russians here may 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.150
 Basically, the Americans themselves play like this , but 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.190
 here is a special distinction of fights 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.459
 American server from Russian 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.350
 I do not see the server but if the European 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.480
 the server there are Americans when they play 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.880
 more all the same specific tonoan and those 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.709
 same, too, come to drag the Americans 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.519
 who left their server for some reason 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.890
 on European there they are basically here 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.280
 lead the fight he said little capture 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.489
 the base 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.859
 here the principle is well, the game is very, very 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.049
 similar to the Russian server is the only thing 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.519
 here you see no pass chat 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.010
 insults to the player 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.590
 There is no such a skirmish 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.989
 mutual accusations well I don’t know when 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 I'll get out of the sandbox will be there 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.560
 how it goes on well and so 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.090
 principle server and dad your game 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.000
 carry people are basically alike 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.819
 I can still tell you that well, here's more 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.160
 more somehow not viciously passes the game 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.650
 it happens that it passes you there 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.290
 it shoots you 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.230
 you that is critical damage 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.190
 such that you have already been undermined but 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.799
 basically 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.640
 he drives on he throws you rides 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.580
 further he 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.380
 does not finish standing there why so 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.590
 happens I don’t know maybe a player 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.480
 fascinated will be well here so here a few 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.870
 times happened to me when i already 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.420
 I thought that well that's all but the player 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.760
 just drove past me but this here 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.500
 such first impression about american 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.720
 server here you see now 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.600
 practically we already won the wallpaper here 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.669
 especially nothing to say there is already clear 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.540
 what will happen next well this is such a first 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.550
 American server review will play 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.500
 I will continue to develop the machine as 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.440
 you can see how the game is going on 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.010
 with you was a thief everyone thank you all before 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.010
 dating
