00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.650
 more about how do I am happy 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.870
 to meet you again 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.290
 today we will do together 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.370
 the real pastry custard the same as the one 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.570
 that you will buy in your 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.670
 bakery pastry 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.730
 except that you would have done it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
 let's go for the recipe of a 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.090
 start by spreading your dough 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.080
 flaky then obviously if you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.900
 do not have time to do the parity 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.460
 or if it's really too long you have 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.140
 two choices you buy in you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910
 in the trade that works very well where 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.070
 you can also make a paste 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.620
 broken that will also work 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760
 I'm not too much for it 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.250
 the puff pastry is that gives a 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.620
 little crunchy flon you were you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 can not be bad so you spread out your 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.379
 puff pastry you take out a 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.190
 mold to saint thois high enough 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.640
 for that be a flan and enough and 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:57.449
 then we will do as usual 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.010
 as if it was for a hta we are going to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:06.170
 bottom it's just a threshold to 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 nothing complicated in this operation 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.689
 we try to still a pretty dough 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:20.880
 thick so that for the flank to 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:24.299
 hold well do not hesitate to come on the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.409
 put back on the end so it takes a 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.619
 little time we are going to say that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.240
 it's not bad we just remove the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.049
 surplus is this work goes a little bit this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.049
 who stays 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:02:16.630
 and we rework again by coming 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:18.670
 to pass the taste of leaving is even if 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.500
 aesthetically it's not very nice of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.450
 Anyway worry you 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 go put cream to the brim 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:34.989
 so the dough will not be obviously 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:37.510
 with a time to make the dough 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:46.840
 to avoid that they develop 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:49.720
 too much and we'll do it 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.790
 the pastry cream then points for 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.400
 a quantity in his efforts pretty much 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.780
 2 liters of custard League 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.610
 it means it's the 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.510
 preparation and liters of milk has 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.200
 a little more pastry cream 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.260
 kong 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.350
 when you count the eggs and touch 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.549
 who is the one for the recipe with dolly 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.840
 from the east i think about doha a little bit 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.200
 too much but better to have more than 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.900
 not enough 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.769
 so here we go now 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.150
 on pastry cream not that of the 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.440
 can pastry then I do it 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.880
 still more but I will give you 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.420
 the basic recipe that is to say for ali 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:29.140
 of the is so a liter of milk there you 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:33.989
 after 4 hours you need 80 g of 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:39.340
 sugar and finally 100 g of flour of which I 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:42.010
 start again east ali 4 '80 g sugar 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.880
 and 100 g of flour started by making 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.069
 heat violate in a container enough 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.459
 big because we have to add the 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.579
 sweeten the eggs and the flour then 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:59.019
 Mix sugar and them to the 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:02.310
 whiten your yellow superheroes 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:08.469
 have been mixed blending is bleached 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:12.370
 add flour there is just this one 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:14.560
 to mix together and it stops 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.939
 once the whole is fine 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.720
 mix without lumps 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:23.770
 we wait until they are well 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:29.110
 hot once the vote comes up happens to 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:33.669
 boil like here we will drop a 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:37.500
 little bit of fire and we will come back there 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.500
 add the preparation 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.579
 and now will follow a step 

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:46.439
 important 

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:48.929
 we will go the milk preparation to 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:50.519
 boil once these two 

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:51.539
 ingredients will boil that the 

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.489
 cream will be almost ready 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.479
 we'll kill and that's important during 

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:59.189
 five minutes for all the germs 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.569
 the cream begin to arrive at 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:02.159
 boiling 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.449
 it's gone for five minutes of mixing 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.599
 so we can go down a little bit 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.339
 fire can be put on medium heat and 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.499
 mix quietly does not need to 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:12.239
 to panic about traits but it takes 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:14.669
 always to make it turn so 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:16.169
 hysterical false and that this one you 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:19.619
 far too long I tell you at least 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.299
 five minutes bremen is ready 

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.879
 Here it is now to make 

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:25.259
 cool as quickly as possible and 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:27.989
 use it for the cakes you 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:37.649
 want it's the cream in your 

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:40.619
 mold to the brim it takes little 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:44.119
 near 2 2 the two really not of the island 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:54.319
 which will give you almost the soul 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:56.999
 the amount to get to these creams 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:00.329
 go up a little bit to keep up 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:02.429
 everywhere identically and well before you 

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:05.849
 preheat your oven to 200c 

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:08.969
 degrees and then we will write at least 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.769
 an hour but it can go steady 1h15 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.849
 an hour and a half 1 settling in 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:16.049
 cook your end is cooked then you have 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.269
 a small part that is a little bit 

00:06:16.049 --> 00:06:19.619
 more golden but it's normal in she 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:21.659
 wrote baker it will also be like 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:23.819
 that you see that he wipes because 

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:25.739
 as you can see the flank 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:28.589
 to overflow a little bit is a sign that 

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:31.079
 the cream has warmed well to 

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:34.300
 inside it does not matter if you 

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:36.819
 want to unmold leave to cool 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.720
 red 2 1 it takes a little time to 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:43.629
 cool dolls around that 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.750
 who overflowed and then unmount the 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.639
 simply the return does not know more 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:52.440
 complicated than that 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.440
 see you soon on how do we do
