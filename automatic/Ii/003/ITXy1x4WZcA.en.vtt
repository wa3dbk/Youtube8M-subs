template is all you need now for each

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.840 
template is all you need now for each
petal<00:01:09.320> we're<00:01:09.860> going<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.159> need<00:01:10.280> a<00:01:10.340> square<00:01:10.700> of

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
petal we're going to need a square of

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.690 
petal we're going to need a square of
fabric<00:01:11.500> now<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.560> length<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.040> width<00:01:13.250> needs<00:01:13.580> to

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
fabric now the length and width needs to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.760 
fabric now the length and width needs to
be<00:01:13.790> approximately<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.630> same<00:01:14.869> size<00:01:15.229> as<00:01:15.530> the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
be approximately the same size as the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.260 
be approximately the same size as the
template<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:17.840> fold<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.259> in<00:01:18.320> half<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:19.270> we

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
template so we fold it in half and we

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.830 
template so we fold it in half and we
just<00:01:20.450> put<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.750> inside<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.560> template<00:01:22.009> and

gonna pull the thread no not this one
we're<00:03:01.990> gonna<00:03:02.080> pull<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.590> thread<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.070> it

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
we're gonna pull the thread and it

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
we're gonna pull the thread and it
automatically<00:03:04.630> gathers<00:03:05.380> up<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:07.030> petal<00:03:09.960> how

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
automatically gathers up the petal how

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.170 
automatically gathers up the petal how
simple<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:15.190> go<00:03:15.340> perfectly<00:03:15.760> gathered

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
simple is that we go perfectly gathered

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.150 
simple is that we go perfectly gathered
there's<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.720> back<00:03:19.650> there<00:03:20.650> we<00:03:20.740> have<00:03:20.890> it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
there's the back there we have it

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.690 
there's the back there we have it
now<00:03:22.090> we<00:03:22.510> need<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.810> make<00:03:22.959> enough<00:03:23.590> petals<00:03:24.010> for

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700

into the template trim the edge and with
that<00:03:44.050> same<00:03:44.290> needle<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.709> thread<00:03:44.980> in<00:03:45.280> through

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
that same needle and thread in through

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.660 
that same needle and thread in through
number<00:03:46.360> one<00:03:46.570> start<00:03:48.870> as<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.050> can<00:03:50.200> see<00:03:50.670> I've

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
number one start as you can see I've

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.030 
number one start as you can see I've
still<00:03:52.420> got<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.080> petal<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.620> first<00:03:53.830> petal

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
still got the petal the first petal

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.950 
still got the petal the first petal
attached
