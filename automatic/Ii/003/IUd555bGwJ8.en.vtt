00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.460 

okay<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.070> got<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.199> camphor<00:00:16.199> tree

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
okay what we got here is a camphor tree

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.220 
okay what we got here is a camphor tree
and<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.449> tree<00:00:18.630> has<00:00:18.779> been<00:00:18.960> cut

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
and as you can see the tree has been cut

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.679 
and as you can see the tree has been cut
back<00:00:19.800> pretty<00:00:20.369> severely<00:00:20.789> all<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> way<00:00:21.300> around

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
back pretty severely all the way around

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.439 
back pretty severely all the way around
now<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.800> might<00:00:23.039> say<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.029> lousy

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
now one might say that's a really lousy

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.529 
now one might say that's a really lousy
pruning<00:00:25.170> job<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.769> if<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.369> was<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.849> case<00:00:27.090> I

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
pruning job and if that was the case I

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.339 
pruning job and if that was the case I
would<00:00:28.289> agree<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.910> happened<00:00:30.390> was<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
would agree but what happened was this

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.350 
would agree but what happened was this
tree<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.340> look<00:00:32.489> over<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.180> up

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
tree if you look over on the right up

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
tree if you look over on the right up
here<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.170> there's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.469> big<00:00:35.040> dead

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
here you can see that there's a big dead

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.360 
here you can see that there's a big dead
top<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.450> tree<00:00:36.780> has<00:00:36.960> been<00:00:37.170> dying<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.950> way

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
top this tree has been dying all the way

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.540 
top this tree has been dying all the way
around<00:00:38.760> now<00:00:39.660> what's<00:00:39.809> interesting<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.489> you<00:00:41.489> can

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
around now what's interesting is you can

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.160 
around now what's interesting is you can
see<00:00:41.850> there's<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> stump<00:00:42.450> over<00:00:42.629> here<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
see there's a stump over here on the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.740 
see there's a stump over here on the
ground<00:00:43.440> there<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.460> another<00:00:44.850> camper<00:00:45.390> here

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
ground there was another camper here

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.889 
ground there was another camper here
last<00:00:46.230> year<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.250> same<00:00:47.520> size<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
last year the same size as this one and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.200 
last year the same size as this one and
the<00:00:49.559> whole<00:00:49.710> thing<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.100> turned<00:00:50.280> brown<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the whole thing just turned brown the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
the whole thing just turned brown the
whole<00:00:51.390> thing<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:51.780> suddenly<00:00:52.050> died<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:53.399> one

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
whole thing just suddenly died this one

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.880 
whole thing just suddenly died this one
was<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.149> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.449> slower<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.649> it's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
was going a little bit slower so it's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.790 
was going a little bit slower so it's
working<00:00:56.520> its<00:00:56.640> way<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:56.879> from<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> top<00:00:57.809> so

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
working its way down from the top so

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
working its way down from the top so
we're<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> give<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> try<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.420> see

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
we're going to give it a try and see

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.279 
we're going to give it a try and see
what<00:01:00.690> happens

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
what happens

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
what happens
maybe<00:01:02.129> I'll<00:01:02.280> post<00:01:02.520> another<00:01:02.760> video<00:01:03.000> next<00:01:03.359> year

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
maybe I'll post another video next year

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:44.260 
maybe I'll post another video next year
see<00:01:04.379> what<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.650> looks<00:01:04.799> like

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.760 

yeah<00:01:47.420> all<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:48.780> stopped<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.289> this<00:01:49.439> point

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
yeah all right we stopped at this point

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.600 
yeah all right we stopped at this point
and<00:01:51.049> if<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.289> left<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.649> alone<00:01:52.770> we've<00:01:53.250> left<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and if we left it alone we've left a

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.389 
and if we left it alone we've left a
fair<00:01:53.939> amount<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.360> foliage<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
fair amount of foliage on there and it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.389 
fair amount of foliage on there and it
might<00:01:56.549> fill<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.539> made<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.720> discovery

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
might fill in but we made a discovery

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.669 
might fill in but we made a discovery
when<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.520> were<00:01:59.640> looking<00:01:59.759> at<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> tree<00:02:00.679> we

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
when we were looking at the tree we

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.330 
when we were looking at the tree we
recognize<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.220> there's<00:02:02.640> still<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.330> lot<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
recognize that there's still a lot of

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.969 
recognize that there's still a lot of
declining<00:02:05.340> tissue<00:02:05.789> in<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.209> tree<00:02:06.560> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.619> look

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
declining tissue in the tree if you look

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.680 
declining tissue in the tree if you look
at<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.220> piece<00:02:08.489> right<00:02:08.670> here<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.269> see<00:02:09.479> as

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
at this piece right here you can see as

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.530 
at this piece right here you can see as
a<00:02:10.110> real<00:02:10.590> radical<00:02:11.060> discoloration<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
a real radical discoloration this is the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.229 
a real radical discoloration this is the
healthy<00:02:12.900> wood<00:02:13.110> over<00:02:13.260> here<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.849> the

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
healthy wood over here and this is the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.420 
healthy wood over here and this is the
defining<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> diseased<00:02:17.130> wood

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
defining way this is the diseased wood

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.120 
defining way this is the diseased wood
so<00:02:18.269> as<00:02:18.480> this<00:02:18.690> continues<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.500> spread<00:02:19.799> down

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
so as this continues to spread down

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.569 
so as this continues to spread down
through<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.640> trunk<00:02:21.170> then<00:02:22.250> even<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.340> stuff

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
through the trunk then even the stuff

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.979 
through the trunk then even the stuff
that<00:02:23.730> has<00:02:23.880> active<00:02:24.269> tissue<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.750> going<00:02:24.780> to

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
that has active tissue is going to

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.710 
that has active tissue is going to
continue<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.500> get<00:02:25.769> infected<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.720> will

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
continue to get infected and will

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.180 
continue to get infected and will
decline<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:30.480> upper<00:02:30.780> canopy<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.799> were<00:02:32.069> able

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
decline so the upper canopy we were able

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.370 
decline so the upper canopy we were able
to<00:02:32.370> make<00:02:32.519> most<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> cuts<00:02:33.239> back<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.780> good

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
to make most of the cuts back to good

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.069 
to make most of the cuts back to good
solid<00:02:34.799> green<00:02:35.010> tissue<00:02:35.510> but<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.690> next<00:02:36.959> thing

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
solid green tissue but the next thing

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.069 
solid green tissue but the next thing
that<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.319> want<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:37.799> is<00:02:38.790> going<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.180> be<00:02:39.359> to<00:02:39.870> cut

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
that I want to do is going to be to cut

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.840 
that I want to do is going to be to cut
it<00:02:40.200> even<00:02:40.590> harsher<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.400> lot<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.670> this

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
it even harsher because a lot of this

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.759 
it even harsher because a lot of this
still<00:02:42.209> has<00:02:42.390> some<00:02:42.630> problems<00:02:43.019> up<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:43.230> has<00:02:43.590> some

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
still has some problems up here has some

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.960 
still has some problems up here has some
problems<00:02:44.250> over<00:02:44.510> here<00:02:45.510> has<00:02:45.750> some<00:02:45.930> problems<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
problems over here has some problems and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.309 
problems over here has some problems and
before<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.090> do<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:48.389> we're<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.049> go<00:02:49.139> get

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
before we do it we're going to go get

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.559 
before we do it we're going to go get
some<00:02:49.470> Lysol<00:02:49.889> and<00:02:50.220> spray<00:02:50.459> down<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.329> one

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
some Lysol and spray down the one

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.030 
some Lysol and spray down the one
chainsaw<00:02:52.139> that<00:02:52.290> we're<00:02:52.410> going<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.590> use<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.920> make

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
chainsaw that we're going to use to make

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.270 
chainsaw that we're going to use to make
these<00:02:53.250> harsh<00:02:53.549> cuts<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.780> hopes<00:02:55.109> of<00:02:55.350> minimizing

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
these harsh cuts in hopes of minimizing

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.240 
these harsh cuts in hopes of minimizing
the<00:02:56.459> spread<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.510> disease<00:02:57.709> through<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the spread of the disease through the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:10.539 
the spread of the disease through the
pruning<00:02:59.549> tool

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.949 

so<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.670> back<00:03:11.879> up<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.269> tree<00:03:12.299> again<00:03:12.689> with<00:03:12.930> a

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
so it back up in the tree again with a

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.759 
so it back up in the tree again with a
sterilised<00:03:13.739> chainsaw<00:03:14.639> and<00:03:15.620> hopefully<00:03:16.620> all

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
sterilised chainsaw and hopefully all

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.069 
sterilised chainsaw and hopefully all
the<00:03:16.889> cuts<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:17.219> we<00:03:17.370> make<00:03:17.659> we're<00:03:18.659> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.959> be

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
the cuts that we make we're going to be

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.839 
the cuts that we make we're going to be
entirely<00:03:19.709> into<00:03:20.459> sound<00:03:22.129> uninfected<00:03:23.129> wood<00:03:23.549> I

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
entirely into sound uninfected wood I

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.839 
entirely into sound uninfected wood I
would<00:03:24.450> take<00:03:24.599> it<00:03:24.749> down<00:03:24.780> pretty<00:03:25.730> significant<00:03:26.730> I

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
would take it down pretty significant I

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.559 
would take it down pretty significant I
would<00:03:27.000> probably<00:03:27.209> go<00:03:27.510> about<00:03:31.819> yes<00:03:32.819> right<00:03:33.329> there

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
would probably go about yes right there

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.839 
would probably go about yes right there
yes<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.219> tree<00:03:35.430> is<00:03:35.519> going<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:35.669> look<00:03:35.730> really

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
yes the tree is going to look really

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.629 
yes the tree is going to look really
harsh<00:03:36.599> but<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.680> don't<00:03:37.889> do<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.219> then<00:03:38.519> we're

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
harsh but if we don't do it then we're

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.690 
harsh but if we don't do it then we're
not<00:03:38.730> going<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:38.939> get<00:03:39.060> past<00:03:39.329> those<00:03:40.700> infected

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
not going to get past those infected

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:54.140 
not going to get past those infected
areas<00:03:42.769> even<00:03:43.769> that's<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.189> crapshoot<00:03:52.310> yeah<00:03:53.310> he<00:03:53.790> is

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
areas even that's a crapshoot yeah he is

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.050 
areas even that's a crapshoot yeah he is
still<00:03:54.359> some<00:03:54.510> discoloration<00:03:55.079> in<00:03:55.439> here

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.820 

I<00:03:58.239> think<00:03:58.780> maybe<00:03:58.959> if<00:03:59.080> we<00:03:59.170> take<00:03:59.290> another<00:03:59.440> foot

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
I think maybe if we take another foot

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.110 
I think maybe if we take another foot
off<00:03:59.920> I'll<00:04:00.160> do<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.400> from<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.640> ladder<00:04:02.910> how's<00:04:03.910> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
off I'll do it from the ladder how's it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:17.470 
off I'll do it from the ladder how's it
look<00:04:04.209> up<00:04:04.390> there

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.300 

yeah<00:04:18.480> for<00:04:18.750> balancing<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.560> people<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.130> blow

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
yeah for balancing and people that blow

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.270 
yeah for balancing and people that blow
off<00:04:20.459> over<00:04:20.669> there<00:04:20.970> Harshman<00:04:21.690> we're<00:04:22.019> doing<00:04:22.350> I'm

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
off over there Harshman we're doing I'm

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.930 
off over there Harshman we're doing I'm
afraid<00:04:23.639> if<00:04:23.730> we<00:04:23.820> don't<00:04:24.030> do<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.360> we

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
afraid if we don't do it we

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.820 
afraid if we don't do it we

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:44.700 
there it is that's what it looks like
when<00:04:44.090> it's<00:04:44.240> done

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
when it's done

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.240 
when it's done
and<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.980> looks<00:04:46.190> like<00:04:46.250> crap<00:04:47.980> don't<00:04:48.980> see<00:04:49.130> any

other options and like I said before

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.570 
other options and like I said before
this<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.530> not<00:04:51.680> something<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.340> would<00:04:52.490> ever

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
this is not something I would ever

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.660 
this is not something I would ever
recommend<00:04:53.740> and<00:04:54.740> it'll<00:04:54.920> be<00:04:54.980> real<00:04:55.160> easy<00:04:55.190> for<00:04:55.640> a

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
recommend and it'll be real easy for a

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.130 
recommend and it'll be real easy for a

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
Saratoga Tree Service they sure butcher

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.540 
Saratoga Tree Service they sure butcher
their<00:04:59.210> trees<00:04:59.650> well<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:01.130> only<00:05:01.280> other<00:05:01.460> option

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
their trees well the only other option

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.270 
their trees well the only other option
is<00:05:01.910> you're<00:05:02.270> cutting<00:05:02.450> Pam<00:05:03.130> clients<00:05:04.130> is

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
is you're cutting Pam clients is

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.100 
is you're cutting Pam clients is
attached<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:04.940> tree<00:05:05.150> so<00:05:05.180> this<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.810> like<00:05:05.960> an

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
attached to the tree so this is like an

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.160 
attached to the tree so this is like an
absolute<00:05:06.830> last<00:05:07.250> ditch<00:05:07.520> effort<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:09.050> we'll

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
absolute last ditch effort and we'll

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.420 
absolute last ditch effort and we'll
check<00:05:09.320> it<00:05:09.470> out<00:05:09.530> next<00:05:09.710> year<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.040> see<00:05:10.280> what

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
check it out next year and see what

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.780 
check it out next year and see what
happens<00:05:10.870> but<00:05:11.870> in<00:05:12.770> essence<00:05:13.160> it's<00:05:13.340> just<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.610> big

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
happens but in essence it's just a big

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.590 
happens but in essence it's just a big
Bush

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.260 

okay<00:05:17.470> now<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:17.920> realize<00:05:18.520> that<00:05:18.790> there's<00:05:19.000> going<00:05:19.210> to

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
okay now I realize that there's going to

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.360 
okay now I realize that there's going to
be<00:05:19.330> an<00:05:19.510> awful<00:05:20.260> lot<00:05:20.290> of<00:05:20.470> controversy<00:05:21.280> about

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
be an awful lot of controversy about

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.400 
be an awful lot of controversy about

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.480 
to the chapter on verticillium wilt and
this<00:05:31.750> particular<00:05:32.440> book<00:05:32.680> is<00:05:32.890> the<00:05:33.040> one<00:05:33.190> that<00:05:33.340> I

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
this particular book is the one that I

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.290 
this particular book is the one that I
often<00:05:34.330> refer<00:05:34.660> to<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:36.030> what<00:05:37.030> we're<00:05:37.180> dealing

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
often refer to and what we're dealing

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.070 
often refer to and what we're dealing
here<00:05:37.690> with<00:05:37.750> is<00:05:38.730> verticillium<00:05:39.730> is<00:05:40.120> according

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
here with is verticillium is according

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.420 
here with is verticillium is according
to<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.230> books<00:05:41.440> a<00:05:41.730> soil<00:05:42.730> borne<00:05:43.030> fungus<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:44.430> it

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
to the books a soil borne fungus and it

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.550 
to the books a soil borne fungus and it
spreads<00:05:45.760> up<00:05:45.940> through<00:05:46.240> the<00:05:46.390> xylem<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.200> tree

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
spreads up through the xylem of the tree

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.550 
spreads up through the xylem of the tree
and<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.010> lodges<00:05:48.550> itself<00:05:48.730> in<00:05:49.360> upper<00:05:50.140> sections

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
and it lodges itself in upper sections

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.730 
and it lodges itself in upper sections
of<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.800> tree<00:05:51.070> and<00:05:51.510> in<00:05:52.510> doing<00:05:52.720> so<00:05:53.140> it<00:05:53.410> says

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
of the tree and in doing so it says

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.020 
of the tree and in doing so it says
according<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.820> this<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:55.420> the<00:05:55.810> spread<00:05:56.230> is<00:05:57.030> the

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
according to this that the spread is the

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.850 
according to this that the spread is the
upward<00:05:58.240> spread<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:58.990> verticillium<00:05:59.470> and

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
upward spread of the verticillium and

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.550 
upward spread of the verticillium and
the<00:05:59.950> xylem<00:06:00.400> as<00:06:00.610> described<00:06:01.060> above<00:06:01.260> has<00:06:02.260> been

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
the xylem as described above has been

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.660 
the xylem as described above has been
studied<00:06:02.980> etc<00:06:03.520> etc<00:06:03.610> and<00:06:04.480> it<00:06:04.780> seems<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.670> lodge

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
studied etc etc and it seems to lodge

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.050 
studied etc etc and it seems to lodge
itself<00:06:06.940> and<00:06:07.600> work<00:06:07.900> its<00:06:08.110> way<00:06:08.290> upward<00:06:08.680> so<00:06:09.070> while

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
itself and work its way upward so while

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.170 
itself and work its way upward so while
what<00:06:10.360> we're<00:06:10.510> doing<00:06:10.930> is<00:06:11.400> not<00:06:12.400> a<00:06:12.430> cure<00:06:12.850> for<00:06:13.060> the

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
what we're doing is not a cure for the

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.010 
what we're doing is not a cure for the
verticillium<00:06:14.220> hopefully<00:06:15.220> we<00:06:16.180> can<00:06:16.570> slow<00:06:16.990> it

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
verticillium hopefully we can slow it

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.730 
verticillium hopefully we can slow it
down<00:06:17.170> significantly<00:06:17.730> by<00:06:18.730> cutting<00:06:19.060> out<00:06:19.210> the

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
down significantly by cutting out the

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.760 
down significantly by cutting out the
infected<00:06:20.740> areas<00:06:21.460> to<00:06:21.820> a<00:06:21.850> point<00:06:22.240> where<00:06:22.720> we<00:06:23.590> no

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
infected areas to a point where we no

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.000 
infected areas to a point where we no
longer<00:06:23.800> have<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.640> spores<00:06:25.290> lodged<00:06:26.290> in<00:06:26.740> the

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
longer have the spores lodged in the

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.220 
longer have the spores lodged in the
tissue<00:06:27.280> and<00:06:27.820> hopefully<00:06:28.480> the<00:06:28.840> tree<00:06:29.050> will

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
tissue and hopefully the tree will

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.760 
tissue and hopefully the tree will
sucker<00:06:29.500> out<00:06:29.800> and<00:06:30.630> sprout<00:06:31.630> some<00:06:32.110> new<00:06:32.290> foliage

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
sucker out and sprout some new foliage

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.060 
sucker out and sprout some new foliage
to<00:06:33.520> sustain<00:06:33.970> it<00:06:34.180> as<00:06:34.360> well<00:06:35.200> basically<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.860> big

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
to sustain it as well basically a big

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.900 
to sustain it as well basically a big
Bush<00:06:36.310> so<00:06:37.620> that's<00:06:38.620> what<00:06:38.770> we're<00:06:38.860> trying<00:06:39.070> like<00:06:39.760> I

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:39.910 
Bush so that's what we're trying like I

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.630 
Bush so that's what we're trying like I
said<00:06:40.150> this<00:06:40.300> is<00:06:40.510> an<00:06:40.660> experiment<00:06:41.260> I've<00:06:42.250> done<00:06:42.520> it

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
said this is an experiment I've done it

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.990 
said this is an experiment I've done it
before<00:06:42.760> in<00:06:43.000> the<00:06:43.060> past<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.660> I've<00:06:44.290> had

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
before in the past and I've had

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.570 
before in the past and I've had
different<00:06:46.000> degrees<00:06:46.270> of<00:06:47.130> positive<00:06:48.130> results

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
different degrees of positive results

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.150 
different degrees of positive results
some<00:06:48.880> negative<00:06:49.360> it's<00:06:50.080> like<00:06:50.680> I<00:06:50.710> said<00:06:51.010> before

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
some negative it's like I said before

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.020 
some negative it's like I said before
it's<00:06:51.430> a<00:06:51.490> crapshoot

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
it's a crapshoot

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.840 
it's a crapshoot
the<00:06:52.420> client<00:06:52.810> wants<00:06:53.050> to<00:06:53.110> try<00:06:53.320> it<00:06:53.350> so<00:06:53.850> that's

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
the client wants to try it so that's

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.410 
the client wants to try it so that's
where<00:06:55.000> I<00:06:55.060> stand

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
where I stand

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.870 
where I stand
