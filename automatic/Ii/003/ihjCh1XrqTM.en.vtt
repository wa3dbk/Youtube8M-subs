00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180

got<00:00:45.510> an<00:00:45.989> break<00:00:46.530> early<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> fourth<00:00:47.280> and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
got an break early in the fourth and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.389

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
no breaks in the fifth we managed to

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.939

break<00:00:54.539> at<00:00:55.190> 13<00:00:56.190> or<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.020> finish

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
break at 13 or so we can we can finish

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.020 
break at 13 or so we can we can finish
15<00:00:59.370> 13<00:00:59.730> but<00:01:00.440> besides<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.949> slow<00:01:02.219> start<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
15 13 but besides that the slow start I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.190 
15 13 but besides that the slow start I
think<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.439> match<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.739> us<00:01:06.200> we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
think was a pretty good match for us we

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.840 
think was a pretty good match for us we
just<00:01:07.229> try<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> focus<00:01:07.799> on<00:01:08.159> what<00:01:08.610> has<00:01:08.820> been

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
just try to focus on what has been

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.359 
just try to focus on what has been
working<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.630> us<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> try<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> stay

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
working for us so you try to stay

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
working for us so you try to stay
present<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.240> those<00:01:12.420> strategies

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
present with with those strategies

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.510 
present with with those strategies
rather<00:01:13.290> than<00:01:13.530> thinking<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.369> you're

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
rather than thinking that all you're

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
rather than thinking that all you're
serving<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.990> stay<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> match<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.979> try

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
serving to to stay in the match you try

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
serving to to stay in the match you try

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to focus on what's been working and what

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
to focus on what's been working and what
kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.740> strategy<00:01:20.220> you'd<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.640> execute

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
kind of strategy you'd like to execute

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.660 
kind of strategy you'd like to execute
at<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> time<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.830> try<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> keep<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> momentum

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
at the time and try to keep the momentum

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.539 
at the time and try to keep the momentum
of<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.390> you've<00:01:24.990> had<00:01:25.140> holding<00:01:25.799> served<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.310> far

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
of that you've had holding served so far

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.530 
of that you've had holding served so far
once<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> gets<00:01:27.330> far<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> fifth<00:01:28.259> set

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
once it gets far in the in the fifth set

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.510 
once it gets far in the in the fifth set
but<00:01:30.540> yeah<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:30.840> uh<00:01:31.159> least<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.310> that's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but yeah that's uh least that's that's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.030 
but yeah that's uh least that's that's
my<00:01:32.700> frame<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.240> mind<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.290> but

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
my frame of mind going into it and but

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
my frame of mind going into it and but
it's<00:01:35.159> tricky<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> same<00:01:36.600> time<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.930> saved

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
it's tricky we at the same time we saved

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
it's tricky we at the same time we saved
a<00:01:37.350> match<00:01:37.530> point<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.310> late<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> in

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
a match point there at late in the in

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.700 
a match point there at late in the in
the<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.380> fifth<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.079> yea<00:01:43.079> though<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.500> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
the in the fifth and yea though so it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.109 
the in the fifth and yea though so it's
very<00:01:43.979> close<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.399> mean<00:01:44.549> match<00:01:44.700> could<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.970> gone

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
very close I mean match could have gone

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.310 
very close I mean match could have gone
either<00:01:45.149> way<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
either way but that was kind of the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
either way but that was kind of the
mindset<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> fifth<00:01:47.490> set<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:48.360> haven't

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
mindset in the fifth set we haven't

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.590 
mindset in the fifth set we haven't

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
it's tough at the beginning you we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
know it could be a long one well I think

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.400

who just obviously repair played that
match<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.610> then<00:02:55.700> try<00:02:55.849> to<00:02:55.910> rest<00:02:56.209> as<00:02:56.390> much<00:02:56.420> as

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
match and then try to rest as much as

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.809 
match and then try to rest as much as
you<00:02:56.750> can<00:02:56.930> because<00:02:57.200> from<00:02:58.190> here<00:02:58.250> or<00:02:58.430> not<00:02:58.519> it<00:02:58.670> only

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
you can because from here or not it only

you can because from here or not it only
gets<00:02:59.030> tougher<00:02:59.180> than<00:02:59.480> matches<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
gets tougher than matches and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.940 
gets tougher than matches and
competition<00:03:01.280> gets<00:03:01.459> obviously<00:03:02.000> steeper<00:03:02.599> and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
competition gets obviously steeper and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.170 
competition gets obviously steeper and
you're<00:03:03.950> gonna<00:03:04.040> need<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.370> be<00:03:04.489> fresh<00:03:04.760> playing

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
you're gonna need to be fresh playing

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.759 
you're gonna need to be fresh playing
knowing<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:05.959> these<00:03:06.019> matches<00:03:06.380> could<00:03:06.560> take

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
knowing that these matches could take

knowing that these matches could take
that<00:03:06.980> long<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:08.120> try<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.330> take<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.540> easy

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750
