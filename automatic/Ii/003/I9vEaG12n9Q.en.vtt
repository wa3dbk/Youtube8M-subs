00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.570
 I'm going to spend the heat of battle now 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.860
 has spent all the fun and we 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.350
 we meet again with the brothers 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.609
 yes, that's good, so we'd like 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.310
 ask them now after he has 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:21.500
 past all this fuss that feels 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.089
 Pablo with the gut full after 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.339
 eat already after all the nerves 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.609
 initials how how is everything going 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.609
 you feel 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.850
 which now is much better 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.850
 but that with a bittersweet taste 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.410
 I think it could have come a little 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.440
 more especially with the one he had and 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.710
 with the short stack that was in the 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.710
 table 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.170
 although it is true that the first four 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.230
 especially in the last two they 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.329
 they deserved that position 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.100
 they are very great players are 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.030
 great known players 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.030
 internationally 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.710
 and they deserved it they deserved to be in 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.540
 first and second position in fact 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.400
 now I just found out that marcelo the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 Brazilian boy has been third with 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.390
 which is another deserved position 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.270
 of the great Brazilian perhaps that more war 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 I have given you of all of them it was Paul not 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.160
 which you immediately have the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160
 left 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.820
 we see that we have grown sorry 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.220
 we have managed to double us with kings 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.440
 you know 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.980
 and in the next hand we have played another 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.980
 against him 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.760
 and he has caught us is a color runner 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.700
 runner and it has totally destroyed us 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.930
 but totally good are the trips of the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 poker 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.050
 what projects do you have now what is 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.420
 next thing you're going to play next 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.950
 tournament 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.930
 now for the moment to rest a little 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.040
 of tournaments also I think it's over 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.920
 Now the season here in Barcelona 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.380
 of stars and all that so of 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.060
 At the moment we do not have plans 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.649
 the valence of course that the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.939
 we will play in failures I suppose they will 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.810
 because they always do it by sea 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.160
 gabriel and barcelona assurance barcelona 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.709
 I believe that next year is one of 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.360
 the published visits that we are going to have 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.680
 if I believe that if people love 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.480
 the city is very good and as not the 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.970
 tournament is as big as you can 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.670
 play and that's where most good players will 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.230
 can see is a little festival 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.180
 Exactly it's not a tournament it's a festival 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.829
 of poker barcelona 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.560
 and I can ask what are you going to do with what 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.810
 what have you won 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.810
 still does not know what is not clear 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.480
 a part for for the partner is that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.480
 I think I got a pinch 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.830
 a part to be able to do that is very 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.659
 important that you will reserve a part 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.269
 for future tournaments and for futures 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.769
 pokemon projects and the rest is not 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.580
 he knows where he's going to be destined but 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.650
 sure it ends in a good sign yes 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.390
 safe 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.920
 waste it is not going to waste the 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.530
 money we have never liked we are not going to 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.030
 be great, well, nothing 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.040
 said thank you very much for your 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.290
 time hopefully return to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.939
 find us in future events and much 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 luck for all we count many 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.290
