keep<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:11.880> from<00:01:12.060> getting<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.510> baron<00:01:12.869> yeah<00:01:13.380> I

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
keep them from getting that baron yeah I

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.630 
keep them from getting that baron yeah I
think<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.130> time<00:01:14.430> though

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
think you have a little more time though

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.070 
think you have a little more time though
I<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.750> they'd<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.049> a

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I think you know they'd have a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
I think you know they'd have a
clairvoyant<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.710> did<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> couple<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
clairvoyant so you did have a couple of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
clairvoyant so you did have a couple of
rockets<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:19.110> he<00:01:19.170> had<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
rockets out there I think he had the

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.990 
rockets out there I think he had the
ability<00:01:19.500> who<00:01:19.890> sort<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> wait<00:01:20.310> another<00:01:20.549> four<00:01:20.939> or

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
ability who sort of wait another four or

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.340 
ability who sort of wait another four or
five<00:01:21.210> seconds<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.659> wait<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:21.869> another<00:01:22.080> cool

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
five seconds they wait for another cool

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.570 
five seconds they wait for another cool
down<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.799> have<00:01:22.890> another<00:01:23.009> possible<00:01:23.400> spot

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
down if you have another possible spot

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.950 
down if you have another possible spot
for<00:01:23.729> example<00:01:24.030> he<00:01:24.119> would<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.390> killed<00:01:24.540> Jarvan

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
for example he would have killed Jarvan

situation<00:03:02.020> because<00:03:02.320> CLG<00:03:03.130> are<00:03:03.310> pointing<00:03:03.670> that

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
situation because CLG are pointing that

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.850 
situation because CLG are pointing that
pill<00:03:04.000> count<00:03:04.240> on<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.480> this<00:03:04.600> time<00:03:04.870> doing<00:03:05.470> as<00:03:05.560> much

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
pill count on to this time doing as much

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.370 
pill count on to this time doing as much
damage<00:03:05.920> as<00:03:06.460> a<00:03:06.520> physique<00:03:06.970> we<00:03:07.120> can<00:03:07.360> they<00:03:07.990> are<00:03:08.140> all

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380

five guys actually still around that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.100 
five guys actually still around that
area<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.720> definitely<00:03:11.410> doable<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:13.150> for<00:03:13.600> TSM

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110

the<00:03:24.490> TSM<00:03:25.060> side<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.630> maybe<00:03:26.080> CLG<00:03:26.560> will<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:26.800> able

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
the TSM side so maybe CLG will be able

here<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.950> tea<00:03:48.130> is<00:03:48.160> I'm<00:03:48.340> going<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.489> go<00:03:48.580> for<00:03:48.730> a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
here the tea is I'm going to go for a

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.310 
here the tea is I'm going to go for a
push<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.090> mid<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.420> might<00:03:49.630> turn<00:03:49.810> into<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:50.050> base

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
push in mid this might turn into a base

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.350 
push in mid this might turn into a base
race<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.800> think<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> base<00:03:51.459> raised<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:51.880> seal<00:03:52.150> G

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
race I think the base raised that seal G

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.400 
race I think the base raised that seal G
could<00:03:52.540> win<00:03:52.690> then<00:03:52.840> we've<00:03:52.959> already<00:03:53.080> feel<00:03:53.320> that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
could win then we've already feel that

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.580 
could win then we've already feel that

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
unfortunately at DC it a little bit of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.660 
unfortunately at DC it a little bit of
 which<00:04:12.260> was<00:04:12.379> happening<00:04:12.739> there<00:04:12.920> but<00:04:12.950> big

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
 which was happening there but big

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.800 
 which was happening there but big
cut<00:04:13.819> off<00:04:13.910> he<00:04:14.030> gets<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.239> credit<00:04:14.360> for<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.629> kill

and<00:04:15.019> looks<00:04:15.500> like<00:04:15.620> i<00:04:15.650> GT<00:04:15.890> said<00:04:16.070> will<00:04:16.250> recall

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
and looks like i GT said will recall

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.310 
and looks like i GT said will recall
back<00:04:17.060> so<00:04:17.389> that<00:04:17.419> trait<00:04:17.870> was<00:04:17.989> actually<00:04:18.230> really

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
back so that trait was actually really

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.289 
back so that trait was actually really
good<00:04:18.470> for<00:04:18.590> CLG<00:04:18.859> they<00:04:19.400> got<00:04:19.549> a<00:04:19.579> more<00:04:19.880> important

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
good for CLG they got a more important

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.879 
good for CLG they got a more important
turret<00:04:20.600> kill<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.930> they're<00:04:21.049> still<00:04:21.410> pushing<00:04:21.769> in

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
turret kill and they're still pushing in

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.620 
turret kill and they're still pushing in
right<00:04:22.070> now<00:04:22.220> actually<00:04:22.400> they're<00:04:22.729> still<00:04:23.090> doing

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
some great things in your TSM should be

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.219 
some great things in your TSM should be
ready<00:04:25.370> for<00:04:25.520> this<00:04:25.610> but<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.120> great<00:04:26.630> animal<00:04:26.930> i'm

up<00:07:22.809> winning<00:07:23.020> that<00:07:23.139> fight<00:07:23.469> really<00:07:23.529> is<00:07:24.009> like<00:07:24.249> a

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:24.279 
up winning that fight really is like a

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:25.890 
up winning that fight really is like a
chain<00:07:24.849> of<00:07:24.879> kills<00:07:25.210> went<00:07:25.419> after<00:07:25.539> the<00:07:25.629> other<00:07:25.749> for

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
chain of kills went after the other for

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.799 
chain of kills went after the other for
about<00:07:25.960> five<00:07:26.199> minutes<00:07:26.379> straight<00:07:27.569> well<00:07:28.569> I<00:07:28.599> think

00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:28.809 
about five minutes straight well I think

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:30.629 
about five minutes straight well I think
the<00:07:29.050> main<00:07:29.229> point<00:07:29.469> from<00:07:29.680> CLG<00:07:30.159> point<00:07:30.460> of<00:07:30.550> view

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
the main point from CLG point of view

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:31.920 
the main point from CLG point of view
was<00:07:30.819> you<00:07:31.089> know<00:07:31.180> they<00:07:31.300> have<00:07:31.479> called<00:07:31.749> keep

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
pushing down on that top lane managed to

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.779 
pushing down on that top lane managed to
take<00:07:34.629> out<00:07:34.810> that<00:07:34.990> in<00:07:35.139> a<00:07:35.229> toilet<00:07:35.409> so<00:07:35.789> that's

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:36.789 
take out that in a toilet so that's

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.790 
take out that in a toilet so that's
something<00:07:37.060> in<00:07:37.330> that<00:07:37.409> inhibits<00:07:38.409> are<00:07:38.499> now<00:07:38.620> going
