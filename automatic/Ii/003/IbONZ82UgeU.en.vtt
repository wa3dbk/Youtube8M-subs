00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.010
 unique 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.419
 k 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.160
 the few months this all this is your preparation for the demo 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.359
 driver multiplayer 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.009
 I intend to do it 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.659
 strong multiplayer experience 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.109
 you need to recover essential data 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 and no failure can be 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.740
 you will evolve on the horizon map 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.270
 the action takes place on the roofs of new york 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.000
 so watch out for dizziness 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.560
 you're going to be faced with a lot of different terrains identify the 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.890
 observation posts and throttling points 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.220
 if you want to stay alive 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.340

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.460
 watch out this is the element who want to change the course of a battle 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.070
 each soldier has an ultra sophisticated combination 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.660
 it is equipped with a nanotechnology which increases your 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.580
 combat abilities 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.840
 pulled the trigger too much sauce to activate your opinion 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590
 which allows you to cash in more damage 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.550
 but also to provoke more 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.330
 Nanocombination can post your moves 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.750

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.580

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.530
 Warning 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.020
 it can hurt a lot 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.290
 if the action becomes too frenetic pressed on prb to go into mode 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.260
 stealthy 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 and discreetly gaining ascendancy over his opponent 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 the stealth mode is as enjoyable as it looks 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.480

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.480
