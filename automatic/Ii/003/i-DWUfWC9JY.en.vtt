these<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:15.780> not<00:00:15.929> stickers<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.680> they<00:00:17.460> won't

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
these are not stickers so they won't

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.790 
these are not stickers so they won't
stick<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> laminate<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> did<00:00:19.410> was

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
stick to the laminate so what I did was

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.179 
stick to the laminate so what I did was
added<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.520> little<00:00:20.789> piece<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.270> adhesive<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.189> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
added a little piece of adhesive and the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.160 
added a little piece of adhesive and the
type<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.640> used<00:00:23.850> from<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> back<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.720> these

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
type that I used from the back of these

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.080 
type that I used from the back of these
owls<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:26.689> who's<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.840> there<00:00:31.309> and<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> like

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
owls is who's out there and what I like

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:58.530 
owls is who's out there and what I like
to<00:00:33.210> do<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.690> leave<00:00:34.320> enough<00:00:34.860> space<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:36.530> each<00:00:37.530> end

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.700 

then<00:00:59.170> you<00:00:59.350> just<00:00:59.620> run<00:00:59.980> into<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:01.410> laminator<00:01:02.410> I

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
then you just run into the laminator I

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.290 
then you just run into the laminator I
have<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.130> set<00:01:03.370> at<00:01:03.579> 3<00:01:05.580> sometimes<00:01:06.580> I'll<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.119> it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
have it set at 3 sometimes I'll have it

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.420 
have it set at 3 sometimes I'll have it
at<00:01:07.420> 5<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.869> guess<00:01:08.290> it<00:01:08.470> depends<00:01:08.830> on<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.220> thickness

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
at 5 I guess it depends on the thickness

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:35.980 
at 5 I guess it depends on the thickness
of<00:01:09.729> the<00:01:09.880> paper<00:01:10.060> or<00:01:10.630> the<00:01:10.690> sticker

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.990 

and<00:01:36.530> I'll<00:01:36.650> run<00:01:36.830> there<00:01:36.980> one<00:01:37.100> more<00:01:37.310> time<00:01:37.340> and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
and I'll run there one more time and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:02:05.160 
and I'll run there one more time and
I'll<00:01:38.270> run<00:01:38.420> it<00:01:38.480> this<00:01:38.720> way

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.170 

I'm<00:02:05.710> just<00:02:05.920> letting<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:06.280> cool<00:02:06.490> before<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.939> pick

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
I'm just letting it cool before I pick

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.540 
I'm just letting it cool before I pick
it<00:02:07.330> up<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.750> doesn't<00:02:07.780> warp<00:02:11.280> now<00:02:12.280> I'm<00:02:12.370> going

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
it up so it doesn't warp now I'm going

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.070 
it up so it doesn't warp now I'm going
to<00:02:12.610> go<00:02:12.700> ahead<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:12.970> pause<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.300> video<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:13.780> I

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:03.630 

I<00:02:56.629> add<00:02:57.439> a<00:02:57.920> little<00:02:57.950> bit<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.430> hot<00:02:58.760> glue<00:02:58.909> first

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.960 

then<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.670> ask<00:03:05.360> some<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:07.329> e6000<00:03:08.329> glue<00:03:09.970> it's

then I ask some of this e6000 glue it's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.670 
then I ask some of this e6000 glue it's
kind<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.420> messy<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.019> what<00:03:12.140> I<00:03:12.200> do<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:12.650> just

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
kind of messy so what I do is I just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.500 
kind of messy so what I do is I just
twirl<00:03:13.159> it<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.940> stops<00:03:15.159> pouring<00:03:16.159> out<00:03:16.510> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
twirl it so it stops pouring out and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:24.280 
twirl it so it stops pouring out and
then<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.290> course<00:03:18.319> at<00:03:19.010> your<00:03:21.790> paperclip<00:03:22.819> I<00:03:23.290> do

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
then of course at your paperclip I do

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.720 
then of course at your paperclip I do
this<00:03:24.530> I<00:03:24.769> kind<00:03:24.950> of<00:03:25.040> wiggle<00:03:25.819> it<00:03:25.939> around<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.269> little

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
this I kind of wiggle it around a little

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.030 
this I kind of wiggle it around a little
I<00:03:30.280> turn<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.370> over<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.609> make<00:03:31.790> sure<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.150> it<00:03:32.390> is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
I turn it over to make sure it it is

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.780 
I turn it over to make sure it it is
straight<00:03:34.239> line<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.109> then<00:03:37.069> I'll<00:03:37.489> go

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
straight line and it is then I'll go

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.899 
straight line and it is then I'll go
ahead<00:03:37.909> and<00:03:38.090> add<00:03:38.209> some<00:03:38.239> more<00:03:39.639> of<00:03:40.639> this<00:03:41.090> glue<00:03:42.909> on

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
ahead and add some more of this glue on

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.339 
ahead and add some more of this glue on
top<00:03:44.150> like<00:03:45.139> so<00:03:46.030> then<00:03:47.030> I'll<00:03:47.209> grab<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.690> felt<00:03:47.930> and

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
top like so then I'll grab the felt and

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.940 
top like so then I'll grab the felt and
just<00:03:48.889> cover<00:03:49.549> that<00:03:49.639> area<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.329> squeeze<00:03:50.950> and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
just cover that area and squeeze and

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.690 
just cover that area and squeeze and
push<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.340> down<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:54.099> the<00:03:55.099> way<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.250> push<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.670> down

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
push it down and the way I push it down

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.289 
push it down and the way I push it down
is<00:03:56.269> I<00:03:57.280> push<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.400> down<00:03:58.609> on<00:03:58.639> the<00:03:58.909> edges

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
is I push it down on the edges

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.550 
is I push it down on the edges
surround<00:03:59.659> the<00:03:59.780> edge<00:03:59.900> that's<00:04:00.109> not<00:04:00.319> in<00:04:00.470> the

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
surround the edge that's not in the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.409 
surround the edge that's not in the
middle<00:04:00.799> because<00:04:01.069> if<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.280> put<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.760> if<00:04:02.060> you<00:04:02.239> push

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
middle because if you put it if you push

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.780 
middle because if you put it if you push

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
pressure in the middle all that glues

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:16.990 
pressure in the middle all that glues
can<00:04:04.910> end<00:04:05.239> up<00:04:05.299> seeping<00:04:05.780> out<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.199> sides

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.830 

and<00:04:17.660> that's<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.860> then<00:04:19.040> what<00:04:19.160> I'll<00:04:19.280> do<00:04:19.519> is

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
and that's it and then what I'll do is

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.390 
and that's it and then what I'll do is
I'll<00:04:20.840> let<00:04:21.110> it<00:04:21.260> sit<00:04:21.620> for<00:04:23.380> four<00:04:24.380> hours<00:04:24.800> or<00:04:24.980> so<00:04:25.040> and

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
I'll let it sit for four hours or so and

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.210 
I'll let it sit for four hours or so and
let<00:04:25.730> it<00:04:25.880> dry<00:04:26.060> and<00:04:26.300> a<00:04:26.870> 1-star<00:04:27.320> dry<00:04:27.500> and<00:04:28.070> then

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
let it dry and a 1-star dry and then

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.070 
let it dry and a 1-star dry and then
what<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.460> do<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:29.410> I'll<00:04:30.610> check<00:04:31.610> them<00:04:31.760> to<00:04:31.970> see<00:04:32.690> that
