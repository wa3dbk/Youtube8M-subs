00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.880
 hello friends of android apps the day of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.100
 today we bring two applications of wallace 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.440
 They are to optimize the battery 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.560
 Android phones and good are very 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.050
 basic and improve what is the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.620
 Battery performance of the phone and 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.440
 the durability and good the first one 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.059
 call cosmos country this option the 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.790
 we can find completely free 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:39.239
 in what is place thor and simply 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.570
 for this being the application's interface 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.950
 3 what is a Kleenex or a draft 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.490
 cache 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.600
 but what is the optimizer and brings the 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.660
 ok ok block usually what I 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.420
 more I occupy these two the optimizer 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.190
 of the battery that is being here new 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.910
 data of three options that that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.340
 balanced the power sep and the end that 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.710
 in extreme mode are three options that 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.530
 we can choose so that the 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.930
 phone 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.979
 improve what in your performance in the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.369
 battery and at the same time it could 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.470
 disconnect some some this 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.119
 corrections that we have here or that in 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.899
 balanced since nothing else I told you 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.690
 disconnect what is the wifi and the 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.220
 3g data because to say them well in what 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.200
 it's the power saga 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.530
 does not connect us number also we 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.590
 disconnected that wifi 3g and also 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.830
 you have the option to close 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.060
 some applications that we do not have or 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:53.050
 that are running in the background and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.390
 well and what is the extreme option that 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.710
 is the last one that is the one that I use 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.940
 It is 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.780
 It is for this phone to go 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.520
 say it as it is off 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.880
 but then nothing more would follow 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.520
 running what is called 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.380
 and messages or anything else it is 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.810
 disconnect and disconnect it by 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.080
 call it that and you just have to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.319
 learn here where it says on off and change 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.969
 what is left in this way 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.439
 select any of these three 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.909
 options as I say to me so 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.100
 regular works me pretty well what 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.340
 it's the end 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.010
 it does not work perfect there is here says 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.050
 combustion here also give us the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.870
 options that we have left of life in what 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.470
 it's called music in videos on youtube 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.540
 or see a browser on web page 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.840
 we select anyone and here below we 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.610
 encourages how much time we have to do 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.570
 perform this any of these 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.890
 ok ok options as I tell you this is 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.420
 optional any any option 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.120
 which is left to select from here then if 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.120
 you already decide I choose what is 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.040
 extreme and good option simply because 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.860
 select what you want ok 5 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.740
 Now we're going to pay it because we do not 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.420
 we are going to occupy at that moment that 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.670
 we simply press here by clicking 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.640
 attack that says 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.440
 and good now where it says 3 final 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:31.290
 here it erases what is the cache of the 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:33.880
 phone or delete let's say this some 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.060
 When memory does not live 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.670
 we simply give him here in the clan 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.950
 now that they ask us to select all 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.060
 the options that we want to eliminate 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.060
 we select the first 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.100
 we mark it all and we give it in erase 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.390
 one click for this application to be 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.630
 do your work 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.630
 ok and we hope another guy that to that 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.410
 free memory and that phone render 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.300
 better runs runs better ok now 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.950
 let's check what is the second 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.900
 option that on the other hand I also 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.060
 he liked it pretty good it's already said that 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.430
 he freed us this 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.860
 055 we have open by calling him from that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.350
 shape 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.739
 and well the second option is called wish 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.870
 defend battery that is also 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.260
 it works quite well and how are you 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.340
 There are enough options on Google Play 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.190
 I just chose up to two because 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.650
 I give in pretty well ok here in 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.840
 predefined settings we are fanned 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.360
 three options that is balanced 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.090
 advanced advanced extreme aggressive 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.100
 which is the same as the application 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.350
 before, we can modify it to 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.880
 our taste and here below gives us a 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.990
 small review of what each one does 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.270
 okay 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.210
 here a way have activated so that 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.810
 light and here select the one 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.390

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.570
 Well, here is a short review of 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.630

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:09.540
 nothing else you give in confirm 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.880
 and start doing the configuration as 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.630
 I say to you this check there for 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.620
 that for you to choose which option 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.950
