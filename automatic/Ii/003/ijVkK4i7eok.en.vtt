00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 Good day to all today I 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.230
 show how to get rid of wheezing windows 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.039
 7 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.949
 I had this problem after that 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.340
 as i reinstalled wasp xp did not install 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:32.460
 I read all the food a lot of forums 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.559
 the problem is still not very long 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.070
 combined a couple of ways so 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.020
 look 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.020
 power control panel 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.019
 so here we see plans 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.550
 performance means 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.239
 balanced all usually costs 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.359
 save energy and we are choosing high 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.530
 performance 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:06.259
 that is, we spend energy on 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:13.509
 performance is clear further so 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:13.509
 device manager control panel 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.580
 something slows down 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:35.609
 looking for these controllers here and here 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:37.740
 see here these are from the hearth you 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.060
 I will tell in brief 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.840
 if the advanced parameters are worth 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.130
 mode is not Dima, I PR 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.119
 put a tick here with the action we 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:56.200
 click ok the same here and here 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.560
 did not work wheezing left delete everything 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.340
 these channels click ok my case 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.840
 cancel I donâ€™t need it asks for 300 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.200
 restart the computer we explode 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.450
 cancellation also remove most 2 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.110
 my case again is cancellation because 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.799
 already done you click ok asking 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.940
 reboot push cancel and already wing 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:26.700
 Dorothy the last channel them and make 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:33.010
 have hands and restart your computer 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.569
 windows 7 and install the driver on 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.060
 your audio devices 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:41.829
 and everything should work fine after them 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.870
 and the way that I did not use 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:47.160
 because thank god the wheezing was gone 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.639
 after i did this 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.169
 last way is hell again the panel 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:57.760
 device manager control 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:01.889
 Stage method is manual installation. 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.889
 I'll show you the drivers now 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.730
 again the same controllers and so on 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:14.340
 all channels properties driver click 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:21.810
 remove 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:25.390
 click ok click men men principle this 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.280
 similar to removing the device just 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.690
 after removing the systems all by itself 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.209
 throws out you only remove the driver 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.329
 the device disappears from the list you put 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:46.450
 Drivers must update these 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:53.099
 devices will appear again there in general then 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:53.099
 it all did not help me it worked 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:00.480
 I think you too will help everyone thanks for 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.480
 view everyone good luck everyone bye
