things like not be falling behind I've

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.890 
things like not be falling behind I've
gotten<00:02:17.550> some<00:02:17.940> advice<00:02:18.090> from<00:02:18.390> older<00:02:18.690> dancers

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
gotten some advice from older dancers

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.260 
gotten some advice from older dancers
and<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.740> means<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.580> lot<00:02:20.610> because<00:02:20.940> you're<00:02:21.150> like

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
and that means a lot because you're like

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.020 
and that means a lot because you're like
okay<00:02:21.600> like<00:02:21.840> I'm<00:02:21.990> not<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> only<00:02:22.440> one<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.880> know

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
okay like I'm not the only one you know

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.210 
okay like I'm not the only one you know
who's<00:02:24.540> been<00:02:24.720> through<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.500> obviously

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
who's been through this like obviously

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.520 
who's been through this like obviously
but<00:02:26.490> sometimes<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.030> feels<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:27.530> injury

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
but sometimes it feels like that injury

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.860 
but sometimes it feels like that injury
is<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.800> part<00:02:29.100> of<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.250> dancers<00:02:29.670> life<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.660> because

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
is a part of a dancers life just because

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.870 
is a part of a dancers life just because
of<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.080> physical<00:02:31.590> nature<00:02:31.800> what<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.220> do<00:02:32.430> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
of the physical nature what we do and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.670 
of the physical nature what we do and
that<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> wear<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.810> tear<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.440> fact<00:02:34.620> that

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
that the wear and tear and the fact that

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.420 
that the wear and tear and the fact that
what<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.920> do<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:36.230> unnatural<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.980> body<00:02:38.190> was

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
what we do is unnatural the body was

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.250 
what we do is unnatural the body was
never<00:02:38.580> meant<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.390> in<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> first<00:02:40.050> position

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
