00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hi guys here today and today's video 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 super fast to answer a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.230
 super constant question in comments 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.389
 which I always respond in comments 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 But how many people are asking me? 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.290
 I decided to make the definitive video of 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 my shelf 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.670
 Actually, I'm going to answer questions to 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
 where I bought one 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.449
 Do you think that I understood 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 shop does not buy in store is to do 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.730
 this moment because I think 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 buying a store is not very advantageous 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.630
 first that are not so functional 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.850
 generally has these parts that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.200
 very large and not worth much already 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.260
 that the biggest book that we have this 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.680
 here I do not know how much is kind hqz thing 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.510
 so it's worth it but with the base 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.280
 The book of this size is not worth it. 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.289
 buy because they usually come here 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.870
 more or less knows that the instant then 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.360
 Why am I going to waste so much time? 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.579
 space on the shelves could be 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 one more shelf and that's another 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.539
 disadvantage has few shelf 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.620
 usually on shelves that sell in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.480
 then you better have it done than 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 You can do it as you want. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.299
 and I think it 's cheaper for me to be 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.700
 cheaper 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.100
 even when I bargained I bargained 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 the carpenter charged a little more expensive 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
 when my dad got me to buy one 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 bit cheaper but again when 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 negotiate this is cheaper than if I 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 to buy with a bookcase in the store and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.689
 the material was better because 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 pregnant women who are sold in stores 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.799
 or slightly weaker material and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.540
 can usually bend to the shelf 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.189
 leaves short because if the wood is not 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.049
 so strong I asked that this wood 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.659
 it was a little bit bigger like that 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.630
 mdf a little bit thicker to power 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.130
 hold the weight of books 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.040
 so now I'll show you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.470
 more or less what is the measure of each 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.790
 part of my shelf in total has 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:50.100
 2 and 10 high with 7 shelves 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.530
 to each column of the institution four 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 columns column rope this has 73 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.140
 centimeters wide each shelf 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.759
 It's 27 centimeters tall I think 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.700
 only if a little bigger here should have 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.490
 a 29 this up here but others have 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.960
 27 cm and 30 cm 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.179
 depth this is another characteristic 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.850
 because there the students who are 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.760
 usually 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.010
 two stores it 's a little bit deeper 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.300
 there for me this advantage since in the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.280
 truth still preferred it to be a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.680
 a little closer because only here the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.720
 I do not have as much advantage in leaving 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.130
 ornament on my shelf despite having 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.690
 many faults and you will see 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.310
 Good like I said I had to do the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.140
 first I had to make one later I sent 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.260
 make another column and then I sent 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.750
 do this from here that's where they are two 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.570
 in one are not separated and by 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.100
 example that is 350 reais but I 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.930
 I think I liked my father more than 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.750
 able to make a great price because 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.470
 when I bought only this column here 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.200
 was 280 later when it was ready as 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.630
 Professional nikon 188 face-to-face 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.340
 then it is more or less these prices that 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.140
 I paid in my bookshelf I think 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.880
 worth it because only city 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.950
 small and always someone who knows the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.570
 and is super simple is not a 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.360
 thing you're going to do that make a 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.950
 auto the projects and it will get good has 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.260
 people who can do it for very dear 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.690
 it's there then it's worth researching and 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.390
 sometimes it's much better to do it 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.670
 so simple because it buys in store and the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.020
 stores is generally more expensive and more case 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.250
 I will not make a shock because I know 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.450
 you are asking me a lot 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.590
 because I intend to do this when I go 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.750
 change I do when I have everything 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.700
 organized then I 'll just do it 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.710
 now a quick time very quickly 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.630
 Even for you, they have more or less to warn. 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.730
 in the months before children only appear in the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.000
 background then I find it cooler French 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.000
 come on 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.760
 haha ha 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.850
 for these people I hope they have 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.310
 I wish you had a lot of questions. 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.110
 of you if you have more doubts 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.910
 leave in the comments that maybe 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.350
