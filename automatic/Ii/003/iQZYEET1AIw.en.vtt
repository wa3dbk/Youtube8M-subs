00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.120
 I am a back this is my review 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.509
 number 20 and this time I bring 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.470
 the figure of the low sentinel we are going to 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.560
 start with the review 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:23.560
 so let's measure the figure well stop 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 19 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.829
 38 centimeters 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.630
 is the highest figure of the sides 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.580
 what I like about this figure 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.280
 unlike other versions that I've 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.830
 seen from marvel universe is that this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.890
 figure is made for collectors 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.100
 what do you mean by this I want to 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.850
 say that the other figures make noises 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.200
 lights or whatever and this figure then it 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.240
 put together 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.460
 buying other figures that have a 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.950
 piece to put it together so I say that this 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.040
 It is a collector's figure 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.760
 well let's start with the review 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.690
 We can see 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.690
 head 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.550
 it will not be totally 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.350
 very 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.380
 up slightly downward from 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 the sides move a lot the shoulders 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.470
 a little bit limited mature people is 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.470
 totally possible precisely for what 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.440
 figure 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.320
 in the elbows 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 I have done a little work 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:07.170
 the waist and the back turn completely 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.170
 the back and also his waist 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.530
 louis 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.760
 in their legs they have double point of 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.760
 joint 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.160
 and can see how this figure is seen 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.120
 very well articulated not all figures 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.120
 can they do that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.850
 the three then a little bit of movement 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.150
 nothing else is like a species like the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150
 blood sausage 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.200
 the hands if they move darling 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.650
 the show 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.900
 close moves and these tentacles are 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.900
 to grab your enemies 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.390
 so is 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.540
 Spain 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.990
 he is a very sought-after figure 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.000
 the details on the back 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.510
 the painting is very well very well 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.510
 achieved 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.770
 very father is not 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.670
 if those with several sentries the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.860
 my respect, because it is a 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.290
 bit difficult to get everything more but 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.140
 Well, it's a great figure 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.900
 Well I hope you're good to you 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.280
 have encouraged to get the figure not 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.280
 it will be so zero see you in the next
