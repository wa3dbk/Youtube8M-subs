00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.210
 friends friends today we are going to make a mass 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.210
 for pizza 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.490
 that is not the purest in the world but 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.420
 it's my pizza dough and I also have 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.450
 three or four 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.850
 more more let's start with this and little 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.890
 little yes and we are the most basic 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.550
 the simplest 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.000
 I already have 500 grams of strength flour 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.739
 is with which the bread is made and how 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.800
 You can see he has put in a bowl I 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.460
 made a little hole in the center and here 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.059
 I'm going to put 300 milliliters of water 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.059
 tempered 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.040
 and that a little bit of Latin has gone by 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.860
 now followed by charente that also 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.650
 40 grams of oil that was passed a 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.350
 I've done this a little bit and well 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.120
 tell you that here I have put 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.750
 30 grams of yeast 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.210
 30 grams of baking powder of which 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.460
 pastry is used I have raisins with 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.350
 this yeast and with the recorder 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.870
 baker the next one that makes you either 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.460
 with baker's yeast but now 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.120
 that the gentleman is because this is very 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.690
 simple very basic and surely it's going 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.050
 to like it 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.950
 I think everyone but good 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.740
 you will see as yes 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.079
 well you just have to move on 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.090
 massa to happen in this case I'm 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:51.360
 simply mixing the flour with the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.140
 water and now I will directly put 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.140
 oil 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.460
 good olive oil I put 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 refined 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.739
 the virgin olive oil if you like it is 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.330
 awaited stronger because he uses them 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.430
 also this case 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.930
 I do not mind giving him this one because it's a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.930
 worth more neutral flavor 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.970
 Well now I just have to 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.069
 happen to happen to happen and then already when 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.020
 have it higher and you will see how 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.990
 it remains for you to see the next step 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.370
 Well, I'm finishing, I have 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.320
 to put about 30 more granites of flour 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.330
 so he finishes catching the texture and 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.830
 about 4 grams of salt that moved 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.310
 tell you that I had also put it 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.890
 because it is in the most basic mass that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.890
 I know for pizzas this now I'm not going 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.500
 to have one hour resting in an area 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:01.020
 tempered of the house 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:04.460
 and then, as you well understand, 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.430
 I'm going to use it by making a pizza 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.680
 it followed here are the good fijaros 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.770
 texture that has stuck to the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.690
 finger but it is released very easily 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.820
 it is important this detail does not have to 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.860
 be like other masses you remember 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.850
 with you that has to be separated from 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.820
 finger this one in particular good friends 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
 because time has passed have passed is 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:32.610
 is oriented said that I had to 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.260
 pass and here you have the mass to speak 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.700
 simply because it'll cut me 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.920
 gives for two pizzas 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.770
 I had cut it so you can see how 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:46.270
 it would be the previous 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.550
 and there you have it well back and with a 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.370
 extraordinary university presence with 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.220
 a little more 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.650
 and serious is good because those mass for 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.250
 pizzas 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.020
 I want to tell you what I'm going to do 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.510
 now but you can imagine it true 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.100
 you will see and you will see because there is 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.100
 I think sign come on then
