previous tutorial john explained the
overall<00:00:10.440> concept<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.280> scale<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.849> how<00:00:12.210> it

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
overall concept of scale and how it

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.330 
overall concept of scale and how it
relates<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.960> size<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.620> an<00:00:13.740> architectural

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
relates the size of an architectural

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.339 
relates the size of an architectural
plan<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:15.120> dimensions<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> real<00:00:16.110> world

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
different size drawings so the first

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.150 
different size drawings so the first
thing<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
thing that you have to do is you have to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940 
thing that you have to do is you have to
figure<00:00:44.610> out<00:00:44.730> which<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.870> scales<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
figure out which of the scales on the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
figure out which of the scales on the
ruler<00:00:47.280> you're<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.850> going<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.059> use<00:00:48.239> in

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
ruler you're actually going to use in

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.840 
ruler you're actually going to use in
relation<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.379> drawing<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> our<00:00:50.430> drawing

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
relation to your drawing and our drawing

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.600 
relation to your drawing and our drawing
is<00:00:51.120> 1/4<00:00:51.899> inch<00:00:52.110> equals<00:00:52.410> 1<00:00:52.829> foot<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.309> what<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
is 1/4 inch equals 1 foot so what that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.760 
is 1/4 inch equals 1 foot so what that
means<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> for<00:00:54.420> every<00:00:54.600> quarter<00:00:55.199> inch<00:00:55.469> on

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
means is that for every quarter inch on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.369 
means is that for every quarter inch on
our<00:00:56.280> plan<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> equal<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.539> 1<00:00:57.840> foot<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
our plan it is equal to 1 foot in

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
our plan it is equal to 1 foot in
reality<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> very<00:00:59.640> first<00:00:59.879> thing<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.149> have

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
reality so the very first thing we have

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
reality so the very first thing we have
to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:01.230> find<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.770> scale<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.969> ruler

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to do is to find that scale on the ruler

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
to do is to find that scale on the ruler
itself<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.840> come<00:01:04.050> in<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.470> look<00:01:04.739> here

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
itself so come in and have a look here

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.640 
itself so come in and have a look here
and<00:01:05.160> you'll<00:01:05.670> notice<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.229> ruler

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
and you'll notice that on the ruler

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.380 
and you'll notice that on the ruler
there<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.220> all<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> these<00:01:08.670> different<00:01:09.240> numbers

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
there are all of these different numbers

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.270 
there are all of these different numbers
on<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> edges<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.470> like<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.860> said<00:01:11.070> there<00:01:11.250> are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
on the edges and like I said there are

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.850 
on the edges and like I said there are
12<00:01:11.640> different<00:01:11.909> scales<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> ruler<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.770> if

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
12 different scales on this ruler but if

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640 
12 different scales on this ruler but if
you<00:01:13.979> look<00:01:14.220> onto<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> ends<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.510> see<00:01:15.810> what

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you look onto the ends you will see what

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.679 
you look onto the ends you will see what
the<00:01:16.830> scale<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.520> particular<00:01:18.090> end<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the scale of a particular end of the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.350 
the scale of a particular end of the
ruler<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.740> says<00:01:19.950> 1/8<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:21.150> one

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
ruler is and this one says 1/8 this one

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.890 
ruler is and this one says 1/8 this one
says<00:01:21.570> 1/2<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> says<00:01:23.220> 1<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.689> one

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
says 1/2 this one says 1 and this one

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.130 
says 1/2 this one says 1 and this one
says<00:01:25.140> 1/4<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> our<00:01:26.670> scale<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.330> our<00:01:27.600> drawing<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
says 1/4 and our scale of our drawing is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.940 
says 1/4 and our scale of our drawing is
1/4<00:01:28.799> inch<00:01:29.009> equals<00:01:29.310> 1<00:01:29.759> foot<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
1/4 inch equals 1 foot so we know that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.609 
1/4 inch equals 1 foot so we know that
this<00:01:32.220> 1/4<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> side<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.079> ruler<00:01:34.439> that

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
this 1/4 is the side of the ruler that

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
this 1/4 is the side of the ruler that
we<00:01:34.890> need<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.610> that's<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.970> very<00:01:36.270> most

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
we need to use so that's the very most

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.870 
we need to use so that's the very most
important<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
important thing that you have to do the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.490 
important thing that you have to do the
second<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.810> have<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.259> able<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
second thing is you have to be able to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
second thing is you have to be able to
figure<00:01:41.100> out<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.640> use<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.329> measurements

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
figure out how to use the measurements

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
figure out how to use the measurements
and<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> increments<00:01:43.829> on<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.250> ruler<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and the increments on the ruler and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.160 
and the increments on the ruler and
relate<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> drawing<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:45.960> I'm<00:01:46.020> going

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
relate them to the drawing so I'm going

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.149 
relate them to the drawing so I'm going
to<00:01:46.229> show<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.070> you're

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
to show you how to do that so you're

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
to show you how to do that so you're
gonna<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> come<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.670> closer<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
gonna have to come in closer and this is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.780 
gonna have to come in closer and this is
where<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.110> have<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.590> your<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.460> Eagle

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
where you have to use your your Eagle

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.510 
where you have to use your your Eagle
eyes<00:01:50.939> because<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.750> very<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.350> small<00:01:52.710> but

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
eyes because it's very very small but

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.980 
eyes because it's very very small but
I'm<00:01:53.610> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> show<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.030> first<00:01:54.659> thing<00:01:54.899> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I'm going to show you first thing you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.649 
I'm going to show you first thing you
need<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.140> do<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.590> need<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> find<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.250> zero

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
need to do is you need to find the zero

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.240 
need to do is you need to find the zero
because<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> zero<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.320> where<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.649> start<00:01:59.040> to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
because the zero is where you start to

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.160 
because the zero is where you start to
measure<00:01:59.460> from<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.030> you'll<00:02:00.450> notice<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
measure from and you'll notice that on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620 
measure from and you'll notice that on
an<00:02:01.320> architect's<00:02:01.890> scale<00:02:02.159> unlike<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> regular

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
an architect's scale unlike a regular

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.420 
an architect's scale unlike a regular
ruler<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.350> zero<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> end<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
ruler the zero is not at the end it's

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.509 
ruler the zero is not at the end it's
actually<00:02:05.549> kind<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.479> about<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.429> centimeter<00:02:08.429> or

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
actually kind of about a centimeter or

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.100 
actually kind of about a centimeter or
so<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.329> end<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> ruler<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so in from the end of the ruler and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.690 
so in from the end of the ruler and
that's<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.560> starting<00:02:10.950> point<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that's the starting point so what that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.270 
that's the starting point so what that
means<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.690> everything<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.800> left<00:02:14.040> of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
means is that everything to the left of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.930 
means is that everything to the left of
the<00:02:14.430> ruler

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
the ruler

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.570 
the ruler
these<00:02:15.930> lines<00:02:16.350> here<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.010> see<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> number

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
these lines here and you see the number

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.900 
these lines here and you see the number
two<00:02:17.750> those<00:02:18.750> are<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.590> foot<00:02:19.980> increments<00:02:20.340> so

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
two those are one foot increments so

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.360 
two those are one foot increments so
that's<00:02:21.090> two<00:02:21.450> feet<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:22.440> four<00:02:22.920> feet<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that's two feet that's four feet and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.900 
that's two feet that's four feet and
that's<00:02:24.120> six<00:02:24.510> feet<00:02:24.750> these<00:02:25.740> small<00:02:26.310> little<00:02:26.550> half

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
that's six feet these small little half

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.800 
that's six feet these small little half
lines<00:02:27.800> represent<00:02:28.800> six<00:02:29.160> inch<00:02:29.430> increments<00:02:30.210> so

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
lines represent six inch increments so

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.830 
lines represent six inch increments so
everything<00:02:31.470> to<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> left<00:02:32.130> of<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.580> zero<00:02:32.840> reads

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
everything to the left of the zero reads

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.500 
everything to the left of the zero reads
in<00:02:34.110> one<00:02:34.620> foot<00:02:34.950> increments<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.610> six<00:02:36.270> inch

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
in one foot increments and six inch

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.450 
in one foot increments and six inch
increments<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.530> number<00:02:37.770> here<00:02:37.950> would<00:02:38.340> be

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
increments so this number here would be

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.030 
increments so this number here would be
five<00:02:38.730> feet<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.810> number<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.440> would<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.770> four

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
five feet this number here would be four

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.280 
five feet this number here would be four
foot<00:02:41.250> six<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.720> first<00:02:42.930> thing<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
foot six so that's the first thing the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.660 
foot six so that's the first thing the
second<00:02:43.680> thing<00:02:43.710> that<00:02:43.920> you<00:02:44.010> need<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.220> know<00:02:44.460> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
second thing that you need to know is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.930 
second thing that you need to know is
that<00:02:45.180> everything<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.990> right<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> zero

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
that everything to the right of the zero

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.550 
that everything to the right of the zero
represents<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.420> inch<00:02:48.720> increments<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.410> this

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
represents one inch increments and this

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.220 
represents one inch increments and this
is<00:02:49.740> where<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:51.230> supersonic

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
is where you have to have supersonic

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.680 
is where you have to have supersonic
eyes<00:02:52.410> because<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.220> marks<00:02:53.700> are<00:02:53.940> extremely

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
eyes because these marks are extremely

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.990 
eyes because these marks are extremely
small<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.380> each<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:55.980> those<00:02:56.160> two<00:02:56.700> scale

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
small but each one of those two scale

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120 
small but each one of those two scale
represents<00:02:57.300> an<00:02:57.780> inch<00:02:58.080> so<00:02:58.680> you<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:58.920> actually

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
represents an inch so you can actually

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.370 
represents an inch so you can actually
measure<00:02:59.520> at<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.880> quarter-inch<00:03:00.210> scale<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:01.110> to

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
measure at a quarter-inch scale down to

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.950 
measure at a quarter-inch scale down to
the<00:03:01.470> inch<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.070> three<00:03:02.520> inches<00:03:02.640> 6<00:03:03.570> inches

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
the inch so that's three inches 6 inches

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.130 
the inch so that's three inches 6 inches
9<00:03:04.710> inches<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.370> 12<00:03:05.820> inches<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.690> now<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:06.900> we

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
9 inches and 12 inches so now that we

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.500 
9 inches and 12 inches so now that we
know<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.350> let's<00:03:07.800> try<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> measure<00:03:08.550> something

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
know that let's try to measure something

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.360 
know that let's try to measure something
in<00:03:09.630> our<00:03:09.720> plan<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.350> figure<00:03:10.710> out<00:03:10.830> how<00:03:10.950> big<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.280> is

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
in our plan and figure out how big it is

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.590 
in our plan and figure out how big it is
so<00:03:11.610> what<00:03:11.760> we're<00:03:11.880> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.030> measure<00:03:12.240> is<00:03:12.480> we're

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
so what we're going to measure is we're

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.210 
so what we're going to measure is we're
going<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.750> measure<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.500> dining<00:03:13.860> room<00:03:13.980> table

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
going to measure the dining room table

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.850 
going to measure the dining room table
because<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.600> good<00:03:16.290> easy<00:03:16.500> thing<00:03:16.830> to

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
because it's a good easy thing to

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.410 
because it's a good easy thing to
measure<00:03:17.070> because<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.550> rectangle<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.240> what

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
measure because it's a rectangle so what

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.510 
measure because it's a rectangle so what
I'm<00:03:18.510> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.720> do<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.320> I'm<00:03:19.470> going<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.620> go<00:03:19.800> over

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go over

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.610 
I'm going to do is I'm going to go over
to<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.820> dining<00:03:21.000> room<00:03:21.240> table<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.810> first

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
to the dining room table and the first

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.310 
to the dining room table and the first
thing<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:22.920> need<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.100> do<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.490> you<00:03:23.610> need<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.790> line

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
thing you need to do is you need to line

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.490 
thing you need to do is you need to line
the<00:03:25.320> 0<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:26.690> perfectly<00:03:27.690> with<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.959> edge<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the 0 up perfectly with the edge of the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.260 
the 0 up perfectly with the edge of the
table<00:03:28.920> like<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.760> see<00:03:29.940> I've<00:03:30.060> got<00:03:30.209> my

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
table like that you can see I've got my

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.750 
table like that you can see I've got my
zero<00:03:30.750> lined<00:03:31.680> up<00:03:31.890> with<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> edge<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.459> table

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
zero lined up with the edge of the table

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.880 
zero lined up with the edge of the table
I'm<00:03:32.880> going<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.120> measure<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.959> long<00:03:34.290> length<00:03:34.709> of

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
I'm going to measure the long length of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.470 
I'm going to measure the long length of
the<00:03:35.010> table<00:03:35.190> first<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:35.760> I'm<00:03:36.000> simply<00:03:36.330> going<00:03:36.420> to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the table first so I'm simply going to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.860 
the table first so I'm simply going to
count<00:03:36.750> that's<00:03:37.020> one<00:03:37.320> feet<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:38.040> feet<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.670> foot

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
count that's one feet one feet one foot

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.440 
count that's one feet one feet one foot
two<00:03:39.870> feet<00:03:40.140> three<00:03:40.200> feet<00:03:41.160> four<00:03:41.670> feet<00:03:41.700> five<00:03:42.180> feet

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
two feet three feet four feet five feet

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.870 
two feet three feet four feet five feet
and<00:03:42.630> six<00:03:42.900> feet<00:03:43.080> so<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.440> know<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.670> table

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
and six feet so we know that the table

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.780 
and six feet so we know that the table
is<00:03:45.300> at<00:03:45.930> least<00:03:46.200> six<00:03:46.709> feet<00:03:46.920> long<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.520> we<00:03:47.640> also

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
is at least six feet long but we also

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.400 
is at least six feet long but we also
know<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.360> little<00:03:48.510> bit<00:03:48.690> longer<00:03:48.900> than<00:03:49.140> six

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
know it's a little bit longer than six

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.900 
know it's a little bit longer than six
feet<00:03:49.590> because<00:03:49.860> part<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.400> hanging<00:03:50.670> off

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
feet because part of it is hanging off

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.670 
feet because part of it is hanging off
the<00:03:51.120> edge<00:03:51.270> of<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> six<00:03:51.840> there<00:03:52.050> so<00:03:52.230> what<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.410> do

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
the edge of the six there so what you do

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.170 
the edge of the six there so what you do
is<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.489> then<00:03:53.640> slide<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:55.230> scale<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.850> six

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
is you then slide the scale so the six

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.479 
is you then slide the scale so the six
lines<00:03:57.570> up<00:03:57.870> perfectly<00:03:58.830> with<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.160> edge<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.400> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
lines up perfectly with the edge of the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.610 
lines up perfectly with the edge of the
table<00:03:59.700> and<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.450> you<00:04:00.480> count<00:04:00.840> backwards<00:04:01.170> from

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
table and then you count backwards from

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.680 
table and then you count backwards from
the<00:04:01.739> zero<00:04:01.980> side<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:03.030> figure<00:04:03.209> out<00:04:03.390> how<00:04:03.540> many

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
the zero side to figure out how many

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.750 
the zero side to figure out how many
inches<00:04:03.900> more<00:04:04.440> than<00:04:04.680> six<00:04:04.950> feet<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.580> it's

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
inches more than six feet it is and it's

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.790 
inches more than six feet it is and it's
three<00:04:06.180> inches<00:04:06.660> more<00:04:06.930> than<00:04:07.170> six<00:04:07.440> feet<00:04:07.620> which

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
three inches more than six feet which

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800 
three inches more than six feet which
means<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.280> long<00:04:08.550> length<00:04:08.850> of<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.209> table<00:04:09.480> is

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
means the long length of that table is

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.590 
means the long length of that table is
six<00:04:10.590> feet<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.100> three<00:04:11.850> inches<00:04:12.000> long<00:04:12.360> do<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
six feet and three inches long do you

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.790 
six feet and three inches long do you
see<00:04:12.750> how<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:12.900> lines<00:04:13.260> up<00:04:13.440> with<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.709> edge

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
see how that lines up with the edge

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.039 
see how that lines up with the edge
there<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:14.280> now<00:04:15.150> let's<00:04:15.360> measure<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.780> short

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
there so now let's measure the short

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.229 
there so now let's measure the short
edge<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> table<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:17.549> I'll<00:04:17.640> just<00:04:17.790> turn<00:04:18.030> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
edge of the table so I'll just turn the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.810 
edge of the table so I'll just turn the
ruler<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.660> other<00:04:18.780> way<00:04:19.250> again<00:04:20.250> first<00:04:20.609> thing

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
ruler the other way again first thing

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.949 
ruler the other way again first thing
you<00:04:20.910> need<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.120> do<00:04:21.330> when<00:04:21.480> you're<00:04:21.600> taking<00:04:21.900> a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
you need to do when you're taking a

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.140 
you need to do when you're taking a
measurement<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.620> need<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.860> align<00:04:23.310> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
measurement is you need to align the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.940 
measurement is you need to align the
zero<00:04:24.510> with<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> end<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.320> you're<00:04:25.440> measuring

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
zero with the end that you're measuring

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.030 
zero with the end that you're measuring
so<00:04:26.460> I've<00:04:26.610> aligned<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.150> up

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
so I've aligned it up

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.910 
so I've aligned it up
you're<00:04:28.250> going<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.430> count<00:04:28.700> back<00:04:28.970> one<00:04:29.960> to<00:04:30.500> three

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
you're going to count back one to three

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.220 
you're going to count back one to three
feet<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.340> I<00:04:31.370> know<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.510> short<00:04:32.840> length<00:04:33.050> of

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
feet so I know that the short length of

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.170 
feet so I know that the short length of
the<00:04:33.350> table<00:04:33.680> is<00:04:33.800> three<00:04:34.130> feet<00:04:34.340> plus<00:04:34.790> a<00:04:35.000> few

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
the table is three feet plus a few

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.180 
the table is three feet plus a few
inches<00:04:35.360> so<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.350> figure<00:04:36.590> out<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.890> number<00:04:37.100> of

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
inches so to figure out the number of

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.000 
inches so to figure out the number of
inches<00:04:37.340> I'm<00:04:37.610> going<00:04:37.640> to<00:04:37.850> slide<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.360> ruler<00:04:38.600> down

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
inches I'm going to slide the ruler down

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.380 
inches I'm going to slide the ruler down
so<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.220> the<00:04:40.340> three<00:04:40.640> lines<00:04:40.910> up<00:04:41.120> with<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.330> edge

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
so that the three lines up with the edge

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.600 
so that the three lines up with the edge
of<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.570> table<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:41.960> count<00:04:42.260> back<00:04:42.500> and<00:04:42.800> it's

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
of the table and count back and it's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.430 
of the table and count back and it's
three<00:04:43.910> inches<00:04:44.060> so<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.540> short<00:04:44.870> length<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.350> the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
three inches so the short length of the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.590 
three inches so the short length of the
table<00:04:45.740> is<00:04:45.890> three<00:04:46.310> foot<00:04:46.610> three<00:04:47.060> inches<00:04:47.360> so

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
table is three foot three inches so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.900 
table is three foot three inches so
that's<00:04:48.170> one<00:04:48.500> thing<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.860> can<00:04:49.040> do<00:04:49.220> with<00:04:49.790> the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
that's one thing you can do with the

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.550 
that's one thing you can do with the
scale<00:04:50.150> ruler<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.660> second<00:04:51.050> thing<00:04:51.170> you<00:04:51.260> can<00:04:51.290> do

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
scale ruler the second thing you can do

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.260 
scale ruler the second thing you can do
is<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.770> can<00:04:51.890> actually<00:04:52.280> use<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.640> scale<00:04:52.910> ruler

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
is you can actually use the scale ruler

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.750 
is you can actually use the scale ruler
to<00:04:53.660> draw<00:04:53.840> something<00:04:54.470> on<00:04:54.560> sketch<00:04:54.890> paper<00:04:55.160> to

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
to draw something on sketch paper to

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.910 
to draw something on sketch paper to
scale<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.480> see<00:04:56.870> how<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.170> fits<00:04:57.410> on<00:04:57.560> your<00:04:57.710> plan

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
scale and see how it fits on your plan

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.050 
scale and see how it fits on your plan
so<00:04:58.100> I'm<00:04:58.160> going<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> show<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:58.490> how<00:04:58.670> to<00:04:58.700> do<00:04:58.910> that

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
so I'm going to show you how to do that

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.430 
so I'm going to show you how to do that
and<00:04:59.210> this<00:04:59.300> is<00:04:59.480> where<00:04:59.900> it<00:04:59.990> starts<00:05:00.230> to<00:05:00.350> get

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
and this is where it starts to get

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.170 
and this is where it starts to get
really<00:05:00.680> fun<00:05:00.920> and<00:05:01.160> interesting<00:05:01.370> because<00:05:01.910> you

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
really fun and interesting because you

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.060 
really fun and interesting because you
can<00:05:02.390> try<00:05:03.170> placing<00:05:03.440> furniture<00:05:04.190> or<00:05:05.020> different

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
can try placing furniture or different

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.410 
can try placing furniture or different
different<00:05:07.070> book<00:05:07.310> different<00:05:07.640> size<00:05:08.030> things

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
different book different size things

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.330 
different book different size things
into<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.350> floorplan<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:09.920> what<00:05:10.040> I'm<00:05:10.130> going<00:05:10.280> to

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
into the floorplan so what I'm going to

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.640 
into the floorplan so what I'm going to
do<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:11.020> I'm<00:05:12.020> going<00:05:12.170> to<00:05:12.230> take<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.440> piece<00:05:12.620> of

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
do is I'm going to take a piece of

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.350 
do is I'm going to take a piece of
sketch<00:05:12.950> paper<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.490> I'm<00:05:13.640> going<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:13.970> draw<00:05:14.210> a

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
sketch paper and I'm going to draw a

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.210 
sketch paper and I'm going to draw a
bookcase<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.140> I'm<00:05:15.470> going<00:05:15.650> to<00:05:15.680> see<00:05:15.890> how<00:05:16.070> it

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
bookcase and I'm going to see how it

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.340 
bookcase and I'm going to see how it
fits<00:05:16.490> into<00:05:17.240> my<00:05:17.360> floorplan<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.020> I'm<00:05:18.110> going<00:05:18.320> to

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
fits into my floorplan and I'm going to

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.350 
fits into my floorplan and I'm going to
draw<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.590> bookcase<00:05:19.010> that<00:05:19.730> is<00:05:19.850> six<00:05:20.120> feet<00:05:20.300> long

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
draw a bookcase that is six feet long

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.660 
draw a bookcase that is six feet long
and<00:05:20.840> 12<00:05:21.440> inches<00:05:21.680> wide<00:05:21.860> because<00:05:22.280> that's<00:05:22.460> a

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
and 12 inches wide because that's a

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.370 
and 12 inches wide because that's a
pretty<00:05:23.000> typical<00:05:23.210> dimension<00:05:23.870> for<00:05:24.050> a<00:05:24.080> bookcase

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
pretty typical dimension for a bookcase

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.110 
pretty typical dimension for a bookcase
so<00:05:24.620> come<00:05:25.250> in<00:05:25.370> close<00:05:25.610> and<00:05:25.640> I'm<00:05:25.820> going<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.000> show

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
so come in close and I'm going to show

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.960 
so come in close and I'm going to show
you<00:05:26.150> how<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.330> do<00:05:26.510> this<00:05:26.630> I'm<00:05:27.020> going<00:05:27.590> to<00:05:27.650> mark<00:05:28.010> the

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
you how to do this I'm going to mark the

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.630 
you how to do this I'm going to mark the
zero<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.630> I'm<00:05:30.590> going<00:05:30.770> to<00:05:30.800> mark<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.310> six

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
zero and I'm going to mark the six

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.490 
zero and I'm going to mark the six
because<00:05:32.300> that's<00:05:32.480> the<00:05:32.660> length<00:05:32.810> of<00:05:33.020> my<00:05:33.110> bookcase

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
because that's the length of my bookcase

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.120 
because that's the length of my bookcase
and<00:05:33.740> I'm<00:05:33.860> simply<00:05:34.190> going<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.460> draw<00:05:34.790> a<00:05:35.170> line<00:05:36.170> in

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
and I'm simply going to draw a line in

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.920 
and I'm simply going to draw a line in
my<00:05:37.580> pan<00:05:37.850> between<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.360> two<00:05:38.510> of<00:05:38.630> them<00:05:38.750> like<00:05:38.900> that

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
my pan between the two of them like that

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.040 
my pan between the two of them like that
and<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:40.910> don't<00:05:41.060> have<00:05:41.180> to<00:05:41.330> be<00:05:41.420> perfect<00:05:41.840> you

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
and you don't have to be perfect you

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.750 
and you don't have to be perfect you
just<00:05:42.590> have<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.860> get<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.100> general<00:05:43.430> sense<00:05:43.640> of

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
just have to get the general sense of

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.550 
just have to get the general sense of
the<00:05:43.820> scale<00:05:44.000> and<00:05:44.240> it's<00:05:44.420> 12<00:05:44.720> inches<00:05:44.960> wide<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:45.470> I'm

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
the scale and it's 12 inches wide so I'm

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.610 
the scale and it's 12 inches wide so I'm
going<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.740> mark<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.730> zero<00:05:47.030> and<00:05:47.270> go<00:05:47.390> back<00:05:47.630> one

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
going to mark the zero and go back one

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.860 
going to mark the zero and go back one
foot<00:05:48.890> like<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.130> and<00:05:49.700> then<00:05:50.360> I'm<00:05:50.540> just<00:05:50.570> going

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
foot like that and then I'm just going

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.450 
foot like that and then I'm just going
to<00:05:50.900> hand<00:05:51.110> sketch<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.920> other<00:05:52.040> two<00:05:52.280> dimensions

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
to hand sketch the other two dimensions

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.920 
to hand sketch the other two dimensions
and<00:05:53.710> close<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.890> my<00:05:55.010> box<00:05:55.250> so<00:05:56.180> now<00:05:56.210> I've<00:05:56.420> used<00:05:56.660> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
and close in my box so now I've used the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.470 
and close in my box so now I've used the
scale<00:05:57.170> ruler<00:05:57.620> to<00:05:58.250> draw<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.670> bookcase<00:05:59.060> that<00:05:59.090> is

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
scale ruler to draw a bookcase that is

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.990 
scale ruler to draw a bookcase that is
six<00:05:59.720> feet<00:05:59.930> long<00:05:59.960> and<00:06:00.470> one<00:06:01.100> foot<00:06:01.370> wide<00:06:01.580> and<00:06:01.610> now

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
six feet long and one foot wide and now

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.050 
six feet long and one foot wide and now
using<00:06:02.480> the<00:06:02.600> sketch<00:06:02.840> paper<00:06:03.170> I<00:06:03.610> can<00:06:04.610> take<00:06:04.820> that

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
using the sketch paper I can take that

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.050 
using the sketch paper I can take that
and<00:06:05.330> I<00:06:05.480> can<00:06:05.720> see<00:06:06.340> where<00:06:07.340> I<00:06:07.370> could<00:06:07.610> place<00:06:07.820> that

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
and I can see where I could place that

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.480 
and I can see where I could place that
so<00:06:08.270> for<00:06:08.450> example<00:06:08.930> in<00:06:09.170> this<00:06:09.740> house<00:06:09.980> I<00:06:10.190> would<00:06:10.340> be

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
so for example in this house I would be

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.570 
so for example in this house I would be
able<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.700> place<00:06:10.970> my<00:06:11.210> bookcase<00:06:12.370> against<00:06:13.370> that

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
able to place my bookcase against that

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.460 
able to place my bookcase against that
wall<00:06:13.880> in<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:14.420> dining<00:06:14.450> room<00:06:14.870> because<00:06:14.960> I<00:06:15.170> have

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
wall in the dining room because I have

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.700 
wall in the dining room because I have
at<00:06:15.860> least<00:06:16.190> six<00:06:16.520> feet<00:06:16.900> in<00:06:17.900> order<00:06:18.140> to<00:06:18.230> place<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
at least six feet in order to place the

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.110 
at least six feet in order to place the
bookcase<00:06:19.040> and<00:06:19.070> I<00:06:19.280> would<00:06:19.460> still<00:06:19.700> have<00:06:19.880> enough

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
bookcase and I would still have enough

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.550 
bookcase and I would still have enough
room<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.360> walk<00:06:20.660> around<00:06:20.690> to<00:06:21.110> get<00:06:21.290> into<00:06:21.470> the

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 
room to walk around to get into the

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.200 
room to walk around to get into the
dining<00:06:21.650> room<00:06:21.920> table<00:06:22.250> so<00:06:22.760> there's<00:06:22.940> a<00:06:23.030> couple

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
dining room table so there's a couple

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.540 
dining room table so there's a couple
ways<00:06:23.360> that<00:06:23.540> you<00:06:23.840> can<00:06:23.990> use<00:06:24.140> a<00:06:24.170> scale<00:06:24.500> ruler<00:06:24.890> to

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
ways that you can use a scale ruler to

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.150 
ways that you can use a scale ruler to
both<00:06:26.060> measure<00:06:26.510> a<00:06:26.840> floor<00:06:27.320> plan<00:06:27.560> as<00:06:27.710> well<00:06:27.860> as<00:06:27.920> to

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
both measure a floor plan as well as to
