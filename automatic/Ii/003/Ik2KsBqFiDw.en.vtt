showing you breaking tips now we're
going<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.220> talk<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.429> little<00:00:08.550> bit<00:00:08.670> more<00:00:08.940> about

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
going to talk a little bit more about

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.419 
going to talk a little bit more about
footwork<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:10.019> most<00:00:10.290> basic<00:00:10.740> footwork<00:00:11.010> step

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
footwork the most basic footwork step

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.280 
footwork the most basic footwork step
out<00:00:11.670> there<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.059> what<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.480> call<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> six<00:00:13.049> step

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
out there is what we call the six step

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.289 
out there is what we call the six step
now<00:00:14.009> obviously<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:14.670> called<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.940> six<00:00:15.179> step

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
now obviously it's called a six step

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.260 
now obviously it's called a six step
because<00:00:15.630> there's<00:00:15.929> six<00:00:16.590> steps<00:00:16.920> okay<00:00:17.609> I'm<00:00:18.090> going

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
because there's six steps okay I'm going

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.820 
because there's six steps okay I'm going
to<00:00:18.330> break<00:00:18.510> down<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.750> six<00:00:19.020> steps<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:19.439> before

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
to break down the six steps now before

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.019 
to break down the six steps now before
we<00:00:19.920> take<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> ground<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:20.820> actually

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
we take it to the ground I'm actually

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.849 
we take it to the ground I'm actually
going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.300> show<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.199> you're<00:00:22.320> standing<00:00:22.560> up

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
going to show it so you're standing up

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.490 
going to show it so you're standing up
so<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> basic<00:00:23.609> idea<00:00:23.910> okay<00:00:24.750> but<00:00:25.350> I

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
so you can get a basic idea okay but I

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880 
so you can get a basic idea okay but I
prefer<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.099> go<00:00:26.390> counterclockwise<00:00:27.710> but<00:00:28.710> in

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
prefer to go counterclockwise but in

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.230 
prefer to go counterclockwise but in
footwork<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.490> should<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:29.760> able<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.090> your

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
footwork you should be able to do your

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.790 
footwork you should be able to do your
basic<00:00:30.420> steps<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.990> both<00:00:31.140> directions<00:00:31.500> which

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
basic steps in both directions which

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
basic steps in both directions which
would<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.070> clockwise<00:00:32.759> clockwise<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:34.020> should

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
would be clockwise clockwise I should

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.770 
would be clockwise clockwise I should
say<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.559> counterclockwise<00:00:35.309> okay<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.600> good

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
say and counterclockwise okay it's good

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.240 
say and counterclockwise okay it's good
to<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:36.989> able<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.350> both<00:00:37.469> directions<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
to be able to go in both directions and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.650 
to be able to go in both directions and
kind<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> be<00:00:38.550> ambidextrous<00:00:39.210> okay

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
kind of be ambidextrous okay

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.510 
kind of be ambidextrous okay
here<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.469> six<00:00:40.800> steps<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.160> gonna<00:00:41.280> break<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
here we go six steps I'm gonna break it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.040 
here we go six steps I'm gonna break it
down<00:00:41.550> we're<00:00:42.149> installing<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> left<00:00:42.899> foot

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
five right foot back six you're back at

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.219 
five right foot back six you're back at
the<00:01:30.090> beginning<00:01:30.180> now<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> do<00:01:31.020> two

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the beginning now we're going to do two

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.539 
the beginning now we're going to do two
rotations<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.100> see<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> transition

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
rotations so you can see the transition

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.800 
rotations so you can see the transition
it's<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.600> something<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.220> 1<00:01:35.220> 2

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
it's gonna look something like this 1 2

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
the easier it's going to become you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.940 
the easier it's going to become you
wanna<00:01:51.869> stay<00:01:52.020> light<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.259> your<00:01:52.380> feet<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> you

directions the opposite direction

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.609 
directions the opposite direction
basically<00:01:56.549> reverse<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.659> motions<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.409> instead

trust<00:02:31.010> me<00:02:31.160> accounting<00:02:31.670> helps<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.690> want

trust me accounting helps and you want

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.870 
trust me accounting helps and you want
to<00:02:32.990> get<00:02:33.140> this<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.530> beginning<00:02:33.920> both<00:02:34.340> ways

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
to get this in the beginning both ways

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.730 
to get this in the beginning both ways
practice<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.750> both<00:02:35.900> directions<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.590> would

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
practice it in both directions I would

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.040 
practice it in both directions I would
recommend<00:02:37.190> doing<00:02:37.580> reps<00:02:37.910> of<00:02:38.150> five<00:02:38.360> or<00:02:38.600> ten<00:02:38.810> in

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
recommend doing reps of five or ten in

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.320 
recommend doing reps of five or ten in
each<00:02:39.410> direction<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.460> you<00:02:40.670> get<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.000> down

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
each direction so that you get it down

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.990 
each direction so that you get it down
pat<00:02:41.390> okay<00:02:42.050> again<00:02:42.800> six<00:02:43.190> steps<00:02:43.430> standing<00:02:43.850> up

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
pat okay again six steps standing up

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.130 
pat okay again six steps standing up
next<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:44.870> follow<00:02:45.080> six<00:02:45.500> step<00:02:45.680> on<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.890> floor
