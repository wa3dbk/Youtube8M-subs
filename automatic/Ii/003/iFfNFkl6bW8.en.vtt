00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello girls today I bring you a video that 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.400
 it makes me very much like some 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.110
 It seems silly but I think 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.910
 super amazing that living in madrid 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 I did not know there is a cosmetics 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.190
 company store that for those who do not know 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.630
 what it is is like the outlet of estue 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.720
 lauder mch 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.699
 bobby brown clean and this whole group of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.220
 companies that have all these brands 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.019
 that we all like so much and that I 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.590
 I had only been in this kind of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.110
 shop in usa in outlets of usa and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.329
 it had been a long time without going to the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.090
 rozas village that is in madrid in the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.190
 obviously rozas and the weekend 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.170
 I was by chance because I came to 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.270
 family from outside and they wanted to go do 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 shopping and so on and when I saw the cosmetic 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.100
 company store says it's this will be like 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.780
 it is possible that this is that I do not 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 know and the truth that they had enough 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.489
 things we had a lot of things about bobby 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.250
 braun they had pallets they had the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 pretty powerful collection they had a few 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 kits that were blusher without lipsticks 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.769
 well, there was a lot of things 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.840
 I tried to contain myself a lot because I did not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.460
 I wanted to spend 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.500
 but when I get to do anything mack 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.759
 I could not resist I took some things 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.950
 I'm going to teach them to the others 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.929
 past collections I do not know if they are all 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.030
 from the same collection or not but good 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.859
 I'm going to teach you these dating jobs 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.799
 that they gave me for those who follow me 

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:24.110
 facebook and instagram already you will have 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.549
 seen because I uploaded a photo but under 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.979
 of the video in the information box 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.509
 you have links to both facebook and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.560
 instagram or what good to instagram what 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.289
 only there is my username 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.759
 in case you want to look for me and well I'm going 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.189
 to teach what is inside 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.840
 The first thing I saw were these pigments 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.340
 I've been watching them on the internet 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.530
 I have seen that they are from a collection that 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.569
 called vera that came out in 2012 I do not know very 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.360
 well when and this is in particular it 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:50.149
 they call aloha are four shades and they come 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.819
 well in these little boats in these two 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.590
 doubles the one below is a mole that has 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.390
 golden flashes and the one above is a 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.909
 mole more clarito than strip with more 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.619
 champagne vale are super pretty 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.270
 there were enough of them so if you live in 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.369
 madrid and you approach the most likely is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.189
 that still has the other two are 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.090
 in golden shades copper from above is a 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.099
 tone 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
 as more clarito and the one below is more 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.209
 dark and we throw to copper if you want os 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.010
 I do soches if you live in Madrid or 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.750
 you have thought about and you are going to come in 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.310
 short to whatever it is I taught them with their 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.140
 you may have them at home because 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.269
 purchases when they left at the time and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 you do not remember them so you 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.080
 I'm going to teach and the truth is that I 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.650
 it seems that this is a last 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:36.740
 the color intensity of brightness and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.740
 nuances that it seems to be very cool 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.129
 my mother I am color by all 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.719
 eyelid must be hallucinating has 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.879
 sub tone as rosita also have to 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.879
 to say this is a tone like brown quoted 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.450
 I find them incredible they are beautiful and they 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.360
 I'm going to teach the other two those who are 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.980
 the tone like doradito or copper and what 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.670
 So pretty color reminds me a bit of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.670
 the for disk 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.469
 it's a tone between orange gold 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.790
 very nice clarito the truth is that 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.739
 these colors I think should be left 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.359
 very very good when you're dark but 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.709
 well anyway at least these 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.459
 two and I plan to use them though 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.989
 be more white even this one already 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.710
 We'll see how to make it work and this 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:30.540
 is the last one that is the tone 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.540
 which is same soon darker 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.300
 it is quite orange and if it is very copper 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.760
 it is a copper tone clarito bell 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.769
 also what the 4 have cost me 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.629
 because of course the price they had 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.939
 originally I do not have it I know that here yes 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.760
 I put it but I do not remember but I 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:54.610
 has cost the 420 with 50 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.340
 that is five euros each of base in a 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.989
 gift in love with my pigments after 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.549
 from a cream-colored umbrella that seems to me 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.260
 that could go pretty well with these 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.000
 pigments that I had also picked 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.099
 lately the truth is that I have a 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.150
 little cream shadows fever is 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.150
 call app from before 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.030
 it's a big band shadow and it's like 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.730
 we were 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.840
 I teach it 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:27.889
 I'm going to talk is like a mousse 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.990
 it is very in the range of the hills reflects 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.280
 very much in light 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.710
 I already tell you in the range of shadows 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.020
 I think that as a basis for the pigments 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.520
 to be a party because I'll tell you what 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.740
 such are these types of shadows because I 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.280
 It's the first time I've ever seen them 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.960
 I had heard about this range not being 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.300
 the same is that I have lived under one 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.100
 stone or wormwood but they do not sound like 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.480
 nothing so I'll tell you how 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.390
 working that I bought was this in the 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.100
 a sim super lipglass that is pretty 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.410
 transparent is what I carry in the 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.760
 lips and is a clear tone but not 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.520
 It paints too much so you do not have 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.990
 too new they are natural but a 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.000
 tad more clarito is like environment 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.250
 you see her but a little more more 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.490
 clear and nothing I will put here a little 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.620
 so you can see I'm not going to put on 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.969
 little concentrate because if not 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:23.269
 go and that's a nude tone a rosary 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.249
 it's called jasmine hand and it's your typical 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:26.029
 color that always looks good 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.269
 regardless of what you carry in 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:31.819
 eyes or on the cheeks is a color of 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:33.860
 these wildcard so I liked it a lot and 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:35.719
 I bought it and I forget to say that about 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.819
 price of the shade is in mousse 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.409
 will cost 12 euros each post and good 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:43.300
 girls these have been my complete in 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:45.370
 Marist outlet and brown side 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.229
 I hope you liked it and that if 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.849
 you had thought to come to madrid or live 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.830

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.300

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.860
