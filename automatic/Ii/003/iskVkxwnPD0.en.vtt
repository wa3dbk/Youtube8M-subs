you<00:00:00.510> don't<00:00:00.690> have<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.960> be<00:00:01.079> mechanic<00:00:01.589> to<00:00:01.680> drive<00:00:01.860> a

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
you don't have to be mechanic to drive a

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.649 
you don't have to be mechanic to drive a
car<00:00:02.159> but<00:00:02.399> it<00:00:02.760> doesn't<00:00:03.060> hurt<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.270> have<00:00:03.300> some

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
car but it doesn't hurt to have some

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.829 
car but it doesn't hurt to have some
idea<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:04.170> how<00:00:04.710> your<00:00:05.190> vehicle<00:00:05.400> works<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.660> way

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
idea of how your vehicle works that way

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.059 
idea of how your vehicle works that way
you'll<00:00:07.020> have<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> better<00:00:07.410> understanding<00:00:07.500> of

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
you'll have a better understanding of

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.770 
you'll have a better understanding of
where<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.370> look<00:00:08.400> when<00:00:08.940> something<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.420> your<00:00:09.510> car

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
where to look when something on your car

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.900 
where to look when something on your car
doesn't<00:00:10.410> work<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:11.250> if<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.490> don't<00:00:11.670> know<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
doesn't work so if you don't know the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.640 
doesn't work so if you don't know the
difference<00:00:12.269> between<00:00:12.330> an<00:00:12.750> AC<00:00:12.990> compressor<00:00:13.320> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
difference between an AC compressor and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.290 
difference between an AC compressor and
the<00:00:14.009> flux<00:00:14.250> capacitor<00:00:14.420> this<00:00:15.420> video<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:15.900> you

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.759 

to<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.420> started<00:00:21.570> let's<00:00:22.020> pop<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.380> hood<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:22.680> we

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
to get started let's pop the hood so we

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.380 
to get started let's pop the hood so we
can<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.039> what's<00:00:23.220> inside<00:00:23.369> there<00:00:24.180> will<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.330> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
can see what's inside there will be a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.609 
can see what's inside there will be a
hood<00:00:24.570> release<00:00:24.869> handle<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.260> front<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
hood release handle in front of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.589 
hood release handle in front of the
driver<00:00:25.830> seat<00:00:26.099> under<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.430> dash<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.390> will

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
driver seat under the dash that will

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
driver seat under the dash that will
open<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.960> hood<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.590> bit<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.279> you'll

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
open the hood up a little bit but you'll

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
open the hood up a little bit but you'll
then<00:00:29.699> need<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> find<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.510> release<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> latch

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
then need to find and release the latch

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.000 
then need to find and release the latch
underneath<00:00:32.989> here<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> engine<00:00:34.530> which

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
underneath here we have the engine which

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.330 
underneath here we have the engine which
in<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.309> case<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> 3.8<00:00:36.540> liter<00:00:36.899> v6<00:00:37.590> since

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
in this case is a 3.8 liter v6 since

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.549 
in this case is a 3.8 liter v6 since
this<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.969> rear-wheel<00:00:39.540> drive<00:00:39.570> car<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.350> front

this is a rear-wheel drive car the front

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.990 
this is a rear-wheel drive car the front
of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> engine<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.160> usually<00:00:41.640> face<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000

which is over here in the corner and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.190 
which is over here in the corner and
this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> AC<00:01:33.060> compressor<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.079> the

this is the AC compressor which is the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
this is the AC compressor which is the
only<00:01:34.350> moving<00:01:34.890> part<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> air-conditioning

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.270 
only moving part in the air-conditioning
system<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> find<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.680> because<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.130> has

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
system you can find it because it has

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.100
