00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
colors I'm using today are lvx is

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.229 
colors I'm using today are lvx is
phantom<00:00:54.059> which<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> white<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.530> then<00:00:56.520> OPI

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
phantom which is this white and then OPI

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.619 
phantom which is this white and then OPI
is<00:00:57.390> red-hot<00:00:58.109> Rio<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.270> about<00:01:00.420> this

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
is red-hot Rio so I think about this

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.930 
is red-hot Rio so I think about this
design<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.469> bit<00:01:01.859> difficult<00:01:02.070> we

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
design it's a little bit difficult we

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.740 
design it's a little bit difficult we
might<00:01:03.149> find<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:04.400> finding<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.700> combination<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
might find is finding a combination of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.800 
might find is finding a combination of
white<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.409> red<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.830> doesn't<00:01:08.460> bleed<00:01:08.810> into

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
white and red that doesn't bleed into

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
white and red that doesn't bleed into
one<00:01:09.840> another<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.590> makes<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.890> pink<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
one another like that makes a pink you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.149 
one another like that makes a pink you
know<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.990> took<00:01:13.140> me<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.320> few<00:01:13.560> minutes<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.130> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

in word on this a little bit and so

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.320 
in word on this a little bit and so
pretty<00:02:32.069> much<00:02:32.220> you<00:02:32.489> know<00:02:32.610> this<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:33.000> just

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
pretty much you know this is just

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.780 
pretty much you know this is just
getting<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.050> set<00:02:34.319> up<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.770> make<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.280> spiral

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
getting it set up to make the spiral

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.860 
getting it set up to make the spiral
design<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:37.080> more<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.380> do<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.800> more

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
design the more you do this the more

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.990 
design the more you do this the more
kind<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:40.050> spirally<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.250> crazy<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.880> gonna

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
kind of spirally and crazy it's gonna

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.910 
kind of spirally and crazy it's gonna
look<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:45.720> just<00:02:45.959> gonna<00:02:46.080> keep<00:02:46.260> going<00:02:46.320> here

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
look so I'm just gonna keep going here

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.520 
look so I'm just gonna keep going here
once<00:02:47.250> more<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.269> as<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.959> can<00:02:49.050> see<00:02:49.230> I'm<00:02:49.320> dipping

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
in every time to to kind of clean up in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.250 
in every time to to kind of clean up in
the<00:02:53.310> middle<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.820> make<00:02:53.970> sure<00:02:54.150> it's<00:02:54.300> nice<00:02:54.480> so

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
don't want to make a spiral so I'm not

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.570 
don't want to make a spiral so I'm not
gonna<00:03:07.140> go<00:03:07.319> keep<00:03:07.709> going<00:03:07.739> here<00:03:08.280> I'm<00:03:08.340> just<00:03:08.459> gonna

kind of stop right about there and
that'll<00:03:11.790> be<00:03:11.910> good<00:03:12.120> because<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.540> looks<00:03:12.750> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810

so<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.380> your<00:03:49.680> design<00:03:50.070> doesn't<00:03:50.820> get<00:03:51.060> all

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
so that your design doesn't get all

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.500 
so that your design doesn't get all
nasty<00:03:52.230> with<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.709> polish<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:54.150> if<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.390> ever
