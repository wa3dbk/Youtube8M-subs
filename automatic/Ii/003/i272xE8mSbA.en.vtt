automate them the nice thing about this

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.830 
automate them the nice thing about this
is<00:01:58.919> that<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.639> 3300<00:02:00.119> milliamp<00:02:00.659> hour<00:02:00.809> battery

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
is that the 3300 milliamp hour battery

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.870 
is that the 3300 milliamp hour battery
was<00:02:01.349> not<00:02:01.559> enough<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.859> you<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.489> can<00:02:02.609> improve

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
was not enough for you you can improve

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.309 
was not enough for you you can improve
it<00:02:02.999> by<00:02:03.119> thirty<00:02:03.389> percent<00:02:03.749> by<00:02:03.929> using<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
it by thirty percent by using the

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.469 
it by thirty percent by using the
battery<00:02:04.619> extender<00:02:04.829> rule<00:02:05.219> allowing<00:02:06.059> you<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
battery extender rule allowing you to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.240 
battery extender rule allowing you to
basically<00:02:06.749> turn<00:02:07.529> off<00:02:07.709> things<00:02:07.919> that<00:02:08.039> you're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
basically turn off things that you're

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
basically turn off things that you're
not<00:02:08.369> using<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.969> example<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.479> your<00:02:09.629> battery<00:02:09.959> is

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
not using for example if your battery is

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.870 
not using for example if your battery is
running<00:02:11.099> low<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.640> set

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
running low you can set

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.580 
running low you can set
this<00:02:12.060> battery<00:02:12.300> extender<00:02:12.570> by<00:02:12.960> turning<00:02:13.230> your

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
this battery extender by turning your

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
this battery extender by turning your
display<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.160> lower<00:02:14.370> brightness<00:02:14.640> turning

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
display to a lower brightness turning

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
display to a lower brightness turning
off<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.450> GPS<00:02:16.020> if<00:02:16.200> you're<00:02:16.320> not<00:02:16.410> using<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
off your GPS if you're not using it and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940 
off your GPS if you're not using it and
then<00:02:17.780> extend<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:18.990> battery<00:02:19.140> by<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.680> 30

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
then extend your battery by up to 30

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.550 
then extend your battery by up to 30
