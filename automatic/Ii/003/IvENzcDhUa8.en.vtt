a<00:03:00.350> point<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.800> landfall<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.670> don't<00:03:01.730> say<00:03:02.060> this

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
a point of landfall and I don't say this

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.510 
a point of landfall and I don't say this
all<00:03:02.390> too<00:03:02.600> often<00:03:02.840> PAGASA<00:03:03.770> I<00:03:04.010> think<00:03:04.280> they<00:03:04.370> have

all too often PAGASA I think they have

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.920 
all too often PAGASA I think they have
it<00:03:04.670> down<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:05.210> this<00:03:05.330> is<00:03:05.450> going<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.780> come

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
it down I think this is going to come

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.900 
it down I think this is going to come

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
year the storm system came right through

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.090 
year the storm system came right through
this<00:03:35.000> area<00:03:35.300> track<00:03:35.930> kind<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.470> like<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:36.920> in

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
this area track kind of like this in

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.190 
this area track kind of like this in
that<00:03:37.400> right<00:03:37.760> front<00:03:38.180> eye<00:03:38.390> wall<00:03:38.690> pushed<00:03:39.050> that

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
that right front eye wall pushed that

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.010 
that right front eye wall pushed that
water<00:03:39.560> right<00:03:40.010> up<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.670> bays<00:03:40.850> here<00:03:41.300> now<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:41.870> this

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
water right up the bays here now if this

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.290 
water right up the bays here now if this
moves<00:03:42.290> over<00:03:42.530> towards<00:03:42.800> Samar<00:03:43.190> it's<00:03:43.700> not<00:03:44.000> as

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
moves over towards Samar it's not as

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.240 
moves over towards Samar it's not as
vulnerable<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:45.140> there<00:03:45.320> are<00:03:45.500> still<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.890> lot<00:03:46.100> of

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
vulnerable but there are still a lot of

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.190 
vulnerable but there are still a lot of
vulnerable<00:03:46.700> areas<00:03:47.120> out<00:03:47.330> here<00:03:47.360> and<00:03:47.900> if<00:03:48.020> you<00:03:48.080> get

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
vulnerable areas out here and if you get

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.810 
vulnerable areas out here and if you get
that<00:03:48.320> water<00:03:48.560> flowing<00:03:49.070> into<00:03:49.220> some<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.640> bays

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
that water flowing into some of the bays

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.120 
that water flowing into some of the bays
and<00:03:50.030> pushing<00:03:50.810> up<00:03:50.959> kind<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.590> like<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:51.770> funnel

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
and pushing up kind of like a funnel

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.290 
and pushing up kind of like a funnel
that's<00:03:52.670> where<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:52.970> could<00:03:53.090> see<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.270> very

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
that's where you could see a very

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.150 
that's where you could see a very
serious<00:03:53.989> threat<00:03:54.080> of<00:03:54.260> storm<00:03:54.500> surge<00:03:54.650> especially

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
serious threat of storm surge especially

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.250 
serious threat of storm surge especially
with<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.459> storm<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.150> this<00:03:56.330> intensity<00:03:57.020> I<00:03:57.050> can't

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
with a storm of this intensity I can't

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.840 
with a storm of this intensity I can't
stress<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.530> enough<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.070> I<00:03:58.280> think<00:03:58.489> everybody

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
stress it enough and I think everybody

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.270 
stress it enough and I think everybody
out<00:03:59.030> here<00:03:59.380> realizes<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:00.860> that's<00:04:01.070> why

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
out here realizes it and that's why

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.400 
out here realizes it and that's why
there<00:04:01.520> is<00:04:01.640> forced<00:04:02.090> evacuations<00:04:02.900> at<00:04:03.050> this<00:04:03.230> time

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
there is forced evacuations at this time

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.770 
there is forced evacuations at this time
but<00:04:03.890> even<00:04:04.130> after<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.790> storm<00:04:05.060> moves<00:04:05.300> inland

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
but even after the storm moves inland

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.850 
but even after the storm moves inland
here's<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.410> deal

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
here's the deal

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.010 
here's the deal
I<00:04:06.890> think<00:04:07.430> ECMWF<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:08.450> a<00:04:08.510> little<00:04:08.720> bit<00:04:08.810> farther

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
I think ECMWF is a little bit farther

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.540 
I think ECMWF is a little bit farther
towards<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.440> south<00:04:09.620> but<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:10.040> is<00:04:10.160> going<00:04:10.370> to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
towards the south but it is going to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.660 
towards the south but it is going to
weaken<00:04:10.940> but<00:04:11.300> it's<00:04:11.480> moving<00:04:11.780> very<00:04:12.170> slow<00:04:13.160> so<00:04:13.400> just

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
weaken but it's moving very slow so just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.340 
weaken but it's moving very slow so just
kind<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:13.880> superimposes<00:04:14.540> farther<00:04:14.959> towards<00:04:15.290> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
kind of superimposes farther towards the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.530 
kind of superimposes farther towards the
north<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.709> we're<00:04:16.190> talking<00:04:16.640> about<00:04:16.790> the<00:04:17.239> risk

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
north and we're talking about the risk

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.180 
north and we're talking about the risk
of<00:04:17.720> flooding<00:04:17.959> across<00:04:18.230> much<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.560> central

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
of flooding across much of central

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.909 
of flooding across much of central
northern<00:04:19.549> besides<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.419> also<00:04:21.140> Southern<00:04:21.590> Luzon

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
northern besides and also Southern Luzon

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.370 
northern besides and also Southern Luzon
and<00:04:22.100> eventually<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.510> could<00:04:23.900> bring<00:04:24.140> some

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
and eventually this could bring some

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.020 
and eventually this could bring some
rough<00:04:24.560> weather<00:04:24.740> over<00:04:25.130> towards<00:04:25.460> Manila<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.850> know

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
rough weather over towards Manila I know

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.760 
rough weather over towards Manila I know
we<00:04:26.150> have<00:04:26.240> a<00:04:26.300> lot<00:04:26.510> of<00:04:26.660> people<00:04:26.930> watching<00:04:27.169> from<00:04:27.380> an

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
really we're trying to figure out this

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.900 
really we're trying to figure out this
one<00:04:47.300> guys<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:48.139> what<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.530> do<00:04:48.830> see<00:04:49.130> is<00:04:49.370> at<00:04:49.789> least

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910

one guys and what we do see is at least
the<00:04:50.090> JTWC<00:04:50.780> track<00:04:51.110> pretty<00:04:52.099> good<00:04:52.310> consensus

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
the JTWC track pretty good consensus

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.820 
the JTWC track pretty good consensus
that<00:04:53.150> we<00:04:53.630> all<00:04:53.810> feel<00:04:54.050> like<00:04:54.139> this<00:04:54.440> is<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.590> little

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
that we all feel like this is a little

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.589 
that we all feel like this is a little
bit<00:04:54.919> farther<00:04:55.130> towards<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.729> east<00:04:55.940> it's<00:04:56.330> going

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
bit farther towards the east it's going

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.779 
bit farther towards the east it's going
to<00:04:56.690> be<00:04:56.780> making<00:04:56.960> landfall<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:58.099> should<00:04:58.400> weaken

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
to be making landfall that should weaken

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.490 
to be making landfall that should weaken
it<00:04:58.910> before<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.360> comes<00:04:59.509> towards<00:04:59.930> manila<00:05:00.259> but

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
it before it comes towards manila but

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.309 
it before it comes towards manila but
remember<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.729> Philippine<00:05:02.150> Islands<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.870> mean

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:03.319 
remember the Philippine Islands I mean

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.290 
remember the Philippine Islands I mean
there's<00:05:03.530> a<00:05:03.590> lot<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:04.039> warm<00:05:04.280> water<00:05:04.550> even<00:05:05.060> while

there's a lot of warm water even while

do<00:05:09.800> have<00:05:10.069> it<00:05:10.190> going<00:05:10.430> on<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.729> West

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
do have it going on that West

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.749 
do have it going on that West
northwesterly<00:05:11.449> track<00:05:12.409> basically<00:05:12.680> Praga<00:05:13.430> out

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
northwesterly track basically Praga out

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.730 
northwesterly track basically Praga out
what<00:05:13.970> we<00:05:14.090> are<00:05:14.210> seeing<00:05:14.479> right<00:05:14.659> now<00:05:14.690> there<00:05:15.319> is<00:05:15.500> a

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
what we are seeing right now there is a

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.710 
what we are seeing right now there is a
colle<00:05:16.039> over<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.610> central<00:05:17.060> Philippines<00:05:17.240> and

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
colle over the central Philippines and

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.029 
colle over the central Philippines and
that's<00:05:17.840> kind<00:05:18.020> of<00:05:18.050> like<00:05:18.139> a<00:05:18.259> dead<00:05:18.500> zone<00:05:18.770> in<00:05:19.009> the

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
that's kind of like a dead zone in the

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:21.159 
that's kind of like a dead zone in the
air<00:05:19.759> pattern<00:05:20.210> it's<00:05:20.539> out<00:05:20.630> here<00:05:20.810> that<00:05:20.960> could

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
air pattern it's out here that could

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.020 
air pattern it's out here that could
also<00:05:21.380> allow<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:22.130> that<00:05:22.220> northwesterly

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
also allow for that northwesterly

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.080 
also allow for that northwesterly
projection<00:05:23.930> vise<00:05:24.500> with<00:05:24.710> JMA<00:05:25.280> is<00:05:25.460> showing<00:05:25.819> just

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
projection vise with JMA is showing just

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:27.420 
projection vise with JMA is showing just
a<00:05:26.180> little<00:05:26.360> bit<00:05:26.479> farther<00:05:26.599> towards<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.080> south

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
a little bit farther towards the south

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.890 
a little bit farther towards the south
basically<00:05:28.430> at<00:05:28.669> this<00:05:28.970> point<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.569> I<00:05:29.750> had

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
basically at this point and I had

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.450 
basically at this point and I had
discussed<00:05:30.319> it<00:05:30.470> with<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.650> lot<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.889> Mets<00:05:31.250> this

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
discussed it with a lot of Mets this

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.480 
discussed it with a lot of Mets this
morning<00:05:32.000> um<00:05:32.259> what<00:05:33.259> we<00:05:33.380> are<00:05:33.530> looking<00:05:33.889> at<00:05:34.070> and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
morning um what we are looking at and

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.300 
morning um what we are looking at and
what<00:05:34.699> you<00:05:34.880> are<00:05:35.060> seeing<00:05:35.300> out<00:05:35.599> here<00:05:35.630> guys<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.469> a

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
what you are seeing out here guys is a

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.790 
what you are seeing out here guys is a
lot<00:05:37.669> of<00:05:37.789> dynamics<00:05:38.360> in<00:05:38.479> play<00:05:38.509> and<00:05:38.960> still<00:05:39.590> at

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
lot of dynamics in play and still at

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.180 
lot of dynamics in play and still at
this<00:05:40.070> time<00:05:40.870> watch<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:42.320> corner<00:05:42.680> of<00:05:42.919> air<00:05:43.039> I

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
this time watch that corner of air I

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.740 
this time watch that corner of air I
know<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.580> centerline<00:05:44.060> is<00:05:44.090> important<00:05:44.659> when

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
know the centerline is important when

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.939 
know the centerline is important when
we're<00:05:44.840> talking<00:05:44.930> about<00:05:45.080> strong<00:05:45.469> typhoons

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
we're talking about strong typhoons

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.189 
we're talking about strong typhoons
especially<00:05:46.430> that<00:05:46.610> inner<00:05:46.789> eye<00:05:46.909> wall<00:05:47.509> but<00:05:48.169> as

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 
especially that inner eye wall but as

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:50.350 
especially that inner eye wall but as
far<00:05:48.500> as<00:05:48.530> planning<00:05:48.949> purposes<00:05:49.699> if<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:50.030> are<00:05:50.210> in

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
far as planning purposes if you are in

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.390 
far as planning purposes if you are in
that<00:05:50.509> cone<00:05:50.810> especially<00:05:51.560> now<00:05:52.039> that<00:05:52.070> we're

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
that cone especially now that we're

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.310 
that cone especially now that we're
getting<00:05:52.520> up<00:05:52.759> towards<00:05:53.060> about<00:05:53.210> 48<00:05:53.690> hours<00:05:53.990> out<00:05:54.169> it

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
getting up towards about 48 hours out it

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.080 
getting up towards about 48 hours out it
could<00:05:54.500> at<00:05:54.620> least<00:05:54.919> at<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.280> very<00:05:55.310> least<00:05:55.789> get

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
could at least at the very least get

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.700 
could at least at the very least get
tropical<00:05:56.599> storm<00:05:56.810> strength<00:05:57.020> winds<00:05:57.319> which<00:05:57.560> is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
tropical storm strength winds which is

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.950 
tropical storm strength winds which is
enough<00:05:57.949> to<00:05:57.979> cause<00:05:58.219> some<00:05:58.460> damage<00:05:58.610> but<00:05:59.000> those<00:05:59.750> of

enough to cause some damage but those of

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.230 
enough to cause some damage but those of
you<00:06:00.110> as<00:06:00.259> I<00:06:00.409> stressed<00:06:00.710> earlier<00:06:00.860> in<00:06:01.370> eastern

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
you as I stressed earlier in eastern

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.969 
you as I stressed earlier in eastern
samar<00:06:02.479> late<00:06:03.020> day<00:06:03.199> and<00:06:03.229> Southern<00:06:03.620> Luzon

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
samar late day and Southern Luzon

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:05.950 
samar late day and Southern Luzon
especially<00:06:04.610> along<00:06:04.789> the<00:06:04.849> eastern<00:06:05.360> seaboards

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
especially along the eastern seaboards

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.670 
especially along the eastern seaboards
this<00:06:06.440> one<00:06:06.770> is<00:06:07.069> going<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.400> come<00:06:07.610> onshore<00:06:07.789> with

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
this one is going to come onshore with

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.459 
this one is going to come onshore with
ferocity<00:06:09.680> that<00:06:10.130> we<00:06:10.610> have<00:06:10.849> not<00:06:11.090> seen<00:06:11.539> since

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
ferocity that we have not seen since

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:15.219 
ferocity that we have not seen since
November<00:06:13.159> of<00:06:13.310> last<00:06:13.340> year<00:06:13.789> even<00:06:14.240> Ramah<00:06:14.509> soon<00:06:14.900> or

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
November of last year even Ramah soon or

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.379 
November of last year even Ramah soon or
glenda<00:06:15.830> as<00:06:16.069> a<00:06:16.370> lot<00:06:16.580> of<00:06:16.610> people<00:06:16.729> out<00:06:17.030> here<00:06:17.060> know

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:17.389 
glenda as a lot of people out here know

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:19.839 
glenda as a lot of people out here know
it<00:06:17.509> as<00:06:17.630> was<00:06:18.259> still<00:06:18.620> a<00:06:18.650> fairly<00:06:18.949> serious<00:06:19.580> storm

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
it as was still a fairly serious storm

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.159 
it as was still a fairly serious storm
system<00:06:20.210> I<00:06:20.330> think<00:06:20.360> this<00:06:20.659> one<00:06:20.840> could<00:06:21.020> be

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
system I think this one could be

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.990 
system I think this one could be
stronger<00:06:21.530> just<00:06:21.919> wrapping<00:06:22.310> it<00:06:22.400> up<00:06:22.550> here<00:06:22.880> this

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
stronger just wrapping it up here this

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.640 
stronger just wrapping it up here this
is<00:06:23.060> actually<00:06:23.360> our<00:06:23.810> thoughts<00:06:24.169> here<00:06:24.469> from

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
is actually our thoughts here from

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.350 
is actually our thoughts here from
western<00:06:24.979> Pacific<00:06:25.280> weather<00:06:25.400> calm<00:06:25.849> a<00:06:25.880> few<00:06:26.180> of<00:06:26.300> us

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
western Pacific weather calm a few of us

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.209 
western Pacific weather calm a few of us
talked<00:06:26.780> about<00:06:26.930> this<00:06:27.319> expecting<00:06:28.130> that

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:28.219 
talked about this expecting that

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.330 
talked about this expecting that
landfall<00:06:28.759> there<00:06:29.599> into<00:06:30.050> Samar<00:06:30.560> as<00:06:30.919> I<00:06:30.949> mentioned

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
landfall there into Samar as I mentioned

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.589 
landfall there into Samar as I mentioned
that<00:06:31.430> cone<00:06:31.639> of<00:06:31.789> air<00:06:31.909> though<00:06:32.120> still<00:06:32.449> could

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 
that cone of air though still could

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:35.290 
that cone of air though still could
waver<00:06:32.840> and<00:06:33.169> then<00:06:33.469> making<00:06:33.949> that<00:06:34.370> northwesterly

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
waver and then making that northwesterly

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.680 
waver and then making that northwesterly
jog<00:06:35.779> into<00:06:36.169> a<00:06:36.380> coal<00:06:36.800> right<00:06:37.279> there<00:06:37.550> over<00:06:38.270> central

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
jog into a coal right there over central

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.230 
jog into a coal right there over central
portions<00:06:39.110> of<00:06:39.169> Luzon<00:06:39.919> that<00:06:40.430> could<00:06:40.729> bring<00:06:41.000> that

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
portions of Luzon that could bring that

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.710 
portions of Luzon that could bring that
rough<00:06:41.479> way

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
rough way

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.640 
rough way
eventually<00:06:42.550> they're<00:06:43.550> by<00:06:43.850> Sunday<00:06:44.780> in<00:06:45.050> across

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
eventually they're by Sunday in across

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.580 
eventually they're by Sunday in across
the<00:06:45.980> manila<00:06:46.460> area<00:06:47.150> but<00:06:47.510> the<00:06:47.960> exact<00:06:48.260> timeline

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
the manila area but the exact timeline

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.410 
the manila area but the exact timeline
still<00:06:49.190> could<00:06:49.370> wave<00:06:49.580> her<00:06:49.610> but<00:06:49.910> I<00:06:49.940> think<00:06:50.180> this<00:06:50.270> is

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:50.420 
still could wave her but I think this is

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.570 
still could wave her but I think this is
going<00:06:50.600> to<00:06:50.720> be<00:06:50.780> the<00:06:50.870> general<00:06:51.170> track<00:06:52.160> or<00:06:52.400> lease

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
going to be the general track or lease
