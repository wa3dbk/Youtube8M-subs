00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.469
 and we are here in a chapter where 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.719
 let's do 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.059
 to begin with we need to have the level 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.250
 of majority number 3 and this obviously 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.930
 achieve as we are seeing here is the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.360
 billiards and number 3 and it really is it 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.250
 they manage to capture and apply and to use 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.020
 any of these we will use 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.100
 cheat with the electron I do not know what it is 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.950
 very funny although it is electro electro 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.340
 electrifies hand in hand and there's the 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.230
 level of pillerÃ­a number 3 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.120

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.800
