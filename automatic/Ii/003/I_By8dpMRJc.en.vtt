00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.580
 here we are with the new 500 l version 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 500 vitaminized that we are used to 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.519
 to see know about available with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.440
 twin air engine with 105 horsepower the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.490
 twin we have already tried on 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.400
 panda lately pop 500 pop with the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.170
 1400 from 95 horses we can't here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.170
 come in because we have a human statue 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.890
 which prevents us from entering the car 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 but there is no problem we go to another 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.250
 500 which is here at our disposal 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.559
 let's go up then take a ride in front 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 behind we go up because I had to show 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.910
 how the infotainment has changed 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.469
 compared to the classic fiat standards i 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.860
 facts is no longer the blue and me but comes 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 resumed the u connect by chrysler then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.020
 a more performing radio version 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.359
 multimedia because here is the entrance 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.739
 usb and auxiliary input in addition to the cd 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.140
 possibility to connect a telephone 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.360
 obviously in bluetooth fair the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.760
 possibility of connecting the tomtom 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.640
 the fact is pretty nice too 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.430
 always from the display that is touchscreen 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.009
 look at the details of consumption autonomies 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.470
 etcetera etc. and look also at the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.299
 We talk about our driving ecology 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.520
 very nice interior the dashboard the same 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.590
 body color here controls 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.229
 of air conditioning there is so much space to 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.420
 board because the car is very high la 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.810
 the pavilion is also very high 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.970
 the most pro Luke to frame the logo 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.740
 past technologies will recognize 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.079
 the logo of audio beats then a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.050
 sound system with flakes 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.670
 very nice the roof in 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.490
 inside you that you are other manages to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.770
 resume it even from above when grown up 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.010
 brightness inside we send see 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.810
 the trunk since this panda is very much 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.250
 great is this when you use this 500 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.790
 is very large 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.170
 the trunk and consequently very large 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.090
 up below there is a well a 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.290
 second bottom let's call it so let's see 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.020
 if we can put it back that 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.030
 possibility of breaking down the last seats 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:20.940
 What I will like to see the front of 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.440
 this 500 because it takes over that of the 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.440
 five hundred classic also here 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440
 vitaminized 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.690

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.690
