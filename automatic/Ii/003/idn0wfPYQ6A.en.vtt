00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.960
 good friends of youtube today I'm going to 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:11.000
 teach how to pass the English language 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.740
 because you read Spanish and sometimes 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.289
 in the run you are left in English for 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.420
 I'll show you good today 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.260
 equally as a Spanish past if you already 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.510
 crystal in English very easy 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.520
 good where you have saved the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.310
 game that can be the local disk is in 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.840
 the local disk of you now in my pc 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.440
 and you know where is a game 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.010
 then for the team 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.199
 local disk 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.000
 yang where you have it saved 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.409
 suddenly you do not have it on disk 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.359
 local but in library in downloads what 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.000
 I know but in this case I have it 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.400
 local disk yes 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.470
 I will have it 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.440
 in this case I have it here in 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:06.009
 the for speed the run 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.970
 enter and it says data after win32 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.970
 after 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.110
 read the blog, I'm pointing them out 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.510
 after 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.070
 let's take all the files that 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:27.940
 they begin by where here it says is the 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.130
 ok where is the the digan is that 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.540
 means Spanish but before that 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.540
 let's create a new folder 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 before that we are going to create a new 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.040
 folder that we will call it as 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.350
 you want but in this case others 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.400
 I'm going to call you other languages 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.400
 less Spanish 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.710
 - it 's for picamos 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:04.070
 because this video has to be short 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 well we started and we take all the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.940
 that are not Spanish we put them in 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.840
 this folder for example here rup 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.709
 means Russian 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.709
 we move 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.220
 to the folder 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.530
 this also good 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.590
 we keep moving 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.730
 it's a bit delayed, be patient 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.920
 can but this is mexico 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.220
 but you want the espanyol of 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.659
 Spain or in the shot equally if 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.290
 They want any Spanish that comes out with 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:45.810
 all choose the is the is because that is 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.760
 the most suitable for any part 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:53.340
 where you are is already good 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.340
 in Argentina , Spain 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.110
 good where you are in Mexico that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.980
 is the most indicated because it is like the one 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.660
 goes with everyone they attend in Spanish the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:13.270
 Colombia but as I told you 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.430
 they are continuing to do the same operation 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.340
 they have to give them four files that 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.770
 Say you are against espanyol ask for this 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.890
 example of English 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:28.330
 keep uploading 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.330
 of English but beware that this is 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.280
 the one that I'm pointing to the Spanish as well 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.200
 that if he could not get in yes no 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.580
 they do not fit the operation and 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.580
 you can see the game 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.360
 or they will not run the game until 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.049
 you take everything out of the folder 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.810
 so we better do everything right so we do not 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.050
 have problems later 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.220
 you know all of Spanish care 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.220
 because here I you Spanish 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.440
 all all but those in Spanish for 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.720
 this has to have extreme concentration 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.240
 because you can tell it very easy 20 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.370
 because one becomes deconcentrated and believes that 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.280
 they are all files and it happened to me 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.230
 that and then it 's up to repeat 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.350
 and it is better to do everything right at once 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.940
 so as not to have to repeat what 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.940
 good still taking the files 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.180
 he keeps telling us to stay 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.840
 remember 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.220
 4 of Spanish but just in case if 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.090
 you want to check that one does not have 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.449
 spa 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.930
 Well, that's Spanish or here, how it comes out is 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.150
 more later 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.280
 they can 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.680
 enter your folder as you 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.270
 they put like in this case I put it 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.270
 other languages less spam 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.030
 so you can already take these three 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:17.180
 objects for 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.180
 these four objects to streamline 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.340
 to each eye because there is Spanish here is 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.009
 Mexican mail but good and only us 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.919
 matter right now 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.409
 we let the wait there because it is not that 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.300
 be Mexican but another language no other and 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.119
 that we do not care more about us 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.400
 josette less and just catch those that 

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:39.639
 we want to catch 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.770
 well we keep repeating the operation 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:46.379
 to be with 4 as I told them 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.660
 when you're in English where you 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:52.099
 it implies clicking on gray which means 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.099
 from Spanish English 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.560
 Well here, I know, but let's say 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.960
 you do not know very well then that 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.940
 will bring caribe de de he has nothing 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.180
 what to do with Spanish only has to 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.350
 go out 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:14.390
 is for then is that is as here is 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:17.900
 I'm going, it's 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.660
 Spanish that is the queen that and here 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.230
 it only comes out of it does not bring it is not 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.420
 Spanish 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.420
 then rectify each one for a 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.870
 but very carefully 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.950
 well we already saw that nobody says then if 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.810
 you want you can put that corpse 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.620
 that comes out and nothing comes out 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.150
 then if they want to do it faster 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:54.130
 or slow or as you want it 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.020
 to do here, all of them have already 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.880
 espanyol that you put is you leave 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.470
 three files in total that are the 

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.660
 same 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.160
 well it came out of the folder in this 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.830
 case because I put spa 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.920
 good 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.920
 and you can start playing your game
