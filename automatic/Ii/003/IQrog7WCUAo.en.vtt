programming<00:00:09.059> languages<00:00:09.360> are<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:10.230> basic

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
programming languages are the basic

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.650 
programming languages are the basic
means<00:00:10.830> that<00:00:11.190> people<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.910> communicate<00:00:12.180> to

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
means that people can communicate to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.260 
means that people can communicate to
computers<00:00:13.050> my<00:00:13.500> job<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.250> twofold<00:00:14.549> number<00:00:15.090> one

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:15.270 
computers my job is twofold number one

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.390 
computers my job is twofold number one
I'm<00:00:15.719> trying<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.410> take<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:16.770> existing<00:00:17.280> language

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
I'm trying to take an existing language

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.930 
I'm trying to take an existing language
and<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.560> translate<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.800> language<00:00:20.490> into

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
and then translate that language into

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.400 
and then translate that language into
something<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.630> computer<00:00:22.080> actually<00:00:22.170> can

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
something that a computer actually can

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.620 
something that a computer actually can
execute<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.519> other<00:00:23.670> aspect<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.119> well<00:00:24.420> if

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
execute and the other aspect is well if

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.210 
execute and the other aspect is well if
you<00:00:24.750> have<00:00:24.869> new<00:00:25.019> problems<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.769> might<00:00:25.980> actually

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you have new problems you might actually

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.370 
you have new problems you might actually
need<00:00:26.550> new<00:00:26.759> languages<00:00:27.240> right<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.019> we<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.259> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
need new languages right so we have to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109 
need new languages right so we have to
design<00:00:28.529> new<00:00:29.130> languages<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.759> have<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> come<00:00:30.089> up

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
design new languages we have to come up

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.269 
design new languages we have to come up
with<00:00:30.210> new<00:00:30.390> abstractions<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.250> course

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
with new abstractions and then of course

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.820 
with new abstractions and then of course
also<00:00:32.730> implement<00:00:33.360> these<00:00:33.510> new<00:00:33.960> abstractions<00:00:34.380> in

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
also implement these new abstractions in

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.430 
also implement these new abstractions in
translators<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.060> our<00:00:36.300> idea<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> basically

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
translators so our idea is to basically

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.230 
translators so our idea is to basically
first<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.310> all<00:00:38.430> come<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.790> with<00:00:38.910> new

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
first of all come up with new

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.050 
first of all come up with new
programming<00:00:40.130> abstractions<00:00:41.130> to<00:00:41.220> use<00:00:41.730> phones

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
programming abstractions to use phones

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.020 
programming abstractions to use phones
last<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> optimize<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:44.040> power<00:00:44.430> consumption

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
last to optimize for power consumption

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.440 
last to optimize for power consumption
so<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.630> had<00:00:45.750> developed<00:00:46.080> now<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.470> new<00:00:46.800> spatial

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
so we had developed now a new spatial

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.400 
so we had developed now a new spatial
notion<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> programming<00:00:49.080> language<00:00:49.380> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
notion in the programming language that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
notion in the programming language that
you<00:00:49.560> can<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.070> talk<00:00:50.310> about<00:00:50.660> services

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you can actually can talk about services

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.480 
you can actually can talk about services
that<00:00:51.870> are<00:00:51.960> available<00:00:52.040> on<00:00:53.040> such<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.250> dynamic

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
that are available on such a dynamic

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.360 
that are available on such a dynamic
network<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.690> driver<00:00:55.470> application<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.190> call

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
network one driver application we call

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.890 
network one driver application we call
says<00:00:56.580> these<00:00:56.700> are<00:00:56.760> applications<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
says these are applications that

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.870 
says these are applications that
showcase<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.890> potential<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.820> new

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
showcase the potential of this new

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.030 
showcase the potential of this new
architecture<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.320> call<00:01:01.470> Amber<00:01:01.800> Alert

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
architecture is what we call Amber Alert

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.579 
architecture is what we call Amber Alert
right<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:03.240> amber<00:01:03.540> alert<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.900> actually<00:01:04.199> system

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
right so amber alert is actually system

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580 
right so amber alert is actually system
that<00:01:05.339> tries<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.759> track<00:01:06.150> down<00:01:06.590> abducted

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that tries to track down abducted

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
that tries to track down abducted
children<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.790> how<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.030> could<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.390> use

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
children so now how we could we use

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.840 
children so now how we could we use
these<00:01:09.780> dynamic<00:01:10.229> networks<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.860> cell<00:01:11.160> phones<00:01:11.400> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
these dynamic networks of cell phones to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
these dynamic networks of cell phones to
do<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.660> answer<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.290> might<00:01:13.470> want

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
do this and the answer is you might want

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.010 
do this and the answer is you might want
to<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:13.890> out<00:01:14.070> there<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.780> for<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> specific

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to go out there and for a specific

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
to go out there and for a specific
search<00:01:16.500> area<00:01:16.890> let's<00:01:17.070> assume<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.700> part<00:01:17.940> of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
search area let's assume it's a part of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.720 
search area let's assume it's a part of
a<00:01:18.120> town<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:18.750> ask<00:01:18.990> well<00:01:19.370> can<00:01:20.370> you<00:01:20.490> please

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
a town and then ask well can you please

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.850 
a town and then ask well can you please
take<00:01:21.120> a<00:01:21.180> picture<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:22.380> camera<00:01:22.740> out

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
take a picture or is there camera out

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
take a picture or is there camera out
there<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.370> sees<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.670> red<00:01:24.060> car<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.540> red<00:01:24.720> sedan

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
there that sees a red car a red sedan

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.550 
there that sees a red car a red sedan
and<00:01:26.060> once<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> picture<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.659> taken<00:01:27.870> this<00:01:28.320> might

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
and once the picture is taken this might

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.380 
and once the picture is taken this might
actually<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.130> sent<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.790> specific

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
actually be then sent to a specific

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.700 
actually be then sent to a specific
piece<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.690> software<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.200> able<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> analyze

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
piece of software is able to analyze

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.490 
piece of software is able to analyze
this<00:01:32.610> image<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.270> says<00:01:33.540> ok<00:01:33.900> yes<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.440> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
this image and then says ok yes there is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.320 
this image and then says ok yes there is
an<00:01:34.620> interesting<00:01:35.040> car<00:01:35.760> at<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.030> intersection

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
an interesting car at that intersection

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.360 
an interesting car at that intersection
and<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.050> information<00:01:37.440> in<00:01:37.770> turn<00:01:38.010> could<00:01:38.250> be

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
and that information in turn could be

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.680 
and that information in turn could be
shared<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.820> other<00:01:39.060> people<00:01:39.120> around<00:01:39.540> this

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
shared with other people around this

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.880 
shared with other people around this
intersection<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.440> course<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.800> your

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
intersection of course with your

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.430 
intersection of course with your
authorities<00:01:41.400> initially<00:01:41.940> we<00:01:42.330> start<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.750> Java

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
authorities initially we start with Java

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.100 
authorities initially we start with Java
and<00:01:43.650> then<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.310> thinking<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.760> well<00:01:45.330> we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and then just the thinking of well we

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
and then just the thinking of well we
need<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.560> able<00:01:46.650> to<00:01:46.830> talk<00:01:46.950> about<00:01:47.220> space<00:01:47.460> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
need to be able to talk about space that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.120 
need to be able to talk about space that
was<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.180> initial<00:01:48.540> start<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.799> actually

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
was the initial start so we actually

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.940 
was the initial start so we actually
have<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.640> an<00:01:50.790> infrastructure<00:01:51.270> where<00:01:51.479> he<00:01:51.570> sent

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
have now an infrastructure where he sent

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
have now an infrastructure where he sent
programs<00:01:52.950> into<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.090> network<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.290> might

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
programs into that network and it might

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.860 
programs into that network and it might
jump<00:01:56.340> from<00:01:56.580> one<00:01:56.760> cell<00:01:57.180> phone<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> next

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
jump from one cell phone to the next

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.380 
jump from one cell phone to the next
cell<00:01:58.020> phone<00:01:58.229> does<00:01:59.010> its<00:01:59.220> thing<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:01:59.820> comes

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
cell phone does its thing and then comes

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.469 
cell phone does its thing and then comes
back<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.229> gliders<00:02:01.650> as<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.520> they

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
back the gliders as you see here they

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
back the gliders as you see here they
are<00:02:03.600> commercial<00:02:03.930> products<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.890> buy

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
are commercial products so you can buy

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.310 
are commercial products so you can buy
them<00:02:05.310> however<00:02:06.180> turns<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.810> there<00:02:07.020> right

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
them however turns out that there right

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
them however turns out that there right
now<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:08.069> hard<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.399> program<00:02:08.729> for<00:02:09.360> shemagh

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
now are very hard to program for shemagh

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
now are very hard to program for shemagh
refers<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.409> first<00:02:10.649> insight<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
refers the first insight was that the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.330 
refers the first insight was that the
current<00:02:12.390> programming<00:02:12.840> model<00:02:13.650> was<00:02:13.799> very<00:02:14.069> hard

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
current programming model was very hard

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.059 
current programming model was very hard
to<00:02:14.400> understand<00:02:14.939> so<00:02:15.749> we<00:02:15.959> came<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.349> with<00:02:16.499> a<00:02:16.529> clean

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
to understand so we came up with a clean

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.849 
to understand so we came up with a clean
slate<00:02:17.400> approach<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:19.200> order<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.469> do<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.709> we

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:19.859 
slate approach in order to do this we

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:20.720 
slate approach in order to do this we
had<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> develop<00:02:20.249> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
had to develop the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.699 
had to develop the
language<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.360> they<00:02:21.840> actually<00:02:21.989> had<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.379> also

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
language and they actually had to also

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.890 
language and they actually had to also
put<00:02:22.920> in<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.129> new<00:02:23.250> board<00:02:23.550> into<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> existing

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
put in a new board into the existing

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380 
put in a new board into the existing
system<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.340> design<00:02:26.640> challenge<00:02:27.120> was<00:02:27.360> that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
system and the design challenge was that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.630 
system and the design challenge was that
we<00:02:27.780> didn't<00:02:28.290> want<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.560> throw<00:02:28.769> out<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.159> existing

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
we didn't want to throw out the existing

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.690 
we didn't want to throw out the existing
infrastructure<00:02:30.170> but<00:02:31.170> instead<00:02:31.769> cannot<00:02:32.159> tag<00:02:32.489> on

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
infrastructure but instead cannot tag on

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.270 
infrastructure but instead cannot tag on
our<00:02:32.849> new<00:02:33.120> infrastructure<00:02:33.659> so<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.650> users

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
our new infrastructure so that users

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.289 
our new infrastructure so that users
were<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.459> little<00:02:35.610> bit<00:02:35.760> afraid<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.180> our

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
were a little bit afraid of our

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.270 
were a little bit afraid of our
infrastructure<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:37.290> use<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.650> old<00:02:37.799> one<00:02:38.040> or

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
infrastructure can use the old one or

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.580 
infrastructure can use the old one or
slowly<00:02:38.790> migrate<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> new<00:02:40.019> infrastructure

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
slowly migrate to the new infrastructure

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.800 
slowly migrate to the new infrastructure
I<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.310> small<00:02:41.549> group<00:02:41.670> of<00:02:41.879> undergrads<00:02:42.360> whose

I have a small group of undergrads whose

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.250 
I have a small group of undergrads whose
only<00:02:43.260> job<00:02:43.379> it<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.799> basically<00:02:44.340> sit<00:02:44.580> down<00:02:44.790> and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
only job it is basically sit down and

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.460 
only job it is basically sit down and
thinking<00:02:46.260> about<00:02:46.560> well<00:02:46.920> if<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.780> iPhone<00:02:48.780> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
thinking about well if I have iPhone and

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.830 
thinking about well if I have iPhone and
I<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.739> Nokia's<00:02:50.489> these<00:02:50.819> kind<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.180> machines<00:02:51.629> or

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
I have Nokia's these kind of machines or

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.930 
I have Nokia's these kind of machines or
phones<00:02:52.049> what<00:02:52.379> to<00:02:52.530> do<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.730> came<00:02:53.910> up

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
phones what to do with it and I came up

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.910 
phones what to do with it and I came up
with<00:02:54.060> some<00:02:54.480> interesting<00:02:54.840> applications<00:02:54.959> seems

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
with some interesting applications seems

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.619 
with some interesting applications seems
to<00:02:56.040> be<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.310> students<00:02:57.000> are<00:02:57.090> very<00:02:57.239> concerned

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
to be that students are very concerned

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.180 
to be that students are very concerned
with<00:02:57.780> getting<00:02:57.870> home<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.200> time<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.890> there's<00:02:59.099> a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
with getting home on time so there's a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.920 
with getting home on time so there's a
the<00:02:59.519> bus<00:02:59.670> application<00:03:00.329> where<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.569> kind<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
the bus application where they kind of

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.170 
the bus application where they kind of
trying<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> find<00:03:01.500> out<00:03:01.650> where<00:03:02.340> specific<00:03:02.790> buses

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
trying to find out where specific buses

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.199 
trying to find out where specific buses
are<00:03:03.390> how<00:03:03.599> busy<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.069> bus<00:03:05.069> stops<00:03:05.640> are<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.180> on

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
are how busy the bus stops are and so on

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.630 
are how busy the bus stops are and so on
and<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.480> forth<00:03:06.720> one<00:03:07.079> aspect<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:08.220> all<00:03:08.430> this

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and so forth one aspect of of all this

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.610 
and so forth one aspect of of all this
particular<00:03:09.569> programming<00:03:09.930> language<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.440> can

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
particular programming language I can

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.349 
particular programming language I can
envision<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.549> build<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.970> very

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
envision that you can build a very

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.140 
envision that you can build a very
limited<00:03:13.579> program<00:03:14.579> language<00:03:14.879> meaning<00:03:15.060> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
limited program language meaning a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.849 
limited program language meaning a
language<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.660> lets<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:15.959> say<00:03:16.170> only<00:03:16.500> very

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
language that lets you say only very

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.860 
language that lets you say only very
simple<00:03:17.069> things<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.790> are<00:03:17.940> very<00:03:18.180> safe<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.569> do

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
simple things that are very safe to do

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.680 
simple things that are very safe to do
and<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.920> might<00:03:20.129> be<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> tool<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:21.269> give<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
and this might be a tool to give to

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.170 
and this might be a tool to give to
probably<00:03:22.650> not<00:03:22.799> elementary<00:03:23.340> school<00:03:23.730> kids<00:03:24.000> but

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
probably not elementary school kids but

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.150 
probably not elementary school kids but
middle<00:03:24.450> school<00:03:24.660> kids<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.650> that<00:03:25.680> they<00:03:25.950> can

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
middle school kids so that they can

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.370 
middle school kids so that they can
actually<00:03:26.310> write<00:03:26.669> their<00:03:26.970> missions<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.630> we

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
actually write their missions and we

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.409 
actually write their missions and we
could<00:03:28.650> go<00:03:28.799> ahead<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:29.370> execute<00:03:29.819> them<00:03:30.090> without

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
could go ahead and execute them without

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.839 
could go ahead and execute them without
being<00:03:30.690> worried<00:03:31.079> that<00:03:31.260> they<00:03:31.470> actually<00:03:31.849> lose

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
being worried that they actually lose

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.940 
being worried that they actually lose
our<00:03:33.090> equipment<00:03:33.569> so<00:03:33.780> basically<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:34.829> an

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
our equipment so basically it's an

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800 
our equipment so basically it's an
enabling<00:03:35.310> technology<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:36.269> bring<00:03:36.510> science

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
enabling technology to bring science

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.629 
enabling technology to bring science
into<00:03:37.470> things<00:03:37.769> like<00:03:37.859> middle<00:03:38.250> school<00:03:38.430> or<00:03:38.609> high
