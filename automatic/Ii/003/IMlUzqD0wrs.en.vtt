00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 so welcome a round mw2 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.230
 have always wanted some again 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.150
 is the player he plays with nascar 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.849
 I think we have until last night 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 in playing at nine or take so 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.210
 no longer know old lobby had 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.100
 with two banners grabbed on the place where 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.539
 You can say ok the hack nobody 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.130
 and since you can tear the murders 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.720
 Unfortunately I had the job of his here 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.660
 there I was actually incident for all 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.949
 played and left 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.150
 gameplay is pretty cool so is now 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.970
 not such a killer gameplay from the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.960
 mittweidaer commando I have life 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.210
 screamed corrosive properly 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.660
 Well, many would like to object 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 today it's about my upload so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.370
 upload calendar can not say anything here 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.750
 but to my order an upload rate of me 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750
 actually a lot last time 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.800
 high so sometimes two videos a day 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 I even have three 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.219
 uploaded some celebrate that some 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.539
 find that maybe too much and me 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.370
 I already thought about it now 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.160
 that we should screw down so so 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.629
 the upload that I have so earlier from 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.010
 few months I have now but so 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.570
 maybe I had in the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.970
 week time carved out a video or 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.110
 one week have two videos you have 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.880
 people think so if I can do that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.790
 so again to reintroduce it 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.720
 instead of we rauszuhauen so many videos 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.880
 It's because I'm upset 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.540
 have videos to do that to me 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.520
 right mood 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 that I am going to earn more money 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 did you also clear that you know her 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 Yes all 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 but I'm just more or 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.960
 less fun and less 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.280
 I have and then I just have 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.790
 perhaps because so many come 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.009
 videos 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.299
 I wonder if I should do more 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.530
 So I do not know how many animals 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.170
 if I stop now sometimes 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 knock it out the second day 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.780
 I think that's cool 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.490
 maybe it's as much as I know 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.470
 Can not you write one 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 comments and I wanted to ask 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.909
 when he has the upload times 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.979
 So wanted when the videos released 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 will have to be 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.829
 if shit on it so now I have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.700
 I think if I have two videos and 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.380
 so 15 and 18 o'clock think so 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.250
 I always like that when I'm three 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.520
 upload videos finished so 12 15 and 18 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.680
 Clock 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.299
 because the so good times so me 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.970
 actually find that the whole 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.170
 okay is not time between 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.420
 So a few hours in between 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.440
 I think it's really cool if you can 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.760
 You can see the other way 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.489
 Comments write when you are so 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720
 the upload and the eighth the videos 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.260
 would wish and what time so 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.510
 approximately 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.819
 So 12 15 18 clock I always find completely 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.050
 well, yes, I already think so 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.580
 that will do so 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.440
 besides, of course, has completely different 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.819
 Suggestions may show the eight 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.160
 clock in the morning or something but I believe that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.650
 is even a little bit earlier then 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.489
 19 o'clock station know too late so no 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.150
 You can guess the comments 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.440
 write 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.360
 what that looks like mw2 I want now 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.720
 same time see if I a good lobby 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.920
 But I think on the place but I hope 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.420
 is unlikely to have the type 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.560
 I did not think there were red 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.900
 point but I could somehow 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.400
 do not shoot down the stryker hc's about 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.620
 a bit sour which provider 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.739
 knecht barely us the kids is a top 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.989
 gun and there I was when I saw that 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.220
 I indeed moved all the people away what 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.170
 actually pretty easy now though 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 i was bad with magna i have to 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.230
 Just keep a little watch that 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.450
 I can knock the swan out because of that 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.600
 I've already been at 85 points or 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.209
 So 8500 I was a bit 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.260
 I thought carefully too, hold now 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.329
 a bit back so i want to go here 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.329
 knock it out and scores then I think 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.970
 against like 37 co2 or so is a whole 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.989
 good gameplay 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.459
 I hope now fallen seems to 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.010
 the comments which upload you are 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:39.170
 you would wish and then I would 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.170
 say, skin in until next time
