I pulled the covers off these lights

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
I pulled the covers off these lights
here<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.570> trying<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> make<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.110> brighter

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
I got the other one right there as you
can<00:02:21.420> see<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.260> lot<00:02:22.500> smaller<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:26.040> when<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.520> put

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
can see it's a lot smaller so when I put

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
can see it's a lot smaller so when I put
this<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:28.050> has<00:02:29.959> these<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.110> step

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this on it has these little step

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.500 
this on it has these little step
stabilizer<00:02:32.130> links<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.819> in<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.360> bottom

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
stabilizer links that go in the bottom

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.259 
stabilizer links that go in the bottom
of<00:02:33.720> your<00:02:33.780> control<00:02:34.170> arm<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.680> onto<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:36.180> it

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
of your control arm and onto here and it

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.020 
of your control arm and onto here and it
seemed<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.720> have<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:37.530> just<00:02:38.489> wasn't<00:02:38.700> able<00:02:38.880> to

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
seemed like I have I just wasn't able to

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.790 
seemed like I have I just wasn't able to
turn<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.360> wheel<00:02:39.540> enough<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.170> had<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.530> put<00:02:40.680> my

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
turn the wheel enough I had to put my

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.470 
turn the wheel enough I had to put my
tires<00:02:41.069> on<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.519> everything<00:02:41.849> checked<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.330> but

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
tires on and everything checked it but

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.650 
tires on and everything checked it but
it<00:02:43.230> seemed<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.590> was<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.800> little<00:02:44.010> tight<00:02:44.220> so

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
it seemed like it was a little tight so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.400 
it seemed like it was a little tight so
I'm<00:02:45.660> wondering<00:02:45.900> what

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
I'm wondering what

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.800 
I'm wondering what
when<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> get<00:02:46.680> my<00:02:46.920> lineman<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.670> need<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.690> get

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
when I get my lineman I need to get

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.009 
when I get my lineman I need to get
these<00:02:48.959> upper<00:02:49.410> control<00:02:49.769> arms<00:02:50.630> Reif<00:02:51.630> gemmed

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
these upper control arms Reif gemmed

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.900 
these upper control arms Reif gemmed
shape<00:02:52.920> here<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.459> this<00:02:53.670> side<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> no<00:02:56.549> price

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
shape here on this side so no price

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.110 
shape here on this side so no price
definitely<00:02:57.660> has<00:02:57.989> some<00:02:58.200> alignment<00:02:58.500> issues

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
definitely has some alignment issues

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.820 
definitely has some alignment issues
there<00:03:00.120> as<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.450> see<00:03:00.599> I<00:03:00.630> got<00:03:00.930> there's<00:03:01.560> quite

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
there as you can see I got there's quite

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.910 
there as you can see I got there's quite
a<00:03:01.860> few<00:03:01.950> shims<00:03:02.370> there<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.319> on<00:03:04.319> this<00:03:04.470> side<00:03:06.920> it's

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
a few shims there and on this side it's

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280 
a few shims there and on this side it's
all<00:03:08.099> crazy<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:08.790> I<00:03:09.180> don't<00:03:09.840> know<00:03:09.930> nothing<00:03:10.230> about

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
all crazy so I don't know nothing about

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.789 
all crazy so I don't know nothing about
that

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
that

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.970 
that
get<00:03:11.489> those<00:03:11.670> riche<00:03:12.000> m'd<00:03:12.330> and<00:03:12.660> get<00:03:13.530> an<00:03:13.620> alignment

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.130 

hopefully<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.130> good<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.459> go<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.940> get<00:03:18.870> some<00:03:19.019> new

hopefully be good to go I get some new

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.810 
hopefully be good to go I get some new
tires<00:03:19.380> on<00:03:19.799> there<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:21.590> did<00:03:22.590> order<00:03:22.829> my<00:03:23.190> exhaust<00:03:23.549> I

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
tires on there I did order my exhaust I

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.819 
tires on there I did order my exhaust I
got<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:25.040> putting<00:03:26.040> duals<00:03:26.549> on<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.590> 40<00:03:28.590> series

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
got a putting duals on it 40 series

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.720 
got a putting duals on it 40 series
flowmasters<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.660> I've<00:03:30.900> got<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.799> got<00:03:32.459> two

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
flowmasters and I've got the I got two

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.789 
flowmasters and I've got the I got two
and<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.940> half<00:03:33.090> inch<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:34.079> I'm<00:03:34.230> putting<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
and a half inch and I'm putting the

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.729 
and a half inch and I'm putting the
cutouts<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.489> there<00:03:35.760> with<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.660> electric<00:03:37.470> dump

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
cutouts on there with the electric dump

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.009 
cutouts on there with the electric dump
so<00:03:38.069> I'll<00:03:38.190> be<00:03:38.370> able<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.579> put<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> little<00:03:39.720> button

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
so I'll be able to put a little button

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.650 
so I'll be able to put a little button
on<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> dash<00:03:40.560> or<00:03:40.950> hidden<00:03:41.340> somewhere<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.120> open

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
on the dash or hidden somewhere and open

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.740 
on the dash or hidden somewhere and open
it<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.810> wide<00:03:43.200> open<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.660> that'll<00:03:45.660> be<00:03:45.720> pretty

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
it to wide open so that'll be pretty

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.660 
it to wide open so that'll be pretty
cool<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.530> that's<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:47.069> stuff<00:03:47.370> should<00:03:47.519> be

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
cool so that's that stuff should be

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.750 
cool so that's that stuff should be
coming<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.150> get<00:03:48.480> my<00:03:48.630> alignment<00:03:49.010> get<00:03:50.010> get<00:03:50.670> all

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
coming in get my alignment get get all

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.940 
coming in get my alignment get get all
