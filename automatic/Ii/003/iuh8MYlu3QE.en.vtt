00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.900
 2.1.0 update content 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.690
 Niefarem, everyone, welcome to the update 2.1.0 guide 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.790
 My name is Brandi Camo, the name is Nefertis. 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.330
 I am the representative of the Diablo III community and todayâ€™s host. 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.930
 We will introduce the first major revision of the "The Soul of the Soul" in this film. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.120
 Let us take a quick look 

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.185
 Season 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.860
 The biggest feature of this revision is the competition system. We call it the season. 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.670
 The season is similar to the second generation ladder 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.190
 Let the heroes come back to practice with the new character from level 1. 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.540
 The season is a completely separate game mode 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.480
 Season character has a separate storage box 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 Craftsman progress, gold coins and peak level 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 You can create season roles in normal or expert mode 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.290
 Let's talk about the season reward. 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.330
 Many new legendary items will be launched every season 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.330
 Season characters will have the opportunity to get these items first 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.760
 You don't have to worry if the season doesn't suit your appetite. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.440
 At the end of the season, these items will be added to the list of general treasures. 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.490
 So everyone has a chance to hit 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.460
 Participants of each season will receive 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.560
 One of the new unique shaped suits 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 Every season you make, you will get one of the new special suits. 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.600
 So come and enjoy with us, you can show off with cool equipment! 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.860
 Warfare achievements are unique achievements of the season. These tasks include a variety of challenges. 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.970
 From the painful VI to defeat Mather 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.180
 Run the entire story mode in 1 hour 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.500
 Both ordinary and expert mode heroes can perform battles 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.700
 So you can choose the preferred mode to challenge 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.830
 Warfare will give you achievements and add your season total points. 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.130
 Achievement points will be recorded in the ladder list of each region 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.130
 Take the lead in winning 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.300
 The first thousand players who have completed the battle achievements 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.960
 Will join the ranks of the immortal heroes of the season ladder list 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.430
 After the season, your season role 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.500
 Will become a normal or expert mode hero depending on the type of character you created during the season. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.700
 The various rewards you won during the season include items, gold coins, artisan recipes. 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.700
 Peak experience and achievements, we will all transfer to the general game 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.300
 And send the season storage box items to you. 

00:02:32.024 --> 00:02:35.024
 Grandeur 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.630
 In addition to the season, we will also launch a grand secret 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.300
 The magnificent mystery is the competitive version of the Niefarem secret with a progress timer. 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.620
 You must summon and defeat the Guardian of the Supreme in 15 minutes. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.830
 The quicker the action, the richer the reward 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.660
 To enter the grandeur 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.220
 You have to hit the secret test stone from the guardian of the general mystery. 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.880
 Then click on the town's Nefarrem stone monument to enter the trial environment 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.800
 Trial is a small arena 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.160
 See how players can beat a few waves of enemies to assess player strength 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.660
 After completing this trial 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.870
 You will receive a magnificent stone that matches the difficulty of your trial. 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.560
 Want to create a magnificent secret portal 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.200
 You only need to use the magnificent stone of the Neferem stone in the town. 

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:16.024
 Is your strength enough to survive these tests? 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.260
 The magnificent secret is tracked with a new progress bar 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.330
 Compare the number of monsters you killed and the time remaining 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.110
 And will give different progress according to the blood volume and difficulty of the monster. 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.260
 So defeat the elite and the warriors 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.380
 Will be more rewarding than defeating ordinary blame 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.110
 Please note that the monsters of the magnificent mystery will not be treasured. 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.890
 The treasure of the whole magnificent mystery is changed into 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.050
 Finally dropped by the Guardian of the Guardian 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.090
 The grandeur of the mystery is so challenging that you should develop a strategy 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.420
 Keep the following rules in mind when challenging the grandeur 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.490
 Some resurrection and transmission functions will fail 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.940
 And you can't change equipment or skills in a magnificent environment. 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.700
 Therefore, it is necessary to make a sand table beforehand! 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.450
 After you defeat the magnificent Guardian, the new NPC Aich will show up. 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.300
 If you complete the grandeur within the time limit 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.300
 You will be able to choose two rewards 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.810
 Have the opportunity to upgrade existing legendary gems 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.830
 Or get a more advanced grandeur stone 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.990
 In case your time in the magnificent mystery is over 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.400
 The Guardian of the Mystery will be automatically summoned 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.900
 After defeating the Guardian of the Guardian, you can't continue to explore the magnificent mystery. 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.200
 But you still have the opportunity to upgrade the legendary gem 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.650
 Completing a high-level grandeur has the opportunity to upgrade the gem to several levels. 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.530
 Your goals will be more rewarding when you set your goals! 

00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:37.554
 Ladder list 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.110
 In order to support the season and the grandeur, we added the ladder function to each system. 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.860
 These ladders allow players to track their progress. 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.510
 Such as grandeur, season achievement points and season battle achievements 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.960
 Specially designed to provide a wealth of detailed information 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.630
 The ladder list allows you to compare your progress with friends and clan members in the same area. 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.960
 Each ladder list tracks the progress in a slightly different way. 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.360
 The magnificent secret ladder list will show the hero rankings of expert and normal modes. 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.310
 And the seasons of the season and the non-season 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.550
 In addition, you can also rank from the team way. 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.160
 Single player mode for two, three and four team models for each class 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.500
 Because the achievements of the war and the achievements of the season are unique characteristics of the season. 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.060
 These categories of ladders will only track the season role information. 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.730
 Warfare achievements and achievement points are shared by all accounts 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.260
 Even some challenges require completion in a specific mode 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.430
 There is no need to distinguish between normal mode and expert mode information. 

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:41.054
 Item update 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.010
 Although the 2.1.0 update file modifies many items 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.360
 We want to highlight a few specific major changes. 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.620
 First, the basic damage of all two-handed weapons will increase. 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.230
 This damage change will go back to the past 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.880
 Any existing two-handed weapons will be updated automatically 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.650
 We also add unique capabilities to several existing legendary items. 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.630
 Existing versions of these legendary items will not be updated in the future and will not have these new capabilities. 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.340
 So you don't need to reserve these items for this purpose. 

00:06:10.164 --> 00:06:13.564
 New scene 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.460
 Have you ever thought about where the stolen treasure Brin was sent? 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.260
 You don't have to guess again! 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.410
 After the 2.1.0 update file is launched, every time you defeat the pirate Boblin 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.290
 He will have a very low chance to leave the portal so that you can go to the Treasures 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.860
 This mysterious area has dangerous new enemies 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.170
 There are rich treasures that you can't imagine at all, so don't let Goblin slip away! 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.430
 We also add new scenes to the Nifarem secrets. 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.010
 Sewage road 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.650
 The sewer is originally designed as a sewer for Wesma 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.080
 Although I was unable to add this scene to Chapter 5 when I launched "The Soul of the Soul" 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.730
 You now have a chance to explore this corrupt and wet sewer 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.180
 It will appear in any grandeur and general secrets 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.670
 The tour of update file 2.1.0 is coming to an end. 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.660
 In addition to the above highlights 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.230
 You can also get more information in the update file so be sure to check it out! 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.230
 Welcome everyone to share their views on this update in the Diablo III forum 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.830
 We are closely preparing for the first season and hope everyone can share the event. 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.400
 Thank you for watching us at San Seiya!
