gonna need the 3 1 by 1 cylinder pieces

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
gonna need the 3 1 by 1 cylinder pieces
and<00:00:25.250> then<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.460> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.640> need<00:00:26.820> a

and then you're going to need a
headlight<00:00:27.269> brick<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.810> then<00:00:28.470> you're<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
headlight brick and then you're going to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
headlight brick and then you're going to
build<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.130> twice<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.880> you're<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.480> going

by 4 plates and a 1 by 2 plate and you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.729 
by 4 plates and a 1 by 2 plate and you
stack<00:00:37.950> them<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.960> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.140> attach<00:00:40.440> them

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
stack them like this you can attach them

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.979 
stack them like this you can attach them
to<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.250> two<00:00:41.760> headlight<00:00:42.120> bricks<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.780> make<00:00:42.809> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
to the two headlight bricks to make a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.250 
to the two headlight bricks to make a
very<00:00:43.290> simple<00:00:43.530> hockey<00:00:43.920> goal<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.930> i'm<00:00:45.930> showing

going to have a lot of the 1 by 1
cylinder<00:00:51.210> pieces<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.149> even<00:00:54.329> need

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
cylinder pieces and you don't even need

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
cylinder pieces and you don't even need
the<00:00:54.629> cylinder<00:00:54.960> pieces<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.559> could<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.890> use<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the cylinder pieces you could just use a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.090 
the cylinder pieces you could just use a
1<00:00:56.340> by<00:00:56.460> 1<00:00:56.489> brick<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> wanted<00:00:57.800> but<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
1 by 1 brick if you wanted but in a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.540 
1 by 1 brick if you wanted but in a
hockey<00:00:59.359> setting<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.629> posts<00:01:00.899> around<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.859> i<00:01:02.190> was

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
hockey setting the posts around so i was

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.580 
hockey setting the posts around so i was
going<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> more<00:01:03.270> realistic<00:01:03.629> look<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:06.590> so

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
going for a more realistic look there so

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
now we're going to build the Lego hockey

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.359 
now we're going to build the Lego hockey
goal<00:01:09.750> that's<00:01:09.930> featured<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.680> our<00:01:10.799> brick<00:01:11.070> film

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
goal that's featured in our brick film

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.990 
goal that's featured in our brick film
and<00:01:12.650> again<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.860> still<00:01:14.100> need<00:01:14.250> those<00:01:14.400> two<00:01:14.729> same

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and again you still need those two same

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
and again you still need those two same
posts<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.140> you're<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> need<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> third

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
posts but you're going to need a third

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.609 
posts but you're going to need a third
one<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.729> you're<00:01:17.850> going<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.030> need<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> stack<00:01:18.479> 3<00:01:19.020> 1

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
one so you're going to need to stack 3 1

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.800 
one so you're going to need to stack 3 1
by<00:01:19.650> 1<00:01:20.040> cylinder<00:01:20.340> pieces<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> that's<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
by 1 cylinder pieces and that's going to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.429 
by 1 cylinder pieces and that's going to
be<00:01:21.900> your<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.229> post<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:24.119> will<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.479> one

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
i mean by that but if you get to 1 by 2

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.030 
i mean by that but if you get to 1 by 2
plates<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.700> 1<00:01:32.939> by<00:01:33.090> 3<00:01:33.119> plate<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.799> put

attach that to the back post and that's

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.670 
attach that to the back post and that's
going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> be<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.210> main<00:01:48.450> bar<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.500> of

going to be the main bar in the back of

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.120 
going to be the main bar in the back of
the<00:01:49.799> net<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.570> that<00:01:51.570> 1<00:01:51.960> by<00:01:52.140> 3<00:01:52.439> piece<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.950> going

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the net and that 1 by 3 piece is going

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.550 
the net and that 1 by 3 piece is going
to<00:01:53.189> sit<00:01:53.520> on<00:01:53.670> top<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> front<00:01:54.570> crossbar<00:01:54.840> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to sit on top of the front crossbar and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.550 
to sit on top of the front crossbar and
you'll<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.750> make<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.049> front<00:01:58.200> crossbar

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you'll see to make the front crossbar

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.789 
you'll see to make the front crossbar
you<00:01:59.130> need<00:01:59.369> again<00:01:59.939> 5<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:00.930> 1<00:02:01.140> by<00:02:01.170> 1<00:02:01.350> cylinder

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you need again 5 more 1 by 1 cylinder

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
you need again 5 more 1 by 1 cylinder
pieces<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.030> need<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> stick<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> bar<00:02:03.840> in

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
pieces and you need to stick a bar in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.350 
pieces and you need to stick a bar in
between<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.130> bar<00:02:05.579> i'm<00:02:05.700> using<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.180> is

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
between so that bar i'm using there is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.760 
between so that bar i'm using there is
the<00:02:06.630> same<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.140> lightsabers<00:02:07.799> and

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
the same one that lightsabers and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.280 
the same one that lightsabers and
other<00:02:08.920> Lego<00:02:09.490> elements<00:02:09.670> use<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.600> it's<00:02:11.050> pretty

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
other Lego elements use and it's pretty

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
other Lego elements use and it's pretty
common<00:02:11.740> so<00:02:12.070> you<00:02:12.760> guys<00:02:12.940> should<00:02:13.150> probably<00:02:13.360> be

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
common so you guys should probably be

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.990 
common so you guys should probably be
able<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.380> one<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.830> if<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.070> don't<00:02:15.280> they

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
able to have one and if you don't they

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.360 
able to have one and if you don't they
come<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.720> lot<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.900> sets<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:17.710> hopefully<00:02:18.280> you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
come in a lot of sets so hopefully you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.090 
come in a lot of sets so hopefully you
can<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:18.640> them<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:20.500> we're<00:02:20.650> back<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.980> those

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
can get them and now we're back to those

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.800 
can get them and now we're back to those
one<00:02:21.340> by<00:02:21.370> four<00:02:21.700> plates<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.300> you're<00:02:22.600> going<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
one by four plates and you're going to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.660 
one by four plates and you're going to
attach<00:02:23.050> those<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.770> headlight<00:02:24.100> bricks<00:02:24.370> and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
attach those to the headlight bricks and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.700 
attach those to the headlight bricks and
then<00:02:25.300> you're<00:02:25.510> going<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.690> attach<00:02:25.990> those<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
then you're going to attach those to the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.430 
then you're going to attach those to the
1<00:02:26.890> by<00:02:27.040> 2<00:02:27.070> plates<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:28.390> we<00:02:28.570> did<00:02:28.900> earlier<00:02:29.350> for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
1 by 2 plates that we did earlier for

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.860 
1 by 2 plates that we did earlier for
the<00:02:29.680> back<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.360> have<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.420> little<00:02:31.720> bit<00:02:31.840> of

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
trouble here so move forward and there's

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.980

you don't even want to use a net you can

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.720 
you don't even want to use a net you can
place<00:02:55.570> your<00:02:55.900> goal<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.410> your<00:02:56.710> Lego<00:02:56.950> Stadium<00:02:57.460> and

place your goal in your Lego Stadium and
you're<00:02:58.540> going<00:02:58.690> to<00:02:58.750> want<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.050> add<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> stud<00:02:59.740> or<00:03:00.010> as

you're going to want to add a stud or as

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.420 
you're going to want to add a stud or as
we<00:03:01.000> did<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.210> 1<00:03:01.600> by<00:03:01.750> 2<00:03:01.810> plate<00:03:02.290> with<00:03:02.320> one<00:03:02.500> stud<00:03:03.280> on

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
we did a 1 by 2 plate with one stud on

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940 
we did a 1 by 2 plate with one stud on
the<00:03:03.550> top<00:03:03.780> underneath<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.020> back<00:03:05.230> post<00:03:05.560> and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
the top underneath the back post and

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.490 
the top underneath the back post and
this<00:03:06.370> will<00:03:06.550> make<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> net<00:03:07.030> sit<00:03:07.420> nicer<00:03:07.960> in<00:03:08.290> your

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
this will make the net sit nicer in your

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.070 
this will make the net sit nicer in your
stadium<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:10.090> see<00:03:10.270> as<00:03:10.450> we<00:03:10.630> place<00:03:10.870> it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
stadium and you can see as we place it

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.530 
stadium and you can see as we place it
in<00:03:11.230> there<00:03:11.770> was<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:11.920> 1<00:03:12.100> by<00:03:12.250> 2<00:03:12.310> there<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:13.090> there

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
in there was a 1 by 2 there and there

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.590 
in there was a 1 by 2 there and there
was<00:03:13.630> no<00:03:13.810> studs<00:03:14.170> underneath<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.800> posts<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:16.180> it

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
was no studs underneath the posts so it

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.900 
was no studs underneath the posts so it
levels<00:03:17.020> it<00:03:17.170> out<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.650> there<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.460> it<00:03:18.610> you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
levels it out and there you have it you

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.790 
levels it out and there you have it you
have<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.090> Lego<00:03:19.330> hockey<00:03:19.630> goal<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.230> it's<00:03:20.500> ready
