we slide it into this hole at the end of
our<00:00:49.710> Bobby<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.580> they're<00:00:50.699> just<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.970> bottom

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239

and look something like that then we

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.620 
and look something like that then we
take<00:00:54.540> our<00:00:54.690> thread
