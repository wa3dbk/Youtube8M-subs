00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
shock has been in development with our

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.340 
shock has been in development with our
suspension<00:00:41.040> team<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.180> course<00:00:42.420> there's<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
suspension team and of course there's so

suspension team and of course there's so
a<00:00:43.379> lot<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> development<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.460> Brad<00:00:45.120> Benedict

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
a lot of development with Brad Benedict

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.869 
a lot of development with Brad Benedict
to<00:00:45.780> his<00:00:45.960> former<00:00:46.320> World<00:00:46.500> Cup<00:00:46.680> racer<00:00:47.070> led<00:00:47.670> by

side with with Matt sipes so huge team

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.560 
side with with Matt sipes so huge team
been<00:00:52.800> working<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.340> for<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> long<00:00:53.730> time<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
been working on this for a long time and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.060 
been working on this for a long time and
what's<00:00:54.750> pretty<00:00:54.870> cool<00:00:55.110> about<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.530> shock<00:00:55.800> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
what's pretty cool about this shock is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.869 
what's pretty cool about this shock is
that<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.410> Poland's<00:00:58.410> invented<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that you know Poland's invented the the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
that you know Poland's invented the the
twin<00:01:00.570> tube<00:01:00.780> design<00:01:01.199> they've<00:01:01.770> refined<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.430> over

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
twin tube design they've refined it over

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.350 
twin tube design they've refined it over
years<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.030> years<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.420> years<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.309> MotoGP

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360

years and years and years of MotoGP
motocross<00:01:06.380> rally<00:01:07.380> racing<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.100> they've<00:01:08.250> been

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
motocross rally racing so they've been

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
motocross rally racing so they've been
in<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.640> game<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.030> long<00:01:09.210> time<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.810> they

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
in the game for a long time and they

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
in the game for a long time and they
spent<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> time<00:01:11.100> working<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:11.549> our

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
spent a lot of time working with our

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.210 
spent a lot of time working with our
team<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.510> analyze<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.200> downhillers<00:01:13.770> work<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
team to analyze how downhillers work and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.539 
team to analyze how downhillers work and
since<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.210> only<00:01:15.780> goes<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.860> demo<00:01:17.100> 8<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
since this only goes on the demo 8 and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
since this only goes on the demo 8 and
the<00:01:18.030> enduro<00:01:18.299> evo<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.350> range<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the enduro evo the range of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.700 
the enduro evo the range of
adjustability<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:22.140> demo<00:01:22.470> so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
adjustability is just for the demo so

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.609 
adjustability is just for the demo so
it's<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:23.009> very<00:01:23.280> tight<00:01:23.610> range<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.750> low

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
it's a very tight range we have low

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.039 
it's a very tight range we have low
speed<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.159> high<00:01:26.460> speed<00:01:26.729> compression<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
speed and high speed compression on the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.109 
speed and high speed compression on the
other<00:01:28.229> side<00:01:28.500> here<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> low<00:01:29.820> speed

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
other side here and then a low speed

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.520 
other side here and then a low speed
rebound<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.500> twin<00:01:32.189> tube<00:01:32.400> design<00:01:33.530> adjustments

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
rebound so twin tube design adjustments

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.990 
rebound so twin tube design adjustments
built<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> specialized<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
built just with the specialized and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.640 
built just with the specialized and
what's<00:01:36.360> very<00:01:36.420> cool<00:01:36.780> about<00:01:36.869> own<00:01:37.140> leads<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> they

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
what's very cool about own leads is they

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.700 
what's very cool about own leads is they
were<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:38.130> surprised<00:01:38.579> by<00:01:39.210> bicycle<00:01:39.990> sag

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
were a little surprised by bicycle sag

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.429 
were a little surprised by bicycle sag
settings<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.700> 50<00:01:42.329> pound<00:01:43.049> shock

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
settings the the 50 pound shock

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.370 
settings the the 50 pound shock
increments<00:01:44.100> were<00:01:44.369> was<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.299> funny<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.689> them<00:01:45.810> so

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
increments were was was funny to them so

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.649 
increments were was was funny to them so
these<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:48.149> Newton<00:01:48.420> meters

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
these actually go in for Newton meters

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.429 
these actually go in for Newton meters
which<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.840> about<00:01:49.140> 24<00:01:49.649> pounds<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.579> more

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
which is about 24 pounds so a lot more

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.899 
which is about 24 pounds so a lot more
