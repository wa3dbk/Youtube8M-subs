playing<00:01:25.380> Spurs<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.920> home<00:01:26.100> obviously<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.610> could

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
playing Spurs at home obviously we could

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
playing Spurs at home obviously we could
get<00:01:26.970> easier<00:01:27.780> fixtures<00:01:28.350> but<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.890> think<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
get easier fixtures but I think this is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.069 
get easier fixtures but I think this is
exactly<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> need<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.840> same

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
exactly what we need for the same

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.440 
exactly what we need for the same
reasons<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.710> keep<00:01:31.890> us<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.189> our<00:01:32.220> toes<00:01:32.340> go<00:01:33.150> into

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
reasons to keep us on our toes go into

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.960 
reasons to keep us on our toes go into
the<00:01:33.540> season<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.170> hopefully<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.430> hit<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.880 
ground running a bit a bit of a concern
for<00:01:39.450> me<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> preseason<00:01:40.290> has<00:01:40.560> been<00:01:40.740> our

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
for me over the preseason has been our

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
for me over the preseason has been our
defense<00:01:41.369> obviously<00:01:42.150> we've<00:01:42.299> seen<00:01:42.479> Phil<00:01:42.750> Jones

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
defense obviously we've seen Phil Jones

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
defense obviously we've seen Phil Jones
and<00:01:43.229> daily<00:01:43.500> bring<00:01:43.680> more<00:01:43.890> often<00:01:44.100> than<00:01:44.220> starting

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and daily bring more often than starting

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.450

at the heart of the center center of the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
at the heart of the center center of the
defense<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.170> needs<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.500> change<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.950> me

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
midfield I'd go away this is what I

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.200 
midfield I'd go away this is what I
think<00:04:51.900> we'll<00:04:52.050> play<00:04:52.229> remember<00:04:52.590> Carrick<00:04:53.009> and

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
think we'll play remember Carrick and

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.010 
think we'll play remember Carrick and
Schneiderlin<00:04:54.680> then<00:04:55.680> young<00:04:56.520> deep<00:04:57.180> I<00:04:57.479> matter

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
Schneiderlin then young deep I matter

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.469 
Schneiderlin then young deep I matter
and<00:04:58.500> I'm<00:04:58.860> really<00:04:59.099> up<00:04:59.340> top<00:04:59.610> that's<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.180> team<00:05:00.360> I

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
and I'm really up top that's the team I

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.820 
and I'm really up top that's the team I
think<00:05:00.509> we'll<00:05:00.810> start<00:05:01.110> with<00:05:01.289> I<00:05:01.470> don't<00:05:01.800> think

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
think we'll start with I don't think

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.409 
think we'll start with I don't think
we'll<00:05:02.069> see<00:05:02.099> schweinsteiger<00:05:02.789> in<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.060> starting

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
we'll see schweinsteiger in the starting

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.029 
we'll see schweinsteiger in the starting
lineup<00:05:03.690> although<00:05:03.960> he<00:05:04.080> could<00:05:04.229> prove<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.530> be<00:05:04.710> a

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
lineup although he could prove to be a

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.339 
lineup although he could prove to be a
very<00:05:05.610> key<00:05:05.940> player<00:05:06.240> for<00:05:06.270> us<00:05:06.509> as<00:05:06.750> the<00:05:06.960> season

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
very key player for us as the season

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.620 
very key player for us as the season
goes<00:05:07.500> on<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.919> also<00:05:08.490> expect<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.030> see<00:05:09.270> us<00:05:09.449> play

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
goes on I also expect to see us play

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.719 
goes on I also expect to see us play
more<00:05:09.870> of<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.020> for<00:05:10.229> free<00:05:10.470> free<00:05:10.770> maybe<00:05:11.400> when<00:05:11.610> we

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
more of a for free free maybe when we

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.719 
more of a for free free maybe when we
side<00:05:11.909> Pedro<00:05:12.919> it's<00:05:13.919> likely<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.250> that<00:05:14.400> may

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
side Pedro it's likely that that may

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.490 
side Pedro it's likely that that may
become<00:05:14.909> a<00:05:15.090> done<00:05:15.360> deal<00:05:15.569> in<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.900> next<00:05:16.139> couple<00:05:16.319> of

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
become a done deal in the next couple of

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.249 
become a done deal in the next couple of
days<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.069> so<00:05:17.759> I<00:05:17.940> do<00:05:18.090> expect<00:05:18.419> us<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.750> go<00:05:18.870> towards

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
days and so I do expect us to go towards

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.990 
days and so I do expect us to go towards
a<00:05:19.319> more<00:05:19.470> for<00:05:19.740> free<00:05:19.919> free<00:05:20.250> formation<00:05:20.849> but

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
a more for free free formation but

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.939 
a more for free free formation but
haven't<00:05:21.659> seen<00:05:21.780> how<00:05:21.990> he<00:05:22.050> played<00:05:22.319> in<00:05:22.500> preseason
