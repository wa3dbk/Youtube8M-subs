 What is it like to be from India andré because 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.660

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.089
 children at one time the tomographies 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.970
 made a few days later showed with 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.660
 more clearly the union of both olim and 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:16.100
 kauane makes a big impact and 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:18.530
 at the same time that the babies were glued together 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.500
 that expression I used that were 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 the effect on growth and on the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.610
 development of the embryo 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.399
 they start to grow starts with two 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.310
 years by the eyes of an egg that began 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.920
 if divided and divided and divided 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.020
 the moment it separates it is 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.190
 the event to freeze age 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.800
 in the case of the girls that we attended 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.679
 they separated but not completely 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.810
 the seizure of the family only increased with the 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.780
 birth on the day of her surgery 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.030
 Caesarean has not been able to hurt her mother.

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:02.360
 doctors said she might not

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.209
 courage 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:46.340
 inf cement distress right but at the same 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.689
 time we had to be strong to 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.540

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.430
 They did not even go home. 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.639
 almost nine months of hospital and 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.569
 Attention to the hospital staff were 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:05.239
 months of preparation a battalion of 20 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.959
 professionals was articulated had to 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.549
 keep in mind it could be so much then 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.510
 the people are prepared 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.629
 then the preparation passed and she 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.150
 room care was available and this 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.609
 now the child's positioning 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.290
 antisepsis cleaning before 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.290
 surgery 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.109
 then the positioning so that it was of the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.199
 the easiest way to 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.120
 understand anatomy possible the last 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.530
 moments before the operation were 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.530
 registered by grandmother 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.269
 the sisters were joined by the abdomen and 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:48.319
 shared vital organs such as liver 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.659
 intestine and bladder 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.790
 were nine hours of procedure at 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.250
 surgery started with the section line 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.579
 which united with one another 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.189
 The liver was then divided 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.129
 each of the girls got a 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.400
 part of the organ then the doctors 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.419
 separated the intestine one meter for each 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.209
 an 

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:13.639
 The next step was to separate the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.239
 bladder one of the most difficult tasks 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.340
 according to the physicians was the pericardium 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.289
 bag containing a liquid that bathes the 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.710
 heart on girls 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.750
 he was unique and could not leak the part 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.150
 end of surgery was the closure of the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.610
 abdomen of the two girls 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.460
 surgery was a success still in the 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.070
 hospital wants olim and kauane follow 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.510
 surrounded by attention every day when 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.090
 I arrive at my schedule is that 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.550
 and it 's true because now in this post 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.490
 the operative we stay in the 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.440
 in the expectation that nothing is wrong 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.530
 attention and preparations also in the 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.780

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.330
 reformed to welcome the girls from here 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.860
 two weeks ago the video never solved the 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.710
 speed impasse 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.610
 meanwhile in the hospital supported by the

 we join them at the request of the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.810
 doctor and we put the next two 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.810
 they were very agitated 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.720
 when we put them both one of them 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.870
 facing each other as they were before 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.570
 they calm down they touch each other 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.200
 they looked and ended up sleeping the biggest 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.200
 Morning
