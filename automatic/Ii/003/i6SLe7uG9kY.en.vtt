go<00:04:23.030> mine<00:04:23.240> just<00:04:23.270> looks<00:04:23.630> like<00:04:23.690> this<00:04:23.960> because<00:04:24.380> it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
go mine just looks like this because it

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.800 
go mine just looks like this because it
was<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.800> Smith<00:04:25.040> it's<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.310> missing<00:04:25.640> icon<00:04:26.000> thing

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
was it Smith it's a missing icon thing

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.930

plugged<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.720> that's<00:04:29.900> why<00:04:30.050> it's<00:04:30.920> like<00:04:31.100> a

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
plugged it in so that's why it's like a

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.100 
plugged it in so that's why it's like a
just<00:04:32.270> an<00:04:32.390> unknown<00:04:32.720> icon<00:04:33.160> so<00:04:34.300> if<00:04:35.300> you<00:04:35.750> have<00:04:35.930> any

some<00:04:41.930> computer<00:04:42.320> things<00:04:43.390> simple<00:04:44.390> software<00:04:44.750> or

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
some computer things simple software or

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.040 
some computer things simple software or
just<00:04:45.470> about<00:04:45.920> max<00:04:46.190> um<00:04:48.670> any<00:04:49.670> hard<00:04:50.300> drive<00:04:50.510> any

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
just about max um any hard drive any

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.760 
just about max um any hard drive any
external<00:04:51.650> hard<00:04:51.830> drives<00:04:51.980> really<00:04:52.280> should<00:04:52.520> do

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
external hard drives really should do

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.200 
external hard drives really should do
load<00:04:54.770> times<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.340> only<00:04:55.430> performance

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
load times the only performance

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.580 
load times the only performance
difference<00:04:56.630> is<00:04:56.750> going<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.960> be<00:04:57.020> load<00:04:57.290> times

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
difference is going to be load times

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.710 
difference is going to be load times
it's<00:04:58.490> not<00:04:58.610> gonna<00:04:58.760> be<00:04:58.880> frame<00:04:59.060> rate<00:04:59.270> but<00:04:59.560> um<00:05:00.560> I

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
it's not gonna be frame rate but um I

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.450 
it's not gonna be frame rate but um I
can<00:05:02.720> actually<00:05:02.840> say<00:05:03.170> that<00:05:03.200> for<00:05:03.800> some<00:05:03.830> reason<00:05:03.980> I

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
can actually say that for some reason I
