now when I say protected it means it's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
now when I say protected it means it's
not<00:00:33.719> impervious<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.640> do

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
not impervious so what I'm going to do

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.160 
not impervious so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:35.880> I'm<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.149> take<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.690> brush<00:00:36.899> I'm

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
is I'm going to take this brush I'm

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.049 
is I'm going to take this brush I'm
going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> brush<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> couple<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.280> times<00:00:38.489> I'm

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
going to brush it a couple of times I'm

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.580 
going to brush it a couple of times I'm
going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> show<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> scratches<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.410> then

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
going to show you the scratches and then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560 
going to show you the scratches and then
they<00:00:40.860> say<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> heals<00:00:41.640> faster<00:00:42.239> with

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
they say that it heals faster with

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.270 
they say that it heals faster with
increased<00:00:43.260> heat<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.620> I'm<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> rub<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
increased heat so I'm going to rub it a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.459 
increased heat so I'm going to rub it a
little<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:44.760> increase<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> heat<00:00:45.539> during

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
little bit just increase the heat during

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
little bit just increase the heat during
the<00:00:46.530> course<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.950> video<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the course of this video and then you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.670 
the course of this video and then you
can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.450> how<00:00:48.840> good<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.559> going

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
can see how good it is so I'm not going

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.930 
can see how good it is so I'm not going
to<00:00:49.739> dig<00:00:49.950> into<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:50.460> but<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
to dig into it here but it's just to

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.600 
to dig into it here but it's just to
kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.180> mimic<00:00:51.739> how<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.219> know<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> might<00:00:53.579> be

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
kind of mimic how you know it might be

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.900 
kind of mimic how you know it might be
with<00:00:53.910> keys<00:00:54.620> or<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.340> something<00:00:56.670> else

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
with keys or you know something else

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.819 
with keys or you know something else
loose<00:00:57.239> change<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.750> pocket<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.680> can

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
loose change in your pocket so you can

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
loose change in your pocket so you can
see<00:00:59.010> I've<00:00:59.280> created<00:00:59.309> some<00:00:59.760> scratches<00:01:00.180> there<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
see I've created some scratches there it

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.650 
see I've created some scratches there it
looks<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> broad<00:01:02.090> scratch<00:01:03.090> there<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
looks like a broad scratch there and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.140 
looks like a broad scratch there and
then<00:01:04.589> we'll<00:01:05.189> let<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.369> self<00:01:05.760> heal<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
then we'll let that self heal for a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.609 
then we'll let that self heal for a
second<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.659> while<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:06.900> doing<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.380> want

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
second and while it's doing that I want

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.929 
second and while it's doing that I want
to<00:01:07.740> show<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> battery<00:01:08.520> looks<00:01:08.700> like

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to show you what the battery looks like

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.660 
to show you what the battery looks like
this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> 3500<00:01:10.560> milliamp<00:01:10.890> hour<00:01:11.100> battery<00:01:11.720> and

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
this is a 3500 milliamp hour battery and

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.090 
this is a 3500 milliamp hour battery and
it's<00:01:14.670> curved<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> phone<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> can

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it's curved just like the phone so can

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.499 
it's curved just like the phone so can
get<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> perspective<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:17.909> what<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.330> looks

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
get a perspective here what that looks

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:18.679 
get a perspective here what that looks
like

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.649 
like
this<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.290> gently<00:01:19.650> curved<00:01:20.150> we<00:01:21.150> were<00:01:21.299> told<00:01:21.479> not

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this is gently curved we were told not

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.030 
this is gently curved we were told not
to<00:01:21.720> mess<00:01:21.990> around<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.590> try<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> bend

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
to mess around with it and try to bend

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.200 
to mess around with it and try to bend
it<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.310> flatten<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:23.939> anything<00:01:23.970> like

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
it or flatten it out or anything like

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
it or flatten it out or anything like
that<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.630> since<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.040> flatten<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
that but since you can flatten out the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
that but since you can flatten out the
phone<00:01:26.700> obviously<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.270> batteries<00:01:27.630> got<00:01:27.780> some

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
phone obviously the batteries got some

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.460 
phone obviously the batteries got some
flexibility<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.030> this<00:01:30.030> device<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:31.350> have

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
flexibility to it this device will have

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.069 
flexibility to it this device will have
better<00:01:31.829> battery<00:01:32.280> performance<00:01:32.430> than<00:01:33.420> what

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
better battery performance than what

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.410 
better battery performance than what
you'll<00:01:34.200> even<00:01:34.350> find<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> LG<00:01:35.670> g2<00:01:36.060> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you'll even find out of the LG g2 and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
you'll even find out of the LG g2 and
this<00:01:37.140> battery<00:01:37.350> itself<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.100> already<00:01:38.280> bigger

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
this battery itself is already bigger

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.740 
this battery itself is already bigger
than<00:01:38.790> what<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.150> be<00:01:39.240> found<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> LG<00:01:40.340> G<00:01:41.340> pro

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
than what can be found on the LG G pro

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.280 
than what can be found on the LG G pro
so<00:01:42.750> let's<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.380> back<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.869> back<00:01:45.869> cover<00:01:46.110> here

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so let's go back to the back cover here

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.389 
so let's go back to the back cover here
that's<00:01:46.439> protected<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.280> it's

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that's protected so you can see it's

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.520 
that's protected so you can see it's
still<00:01:47.610> self-healing<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
still self-healing so I'm just going to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.929 
still self-healing so I'm just going to
just<00:01:49.799> increase<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> temperature<00:01:50.610> because

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
just increase the temperature because

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
just increase the temperature because
it's<00:01:51.030> pretty<00:01:51.210> cool<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.630> room<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's pretty cool in this room here and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.230 
it's pretty cool in this room here and
this<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> kindof<00:01:53.579> buffering<00:01:53.880> out<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.119> like

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
this is a kindof buffering out it's like

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.179 
this is a kindof buffering out it's like
a<00:01:54.270> clear<00:01:54.630> coat<00:01:54.869> or<00:01:55.649> what<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.860> might<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.159> on

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
a clear coat or what you might see on

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.179 
a clear coat or what you might see on
one<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> new<00:01:56.759> Nissan<00:01:57.210> cars<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.020> get

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
one of the new Nissan cars we can get

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
one of the new Nissan cars we can get
some<00:01:59.299> scratch<00:02:00.299> protection<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.869> device

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
some scratch protection on that device

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
some scratch protection on that device
and<00:02:01.439> already<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.280> improving<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> little<00:02:03.000> bit

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and already it's improving a little bit

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.560 
and already it's improving a little bit
here<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:04.399> this

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
here so this

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.350 
here so this
yeah<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.140> takes<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.409> few<00:02:06.530> minutes<00:02:06.790> but<00:02:07.790> as<00:02:08.149> you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
yeah it takes a few minutes but as you

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.490 
yeah it takes a few minutes but as you
can<00:02:08.479> tell<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:08.660> before<00:02:09.140> because<00:02:09.380> we've

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
can tell just before because we've

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.660 
can tell just before because we've
already<00:02:09.679> been<00:02:09.890> scratching<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.369> thing<00:02:10.550> up

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
