the<00:00:29.490> final<00:00:30.090> results<00:00:30.779> i'm<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.260> happy<00:00:31.529> with

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the final results i'm pretty happy with

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.639 
the final results i'm pretty happy with
these<00:00:32.070> settings<00:00:32.550> so<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.690> course<00:00:33.899> I've<00:00:34.290> cropped

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
these settings so of course I've cropped

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.590 
these settings so of course I've cropped
the<00:00:34.950> video<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.850> there's<00:00:36.059> no<00:00:36.180> black

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the video so that there's no black

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.020 
the video so that there's no black
borders<00:00:37.170> I've<00:00:37.770> sharpened<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.640> off<00:00:38.820> I've

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
borders I've sharpened it off I've

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.369 
borders I've sharpened it off I've
actually<00:00:39.210> increased<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.960> sharpness

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
actually increased the sharpness

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.920 
actually increased the sharpness
compared<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.730> test<00:00:42.090> video<00:00:42.360> number<00:00:42.570> two

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
compared to then test video number two

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.020 
compared to then test video number two
I've<00:00:43.170> actually<00:00:43.649> used<00:00:43.860> high<00:00:44.280> sharpness<00:00:44.850> for

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
I've actually used high sharpness for

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.950 
I've actually used high sharpness for
this<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.510> I've<00:00:46.230> tweaked<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.210> hsl<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.539> for

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
this and I've tweaked the hsl and for

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
this and I've tweaked the hsl and for
those<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.379> who<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
those of you who don't know that is the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
those of you who don't know that is the
saturation<00:00:51.030> I've<00:00:51.480> reduced<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.829> bit

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
saturation I've reduced that down a bit

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
saturation I've reduced that down a bit
compared<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.730> test<00:00:53.969> video<00:00:54.239> too<00:00:54.329> because<00:00:54.960> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
compared to test video too because it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
compared to test video too because it
was<00:00:55.260> too<00:00:55.469> saturated<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.510> happy

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
was too saturated and I'm pretty happy

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.229 
was too saturated and I'm pretty happy
with<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.199> result<00:00:58.649> here<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.550> leave<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.969> comment

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
but the signal is cut off a bit at the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.260 
but the signal is cut off a bit at the
top<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> farm<00:01:10.729> unfortunately<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.060> won't

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
top on the farm unfortunately it won't

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.719 
top on the farm unfortunately it won't
let<00:01:12.510> me<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.080> profit<00:01:13.830> manually<00:01:14.369> for<00:01:14.580> some

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
let me and profit manually for some

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.399 
let me and profit manually for some
reason<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.420> resuming<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.229> cross

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
reason it is resuming in and cross

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.130 
reason it is resuming in and cross
something<00:01:16.920> off<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.340> use<00:01:17.729> black<00:01:18.030> borders<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.020> I

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
something off or use black borders and I

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.469 
something off or use black borders and I
decided<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.009> best<00:01:20.040> option<00:01:20.670> was<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.850> drop

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
decided that the best option was to drop

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.140 
decided that the best option was to drop
off<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.470> toss<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.189> bottom<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> videos

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
off and toss the bottom of the videos

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.480 
off and toss the bottom of the videos
