and I have yet to cover a single
pearlescent<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.159> that's<00:01:13.760> probably<00:01:14.060> why<00:01:14.450> I<00:01:14.479> am

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
pearlescent so that's probably why I am

all of a sudden back into that DLC but
get<00:01:18.470> this<00:01:18.740> while<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.130> was<00:01:19.340> forming<00:01:19.790> for

get this while I was forming for
pearlessence<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:21.140> happen<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.920> stumble<00:01:22.070> upon

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
pearlessence I happen to stumble upon

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.850 
pearlessence I happen to stumble upon
this<00:01:22.700> gun<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.690> don't<00:01:24.200> know<00:01:24.290> exactly<00:01:24.470> how

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
this gun and I don't know exactly how

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.980 
this gun and I don't know exactly how
rare<00:01:25.160> this<00:01:25.370> thing<00:01:25.610> is<00:01:25.790> I'm<00:01:26.150> assuming<00:01:26.570> it's

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
rare this thing is I'm assuming it's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.860 
rare this thing is I'm assuming it's
pretty<00:01:27.200> rare<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.860> gun<00:01:28.130> is<00:01:28.400> called<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:29.390> crux

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
pretty rare the gun is called the crux

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.530 
pretty rare the gun is called the crux
and<00:01:30.430> well<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.670> could<00:01:31.790> probably<00:01:31.910> assume

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
and well you could probably assume

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.270 
and well you could probably assume
assume<00:01:33.170> right<00:01:33.380> off<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.680> bat<00:01:33.830> that<00:01:33.860> it's<00:01:34.190> a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
assume right off the bat that it's a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.010 
assume right off the bat that it's a
hybrid<00:01:34.460> between<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.030> crux<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.600> something

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
hybrid between the crux and something

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.990 
hybrid between the crux and something
else<00:01:36.200> and<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.470> something<00:01:36.830> else<00:01:37.340> is<00:01:37.610> the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
else and that something else is the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.750 
else and that something else is the
sepulchers<00:01:38.660> which<00:01:39.200> is<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> unique<00:01:39.830> shotgun

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
sepulchers which is a unique shotgun

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.170 
sepulchers which is a unique shotgun
that<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:41.390> can<00:01:41.690> obtain<00:01:42.050> in<00:01:42.620> this<00:01:42.770> DLC<00:01:42.980> now<00:01:43.790> some

anyways sorry if that dragged on a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.340 
anyways sorry if that dragged on a
little<00:02:19.970> bit<00:02:20.120> longer<00:02:20.300> than<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.660> should<00:02:20.870> have

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
little bit longer than it should have

let's<00:02:21.950> move<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.520> actual<00:02:22.790> guide<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.660> I'm

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
let's move on to the actual guide so I'm

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.780 
let's move on to the actual guide so I'm
not<00:02:24.050> exactly<00:02:24.350> sure<00:02:24.560> what<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:25.069> special<00:02:25.460> effect

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
not exactly sure what the special effect

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.230 
not exactly sure what the special effect
is<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
is of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.380 
is of
having<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:27.320> hybrid<00:02:27.830> but<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:28.640> pretty<00:02:29.120> sure

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
having this hybrid but I'm pretty sure

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.850 
having this hybrid but I'm pretty sure
it<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:30.350> has<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.370> SNS<00:02:32.030> crux<00:02:32.560> special<00:02:33.560> effect

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
it just has the SNS crux special effect

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.880 
it just has the SNS crux special effect
stacked<00:02:34.400> on<00:02:34.700> top<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.930> smoker<00:02:36.380> special

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
stacked on top of the smoker special

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.280 
stacked on top of the smoker special
effect<00:02:37.160> so<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:38.120> would<00:02:38.270> mean<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.080> is

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
effect so that would mean that it is

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.320 
effect so that would mean that it is
only<00:02:39.470> explosive<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.460> spread<00:02:40.700> pattern<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.180> not

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
only explosive the spread pattern is not

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.150 
only explosive the spread pattern is not
right<00:02:41.600> cross<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.440> has<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.560> faster<00:02:43.040> reload

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
right cross and it has a faster reload

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.250 
right cross and it has a faster reload
now<00:02:43.850> if<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.240> guys<00:02:44.360> want<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.720> download<00:02:44.930> this

some of you may have noticed that I

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.810 
some of you may have noticed that I
didn't<00:03:54.290> take<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.620> normal<00:03:55.040> route<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.460> get<00:03:55.640> here

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
didn't take the normal route to get here

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.610 
didn't take the normal route to get here
in<00:03:55.910> fight<00:03:56.150> sideshow<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.870> actually<00:03:57.140> went<00:03:57.530> around

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
in fight sideshow I actually went around

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.850 
in fight sideshow I actually went around
and<00:03:58.040> glitched<00:03:58.310> through<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.670> rock<00:03:59.270> and<00:03:59.710> that<00:04:00.710> was

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
and glitched through a rock and that was

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.860 
and glitched through a rock and that was
intentional<00:04:01.220> instead<00:04:02.210> of<00:04:02.300> going<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.690> normal

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
intentional instead of going the normal

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.960 
intentional instead of going the normal
route<00:04:03.230> like<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.590> did<00:04:03.860> in<00:04:04.100> my<00:04:04.130> guide<00:04:04.520> on<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.820> so

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
route like I did in my guide on the so

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.050 
route like I did in my guide on the so
poker<00:04:05.210> I<00:04:05.570> went<00:04:06.260> around<00:04:06.440> another<00:04:07.430> way<00:04:07.730> so

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
poker I went around another way so

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.880 
poker I went around another way so
that's<00:04:08.600> why<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.780> wanted<00:04:08.990> to<00:04:09.050> show<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.320> guys<00:04:09.440> if

sideshow<00:04:13.160> for<00:04:13.550> this<00:04:13.790> gun<00:04:14.170> then<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.200> recommend

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
sideshow for this gun then I recommend

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.820 
sideshow for this gun then I recommend
using<00:04:16.730> that<00:04:16.880> route<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.330> I<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.810> showed<00:04:18.080> but

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
using that route that I just showed but

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.800 
using that route that I just showed but
as<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.130> can<00:04:19.250> see<00:04:19.460> he<00:04:19.670> did<00:04:19.910> drop<00:04:20.330> the

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
as you can see he did drop the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.410 
as you can see he did drop the
sepulchral<00:04:21.650> crux<00:04:22.190> like<00:04:23.000> I<00:04:23.090> said<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.300> don't

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
sepulchral crux like I said I don't

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.910 
sepulchral crux like I said I don't
really<00:04:23.690> have<00:04:23.810> a<00:04:23.840> name<00:04:24.080> for<00:04:24.290> that's<00:04:24.530> probably

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
really have a name for that's probably

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.800 
really have a name for that's probably
what<00:04:25.160> I'm<00:04:25.250> gonna<00:04:25.370> call<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.880> its<00:04:26.420> a<00:04:26.540> mix<00:04:26.720> between

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
what I'm gonna call it its a mix between

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.410 
what I'm gonna call it its a mix between
both<00:04:27.260> names<00:04:27.560> but<00:04:28.190> yeah<00:04:28.550> let's<00:04:28.820> uh<00:04:28.910> let's<00:04:29.300> move

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
actually really like this gun it is not

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.300 
actually really like this gun it is not
overpowered

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
overpowered

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.030 
overpowered
by<00:04:40.340> any<00:04:40.490> means<00:04:40.760> but<00:04:41.300> it<00:04:41.930> does<00:04:42.200> some<00:04:42.410> damage<00:04:42.830> and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
by any means but it does some damage and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.910 
by any means but it does some damage and
I<00:04:43.370> really<00:04:43.880> love<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.720> magazine<00:04:44.900> size<00:04:45.530> like

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:45.920 
I really love the magazine size like

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.280 
I really love the magazine size like
that<00:04:46.580> is<00:04:46.760> definitely<00:04:46.910> one<00:04:47.420> of<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.810> main

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
that is definitely one of the main

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.890 
that is definitely one of the main
features<00:04:49.070> of<00:04:49.340> this<00:04:49.910> gun<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.450> don't<00:04:50.720> know<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.810> just

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
features of this gun I don't know I just

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.930 
features of this gun I don't know I just
can't<00:04:51.320> get<00:04:51.470> over<00:04:51.710> how<00:04:51.860> big<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.280> magazine<00:04:52.700> size

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
can't get over how big the magazine size

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.530 
can't get over how big the magazine size
is<00:04:53.180> now<00:04:53.810> here<00:04:54.230> in<00:04:54.380> this<00:04:54.500> gameplay<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:55.400> am<00:04:55.940> using

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
is now here in this gameplay I am using

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.990 
is now here in this gameplay I am using
the<00:04:57.110> support<00:04:57.650> gunner<00:04:57.920> column<00:04:58.310> which<00:04:58.760> does

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
the support gunner column which does

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.880 
the support gunner column which does
increase<00:04:59.360> my<00:04:59.540> magazine<00:04:59.990> size<00:05:00.260> like<00:05:00.530> quite<00:05:00.860> a

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
increase my magazine size like quite a

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.460 
increase my magazine size like quite a
lot<00:05:01.010> so<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.550> is<00:05:01.670> why<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.150> way<00:05:03.080> bigger<00:05:03.290> than

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
lot so that is why it is way bigger than

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.780 
lot so that is why it is way bigger than
it<00:05:03.830> should<00:05:04.220> be<00:05:04.460> on<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:06.350> didn't<00:05:06.680> have<00:05:06.830> that

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
it should be on if I didn't have that

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.540 
it should be on if I didn't have that
class<00:05:08.060> mod<00:05:08.300> equipped<00:05:08.660> but<00:05:09.020> I<00:05:09.340> think<00:05:10.340> later

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
class mod equipped but I think later

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.790 
class mod equipped but I think later
here<00:05:11.030> in<00:05:11.120> this<00:05:11.210> footage<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:11.690> equipped<00:05:12.320> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
here in this footage I equipped the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.760 
here in this footage I equipped the
heavy<00:05:13.790> gunner<00:05:14.060> comm<00:05:14.360> at<00:05:14.720> least<00:05:15.080> I<00:05:15.200> think<00:05:15.260> and

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
heavy gunner comm at least I think and

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.920 
heavy gunner comm at least I think and
what's<00:05:16.460> really<00:05:16.640> nice<00:05:16.820> about<00:05:16.880> that<00:05:17.150> is<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:17.660> it

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
what's really nice about that is that it

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.820 
what's really nice about that is that it
increases<00:05:18.580> damage<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.820> fire<00:05:20.240> rate<00:05:20.450> by<00:05:21.350> quite

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
increases damage and fire rate by quite

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.100 
increases damage and fire rate by quite
a<00:05:21.860> lot<00:05:22.130> which<00:05:22.610> fire<00:05:23.120> rate<00:05:23.330> is<00:05:23.360> actually<00:05:23.900> one<00:05:24.080> of

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
a lot which fire rate is actually one of

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.410 
a lot which fire rate is actually one of
the<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.770> things<00:05:25.010> that<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.400> gun<00:05:25.640> lacks<00:05:26.000> and

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
the the things that this gun lacks and

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.660 
the the things that this gun lacks and
anything<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.500> increases<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:28.100> definitely

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
anything that increases that definitely

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.300 
anything that increases that definitely
helps<00:05:29.030> out<00:05:29.150> now<00:05:29.870> another<00:05:30.380> thing<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.800> like<00:05:31.040> about

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
helps out now another thing I like about

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.380 
helps out now another thing I like about
this<00:05:31.670> gun<00:05:31.970> is<00:05:32.270> well<00:05:33.020> that<00:05:33.620> it<00:05:33.770> has<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:35.150> same

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
this gun is well that it has the same

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.560 
this gun is well that it has the same
spread<00:05:35.810> pattern<00:05:36.200> as<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.770> SMS<00:05:37.280> crooks<00:05:37.640> but

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
spread pattern as the SMS crooks but

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.210 
spread pattern as the SMS crooks but

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.110 
I'm a pretty big fan of the SNS crux
it's<00:05:45.800> kind<00:05:46.100> of<00:05:46.160> down<00:05:46.280> to<00:05:46.430> personal<00:05:46.640> preference

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
it's kind of down to personal preference

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.900 
it's kind of down to personal preference
in<00:05:47.600> a<00:05:47.690> way<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:48.380> because<00:05:48.800> it<00:05:49.190> removes<00:05:49.520> that

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
in a way just because it removes that

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.260 
in a way just because it removes that
normal<00:05:50.420> shotgun<00:05:51.020> spread<00:05:51.380> pattern<00:05:51.590> um<00:05:52.270> and

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
normal shotgun spread pattern um and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.720 
normal shotgun spread pattern um and
replaces<00:05:53.990> it<00:05:54.020> with<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.320> fixed<00:05:54.440> spread<00:05:55.340> pattern

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
replaces it with a fixed spread pattern

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.580 
replaces it with a fixed spread pattern
like<00:05:56.120> I<00:05:56.240> said<00:05:56.420> I'm<00:05:56.600> personally<00:05:57.020> a<00:05:57.080> fan<00:05:57.140> of<00:05:57.470> that

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
like I said I'm personally a fan of that

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.820 
like I said I'm personally a fan of that
so<00:05:57.950> I'm<00:05:58.220> going<00:05:58.370> to<00:05:58.430> count<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:58.760> as<00:05:58.970> a<00:05:59.120> positive

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
so I'm going to count that as a positive

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.610 
so I'm going to count that as a positive
another<00:06:00.830> negative<00:06:00.980> I<00:06:01.580> have<00:06:01.610> is<00:06:02.320> well<00:06:03.320> the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
another negative I have is well the

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.790 
another negative I have is well the
damage<00:06:03.800> is<00:06:04.510> kinda<00:06:05.510> lacking<00:06:05.780> in<00:06:06.170> a<00:06:06.230> way<00:06:06.410> it's

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
damage is kinda lacking in a way it's

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.090 
damage is kinda lacking in a way it's
still<00:06:07.340> decent<00:06:08.270> but<00:06:08.930> it<00:06:09.050> could<00:06:09.380> be<00:06:09.530> better<00:06:09.710> it

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
still decent but it could be better it

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.390 
still decent but it could be better it
could<00:06:10.490> be<00:06:10.700> better<00:06:10.930> on<00:06:11.930> that's<00:06:12.680> also<00:06:12.950> kind<00:06:13.220> of<00:06:13.280> a

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
could be better on that's also kind of a

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.390 
could be better on that's also kind of a
problem<00:06:14.230> really<00:06:15.230> the<00:06:15.380> the<00:06:15.680> only<00:06:15.830> problems<00:06:16.310> I

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
problem really the the only problems I

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.350 
problem really the the only problems I
have<00:06:16.580> with<00:06:16.610> this<00:06:16.910> gun

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
have with this gun

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.140 
have with this gun
are<00:06:17.420> the<00:06:18.140> damage<00:06:18.620> and<00:06:18.890> fire<00:06:19.460> rate<00:06:19.640> that's

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
are the damage and fire rate that's

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.570 
are the damage and fire rate that's
about<00:06:20.900> it<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:21.410> accuracy<00:06:21.920> is<00:06:22.040> fine

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
about it the accuracy is fine

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.640 
about it the accuracy is fine
I<00:06:22.610> mean<00:06:23.000> remember<00:06:23.480> it<00:06:23.570> has<00:06:23.720> a<00:06:23.750> fixed<00:06:24.140> spread

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
I mean remember it has a fixed spread

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.770 
I mean remember it has a fixed spread
pattern<00:06:24.830> so<00:06:25.370> the<00:06:25.730> accuracy<00:06:26.030> shouldn't<00:06:26.690> really

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
pattern so the accuracy shouldn't really

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.700 
pattern so the accuracy shouldn't really
matter<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.200> whole<00:06:27.290> lot

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
matter a whole lot

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.100 
matter a whole lot
apart<00:06:28.400> from<00:06:28.550> those<00:06:28.700> two<00:06:28.760> issues<00:06:29.330> I<00:06:29.480> have<00:06:29.720> I<00:06:29.990> do
