00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.900
 so far we have not succeeded but you can not strike us 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.540
 So they are proposing for our farmer to want a lady 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.600
 Naturally 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.689
 if I've ever killed a wrong move 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.689
 what do you think 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.509
 I believe in survival 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.929
 for him and his new then not to endure 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.559
 through buy 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.559

00:02:24.929 --> 00:02:26.869
 just nice 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.919

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.919
 even 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.339
 December approx 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.529

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.559
 Christina the trail 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.239
 and then in nine to ten count play now 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.529

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.009
 that will be strong 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.469

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.269

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:24.349
 also comes 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.209
 How do you know that this is the right move? 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.779
 it sends on the hand 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:31.259
 the kids will go through 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:34.539

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.949

 Seehausens would have done it and against the 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.409
 World chess champions know that they are against the idea and Jan Ullrich 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.759
 because he did not 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.429
