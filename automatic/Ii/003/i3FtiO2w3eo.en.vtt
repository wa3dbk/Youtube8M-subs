00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.420
 or the one that I try to see llosa this video 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.220
 let's see below how 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.110
 turn a collection of split into 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.420
 high quality for that we will use 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.970
 handbrake is a totally program 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.640
 free that allows us to convert to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.340
 different formats like mp4 and emeka see 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.930
 which are high definition besides that 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.610
 allows us to add subtitles 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.430
 customize the width of the video 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.070
 change the sound use them to 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 television for ipod or tablets 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.290
 let's see then the processes of 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.820
 download installation and configuration in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.470
 the description of the video I will leave you 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.840
 the link so they can download the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.550
 completely free program and we continue 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 the next installation steps 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.340
 accepting the terms and click on 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340
 install 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.239
 once finished we will execute the 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.239
 Program 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.310
 and the first thing we're going to do is press 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.620
 in source where we are going to choose either 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.660
 the folder where the split is 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.940
 or simply directly in the 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.880
 unity 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.750
 in this case I have the divide already 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.750
 guarded 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.280
 in a folder 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.300
 so select the divide and the 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.950
 folder video etc after searching the 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.460
 video folder what we are going to do is 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.080
 establish 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.720
 the title in this case the one that has 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.030
 longer duration is that of the movie 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.550
 then we will click on destination 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.410
 at the destination where we are going to save the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.880
 divided we set the route where it's going 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.880
 to save as well as we also give 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.580
 if we click on save 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.830
 in the container part we select 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.630
 if we want an mp4 format or in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.630
 m format fits 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.349
 and in the bottom part we do not have what 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.869
 it has to do with the configurations 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.030
 customized we found the format of 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.739
 video in the colt format also the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.430
 percentage in this case I recommend you 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.959
 leave it 60% percentage and in the part 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.810
 of car we can select if we want 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.670
 the audio in Spanish in English and in the 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.890
 part of subtitles we can click on 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.100
 add and select the different 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.410
 subtitles that we have in dividing 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.420
 once we have everything finished in 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.070
 As for the customization simply 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.320
 to start the conversion process 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.320
 let's click on the button of this one 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.970
 at the bottom it will show us 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.250
 then the percentage elapsed thus 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.290
 as also the speed the time 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.630
 estimated and the elapsed time 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.670
 I also forgot to mention to them that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.490
 on the right side of the program they go to 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.290
 find the different options that 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.209
 have to make it 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.610
 for tve also for what you have to 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.799
 see with android tablets and different 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.019
 predefined and optimized formats 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.720
 for this type of device then 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.099
 we wait for the process and we will see 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.099
 then how is the video 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.860
 finishing the process then we are going to 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.190
 minimize the program and we will open the 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.190
 video 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.610
 It weighs approximately 500 megs because 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.710
 select a format 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.630
 a much smaller video size 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.020
 for this example but you can 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.950
 increase the quality and weight we will go 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.170
 then for example to the menu 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.579
 tools and information from kodak and 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.980
 we are going to realize that he is 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.620
 the achero code format of 74 which is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.959
 for mp4 in high definition and that the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.760
 audio is also in Spanish 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.040
 this is basically the steps that should 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.310
 continue to turn a movie into 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.379
 mp4 format or mkv format up to here 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.359
