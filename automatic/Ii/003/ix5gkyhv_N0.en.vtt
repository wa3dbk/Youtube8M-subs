because you're gonna jump over not one
but<00:00:14.460> four<00:00:15.020> moving<00:00:16.020> vehicles<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.619> you're

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
going to take off on a moving ramp

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.170 
going to take off on a moving ramp
that's<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.230> yeah<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.980> um<00:00:20.250> it's<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> new

that's right yeah it's um it's a new

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.179 
that's right yeah it's um it's a new
category<00:00:21.390> hopefully<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.439> few<00:00:22.560> more<00:00:22.890> people

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
category hopefully a few more people

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.400 
category hopefully a few more people
will<00:00:23.279> break<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.939> record<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.539> I'm<00:00:25.230> gonna

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
will break this record and I'm gonna

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.570 
will break this record and I'm gonna
jump<00:00:25.560> over<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.189> quite<00:00:26.400> difficult

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
jump over this is quite difficult

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.279 
jump over this is quite difficult
actually<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.269> I've<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.990> when<00:00:28.170> they

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
actually because I've got when they

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.200 
actually because I've got when they
actually<00:00:28.590> call<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:28.949> hits<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> ramp<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.730> sucks

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
actually call it hits the ramp it sucks

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
actually call it hits the ramp it sucks
me<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.289> quite<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> deceiving<00:00:32.309> jump

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
me on and it's quite a deceiving jump

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
me on and it's quite a deceiving jump
it's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> lot<00:00:32.910> harder<00:00:33.059> than<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.630> looks<00:00:33.809> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it's a lot harder than actually looks so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.750 
it's a lot harder than actually looks so
it<00:00:34.260> must<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.559> more<00:00:34.890> difficult<00:00:35.160> than<00:00:35.460> if<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
it must be more difficult than if the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.310 
it must be more difficult than if the
cars<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.239> stationary<00:00:36.450> well<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.260> are

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
cars are just stationary well you are

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
cars are just stationary well you are
definitely<00:00:37.500> definitely<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
definitely definitely because it's the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.010 
definitely definitely because it's the
ramp<00:00:39.000> even<00:00:39.300> though<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> runways<00:00:39.780> quite

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
ramp even though the runways quite

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.799 
ramp even though the runways quite
smooth<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:41.610> leading<00:00:42.090> legs<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> ramp

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
smooth the leading legs of the ramp

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
smooth the leading legs of the ramp
they're<00:00:42.960> bouncing<00:00:43.410> around<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.680> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
they're bouncing around a little bit and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.209 
they're bouncing around a little bit and
it<00:00:45.030> sort<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.360> upsets<00:00:46.050> things<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.469> yeah<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it sort of upsets things a bit yeah so

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.740 
it sort of upsets things a bit yeah so
what<00:00:47.520> factors<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.600> into

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
what factors you have to take into

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
what factors you have to take into
account<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> setting<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.250> kind

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
account when you're setting up some kind

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
account when you're setting up some kind
of<00:00:50.489> jump<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:50.850> well<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.140> jumpy<00:00:52.530> are

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
of jump like this well this jumpy are

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.889 
of jump like this well this jumpy are
going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> make<00:00:52.920> sure<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.699> drivers<00:00:54.210> keep<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
going to make sure the drivers keep a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.930 
going to make sure the drivers keep a
constant<00:00:55.350> distance<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.610> don't<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.879> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
constant distance like I don't want to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
constant distance like I don't want to
be<00:00:57.000> coming<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> runway<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
be coming down the runway and and

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
be coming down the runway and and
they're<00:00:59.039> spreading<00:00:59.460> apart<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.539> be

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
they're spreading apart I got to be

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.799 
they're spreading apart I got to be
constant<00:01:01.500> all<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> way<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:03.090> lead<00:01:03.510> driver

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
constant all the way and the lead driver

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.570 
constant all the way and the lead driver
were<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> one<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.439> talking<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.769> ramp<00:01:04.979> he

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
were the one I'm talking the ramp he

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.429 
were the one I'm talking the ramp he
actually<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.210> gotta<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.600> accelerate<00:01:07.200> even

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
actually is gotta not accelerate even

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
actually is gotta not accelerate even
though<00:01:07.890> he's<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.520> fight<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
though he's going to fight to not you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760 
though he's going to fight to not you
know<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> can<00:01:09.630> fight<00:01:09.840> accelerate<00:01:10.290> cuz<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
know you can fight accelerate cuz when I

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.140 
know you can fight accelerate cuz when I
hit<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> ramp<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> pull<00:01:11.850> him<00:01:11.970> back

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
hit the ramp it's going to pull him back

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.399 
hit the ramp it's going to pull him back
a<00:01:12.180> little<00:01:12.390> bit<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> he's<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
a little bit and he's going to have the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.249 
a little bit and he's going to have the
urge<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.250> accelerate<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.119> he<00:01:15.210> does<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.450> 2

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
urge to accelerate and if he does that 2

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.050 
urge to accelerate and if he does that 2

up jumping a motorway smash which is not
a<00:01:22.890> good<00:01:23.159> thing<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.729> don't<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.360> how<00:01:24.570> far

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
a good thing to do don't so how far

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
a good thing to do don't so how far
you're<00:01:25.049> gonna<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.950> clear

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you're gonna have to be going to clear

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.920 
you're gonna have to be going to clear
the<00:01:26.430> moving<00:01:26.759> vehicles<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the moving vehicles I think I'm going to
