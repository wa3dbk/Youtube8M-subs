00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello here mine two stops pearls 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.200
 and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.799
 how to weave little fairies 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.540
 beads 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.960
 so these little fairies are you going 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.750
 can use them to decorate the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.539
 fir gift packages and even to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:25.140
 little jewels with or for your 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.779
 kids you are going to need wire 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.000
 I use small fishing line 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.899
 rock beads of the gods as 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.130
 drops of glitter cups 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.460
 a pearl a little bigger for the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.110
 scissors head and glue well 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.670
 you will start by cutting a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 piece of spinning in the middle you go 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.850
 put a piece of tape on each 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.050
 side you go put on a tube 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.989
 a pearl a tube and three pearls you 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 go jump from the three pearls is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:03.390
 ironed the wire inside the tubes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 and the pearl to create the feet and then 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.100
 the legs to you are going well shot on 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.070
 the movies so as to put both 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 legs side by side and then you go 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.470
 will put on a pearl a little bigger 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:23.520
 then you will weave the skirt 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 there you can use drops 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.549
 you can use glitter from 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.119
 cups on the video I donned ride 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.159
 in turn a cup of glitter and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.900
 a cup actually I started by 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.610
 put a small cup then 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.399
 glitter on each side 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.530
 I made a double knot then I have to 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.200
 new donning glitter each 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.710
 side I did a double and then to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 again a cup a little bigger 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:02.490
 to give a little volume to the skirt 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 Then I put on one side a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.310
 pearl and with and I did iron 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.830
 the other side inside this 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.530
 closed 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.600
 but so that the two sons 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.030
 sort of each side of the pearl 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.370
 it's important it's the base of the face 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.970
 right angle that I use here 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.940
 regularly to are and pearls and that is 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:31.810
 detailed in the ive or free here 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.220
 you can go to the torso in is for 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.340
 to do the torso 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 you're going to make two red ones at one of 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.890
 weaving at right angles 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.370
 you go for example donned three 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.050
 beads on the side with the son 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.900
 left 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.110
 and then two pearls the right side you 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.810
 go take the straight wire and do and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.070
 to iron it inside the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.730
 third period 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:04.870
 put on the left side so do not forget 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:10.180
 the two sons come out on either side of the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.350
 earth there it is the first row you 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.930
 go make it a second 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.590
 then you will make the wings of the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.470

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.080
 inside the first pair envied 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.660
 you do that on both sides 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:38.050
 then you go on two berlin 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.680
 side one on them one on the other and you 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.459
 make a row where right now 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.110
 you will go to arms and hands 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:49.420
