00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
hey guys so this is mark three of the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.330 
hey guys so this is mark three of the
HUD<00:00:08.780> we've<00:00:09.780> got<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.559> we've<00:00:10.830> just<00:00:11.099> got<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
HUD we've got this we've just got a

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.970 
HUD we've got this we've just got a
little<00:00:12.559> recoil<00:00:13.559> instruments<00:00:14.219> mod<00:00:14.580> life<00:00:14.880> here

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
little recoil instruments mod life here

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.890 
little recoil instruments mod life here
so<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.670> know<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.960> Jets<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.859> came<00:00:20.070> out<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
so I know the the Jets just came out and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.939 
so I know the the Jets just came out and
the<00:00:21.900> software<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.380> I've<00:00:22.470> written<00:00:22.680> is

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the software that I've written is

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.590 
the software that I've written is
completely<00:00:23.519> compatible<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.539> if

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
completely compatible with that so if

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.200 
completely compatible with that so if
you<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:24.869> feel<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> jet<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:25.980> up

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
you can feel the jet you can get it up

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.880 
you can feel the jet you can get it up
so<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> model<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.660> supposed<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> go<00:00:28.470> into<00:00:28.859> a

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
so the model is supposed to go into a

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
so the model is supposed to go into a
pair<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> ski<00:00:29.730> goggles<00:00:29.910> where<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.019> sets<00:00:31.230> down

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
pair of ski goggles where it sets down

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.840 
pair of ski goggles where it sets down
here<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.750> goggles<00:00:34.110> iPhone<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.739> too<00:00:34.890> big

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
here the goggles iPhone or too big

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.750 
here the goggles iPhone or too big
plus<00:00:36.510> I've<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> helmet<00:00:37.110> anyway<00:00:37.760> I'd

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
plus I've got the helmet anyway I'd

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
plus I've got the helmet anyway I'd
rather<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:39.180> was<00:00:39.300> fitted<00:00:39.600> into<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> tower<00:00:40.050> and

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
rather it was fitted into the tower and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.049 
rather it was fitted into the tower and
when<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.010> played<00:00:41.280> about<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
when I played about with it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.030 
when I played about with it
I<00:00:42.090> actually<00:00:42.510> prefer<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.590> here<00:00:43.800> at

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I actually prefer it to be up here at

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.240 
I actually prefer it to be up here at
Malena<00:00:44.399> site<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.879> think<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.390> you're<00:00:45.539> skiing

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
Malena site I think when you're skiing

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.639 
Malena site I think when you're skiing
what's<00:00:47.250> don't<00:00:47.550> come<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.840> less<00:00:49.110> important

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
what's don't come here is less important

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.889 
what's don't come here is less important
but<00:00:50.250> when<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:50.430> flying<00:00:50.789> what's<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.629> here

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
but when you're flying what's down here

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
but when you're flying what's down here
is<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.559> ground<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.129> stuff<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:53.579> it's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.000> matte

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
is the ground and stuff but it's a matte

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
is the ground and stuff but it's a matte
kind<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> important<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.640> phoned<00:00:57.090> putting

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
kind of important so I phoned putting

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410 
kind of important so I phoned putting
our<00:00:57.870> peels<00:00:58.260> better<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:59.609> I've<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.879> rotated

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
our peels better and I've just rotated

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.810 
our peels better and I've just rotated
to<00:01:00.510> software<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.320> upside<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to software so this upside there so you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.549 
to software so this upside there so you
can<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.170> doesn't<00:01:04.409> really

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
can see that you know it doesn't really

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550 
can see that you know it doesn't really
get<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> way<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.700> my<00:01:06.000> eyes<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:07.020> really

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
get in the way of my eyes at all really

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.850 
get in the way of my eyes at all really
and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.430> mean<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.180> look<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> sky

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and I mean I can just look up at the sky

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.149 
and I mean I can just look up at the sky
and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.700> they're<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.830> display

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and I see they're all the way up display

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.780 
and I see they're all the way up display
information<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.530> we<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.670> my

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
information so here we go this is my

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
information so here we go this is my
Android<00:01:18.360> app<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.750> far<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.409> really<00:01:19.560> early

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
Android app so far it's really early

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.660 
Android app so far it's really early
stages<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:21.299> works<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> Left<00:01:23.430> we

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
stages but it works so on the Left we

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.359 
stages but it works so on the Left we
have<00:01:23.759> altitude<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.259> switch<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.009> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
have altitude so when we switch on and I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.359 
have altitude so when we switch on and I
get<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> GPS<00:01:27.090> lock<00:01:27.590> it's<00:01:28.590> also<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.159> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
get a GPS lock it's also got but one but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.270 
get a GPS lock it's also got but one but
so<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.060> play<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> could<00:01:30.420> zero<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.950> take

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so it's play I could zero what they take

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.230 
so it's play I could zero what they take
off<00:01:32.490> position<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.450> okay<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:33.720> AGL<00:01:35.240> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
off position so it's okay now AGL the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
off position so it's okay now AGL the
speed<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.600> speed<00:01:36.689> miles<00:01:37.200> per<00:01:37.350> hour<00:01:37.590> distance

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
speed is speed miles per hour distance

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
speed is speed miles per hour distance
is<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.759> distance<00:01:38.790> from<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.110> travel<00:01:40.500> so

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
is the distance from the if travel so

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
is the distance from the if travel so
you<00:01:41.430> know<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:42.119> according<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> circles<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
you know if according to circles and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
you know if according to circles and
I'll<00:01:43.320> be<00:01:43.590> accurate<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.579> other<00:01:47.700> two<00:01:47.939> I'll

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I'll be accurate the the other two I'll

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
I'll be accurate the the other two I'll
come<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> second<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.310> hand

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
come to in a second so on the right hand

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.020 
come to in a second so on the right hand
side<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.540> compass<00:01:52.170> rose<00:01:52.310> up<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.579> as

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
side we have a compass rose up and as

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.219 
side we have a compass rose up and as
always<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.570> direction<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.049> you're<00:01:55.200> going

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
always the direction that you're going

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.260 
always the direction that you're going
in<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> moment<00:01:56.520> I'm<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:57.030> north

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
in so the moment I'm going north

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.260 
in so the moment I'm going north
the<00:01:58.900> compas<00:01:59.200> roars<00:01:59.410> rotates<00:01:59.860> as<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.000> fly<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the compas roars rotates as you fly a

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.370 
the compas roars rotates as you fly a
boat<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.110> old<00:02:02.410> so<00:02:03.040> that<00:02:03.190> them<00:02:03.430> that

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
boat so that is old so that them that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.350 
boat so that is old so that them that
actually<00:02:05.380> are<00:02:05.650> as<00:02:05.890> always<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.820> direction<00:02:07.210> you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
actually are as always the direction you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.180 
actually are as always the direction you
are<00:02:07.390> sort<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.870> East<00:02:08.140> was<00:02:08.440> up<00:02:08.619> there<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:08.890> would

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
are sort of East was up there that would

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.760 
are sort of East was up there that would
say<00:02:09.399> ee<00:02:09.700> up<00:02:09.880> there<00:02:10.119> yeah<00:02:10.509> I've<00:02:10.720> colored<00:02:11.620> that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
say ee up there yeah I've colored that

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.260 
say ee up there yeah I've colored that
so<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.100> it's<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.400> bit<00:02:12.550> more<00:02:12.670> obvious<00:02:12.850> that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
so that it's a bit more obvious that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.270 
so that it's a bit more obvious that
whether<00:02:13.930> you're<00:02:14.110> good<00:02:14.260> generally<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:15.010> for

location so home is said when you get
GPS<00:02:22.450> look<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.110> switch<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.440> on<00:02:23.500> before

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
GPS look when you switch it on before

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.290 
GPS look when you switch it on before
you<00:02:23.920> take<00:02:24.130> off<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:25.300> after<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.850> little

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
in front of me and if home was down

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.590 
in front of me and if home was down
mainly<00:02:42.250> degrees<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.850> right<00:02:42.880> which<00:02:43.450> show

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
mainly degrees to the right which show

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.180 
mainly degrees to the right which show
me<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.930> needed<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.260> Tom<00:02:44.650> rate<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:45.100> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
me that I needed to Tom rate and the

homes on my way hand side and the yellow
transparent<00:02:49.959> triangle<00:02:50.680> as<00:02:50.860> wind<00:02:51.239> so<00:02:52.239> it's<00:02:52.390> one

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
transparent triangle as wind so it's one

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.760 
transparent triangle as wind so it's one
direction<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.290> in<00:02:53.800> relation<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:55.810> comment

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
direction and in relation to my comment

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.640 
direction and in relation to my comment
bearing<00:02:57.100> so<00:02:57.580> again<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.180> I'm<00:02:58.750> at<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.260> moment<00:02:59.590> is

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
bearing so again if I'm at the moment is

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.380 
bearing so again if I'm at the moment is
telling<00:02:59.950> me<00:03:00.070> I'm<00:03:00.340> flying<00:03:00.640> directly<00:03:01.030> into<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
telling me I'm flying directly into the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.650 
telling me I'm flying directly into the
wind

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
wind

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.310 
wind
for<00:03:02.260> example<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:04.030> when<00:03:04.209> speed<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.720> shown<00:03:05.019> on

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
for example the when speed is shown on

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.199 
for example the when speed is shown on
the<00:03:05.530> left<00:03:05.709> at<00:03:06.190> when<00:03:06.400> speed<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:10.000> last

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
the left at when speed and the last

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.170 
the left at when speed and the last
thing<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.570> home<00:03:10.780> distance<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.180> obviously

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
thing is home distance so and obviously

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.910 
thing is home distance so and obviously
as<00:03:13.570> well<00:03:13.720> as<00:03:13.930> at<00:03:14.080> walking<00:03:14.440> onto<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.709> home

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
as well as at walking onto the home

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.220 
as well as at walking onto the home
possession<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.750> as<00:03:17.080> you're

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
possession and because of that as you're

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.930 
possession and because of that as you're
flying<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.799> always<00:03:17.950> show<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
flying I can always show you the

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.610 
flying I can always show you the
distance<00:03:19.269> you've<00:03:19.480> got<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.870> fly<00:03:20.080> home<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.500> your

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
distance you've got to fly home to your

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.120 
distance you've got to fly home to your
takeoff<00:03:20.920> field<00:03:21.370> so<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:23.350> seems<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.830> be<00:03:23.950> all

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
takeoff field so that seems to be all

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.550 
takeoff field so that seems to be all
the<00:03:24.370> basic<00:03:24.790> information<00:03:25.030> I<00:03:25.480> need<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.350> will

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
the basic information I need so I will

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.289 
the basic information I need so I will
fly<00:03:26.739> with<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.160> week<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.519> see<00:03:28.000> how<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.150> go

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
fly with it this week and see how we go

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.450 
fly with it this week and see how we go
on
