00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:20.810
 A three-dimensional exploration ship around Japan with a triangular shaped ship 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.810
 It is a resource 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.190
 Ushigen is sake 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:37.200
 2008 to investigate oil and natural gas that sleeps on the seabed around 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.200
 Agency for Natural Resources and Energy introduced 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:51.730
 What kind of ship is a resource equipped with exploration equipment 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:59.320
 There are two layers of working decks in the Sasuo region with unusual shape 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.920
 Take a device called air gun from the bottom to the sea 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.000
 be called 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.500
 Take a streamer cable with a built-in receiver into the sea 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.850
 And parallel 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:20.690
 Resource propulsion system can rotate propeller direction horizontally 360 degrees 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.780
 Propulsion azimuth thruster equipped with four to have extended mobility for investigation 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.780
 I will 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:39.430
 What is the 3D Physics Exploration Vessel Survey? 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:41.800
 In marine resource surveys, information on the underground structure of the seabed is surveyed using physical survey equipment etc. 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:49.030
 I will collect 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:53.200
 How to proceed with the survey is using a device called an air gun to make the air compressed by the compressor into the water 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:02:01.180
 It emits sound waves by releasing 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.790
 A total of six units are equipped with three units each with a large number of air guns on the left and right 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.370
 Uemachi 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:13.120
 Regular cruising and 25 m intervals at approximately 4 rod for maintenance 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:16.599
 Generates sound waves every 12 seconds 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.450
 Waves reflected by geological interfaces of submarine 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:26.360
 We catch with hydrophone built into streamer cable 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.360
 This will help you understand the underground structure 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.870
 Streamer cables are usually tow 10 at 4800 m c 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:45.850
 We conducted a survey along the planned lateral line 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:50.020
 Extensive resource surveys are conducted taking into account the safety of marine traffic and fishermen 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:55.510
 We ask for cooperation in prior adjustment in the case of investigation 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:56.630
 We deploy warning voice not to disturb founding high schools such as fishing boats 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 While checking 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.340
 We will investigate safely 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:13.890
 Received records acquired at 4 yuan are recorded on magnetic tape and JobMech's data processing center 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.890
 Will be sent to 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:24.819
 The huge amount of data collected in a single survey of 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.819
 We will analyze on the computer 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:36.430
 Perform volume of data in about 6 months 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:44.700
 In this way, you can see in the eyes of the structure of finally exact underground 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:47.270
 Based on this analyzed information, we will evaluate where and how much oil gas is. 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.270
 Hmm 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:04.530
 Japan surrounded by sea ​​on all sides 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:10.230
 Splurge of resources such as oil and natural gas have been expected in recent years rotation 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:18.299
 Three-dimensional physics exploration vessel resource is oil like future 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:20.359
 Towards the development and production of resources, such as Chronology gas continues to survey for the understanding of the seabed underground structure raised 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.359
 I will
