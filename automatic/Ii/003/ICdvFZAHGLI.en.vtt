anyway<00:00:30.510> let's<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> topic<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.619> I'll<00:00:31.859> quickly

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
anyway let's get a topic so I'll quickly

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.889 
anyway let's get a topic so I'll quickly
started<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> starts<00:00:33.239> before<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.630> tell

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
started with the starts before I tell

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
started with the starts before I tell
you<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.170> preference<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.090> how<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.120> use<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.540> gun

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you my preference and how I use this gun

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.260 
you my preference and how I use this gun
so<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.640> mg36<00:00:39.180> has<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.140> high<00:00:40.739> fire<00:00:41.070> rate<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:42.059> for

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so the mg36 has a high fire rate as for

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.830 
so the mg36 has a high fire rate as for
the<00:00:42.360> LMGs<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> course<00:00:43.170> at<00:00:44.149> 750<00:00:45.149> rounds<00:00:45.390> per

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the LMGs of course at 750 rounds per

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
the LMGs of course at 750 rounds per
minute<00:00:45.960> which<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.739> second<00:00:47.100> highest<00:00:47.129> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
minute which is the second highest of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.360 
minute which is the second highest of
all<00:00:47.700> elements<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.660> after<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> m249<00:00:49.920> saw

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
all elements right after the m249 saw

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.090 
all elements right after the m249 saw
and<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.300> tied<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.899> m27<00:00:52.410> yards<00:00:52.949> so

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and it is tied with the m27 yards so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
and it is tied with the m27 yards so
definitely<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> good<00:00:54.030> good<00:00:54.600> fire<00:00:54.840> rate<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
definitely a good good fire rate for the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.299 
definitely a good good fire rate for the
LMGs<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.210> does<00:00:57.210> 25<00:00:57.600> damage<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.230> close<00:00:58.530> which

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
LMGs it does 25 damage up close which

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
LMGs it does 25 damage up close which

core and four shots on hardcore as it
takes<00:01:13.470> ads<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> damage<00:01:14.729> drops<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.570> 17

on a range of 50 meters and forgot to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.399 
on a range of 50 meters and forgot to
mention<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.310> damage<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> 25<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.659> just<00:01:22.259> up

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
mention that the damage of 25 is just up

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.580 
mention that the damage of 25 is just up
to<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> range<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> 8<00:01:23.070> meters<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.380> pretty<00:01:25.380> average

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
to a range of 8 meters so pretty average

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
to a range of 8 meters so pretty average
stats<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.670> an<00:01:26.820> assault<00:01:27.150> rifle

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
stats there it's like an assault rifle

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
stats there it's like an assault rifle
basically<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:30.360> gun<00:01:30.540> has<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.520> pretty<00:01:32.520> low

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
basically and the gun has a pretty low

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
basically and the gun has a pretty low
kick<00:01:32.970> compared<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> belt<00:01:34.290> fed<00:01:34.530> lmg<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
kick compared to the belt fed lmg so

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
kick compared to the belt fed lmg so
it's<00:01:36.180> not<00:01:36.390> hard<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.720> control<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.290> guns

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
it's not hard to control this guns

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
it's not hard to control this guns
recoil<00:01:38.240> however<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.540> would<00:01:39.659> definitely

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
recoil however I would definitely

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.560 
recoil however I would definitely
recommend<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.340> burst<00:01:41.579> fire<00:01:41.909> with<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.329> gun

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
recommend you burst fire with this gun

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
recommend you burst fire with this gun

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
as like it is with all the other lmg so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.980 
as like it is with all the other lmg so
you<00:01:48.930> only<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.560> follow<00:01:50.159> 21<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.970> close<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
you only want to follow 21 on close to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.719 
you only want to follow 21 on close to
mid<00:01:52.170> range<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.799> soon<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> try<00:01:53.399> killing

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
people at longer ranges even if you have

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
on the enemy it's not gonna hit because

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
on the enemy it's not gonna hit because
the<00:02:00.930> spread<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.500> pretty<00:02:01.829> pretty<00:02:02.130> damn<00:02:02.490> big<00:02:02.909> if

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the spread is pretty pretty damn big if

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.870 
the spread is pretty pretty damn big if
you<00:02:03.360> pull<00:02:03.719> out<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> fire<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.500> gun<00:02:04.740> for<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.850> a

and<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> be<00:02:08.580> lot<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.360> precise

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
and you're going to be lot more precise

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.050 
and you're going to be lot more precise
and<00:02:10.979> also<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.370> gun<00:02:11.580> features<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and also this gun features a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.589 
and also this gun features a
short<00:02:13.810> mode<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.069> can<00:02:15.430> well<00:02:15.849> verse<00:02:16.060> 5<00:02:16.360> you

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
short mode so you can well verse 5 you

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.300 
short mode so you can well verse 5 you
can<00:02:16.810> definitely<00:02:17.170> use<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.349> on<00:02:17.770> longer<00:02:18.069> range

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
can definitely use that on longer range

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.490 
can definitely use that on longer range
as<00:02:18.489> if<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.819> aren't<00:02:19.660> comfortable<00:02:19.870> with<00:02:20.230> burst

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
as if you aren't comfortable with burst

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.280 
as if you aren't comfortable with burst
firing<00:02:20.860> on<00:02:21.160> other<00:02:21.280> guns<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.020> when<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.050> tried<00:02:23.260> it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
firing on other guns so when I tried it

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.229 
firing on other guns so when I tried it
out<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.860> kick<00:02:27.250> as<00:02:27.459> I<00:02:27.489> said<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> little

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
out and the kick as I said is a little

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.990 
out and the kick as I said is a little
bit<00:02:28.360> more<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:28.950> however<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.280> myself

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
bit more to the right however I myself

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.150 
bit more to the right however I myself
don't<00:02:31.360> have<00:02:31.510> any<00:02:31.630> trouble<00:02:31.989> compensating<00:02:32.980> this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
don't have any trouble compensating this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.330 
don't have any trouble compensating this
so<00:02:33.459> as<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.510> said<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.319> do<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.680> first<00:02:35.980> firing

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
so as I said you can do the first firing

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.070 
so as I said you can do the first firing
a<00:02:36.580> nun<00:02:36.700> mid-range<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.360> gonna<00:02:37.480> drag<00:02:37.780> down<00:02:38.050> the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
a nun mid-range it's gonna drag down the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.720 
a nun mid-range it's gonna drag down the
trigger<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.530> little<00:02:38.650> bit<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.250> left<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.670> a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730

little bit down and like that you will

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.520 
little bit down and like that you will
stay<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:41.950> target<00:02:42.190> easily<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:47.230> get

attachment<00:04:12.910> for<00:04:13.060> this<00:04:13.180> gun<00:04:13.359> i<00:04:13.389> think<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.780> grip

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
attachment for this gun i think the grip

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.340 
attachment for this gun i think the grip
is<00:04:14.019> better<00:04:14.380> as<00:04:14.730> i<00:04:15.750> feel<00:04:16.750> more<00:04:16.959> comfortable

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
is better as i feel more comfortable

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.450 
using a belt-fed lmg with a bipod I
really<00:04:21.070> don't<00:04:21.159> like<00:04:21.280> using<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:22.270> magazine-fed

with a bipod that's just it's not it's

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.440 
with a bipod that's just it's not it's
not<00:04:29.680> worth<00:04:29.950> it<00:04:30.160> you'd<00:04:30.580> rather<00:04:30.730> have<00:04:30.880> an<00:04:31.060> m6

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
not worth it you'd rather have an m6

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.720

you're a pkp with five pots those work
way<00:04:33.910> better<00:04:34.710> so<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:35.740> would<00:04:35.950> definitely

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
way better so I would definitely

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.060

exactly you have to use what is best
this<00:04:45.880> is<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.840> pretty<00:04:47.080> versatile<00:04:47.620> gun<00:04:47.890> however<00:04:48.670> I

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
this is a pretty versatile gun however I

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.770 
this is a pretty versatile gun however I
do<00:04:48.910> think<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:50.020> red<00:04:50.770> dot<00:04:51.120> Cobra<00:04:52.120> or<00:04:52.150> reflex

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
do think that a red dot Cobra or reflex

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.170 
do think that a red dot Cobra or reflex
sight<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.710> reflex<00:04:54.160> holographic<00:04:54.820> sight<00:04:55.030> will

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
sight that reflex holographic sight will

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.600 
sight that reflex holographic sight will
definitely<00:04:55.690> do<00:04:55.810> a<00:04:55.900> great<00:04:56.140> job<00:04:56.220> however<00:04:57.220> if<00:04:57.430> you

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
definitely do a great job however if you

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.370 
definitely do a great job however if you
like<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:58.030> carb<00:04:58.390> or<00:04:58.540> something<00:04:58.960> like<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.140> you

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
like a carb or something like that you

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.860 
like a carb or something like that you
can't<00:04:59.680> give<00:04:59.920> it<00:05:00.010> a<00:05:00.100> try<00:05:00.370> but<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.390> don't<00:05:01.510> think<00:05:01.750> it

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
can't give it a try but I don't think it

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.030 
can't give it a try but I don't think it
would<00:05:01.990> work<00:05:02.020> as<00:05:02.350> well<00:05:02.590> as<00:05:02.860> a<00:05:03.700> non<00:05:03.970> zoom<00:05:04.240> scope

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
would work as well as a non zoom scope

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.440 
would work as well as a non zoom scope
so<00:05:06.040> there<00:05:06.370> goes<00:05:06.550> my<00:05:06.700> preference<00:05:07.180> for<00:05:07.330> the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
so there goes my preference for the

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.540 
so there goes my preference for the
sides<00:05:07.690> as<00:05:07.960> i<00:05:08.260> see<00:05:08.410> here<00:05:08.530> i<00:05:08.590> used<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.160> wrap<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.460> or

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550
