00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 

and<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.900> think<00:01:46.020> as<00:01:46.560> long<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:46.830> he<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.220> somethings

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and I think as long as he do somethings

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.950 
and I think as long as he do somethings
better<00:01:47.880> than<00:01:48.119> doing<00:01:48.510> nothing

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
better than doing nothing

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
better than doing nothing
and<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.619> his<00:01:49.920> focus<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.460> fighting<00:01:51.299> whalers

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and if his focus is fighting whalers

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.910 
and if his focus is fighting whalers
