00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.929
 hey people would be here and I wanted to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.970
 Just let it know that last night 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.379
 Two more brand new call of the ghosts 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.360
 videos have been published 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.400
 the one video is the official launch 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.169
 Trailer will be in America then 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.659
 shown on TV, of course, and me 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.070
 think with us on prosieben, for example 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.439
 you could even in the comments 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.089
 Write if the last year at black 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.380
 ops 2 was also on TV 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.269
 I'm namely me not quite 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.679
 I'm sure I think so 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.300
 case, the trailer is right again 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.160
 Of course, there are many 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.189
 exploding shots jets and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
 helicopters and cars and earthquakes and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 collapsing skyscrapers probably people 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.550
 here under flies and house walls down 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 slip and there are even those 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 Attack the rally and then finish 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.629
 there is still an exploding room 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.250
 exploding space station of course 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.690
 We already heard that at the beginning 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.550
 I have an extra made again 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 it's the first story mission that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 I could also watch that I will 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.809
 of course in the description 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.090
 link as well as the link to 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.559
 official launch trailer and even though 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.030
 the launch trailer is really crazy 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 I find the second video that you 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 have released yesterday still around 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 a lot better 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.150
 that is in five minutes 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.670
 interview with mark rubin about that 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.620
 sports system beyond the grade of this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.940
 call of duty ghost very interesting because 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.770
 he shows exactly how everything works 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.630
 How to change the clothes 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.610
 Can the face and just the whole 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.680
 class with the pictet system with the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.030
 new extended pecking system and there 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.160
 Of course you also have a few new ones 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.370
 seen objects such as a 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.600
 second gun of a pistol took spd 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.230
 just like the submachine gun 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.150
 black Ops 2 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.950
 the interesting thing about the gun you 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.070
 does not look like any normal 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.950
 pistol, such as the 57 or the 45 tak 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 this looks like the graphic from mw2 and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.260
 who with the concept nothing at all 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.640
 can start 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.500
 You can see that in the background I can 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.000
 have a screenshot made that has so 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.130
 So it will be a prop 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.900
 most likely a gun 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.310
 who shoots in ointments or maybe 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.150
 even fully automatic is there I am 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.770
 very excited 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.420
 You can tell me once in the comments 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.160
 Write what you think I personally 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.690
 think that they are really in seiffen 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.910
 that's how it has got 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.530
 looked at the africa and the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.330
 only gun somehow similar 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.070
 see is your africa and that's why i think 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.480
 that will be a gun too 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.369
 in ointments shoots' cause we just 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.599
 have not seen for a long time and mine 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.859
 which was actually quite fun 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.900
 to play with these weapons 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.810
 Of course, the two are left and in the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.550
 description and 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.500
 I'll tell you on the day I click 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.319
 that call of duty ghost really does 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.970
 in 14 days on tuesday comes out and 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.500
 I should even have it on friday 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.000
 and that would mean then 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.890
 that I really am the whole weekend 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 I can make videos for you 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.489
 Then you really three or three from Tuesday 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.440
 can bring four videos a day 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.420
 to the newest things in the multiplayer 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.220
 investor ii and in this new noble 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.540
 mode if it is really there then 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.370
 would still be no confirmation 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 In any case, that was real 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.480
 madness the big problem is now only 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.940
 This year it is really that stupid 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.980
 on friday is all saints and so on 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.690
 Of course not delivered either 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.010
 do that now so i am already on 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.790
 Thursday would get that would be natural 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.860
 even better 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.660
 or maybe then, hopefully 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.459
 saturday, if it does not come on friday 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.080
 otherwise I get the monday and that 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.310
 It would be a shame because then I have one 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.500
 a bit of a time pressure because I like you 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.330
 Of course, I want to bring a lot of good videos 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.280
 Of course I'll post you on youtube and 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.319
 Keep things running on twitter 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.390
 there are some really exciting super 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.650
 weeks on us to say goodbye 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.000
 but now and that would be real 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.769
 nice if you have my thumb up 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 because I really try it 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.829
 always up to date 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.900
 I wish you a nice day 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.370
 and a lot of fun with the two videos 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 something from me pisa
