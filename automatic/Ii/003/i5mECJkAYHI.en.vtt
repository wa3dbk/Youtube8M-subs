00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.910
 and hello to all those I hope you 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.160
 okay here damien of the collective who 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.610
 puts for a new tutorial with 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.470
 wordpress 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.320
 so today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.939
 to create a responsive website that 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.450
 will fit on any type of 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.239
 terminal 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.869
 this is from the computer screen of the 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:33.260
 tablet or mobile and realize it 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.570
 entirely on your hard drive so at 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.820
 know that there we will not work 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 on a web host but on the disk 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.800
 hard and to interpret the php 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.880
 we will need a local server so 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.340
 if you are on macintosh 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.620
 we can use missing so you 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.630
 will have to follow the manips if you are 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.060
 on windows in the source files I 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.540
 you inserted links for 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.760
 download either esi php or download 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.900
 sales servers with small utopias 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.770
 to configure it and to configure the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.649
 database once you have 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.020
 downloaded these servers the local server 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.289
 we can create our database 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.289
 in phpmyadmin for suddenly launched 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.899
 the installation of wordpress once 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.210
 wordpress is installed we can 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.859
 start to configure it we will do the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.780
 difference between pages and 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:29.960
 articles which will allow us to 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.600
 constitute our menu we will be able 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.630
 also added sub- levels to 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.459
 menu if you have for example 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.920
 different categories to treat that you 

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:41.450
 avoid having an extended menu 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.909
 so we'll see how to declare a menu 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.939
 how to declare a second menu that will be 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.579
 rather focused social networks we will see 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.619
 how to integrate our eyes she is 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.079
 automatically or war 3 will take care of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.580
 put little icons a little bit more 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.520
 down well we will post 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.340
 the last 5 items and we'll see 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.290
 how to insert a logo again 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.570
 without using programming none 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.540
 clickable logo at the click back on 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.700
 which of the website 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.440
 so I was talking to you about pages and 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.860
 articles so we will make the difference 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.260
 between a page that you can see here 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.140
 and articles here that you can see 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.320
 in the news page we will limit 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.330
 besides the number of articles to 5 but 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.880
 we will see how to increase it if we 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.920
 wish and you will see some beyond 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.080
 of five wordpress articles creates us a 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.850
 pagination to navigate from page to page 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.240
 it will be the occasion also for you 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.580

 we will also see how to allow 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.260
 comments or masks and we 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.910

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.319
 since at the base it is in English so 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.719
 how 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.579

 these songs the interest also of this 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.109

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.460
 we will also see how to protect 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.780
 at most his website 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.250
 so we will yield 2 2 small plugin for 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.580
 to hide already at first 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.240
 access to your area for you 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.620
 identify 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.270
 so we'll see how to specify a 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.710
 other url normally in general 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.580

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.530
 disconnect disconnect hop on there 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.639
 to adapt one just type something from the 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.840
 type w pull login to login to the 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.490
 admin console and well there we 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.520
 the user wants to connect 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.039
 will land on a 404 page so we'll see 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.680
 how to specify another address so 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:10.620
 here we are on the admin area we are going 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:12.430
 to be able to reconnect here and also 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.520
 I go back 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.500
 how to block some users 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.500
 because you have to know that on this page 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.090
 there we can for example try to 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.669
 enter identifiers and words from 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.289
 spends a hundred thousand times wordpress is not going 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.080
 not you block so we'll see how 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.660
 limit to the number of three 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.720
 connection attempts how so 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.400
 block a person beyond we will see 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.280
 also how to attribute to a time 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.130
 blocking at the ip address and 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.990
 so it's full of little tips for 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.620
 so secure at least the site 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.410
 Internet 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.789
 lastly so here we go more 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.010
 talk about wordpress but let's talk about 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.870
 database transfer to a 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.169
 host so we'll see how 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.479
 recover all of our tables from 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:01.630
 the database how to export them 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.800
 and how to insert them directly via 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.620
 our web host 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.090
 we will also see how 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.090
 to transfer 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.120
 all of our files with a 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.460
 ftp client in the directory of your 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.680
 web host 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.690
 we will also see last game 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.150
 how to assign certain rights so 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.430
 some permissions to folders 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:26.010
 in particular to be able to send 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:29.460
 images without problems on the server 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.889
 so of course the site will be responsible 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.740
 that is, he will adapt to 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.260
 any type of terminal like I 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.680
 you had it specified you can see it 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:42.660
 so there if we reduce considerably 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:47.220
 you see that here in the whole bar 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:48.960
 of left baceux this mini girl and for 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.060
 leave room for a menu so mini proud 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.380
 and at the click we just recover from the 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:58.889
 hit our our menu so here we are 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:03.630
 rather on a display like the tablet 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:05.370
 in portrait and if we reduce 1 to a minimum 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:09.000
 there we are not sure of the display 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.850
 so you still motionless so you see that 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.650
 everything works perfectly 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.110
 that's the pagination he can 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.840
 easily enter the articles 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:21.740
 here and then leave comments 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.750
 if you wish 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.940
 so I hope you enjoy this tutorial 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.479
 and I'll find you right now for 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.479
 start it
