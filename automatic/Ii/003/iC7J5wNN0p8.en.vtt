00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.300
 well and for many people school is again 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.190
 started and my school starts tomorrow 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.329
 that is very nice or very nice if 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 do to him 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.899
 save pronunciation I am very curious 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.059
 because i'm going to new school that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.309
 training people 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.469
 I am curious and I have one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.710
 bit fancy but I think it's after 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.160
 two weeks soon again cell wall high sense 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.930
 more i want vacation yes i think and we 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 let's start with the question 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 why are you so nice well this is one 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.670
 whole agreement ask because yes I find that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 really nice about myself that i would 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.570
 don't know what i will never be here 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.299
 so I think the question is more blood 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.970
 from what through beautiful or fun to yourself 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.690
 and when I think about it I think 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.910
 I like my eyes because I like you 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.920
 not to watch this screen or away 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.620
 or that really so white 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.470
 very difficult question this what is your height 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.010
 I am 1 meter 70 if you should 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.870
 choose 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 roy or martijn after the says one 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.170
 impossible question because roy is normal 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.200
 my best friend and he will be mine 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 friend i don't want us all without 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.630
 say it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.670
 and we can do it with the three of them 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.110
 good find we go loose people 3 you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.480
 want to do things 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.000
 so yes high tech do not choose between and 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.340
 I can not therefore choose the pieces 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.530

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.200

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.410

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.770
 also take a moment 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.190
 and then she suddenly said chunks of dorothea 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.970

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.470
 names that has been around for almost 10 years 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 how time flies past some of you 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.520

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.600
 greatest wish in life right now 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.660
 a serio project but crafty yes and that 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.860
 is a game channel on youtube perch pro 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.660

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.100
 wish that is really a big wish 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.990
 that seems wonderful to me 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.140
 and there is still a time for a rest 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.250
 film or so the players and other experience 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.260
 what do you want to be when you've grown up 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.350
 for me it's my previous video over 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.420
 answer something like that but I want you in the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.670
 do film and photography world and what 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.520
 exactly that rule three what seems to you 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.350
 terrible country to go there 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.610
 all war countries but that seems to me 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.040
 quite logical 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.360
 good thing to kijmen really not the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.550

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.230
 and I 've never been there but 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.080
 it just does n't seem like fun at all 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.600
 Yes, yes, there is the rest of those countries 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.220
 so we asked romania 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.380
 I know a lot what you are wearing that seems to me 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.769
 really that uninteresting countries 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.510
 nothing to see or to do would you 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.489
 we interview that church if yes 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.019
 what questions are left to ask 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.480
 I would like to interview there but me 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.680
 do n't have reasonable questions but me 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.150

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.200
 but wish it would be very nice if you 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.810
 take a look and maybe 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.370
 subscribe how we came up with the idea 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.260
 start a youtube channel 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.540
 well i have one that bored us at one 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.000
 day and then we went to stay and still 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.950
 nine years old when we decided 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.470
 to make a musical and I still had 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.540
 never behind music video from amateurs 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.910
 anticipated I might have one or two 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.830
 that me was not really in the youtube per 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.930
 team but overall I've never 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.890
 Bored us out makes a good one 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.410
 copies 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.840
 to a song by the black eyed peas 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.060
 and system ring were more random videos 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.970
 and simply turn on the app and 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.310
 dance or music and so on very random and 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.010
 and then a little more things started 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.620
 to provide such as short movies and went 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.450
 filming in a playground or something 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.490
 while the sea went better me 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.620
 More and more YouTube videos and watch 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.690
 we dream better and cold cameras 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.760
 we also went vlogging 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.810
 so it really started it this were the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.730
 ask 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.770
