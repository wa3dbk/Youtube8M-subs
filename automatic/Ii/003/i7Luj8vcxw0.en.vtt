00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.620
 for a video call of duty black 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.389
 ops so affixed a week of a 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.410
 utility on the chain become but 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.119
 it was because I had done my 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.619
 union of the common videos are 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.760
 went out I told myself for them 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.740
 latecomers it is the fact of videos to 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.029
 see and I like report was to play the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.519
 couple is the last suspense 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 weeks me sorry guys do not have day 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.480
 resume the videos after this race 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.769
 very typical and so we end up 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.660
 like Thursday on blackhawks 2 for 1 or 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.000
 any other ichat so episode I do not know 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.390
 no more too much but for another 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.739
 club 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.710
 we will not say complex but something 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.910
 be pretty cool case that can be 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 stall in a complete trick shots you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.840
 that's it for christophe you have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.539
 you need a machine gun their 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
 assault rifles with a shooting area 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.680
 as well as hansenet well it 's not 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.789
 inevitably patrick shot and that's all we 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.379
 what you need to do if you have to 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.539
 all the balls of your charge that 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.980
 is called that does not stop afterglow so 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.530
 whether she is after re or two 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.950
 so it's not clear that it's not 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:10.869
 disappeared superb that she did not disappear 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:11.770
 we must avoid redoing a little 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.940
 drunk it's the third time I 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.580
 again because like that to be 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.080
 not to get rid of her then she would not 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.140
 delete earlier it may be 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.160
 why study me you is what I 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.960
 will kill like that it would make me that she 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.479
 Here is more pronounced everywhere 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.500
 in short, for what it is poor 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.940
 or empty all the hands of your 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.970
 charger 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.980
 and then now I want to show his 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.600
 fifth kenzo guerlain choroidal voice 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.860
 onlookers then want to charge you 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.660
 do not necessarily pick up lady who is 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.610
 marked and you can invest your 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.020
 soul you have to reload or is what makes 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.750
 your canes it will not be made of you 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.830
 were recharging and what will 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.200
 shoot the case once past the area 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.820
 sniper shooting offers you that you have 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.500
 to do it's it's a fear it's 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.270
 when the shot you change on the sniper 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.520
 and in following you will have the kent be 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.100
 So here it is not super complicated 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.880
 is easily must 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.580
 I understood if you do not have 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.110
 including really look beyond 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.970
 how did I do so roughly upwind 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.710
 good i also write to you about your case 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.130
 you will see I will write what it takes 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.880
 so basically you empty you empty 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.550
 all your balls you pick up balloon 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.260
 on the ground so finally tears to do 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.810
 kansas then you take your weapon 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.220
 whether she is you put these you 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.530
 call shooting area you change from 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 spike dive into sniper mutations 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.760
 and then whatever she does that you 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.210
 do you want to do that? 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.650
 will put on on the caine either and then pouf 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.640
 and austria is so a great and 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.620
 not clear it got complicated 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.450
 explained by us like that so that's it 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.360
 if I think we'll get there it 'll go 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.560
