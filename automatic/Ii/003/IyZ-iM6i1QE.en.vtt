Mark Henry and so on so yeah it's not

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
Mark Henry and so on so yeah it's not
really<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.399> easy<00:01:48.950> imagine<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.040> think<00:01:50.329> but<00:01:51.329> if

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
really that easy imagine we think but if

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.700 
really that easy imagine we think but if
you<00:01:52.040> like<00:01:53.040> any<00:01:53.369> other<00:01:53.490> event<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> PC<00:01:55.500> see

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
you like any other event like a PC see

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.850 
you like any other event like a PC see
if<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.219> money<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.850> buy<00:01:57.170> like<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.469> bouts

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
if you have money to buy like the bouts

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.569 
if you have money to buy like the bouts
and<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.340> title<00:01:59.700> matches<00:02:00.500> then<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:02.310> probably

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and the title matches then you probably

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.410 
and the title matches then you probably
get<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.119> survivors<00:02:03.899> thing<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> yeah

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
get the survivors thing so yeah

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.290 
get the survivors thing so yeah
that's<00:02:07.020> pretty<00:02:07.229> much<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.860> guess<00:02:08.130> if<00:02:09.060> you're

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that's pretty much it I guess if you're

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.800 
that's pretty much it I guess if you're
not<00:02:09.509> spending<00:02:10.370> um<00:02:11.370> you're<00:02:12.209> not<00:02:12.239> purchasing

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
not spending um you're not purchasing

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.470 
not spending um you're not purchasing
the<00:02:12.989> bouts<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.470> guess<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:13.830> play<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.730> every

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
the bouts I guess just play like every

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.220 
the bouts I guess just play like every
hour<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:20.000> think<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.330> interesting<00:02:21.989> thing<00:02:22.020> about

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
hour I think one interesting thing about

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.350 
hour I think one interesting thing about
it<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.890> um<00:02:23.600> like<00:02:25.970> um<00:02:27.890> what<00:02:28.890> quality<00:02:29.670> opponents

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
it is um like um what quality opponents

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.660 
it is um like um what quality opponents
are<00:02:33.200> since<00:02:34.200> says<00:02:34.470> opponent<00:02:35.040> difficulty

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
are since says opponent difficulty

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.970 
are since says opponent difficulty
increases<00:02:35.819> with<00:02:36.540> every<00:02:36.569> win<00:02:39.860> say<00:02:40.860> that's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
increases with every win say that's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.520 
increases with every win say that's
pretty<00:02:41.250> much<00:02:41.519> it<00:02:41.580> um<00:02:42.420> if<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.720> guys<00:02:42.870> play<00:02:43.230> like

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
pretty much it um if you guys play like

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.250 
pretty much it um if you guys play like
a<00:02:43.769> lot<00:02:44.220> of<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> other<00:02:44.810> mobile<00:02:45.810> games<00:02:46.019> out

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
there you probably know how this thing
