00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.139
 came to me and asked me to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.189
 I took it apart and sent it now 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:25.490
 and certainly as well as the head of administration 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:57.840

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:03.510

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:10.409

 last names let it be on their conscience to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:25.460
 their party has experienced a lot of responsibility 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:29.460
 these times we experienced 2004 2005 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.400
 out of the party about two hundred thousand but 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.979
 then over 600 thousand joined the party 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.259
 Now the situation will probably repeat 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.920
 one and a half million let you come out five hundred 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:49.939
 thousand though i don't think anyway 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.939
