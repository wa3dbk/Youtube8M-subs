like<00:00:38.910> getting<00:00:39.239> off<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.570> screens<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.410> running

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
like getting off the screens and running

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.250 
like getting off the screens and running
the<00:00:41.010> baseline<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.850> well<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.300> he<00:00:42.840> thrives

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the baseline really well and he thrives

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
the baseline really well and he thrives
in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> corners<00:00:44.040> where<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.280> probably<00:00:44.730> think

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
in the corners where I probably think

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
in the corners where I probably think
that's<00:00:45.239> his<00:00:45.450> strongest<00:00:45.719> shooting<00:00:46.260> pocket<00:00:46.680> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that's his strongest shooting pocket and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639 
that's his strongest shooting pocket and
he<00:00:47.309> buries<00:00:47.670> wide-open<00:00:48.239> shots<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.840> he<00:00:49.140> really

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
he buries wide-open shots and he really

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
he buries wide-open shots and he really
uses<00:00:50.129> his<00:00:50.550> speed<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.379> compliment<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
uses his speed as a compliment so like I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
uses his speed as a compliment so like I
said<00:00:53.309> he<00:00:53.460> can<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.850> open<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.510> he<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.780> make<00:00:54.989> big

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
said he can get open and he can make big

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
said he can get open and he can make big
shots<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.860> also<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.730> him<00:00:56.879> because<00:00:57.000> he's<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
shots I also like him because he's so

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.080 
shots I also like him because he's so
young<00:00:57.660> father<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:58.770> his<00:00:59.010> side<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> as

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a result he's gonna have so many

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.619 
a result he's gonna have so many
different<00:01:01.829> opportunities<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> grow<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.149> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
different opportunities to grow and so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.750 
different opportunities to grow and so
many<00:01:03.809> moments<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.350> thrive<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.040> he's<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
many moments to thrive and he's one of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
many moments to thrive and he's one of
the<00:01:05.850> youngest<00:01:06.090> players<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.840> draft<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the youngest players in this draft so I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
the youngest players in this draft so I
think<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.280> definitely<00:01:08.430> helps<00:01:09.000> him<00:01:09.180> he<00:01:09.720> could

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
think that definitely helps him he could

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
think that definitely helps him he could
be<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> team<00:01:10.799> with<00:01:10.830> veterans<00:01:11.460> who<00:01:11.580> could

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
be on a team with veterans who could

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
be on a team with veterans who could
really<00:01:11.970> help<00:01:12.180> him<00:01:12.299> grow<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.930> get<00:01:13.020> better<00:01:13.229> or

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
really help him grow and get better or

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.140 
really help him grow and get better or
he<00:01:14.100> could<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> team<00:01:14.760> that's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> lot

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
he could be on a team that's a lot

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.999 
he could be on a team that's a lot
younger<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.659> he<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.320> raised<00:01:16.590> together

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
younger and he can be raised together

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
younger and he can be raised together
with<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> nice<00:01:17.700> core<00:01:18.060> group<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.450> guys<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.990> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
with a nice core group of guys and I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
with a nice core group of guys and I
also<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.610> he's<00:01:20.700> an<00:01:20.820> undefined<00:01:21.299> player<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
also think he's an undefined player and

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.630 
also think he's an undefined player and
I<00:01:22.290> think<00:01:22.470> that's<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.680> good<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.369> sense

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
I think that's a good thing in a sense

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
I think that's a good thing in a sense
because<00:01:24.030> his<00:01:24.240> athleticism<00:01:24.720> helps<00:01:25.320> him<00:01:25.530> do

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
because his athleticism helps him do

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
ways and he doesn't have that pressure

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.170 
ways and he doesn't have that pressure
of<00:01:42.720> having<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.649> show<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.950> his<00:01:44.280> game<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.909> one

of having to show you his game in one
different<00:01:45.600> area<00:01:45.899> now<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> cons<00:01:47.040> about

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
different area now the cons about

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.520 
different area now the cons about
Levine's<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.960> thing<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.290> don't<00:01:49.350> like

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Levine's game the thing I don't like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.480 
Levine's game the thing I don't like
about<00:01:49.680> him<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.220> he<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.210> raw<00:01:51.600> player<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
about him is he is a raw player and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
about him is he is a raw player and
there's<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.549> lot<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.939> upside<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.930> just

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
there's a lot of upside like I just

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.810 
there's a lot of upside like I just
mentioned<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> thing<00:01:56.790> is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
mentioned with that but the thing is

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.209 
mentioned with that but the thing is
that<00:01:57.000> doesn't<00:01:57.450> mean<00:01:57.810> he's<00:01:58.020> defined<00:01:58.530> yet

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that doesn't mean he's defined yet

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.130 
that doesn't mean he's defined yet
could<00:01:59.670> he<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.759> good<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.450> he's<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.049> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
could he be good I think he's going to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
could he be good I think he's going to
be<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.649> think<00:02:01.890> he<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:02.640> but

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
be good and I think he can be good but

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.760 
be good and I think he can be good but
the<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:03.930> he<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.500> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the thing is will he be good that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
the thing is will he be good that
remains<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.549> seen

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
remains to be seen

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.639 
remains to be seen
a<00:02:06.149> lot<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.630> other<00:02:06.750> guys<00:02:06.960> are<00:02:07.170> picking<00:02:07.350> guys

a lot of other guys are picking guys

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.139 
a lot of other guys are picking guys
like<00:02:07.860> James<00:02:08.099> Young<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.580> Kentucky<00:02:09.030> because

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
like James Young out of Kentucky because

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.240 
like James Young out of Kentucky because
they<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.899> many<00:02:10.050> strong<00:02:10.500> assets<00:02:11.069> already

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
they have so many strong assets already

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.380 
they have so many strong assets already

the<00:02:12.600> reason<00:02:13.020> why<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> love<00:02:13.350> Levine<00:02:13.710> is<00:02:13.830> because

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
the reason why I love Levine is because

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.630 
the reason why I love Levine is because
of<00:02:14.160> his<00:02:14.280> ceiling<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.510> high<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:17.040> only<00:02:17.310> thing

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of his ceiling is so high the only thing

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.460 
of his ceiling is so high the only thing
with<00:02:17.970> Levine<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.390> when<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.600> look<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.840> his

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
with Levine is when you look at his

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.190 
with Levine is when you look at his
season<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:19.980> UCLA<00:02:20.640> he<00:02:21.180> didn't<00:02:21.540> exactly<00:02:21.870> have

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
season at UCLA he didn't exactly have

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.710 
season at UCLA he didn't exactly have
the<00:02:22.350> prettiest<00:02:22.770> stat1<00:02:23.220> he<00:02:23.760> only<00:02:24.000> averaged<00:02:24.450> 10

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the prettiest stat1 he only averaged 10

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.420 
the prettiest stat1 he only averaged 10
points<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.110> game<00:02:25.290> two<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> half<00:02:26.160> rebounds

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
points a game two and a half rebounds

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.720 
points a game two and a half rebounds
and<00:02:26.970> he<00:02:27.690> only<00:02:28.020> paid<00:02:28.290> about<00:02:28.560> 24<00:02:29.100> minutes<00:02:29.490> per

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
and he only paid about 24 minutes per

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.610 
and he only paid about 24 minutes per
game<00:02:30.000> now<00:02:30.570> when<00:02:30.810> he<00:02:30.930> did<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.320> lot<00:02:31.500> of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
game now when he did get a lot of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.400 
game now when he did get a lot of
playing<00:02:31.830> time<00:02:31.950> he<00:02:32.310> really<00:02:32.670> did<00:02:32.880> shine<00:02:33.210> but<00:02:34.020> he

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
playing time he really did shine but he

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.960 
playing time he really did shine but he
has<00:02:34.710> he<00:02:34.980> doesn't<00:02:35.400> have<00:02:35.550> as<00:02:35.730> much<00:02:35.910> experience

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
has he doesn't have as much experience

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.900 
has he doesn't have as much experience
as<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.810> lot<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.260> other<00:02:37.410> guys<00:02:37.590> now<00:02:38.490> where<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:38.850> I

as a lot of other guys now where do I

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.970

think<00:02:39.000> he'll<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.780> would<00:02:40.560> venture<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.890> guess

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
think he'll go I would venture to guess

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.010 
think he'll go I would venture to guess
he's<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.490> to<00:02:41.580> probably<00:02:41.970> fall<00:02:42.240> between<00:02:42.720> 10

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
he's going to probably fall between 10

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.860 
he's going to probably fall between 10
and<00:02:43.050> 17<00:02:43.800> now<00:02:44.520> it's<00:02:44.730> kind<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.120> wider<00:02:45.390> window

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
and 17 now it's kind of a wider window

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.570 
and 17 now it's kind of a wider window
that<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.080> lot<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.260> other<00:02:46.530> guys<00:02:46.740> but<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> thing

Sixers<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.200> 10<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.560> could<00:03:10.770> see<00:03:10.920> them<00:03:11.100> taking

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
Sixers of 10 and I could see them taking

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.370 
Sixers of 10 and I could see them taking
him<00:03:11.670> because<00:03:12.390> they<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.690> their<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.050> youngest

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
him because they have their the youngest

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.060 
him because they have their the youngest
team<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> NBA

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
team of the NBA

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.550 
team of the NBA
and<00:03:14.370> Brett<00:03:15.060> Brown<00:03:15.300> really<00:03:15.660> stresses<00:03:16.170> running

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
and Brett Brown really stresses running

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.500 
and Brett Brown really stresses running
on<00:03:16.650> offense<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> also<00:03:17.940> like<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> team<00:03:18.390> like

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
on offense but I also like a team like

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.539 
on offense but I also like a team like
the<00:03:18.660> Sun<00:03:18.930> 2<00:03:19.170> or<00:03:19.320> usually<00:03:19.890> they<00:03:20.220> usually

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
the Sun 2 or usually they usually

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.670 
the Sun 2 or usually they usually
revolve<00:03:20.850> around<00:03:21.060> a<00:03:21.269> good<00:03:21.480> offense<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.320> he's

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
revolve around a good offense and he's

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.870 
revolve around a good offense and he's
something<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.130> wouldn't<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.549> as<00:03:23.730> much

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
something that wouldn't have as much

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.850 
something that wouldn't have as much
pressure<00:03:24.239> around<00:03:24.690> him<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.140> then<00:03:25.560> even<00:03:25.709> the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
pressure around him and then even the

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.620 
pressure around him and then even the
Celtics<00:03:26.340> they're<00:03:26.519> young<00:03:26.790> they're<00:03:27.330> trying<00:03:27.600> to

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
Celtics they're young they're trying to

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.570 
Celtics they're young they're trying to
get<00:03:27.780> better<00:03:27.989> he<00:03:28.620> could<00:03:28.799> work<00:03:29.010> well<00:03:29.220> with<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.459> guy

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
get better he could work well with a guy

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.490 
get better he could work well with a guy
like<00:03:29.790> Rondo<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.810> there's<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.140> couple<00:03:31.320> different

like Rondo so there's a couple different
places<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.430> him<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.150> could<00:03:33.360> see<00:03:33.510> him

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
places I like him but I could see him

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.080 
places I like him but I could see him
fall<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.840> between<00:03:33.989> 10<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.410> 17<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.640> ceiling
