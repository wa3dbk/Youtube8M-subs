00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 beautiful all guys are blin 46 today there 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.940
 we find the boys in a new video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.510
 you were waiting for this video from 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.630
 so is the average configuration for pc 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.730
 as I said in the fast blog 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.699
 the configurations I'm doing not 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 are only for gaming because as I 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.770
 say 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.859
 if you want you could buy gods 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.480
 cheaper and over components 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.240
 block them to death to have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 similar performance or a hair over the more 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.500
 high but my configurations are 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.980
 think both to play and to play 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.690
 be able to do other jobs or render or 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.370
 do so many other things then 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.000
 configurations that I propose to you are 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 suitable for multiple uses the configuration of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.649
 today it is a bit simplistic to call it media 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.620
 because based on the components you go 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.579
 to choose you can go from 600 euros 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.710
 about up to 1000 something euro because 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 I will give you some fixed points and then some 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.059
 upgrades you can do 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 obviously going up in price then 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.199
 I will leave from a base and then if you want 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 spend more so try to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 please as much as possible 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.750
 let's start with the processor the processor is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.850
 a 5 46 90k with socket lga1156 quad 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.640
 core without hyper threading because 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.590
 obviously every 5 n or some 7 is the top 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.229
 of range for the moment for the process 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.549
 of the five and being the ka version 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.590
 unlocked multiplier 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.360
 so if you want to try your hand at a 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.880
 overclock and therefore have performance 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.750
 even higher a frequency is even higher 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.579
 basic of 3.5 gigahertz however with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.549
 the turbo boost option can arrive 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.159
 up to 3gb s 9 then increasing the 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.810
 performance only when the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.460
 therefore we really exploit during a 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 rendering or during game sessions 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.750
 more intensive and down the 5 and then 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.820
 not having it hyper threading than not 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.250
 is exploited in the games we will have the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.890
 maximum performance we can 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.200
 have in play as hyper threading 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.549
 in the 7s when you go to play does not have 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 no sense as it does not come 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.750
 listened to and therefore you can have them 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 same performance in gaming 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.020
 he spoke of an i7 of the corresponding series 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.440
 as for the ram we find a 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.340
 dual channel 8gb kit then two 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.680
 banks from 4 to 2133 makers of g.skill 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.860
 also support hills memory profiles 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.660
 profile for a very simple overclock 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.370
 and therefore without risk we say for 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.930
 as for the motherboard we find 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.310
 a gigabyte ghz 97 p of three is one 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.930
 excellent motherboard 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.330
 all the components I have chosen are from 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.450
 medium-high or excellent range 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.040
 quality has 4 slots for the ram 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.190
 so we can add two more 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.960
 eventually to reach 16 gb 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.870
 supports both to crossfire mode of 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.880
 ati that slide envy and therefore wanting 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.430
 we can use two video cards for 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.760
 having obviously higher performances is 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.620
 equipped with two usb ports 3 and 4 usb 2 in the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.800
 rear panel and is expandable 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.500
 up to 4 usb 3 ports with the panel 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.970
 front and up to ten usb ports 2 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.950
 always with internal connectors 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.460
 as it has become king we find a cooler 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.820
 600 watt master elite series is more 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.960
 that's enough for a video card with 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.150
 a lot of hard drives 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.520
 if we want to use two video cards 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.830
 you will need to choose one 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.210
 slightly larger feeder for 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.640
 as for archiving as 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.460
 in the other configuration we find a 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.160
 one terabyte hard drive from the seagate 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.860
 barracuda schembri at 7,200 revolutions 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.590
 if we want higher performance we can 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.390
 add an ssd and i will leave you there later 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.250
 I will list all the various upgrades that you 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.410
 they can do the machine for how long 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.340
 concerns the that if we find a mid tower 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.880
 k 350 of the master cooler has tx and mini 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.370
 itx 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.320
 so despite a compact design it can 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.820
 contain all our peripherals of 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.140
 we need 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.050
 the case is a pretty choice 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.490
 subjective so if you prefer another 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.980
 that if you can choose another one 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.550
 any one that supports the challenges but 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.140
 of atrix 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.500
 as for the video cards 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.709
 I leave the choice to you as it varies 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.020
 very based on the budget so if you want 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.580
 spend little if you could choose the 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.380
 video card I recommended in the 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.720
 first configuration I will leave you the link 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.380
 in description if you want to take a step 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.410
 over 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.030
 you could 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.920
 an r 92 80 with 3GB of RAM is 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.750
 a great video card as a report 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.070
 price quality is really good 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.080
 excellent video card 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.770
 if you want to take a generation leap 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.590
 you can go on the 970 gtx of envy 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 one of the last cards issued by 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.720
 our beloved at home with 4gb of ram 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.400
 obviously the price goes up however also the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.230
 performance is on another level 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.730
 if we still want to take a step e 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.270
 so go on even more performance 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.840
 high 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.270
 we can go on a 980 gtx always from 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.990
 4 jig of envy that is a beast 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.280
 challenge video like the 970 a bit more 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.230
 powerful 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.990
 I state that by choosing these cards 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.540
 especially the last two videos yes 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.310
 get a gaming configuration that 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.280
 we say it does not have so many limitations in 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.420
 As you can play all ultras 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.260
 the last days of the new generation 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:21.920
 without compromise in fact considers the 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.690
 average configuration is wrong but 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.870
 obviously I mean it as a band of 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.460
 low average and high price not for the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.840
 absolute performance 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.970
 if we want to make improvements e 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.580
 therefore have even higher performance 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.020
 or in any case a solidity of the machine 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.090
 even higher 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.300
 we can upgrade like 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.230
 I told you earlier about 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.030
 kaiser feeder 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.190
 we said that choice discretion 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.110
 yours therefore at the most a taste on 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.880
 video card of the just listed 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.580
 the last two bars 3 upgrade yes 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.470
 can do on the ramp then 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.080
 buying two more beds of ram from 4 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.419
 gb to get to a total of 16 on 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.440
 derivation memory by adding an ssd 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:06.780
 from 120 250 or 500 gb for the system 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.919
 operational programs therefore having a 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.470
 system 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:13.020
 I think it combines a computer without 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.520
 ssb doesn't make sense at the moment I speak 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.590
 for me if you want quantity of 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.150
 storage and spend little you can't 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.300
 do nothing but go to a hard disk 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.730
 or buy a smaller ssd and a 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.350
 hard drive for storage what 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.620
 therefore highly advised to associate with 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:30.480
 example an ssd of 120 that relatively 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.250
 cheap with a hard 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.570
 from a terabyte where we can put 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.690
 all our data 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:40.160
 the last upgrade is for a possible 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.530
 overclock where we can buy a 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.450
 cheap air cooler for example 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.970
 also of the mass cooler is found yes 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.170
 find around 30 20 30 euros there 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.320
 allow to start making a 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.210
 new clock on our processor but the 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.770
 step further is a liquid heat sink 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.410
 as regards the heat sink a 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:02.520
 liquid I recommend a corsair of the 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.810
 series hundred then the 101 lacquer 101 the 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.360
 110 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.980
 because the yes liquid farm smaller 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.470
 then with a smaller radiator e 

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.030
 a smaller fan are not 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.350
 exactly the best 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.970
 remember to leave a like if it is you 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.880
 liked the video a dislike if there is not 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.530
 liked and to leave in the comments if 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.720
 you have any questions in the description 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.490
 as usual I will leave you all the links 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.830
 for the various components or any 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.210
 upgrade for this second 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.750
 configuration is everything and see you at 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.750
 next video
