00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
this figure licensing is definitely one

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.579 
this figure licensing is definitely one
of<00:00:38.579> them<00:00:38.820> definitely<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:40.019> of<00:00:40.050> those<00:00:40.320> issues

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
of them definitely one of those issues

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.610 
of them definitely one of those issues
regarding<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.249> delay<00:00:41.519> on<00:00:41.789> top<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.839> that<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
regarding a delay on top of that the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.040 
regarding a delay on top of that the
head<00:00:43.800> Scott<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.370> completely<00:00:44.999> different<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
head Scott is completely different the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.509 
head Scott is completely different the
body<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.440> completely<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.370> their

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
body is completely different their

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.819 
body is completely different their
tattoos<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.210> different<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:49.079> tailoring<00:00:49.499> I

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
tattoos are different the tailoring I

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.250 
tattoos are different the tailoring I
think<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.339> it<00:00:50.460> may<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.940> slightly<00:00:51.300> similar<00:00:51.629> but

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
think if it may be slightly similar but

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.049 
think if it may be slightly similar but
the<00:00:52.379> bottom<00:00:52.710> line<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> there<00:00:53.309> was<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the bottom line is there was a lot of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.750 
the bottom line is there was a lot of
redevelopment<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.409> figure<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.429> it

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
redevelopment for this figure and it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.160 
redevelopment for this figure and it
looks<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.420> they<00:00:57.659> have<00:00:57.839> done<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.050> better

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
looks like that they have done a better

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.229 
looks like that they have done a better
job<00:00:58.559> than<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.190> original<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.789> was<00:01:00.059> seen

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
job than the original one that was seen

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.319
