gene modded soldiers have their own

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.830 
gene modded soldiers have their own
unique<00:03:45.950> armor<00:03:46.250> style<00:03:46.670> this<00:03:47.300> gives<00:03:47.540> them<00:03:47.750> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
unique armor style this gives them a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.870 
unique armor style this gives them a
distinctive<00:03:48.410> look<00:03:48.440> on<00:03:48.710> the<00:03:48.800> battlefield<00:03:49.280> but

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
distinctive look on the battlefield but

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.520 
distinctive look on the battlefield but
it<00:03:50.000> works<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.330> same<00:03:50.360> way<00:03:50.600> as<00:03:51.050> the<00:03:51.230> rest<00:03:51.410> of

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
it works the same way as the rest of

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.930 
it works the same way as the rest of
ex-cons<00:03:52.010> armor<00:03:52.340> technology

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.820 

so<00:03:58.510> a<00:03:58.540> thin<00:03:58.750> man<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:58.990> going<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.170> drop<00:03:59.350> in<00:03:59.530> behind

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
so a thin man is going to drop in behind

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.640 
so a thin man is going to drop in behind
us<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:00.280> worse<00:04:00.460> and<00:04:00.700> worse<00:04:01.080> but<00:04:02.080> our<00:04:02.290> met<00:04:02.470> can

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
us so worse and worse but our met can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.380 
us so worse and worse but our met can
still<00:04:02.830> use<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.100> kinetic<00:04:03.430> strike<00:04:03.790> module<00:04:04.210> and

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
still use this kinetic strike module and

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.290 
still use this kinetic strike module and
teaches<00:04:05.050> Berserker<00:04:05.560> a<00:04:05.590> lesson

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.020 

alright<00:04:12.300> so<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.480> berserker<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:12.960> down<00:04:13.230> but<00:04:14.030> the

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
alright so the berserker is down but the

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.300 
alright so the berserker is down but the
thin<00:04:15.210> man<00:04:15.360> is<00:04:15.510> still<00:04:15.660> there<00:04:15.900> now<00:04:16.830> our<00:04:17.010> sniper

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
thin man is still there now our sniper

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.340 
thin man is still there now our sniper
however<00:04:17.790> has<00:04:18.090> one<00:04:18.420> of<00:04:18.540> dr.<00:04:18.810> chenes<00:04:19.110> new

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
however has one of dr. chenes new

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.199 
however has one of dr. chenes new
inventions<00:04:19.920> and<00:04:20.280> that's<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> needle<00:04:20.910> grenade

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
inventions and that's the needle grenade

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.480 
inventions and that's the needle grenade
so<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.780> needle<00:04:22.019> grenade<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.530> like<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> regular

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
so the needle grenade is like a regular

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.200 
so the needle grenade is like a regular
grenade<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.900> has<00:04:25.020> a<00:04:25.050> huge<00:04:25.380> blast<00:04:25.680> radius

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
grenade but it has a huge blast radius

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.270 
grenade but it has a huge blast radius
however<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.540> also<00:04:27.630> obeys<00:04:28.020> cover<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.040> thin

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
however it also obeys cover so the thin

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.300 
however it also obeys cover so the thin
man<00:04:29.460> will<00:04:29.610> be<00:04:29.700> hurt<00:04:29.910> but<00:04:30.360> our<00:04:30.480> soldier<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.900> safe

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.370 

okay<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> thin<00:04:38.580> man<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:38.850> down<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:40.020> we<00:04:40.110> can<00:04:40.260> take

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
okay the thin man is down so we can take

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.390
