00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
ranking in our tournament we have a good

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.789

you'll<00:04:35.260> never<00:04:35.380> forget<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:36.130> think<00:04:36.880> any<00:04:37.480> athlete

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
you'll never forget I think any athlete

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.490 
you'll never forget I think any athlete
that<00:04:38.650> performs<00:04:39.580> at<00:04:39.730> this<00:04:39.850> level<00:04:40.110> wants<00:04:41.110> to<00:04:41.380> go

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
that performs at this level wants to go

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.200
