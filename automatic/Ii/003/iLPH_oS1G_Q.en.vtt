thumbnail<00:00:06.720> silhouette<00:00:07.259> sketches<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:07.980> be

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
thumbnail silhouette sketches can be

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.829 
thumbnail silhouette sketches can be
really<00:00:08.429> great<00:00:08.639> because<00:00:09.120> they<00:00:09.240> don't<00:00:09.450> always

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:09.839 
really great because they don't always

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.180 
really great because they don't always
need<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.169> shown<00:00:10.499> to<00:00:10.650> other<00:00:10.740> people

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
need to be shown to other people

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.520 
need to be shown to other people
sometimes<00:00:11.820> they're<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.059> for<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.629> because

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
sometimes they're just for you because

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.869 
sometimes they're just for you because
of<00:00:13.559> this<00:00:13.709> you're<00:00:13.889> really<00:00:13.980> free<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.400> tackle<00:00:14.789> the

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 
of this you're really free to tackle the

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.850 
of this you're really free to tackle the
challenge<00:00:15.329> any<00:00:15.570> way<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.869> you<00:00:15.929> want<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
challenge any way that you want to and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.830 
challenge any way that you want to and
there's<00:00:17.130> not<00:00:17.279> really<00:00:17.429> a<00:00:17.550> way<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.759> cheat<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
there's not really a way to cheat so

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.259 
there's not really a way to cheat so
with<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.170> mind<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> cut<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.119> my

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269 
with this in mind I like to cut up my

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.870 
with this in mind I like to cut up my
thumbnails<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.929> use<00:00:22.710> photoshop's<00:00:23.220> warp<00:00:23.580> tool

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
thumbnails and use photoshop's warp tool

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.499 
thumbnails and use photoshop's warp tool
to<00:00:24.210> get<00:00:24.359> some<00:00:24.509> extra<00:00:24.810> variety<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> let's<00:00:27.390> say

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
to get some extra variety so let's say

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.970 
to get some extra variety so let's say
I've<00:00:27.630> drawn<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.320> thumbnail<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.919> I

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
I've drawn this one thumbnail that I

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.470 
I've drawn this one thumbnail that I
like<00:00:29.279> but<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.089> get<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.210> little<00:00:30.300> more

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
like but I want to get a little more

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089 
like but I want to get a little more
bang<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.900> my<00:00:30.929> buck<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.829> what<00:00:31.949> other

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
bang for my buck and see what other

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
bang for my buck and see what other
variations<00:00:32.820> might<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.480> interesting

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
variations might be more interesting

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.160 
variations might be more interesting
than<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.470> I<00:00:34.500> initially<00:00:34.800> came<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.370> with<00:00:36.080> so<00:00:37.080> my

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
than what I initially came up with so my

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.270 
than what I initially came up with so my
first<00:00:37.380> step<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.740> going<00:00:37.830> to<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.130> make<00:00:38.250> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
first step is going to be to make a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.830 
first step is going to be to make a
couple<00:00:38.520> copies<00:00:40.190> holding<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.310> alt<00:00:41.720> with<00:00:42.720> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
couple copies holding down alt with the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.930 
couple copies holding down alt with the
move<00:00:43.050> tool<00:00:43.080> and<00:00:43.440> each<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.340> them<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> made<00:00:44.790> on

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
move tool and each of them is made on

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
move tool and each of them is made on
their<00:00:45.060> own<00:00:45.180> layer<00:00:45.420> by<00:00:45.690> default<00:00:54.800> now<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> mess

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
their own layer by default now to mess

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.140 
their own layer by default now to mess
with<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.340> guy<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:56.790> bit<00:00:56.910> i'm<00:00:57.030> gonna

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
with this guy a little bit i'm gonna

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.550 
with this guy a little bit i'm gonna
start<00:00:57.270> by<00:00:57.420> making<00:00:57.540> a<00:00:57.750> marquee<00:00:58.140> around<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
start by making a marquee around the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.630 
start by making a marquee around the
upper<00:00:58.650> body<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.210> then<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> command

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
upper body and then use the command

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.210 
upper body and then use the command
layer<00:01:02.690> new<00:01:03.690> layer<00:01:04.670> via<00:01:05.670> cut<00:01:06.920> what<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.040> does

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
layer new layer via cut what that does

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.680 
layer new layer via cut what that does
is<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.370> cuts<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
is it cuts out what was in that

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.750 
is it cuts out what was in that
selection<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.440> then<00:01:10.710> paste<00:01:10.980> it<00:01:11.250> onto<00:01:11.430> its<00:01:11.640> own

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
selection and then paste it onto its own

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
selection and then paste it onto its own
layer<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.080> his<00:01:13.380> legs<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> his

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
layer so now I have his legs and his

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.320 
layer so now I have his legs and his
body<00:01:14.370> on<00:01:15.330> two<00:01:16.080> different<00:01:16.230> layers

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
body on two different layers

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.940 
body on two different layers
and<00:01:18.420> once<00:01:18.750> he's<00:01:18.900> chopped<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.800> work<00:01:19.890> with

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and once he's chopped up I can work with

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.910 
and once he's chopped up I can work with
each<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.490> parts<00:01:20.910> independently<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.860> I'm

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
each of these parts independently so I'm

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.110 
each of these parts independently so I'm
going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> move<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.370> body<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:23.910> to

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:24.120 
going to move the body a little bit to

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.080 
going to move the body a little bit to
the<00:01:24.210> top<00:01:24.800> make<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.830> marquee<00:01:26.280> slightly<00:01:26.880> bigger

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the top make a marquee slightly bigger

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.870 
the top make a marquee slightly bigger
than<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> outside<00:01:27.630> dimensions<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.730> then<00:01:29.730> do

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
than the outside dimensions and then do

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.150 
than the outside dimensions and then do
free<00:01:30.120> transform<00:01:30.660> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.620> once<00:01:31.860> I'm<00:01:32.040> free

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
free transform and then once I'm free

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.300 
free transform and then once I'm free
transforming<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.480> click<00:01:33.510> and<00:01:34.190> find<00:01:35.190> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
transforming I right click and find the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.970 
transforming I right click and find the
warp<00:01:35.610> command<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.410> can<00:01:37.650> mess<00:01:37.800> with

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
warp command and here I can mess with

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.580 
warp command and here I can mess with
this<00:01:38.100> lattice<00:01:38.550> and<00:01:38.760> just<00:01:39.450> play<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.050> I<00:01:40.230> find<00:01:40.500> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
this lattice and just play and I find a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.560 
this lattice and just play and I find a
shape<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.160> I<00:01:41.760> wouldn't<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.270> come<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.540> with

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
shape that I wouldn't have come up with

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.620 
shape that I wouldn't have come up with
initially<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.920> pen<00:01:46.970> I'll<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.180> leave<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
initially with the pen I'll do leave a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
initially with the pen I'll do leave a
little<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.140> extreme<00:01:49.500> warping<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
little more extreme warping just to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.980 
little more extreme warping just to
prove<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.460> point

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:12.600 

and<00:01:59.079> then<00:01:59.799> I'll<00:01:59.920> do<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.220> same<00:02:00.250> with<00:02:00.700> his<00:02:00.820> legs

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.339 

now<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.849> chop<00:02:14.090> up<00:02:14.269> even<00:02:14.569> further<00:02:14.780> again

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
now you can chop up even further again

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.280 
now you can chop up even further again
layer<00:02:16.069> via<00:02:16.400> cut<00:02:18.099> transform<00:02:19.099> things<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:20.290> then

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
layer via cut transform things and then

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
layer via cut transform things and then
warp<00:02:21.620> if<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:21.890> like<00:02:25.659> merge<00:02:26.659> that<00:02:26.930> back<00:02:27.170> down<00:02:27.439> so

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
warp if you like merge that back down so

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.690 
warp if you like merge that back down so
those<00:02:28.489> two<00:02:28.670> are<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:28.939> unit<00:02:29.120> again<00:02:30.700> transform

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
those two are one unit again transform

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.259 
those two are one unit again transform
even<00:02:31.909> further<00:02:32.590> maybe<00:02:33.590> warp<00:02:33.920> once<00:02:34.129> more<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> you

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
even further maybe warp once more so you

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.670 
even further maybe warp once more so you
can<00:02:41.420> see<00:02:41.569> what<00:02:41.689> I'm<00:02:41.780> ending<00:02:41.989> up<00:02:42.109> with<00:02:42.139> is<00:02:42.439> way

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
can see what I'm ending up with is way

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.610 
can see what I'm ending up with is way
different<00:02:42.920> than<00:02:43.129> what<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.489> is<00:02:43.579> i<00:02:43.700> started<00:02:43.939> with

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
different than what it is i started with

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.670 
different than what it is i started with
in<00:02:45.639> my<00:02:46.639> personal<00:02:46.879> workflow<00:02:47.480> i<00:02:47.689> really<00:02:48.409> like<00:02:48.560> to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
in my personal workflow i really like to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.649 
in my personal workflow i really like to
use<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:48.980> idea<00:02:49.340> when<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.669> comes<00:02:49.879> to<00:02:50.030> my<00:02:50.150> second

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
use this idea when it comes to my second

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.259 
use this idea when it comes to my second
pass<00:02:50.900> of<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.319> thumbnails<00:02:51.859> so<00:02:52.849> you<00:02:52.909> see<00:02:53.090> here

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
pass of the thumbnails so you see here

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.759 
pass of the thumbnails so you see here
I've<00:02:53.419> drawn<00:02:53.629> up<00:02:53.659> a<00:02:53.840> number<00:02:54.079> of<00:02:54.139> thumbnails<00:02:54.319> and

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
I've drawn up a number of thumbnails and

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.860 
I've drawn up a number of thumbnails and
maybe<00:02:55.069> I'm<00:02:55.220> only<00:02:55.340> happy<00:02:55.639> with<00:02:56.000> two<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:56.659> three

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
maybe I'm only happy with two or three

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.569 
maybe I'm only happy with two or three
of<00:02:56.959> them<00:02:57.109> so<00:02:58.099> i'll<00:02:58.250> pick<00:02:58.459> those<00:02:58.669> two<00:02:58.879> or<00:02:59.000> three

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
of them so i'll pick those two or three

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.059 
of them so i'll pick those two or three
put<00:03:01.579> them<00:03:01.669> on<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.939> the<00:03:02.060> next<00:03:02.689> sheet<00:03:02.919> these<00:03:03.919> are

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
put them on to the next sheet these are

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.229 
put them on to the next sheet these are
the<00:03:04.129> guys<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.310> made<00:03:04.669> the<00:03:04.790> cut<00:03:06.129> will<00:03:07.129> say<00:03:07.400> this

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the guys that made the cut will say this

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:18.430 
the guys that made the cut will say this
one<00:03:08.480> as<00:03:08.599> well<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:12.079> maybe<00:03:13.689> this<00:03:14.689> one<00:03:14.870> i<00:03:17.440> can

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
one as well and maybe this one i can

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.960 
one as well and maybe this one i can
then<00:03:18.530> forget<00:03:18.889> about<00:03:19.010> those<00:03:19.250> initial<00:03:19.669> designs

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
then forget about those initial designs

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.319 
then forget about those initial designs
i<00:03:20.120> came<00:03:20.299> up<00:03:20.449> with<00:03:20.629> and<00:03:21.729> then<00:03:22.729> plan<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.150> fill

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
i came up with and then plan to fill

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.569 
i came up with and then plan to fill
this<00:03:23.449> new<00:03:23.720> sheet<00:03:23.989> with<00:03:24.379> variations<00:03:25.099> of<00:03:25.310> these

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
this new sheet with variations of these

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.240 
this new sheet with variations of these
three<00:03:25.940> and<00:03:26.090> i'll<00:03:26.599> use<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.930> same<00:03:27.139> chop<00:03:27.979> and

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
three and i'll use the same chop and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.309 
three and i'll use the same chop and
warp<00:03:28.699> techniques<00:03:29.180> that<00:03:29.569> i<00:03:29.629> showed<00:03:29.900> you<00:03:29.930> in<00:03:30.260> the

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
warp techniques that i showed you in the

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.939 
warp techniques that i showed you in the
previous<00:03:30.409> example<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:33.440> here<00:03:33.650> i've<00:03:33.769> taken

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
previous example so here i've taken

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:35.830 
previous example so here i've taken
those<00:03:34.220> three<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.669> done<00:03:35.060> an<00:03:35.180> additional<00:03:35.659> two

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
those three and done an additional two

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.809 
those three and done an additional two
versions<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.379> each<00:03:36.530> look<00:03:37.250> how<00:03:37.370> different<00:03:37.729> they

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
versions of each look how different they

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.789 
versions of each look how different they
are<00:03:37.849> you<00:03:38.690> might<00:03:38.840> not<00:03:38.959> even<00:03:39.019> know<00:03:39.349> that<00:03:39.560> some<00:03:39.709> of

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
are you might not even know that some of

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.020 
are you might not even know that some of
these<00:03:39.859> were<00:03:40.069> based<00:03:40.280> off<00:03:40.489> of<00:03:40.519> their<00:03:40.819> original

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
these were based off of their original

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.990 
these were based off of their original
version<00:03:41.949> thumbnail<00:03:42.949> drawing<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.400> as<00:03:43.519> old<00:03:43.790> as

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
dirt illustrators have been getting out

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.170 
dirt illustrators have been getting out
the<00:03:45.829> pencil<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.310> paper<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.729> draw<00:03:47.120> on

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
the pencil and paper and draw on

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.449 
the pencil and paper and draw on
thumbnails<00:03:47.569> forever<00:03:47.930> but<00:03:48.739> ultimately<00:03:49.159> what

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
thumbnails forever but ultimately what

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.979

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
means to an end this is just getting

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.939 
means to an end this is just getting
ideas<00:03:53.569> out<00:03:53.870> of<00:03:53.900> your<00:03:54.049> head<00:03:54.199> and<00:03:54.500> onto<00:03:54.769> the

paper so if you can let photoshop

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.140 
paper so if you can let photoshop
automate<00:03:57.709> some<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.949> that<00:03:58.099> for<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.489> and<00:03:58.609> maybe

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
automate some of that for you and maybe

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.000 
automate some of that for you and maybe
even<00:03:59.419> come<00:03:59.750> up<00:03:59.780> with<00:04:00.049> some<00:04:00.229> ideas<00:04:00.319> that<00:04:00.949> you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
even come up with some ideas that you

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.949 
even come up with some ideas that you
never<00:04:01.310> would<00:04:01.549> have<00:04:01.609> with<00:04:01.849> a<00:04:01.879> pen<00:04:02.180> it's<00:04:02.750> really

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
never would have with a pen it's really

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.259 
never would have with a pen it's really
worth<00:04:03.079> trying<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:04.310> have<00:04:04.459> fun<00:04:04.519> shopping<00:04:04.879> after
