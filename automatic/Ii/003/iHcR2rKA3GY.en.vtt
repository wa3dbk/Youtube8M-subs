00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.269
 and there we go little by little I do not say is something 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.800
 delayed but the truth is that it has 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.460
 helped everything I 've done 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.559
 the moment 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.570
 and I say from flexing the knee to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.779
 can start walking but there we go 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.849
 very motivated to get ahead fast 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.290
 think about what is coming and logical to take 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.080
 a very good rehabilitation for 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.250
 be 100% is not something that I do not 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.230
 I liked it was not inside your 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.410
 plans but well I also have to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.480
 see a way to assimilate it well I know that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 this is not over, it's been six months 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 I have to prepare still even better I know 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 that I will return well and good with 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.210
 patience especially now from since 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.910
 the next day I get over it I say logical 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.800
 it always hurts that it is something that nobody 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.840
 you want to lose as a footballer but 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.699
 I got over say this is not just there there 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.140
 things but much worse than one does not 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.940
 imagine now better is something 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.010
 insignificant and you have to try to see it 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.329
 in an important way you are not 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.899
 right now is going through the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.649
 fourth week of your surgery is 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.830
 coursing through the subacute phase is in the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.750
 week that is going to let the crutches go 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.090
 to have partial support and we're 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.580
 having double sessions of physiotherapy 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.649
 in the morning and later by the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.539
 later we are working the gym the 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.680
 rehabilitation as he is doing it 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:26.619
 with an awareness of acceptance and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.470
 is working very well has been 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.229
 supporting since he was injured by the 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.319
 question that can not handle right now 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.539
 and this one I'm moving for your 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.940
 therapies apart by supporting it 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.250
 morally true to overcome this that 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.610
 it happens to him I do not consider him a very 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.010
 strong 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.220
 nothing has waned since I arrived here 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.010
 Guadalajara when it happened what 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.590
 give the lesson has been very strong not 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.780
 I expected to see him so strong or estrada 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.740
 depressed but I have not done many 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.740
 of the many desire
