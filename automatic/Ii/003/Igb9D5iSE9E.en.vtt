deal<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> way<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.190> extra<00:01:02.190> features<00:01:02.579> which

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
deal in the way of extra features which

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.119 
deal in the way of extra features which
is<00:01:02.879> exactly<00:01:03.210> how<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.680> fact<00:01:04.949> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
is exactly how I want it in fact it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.890 
is exactly how I want it in fact it's
got<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.369> extra<00:01:05.760> red<00:01:05.939> hands<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.510> probably

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
got this extra red hands that I probably

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
got this extra red hands that I probably
almost<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.650> not<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.130> makes<00:01:08.220> any

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
almost do about not that it makes any

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.820 
almost do about not that it makes any
difference<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.360> wouldn't<00:01:09.630> decry<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
difference but I wouldn't decry that the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.649 
difference but I wouldn't decry that the
loss<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.250> either<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.060> red<00:01:12.240> hands<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
loss of that either the red hands is the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.830 
loss of that either the red hands is the
second<00:01:13.140> time<00:01:13.320> zone<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.689> pointing<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
second time zone that is pointing to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.410 
second time zone that is pointing to
these<00:01:15.960> 24<00:01:16.530> hours<00:01:16.710> owns<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.189> outside<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
these 24 hours owns on the outside so I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
these 24 hours owns on the outside so I
just<00:01:18.659> could<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:18.780> said<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.290> time<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> is

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
just could have said to what time it is

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.490 
just could have said to what time it is
here<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.540> you<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.840> pointing<00:01:22.140> between

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
here so you see it's pointing between

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
here so you see it's pointing between
the<00:01:22.770> 6<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.250> 7<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.880> wrong<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:24.630> when

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the 6 and the 7 which is wrong but when

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450 
the 6 and the 7 which is wrong but when
you<00:01:24.900> change<00:01:25.290> there's<00:01:25.650> actually<00:01:26.189> point

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you change there's actually point

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.050 
you change there's actually point
towards<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> 1200<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> 1400<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.250> it's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
towards the 1200 and the 1400 and it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.810 
towards the 1200 and the 1400 and it's
sort<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.329> yeah<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.409> after<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.579> middle

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
sort of yeah just after the the middle

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.740 
sort of yeah just after the the middle
part<00:01:33.030> say<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.619> say<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.720> 1:25<00:01:36.720> p.m.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
part say as you can say it's 1:25 p.m.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.910 
part say as you can say it's 1:25 p.m.
yeah<00:01:38.030> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> 19th<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.780> August<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.799> by

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
yeah on the 19th of August you see by

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:48.340 
yeah on the 19th of August you see by
the<00:01:40.979> day<00:01:44.990> love<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.140> highly<00:01:46.470> reflective

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
the day love this highly reflective

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.800 
the day love this highly reflective
surfaces<00:01:50.240> well<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.420> not<00:01:51.600> highly

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
surfaces well that's not highly

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.069 
surfaces well that's not highly
reflective<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> guess<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.009> am<00:01:54.079> just

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
reflective I guess but it's am just

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.050 
reflective I guess but it's am just
really<00:01:55.229> knew<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.710> unscathed<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:56.880> almost

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
really knew and unscathed it's almost

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760 
really knew and unscathed it's almost
it's<00:01:57.479> almost<00:01:57.570> scare<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> away<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.409> thing<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's almost scare it away this thing to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
it's almost scare it away this thing to
be<00:01:58.860> honest<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.310> yeah<00:02:00.000> it's<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.479> metal

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
be honest because yeah it's just a metal
