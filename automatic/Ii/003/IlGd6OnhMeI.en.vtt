yeah<00:00:31.980> I'm<00:00:32.130> going<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.489> started<00:00:32.669> with

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
yeah I'm going to get started with

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.549 
yeah I'm going to get started with
opening<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> packs<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.050> probably<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
opening the packs and probably going to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
opening the packs and probably going to
make<00:00:34.680> three<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.700> four<00:00:36.000> more<00:00:36.180> parts<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.960> i'm

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
make three or four more parts and i'm

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
make three or four more parts and i'm
going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> start<00:00:37.710> heaviest<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:39.450> one

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
going to start heaviest down this one

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080 
going to start heaviest down this one
was<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.530> three<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.250> four<00:00:41.280> grams<00:00:41.790> heavier

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
was like three or four grams heavier

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
was like three or four grams heavier
than<00:00:42.390> average<00:00:42.930> pack<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.440> i'm<00:00:43.680> guessing<00:00:43.860> it's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
than average pack so i'm guessing it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
than average pack so i'm guessing it's
going<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.399> have<00:00:44.550> some<00:00:44.850> extra<00:00:44.969> cards<00:00:45.600> how<00:00:46.140> many

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
going to have some extra cards how many

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.260 
going to have some extra cards how many
