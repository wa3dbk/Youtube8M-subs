00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.200 

okay<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.339> whenever<00:01:05.580> I'm<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
okay so whenever I'm going to do a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.580 
okay so whenever I'm going to do a
carving<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.260> something<00:01:07.560> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
carving or I want to do something a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.830 
carving or I want to do something a
little<00:01:07.770> bit<00:01:07.860> fancy<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> make<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
little bit fancy and I want to make a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
little bit fancy and I want to make a
symmetrical<00:01:10.830> pattern<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.430> both<00:01:11.700> sides

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
symmetrical pattern on both sides

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.870 
symmetrical pattern on both sides
I'll<00:01:12.510> start<00:01:12.810> by<00:01:12.930> drawing<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.040> then

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
I'll start by drawing one side and then

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
I'll start by drawing one side and then
I'll<00:01:14.970> trace<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.799> onto<00:01:16.799> some<00:01:16.979> trace<00:01:17.190> paper

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
I'll trace that onto some trace paper

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.550 
I'll trace that onto some trace paper
and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.509> I'll<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:18.750> fold<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.080> trace<00:01:19.290> paper

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and then I'll just fold the trace paper

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.450 
and then I'll just fold the trace paper
in<00:01:19.770> half<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.380> draw<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> draw

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
in half and then draw it you know draw

00:01:23.460 --> 00:03:27.150 
in half and then draw it you know draw
it<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.759> other<00:01:23.880> side

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.040 

so<00:03:27.670> I<00:03:27.700> like<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.060> way<00:03:28.150> it's<00:03:28.300> coming<00:03:28.510> out<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> few

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
so I like the way it's coming out a few

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.070 
so I like the way it's coming out a few
more<00:03:29.170> details<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.620> add<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.070> I'll<00:03:30.130> be<00:03:30.250> done<00:03:34.080> and

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
more details to add and I'll be done and

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.200 
more details to add and I'll be done and
the<00:03:35.680> roof<00:03:35.860> is<00:03:36.070> going<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.340> sit<00:03:36.520> on<00:03:36.550> here<00:03:36.970> and

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
the roof is going to sit on here and

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.610 
the roof is going to sit on here and
there's<00:03:37.450> two<00:03:37.510> screws<00:03:37.960> from<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.200> back<00:03:38.410> that

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
there's two screws from the back that

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.730 
there's two screws from the back that
hold<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:38.980> in<00:03:39.010> place<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:41.050> can<00:03:41.320> take<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.620> off

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
hold it in place so I can take it off

00:03:41.740 --> 00:04:22.629 
hold it in place so I can take it off
the<00:03:41.890> maintenance<00:03:42.190> at<00:03:42.370> when<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.550> need<00:03:42.760> to

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639
