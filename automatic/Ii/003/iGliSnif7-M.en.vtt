the<00:01:57.340> modifications<00:01:57.609> to<00:01:58.389> work<00:01:58.539> from<00:01:58.689> there

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
the modifications to work from there

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.260 
the modifications to work from there
let's<00:01:59.739> talk<00:01:59.950> about<00:02:00.099> the<00:02:00.309> fabrication<00:02:01.059> you've

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
let's talk about the fabrication you've

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.019 
let's talk about the fabrication you've
done<00:02:01.569> some<00:02:01.829> yeoman's<00:02:02.829> work<00:02:02.919> on<00:02:03.309> this<00:02:03.489> so<00:02:03.759> let's

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
done some yeoman's work on this so let's

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:05.999 
done some yeoman's work on this so let's
start<00:02:04.329> from<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:04.630> beginning<00:02:04.779> and<00:02:05.319> work<00:02:05.799> our

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
start from the beginning and work our

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.249 
start from the beginning and work our
way<00:02:06.039> from<00:02:06.249> let's<00:02:07.239> go<00:02:07.389> from<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.630> front<00:02:07.899> end<00:02:08.080> and

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
way from let's go from the front end and

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.649 
way from let's go from the front end and
work<00:02:08.440> our<00:02:08.649> way<00:02:08.679> back<00:02:09.069> house<00:02:09.399> there<00:02:09.640> well<00:02:10.330> first

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
work our way back house there well first

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.230 
work our way back house there well first

it's a negative four and now it allowed

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.270 
it's a negative four and now it allowed

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
on the forks which are 52 degrees I went

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.830 
on the forks which are 52 degrees I went

did a fantastic job as you can see with

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.470 
did a fantastic job as you can see with
no<00:03:19.800> front<00:03:20.040> brake<00:03:20.190> they<00:03:20.910> were<00:03:20.970> able<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
no front brake they were able to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.000 
no front brake they were able to
fabricate<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.530> where<00:03:22.830> I<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.130> use<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:25.010> tie-break

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
fabricate it where I can use a tie-break

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.960 
fabricate it where I can use a tie-break
proportion<00:03:26.580> ER<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.260> just<00:03:28.260> use<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:29.370> pedal<00:03:29.610> and

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
proportion ER and just use one pedal and

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.510 
proportion ER and just use one pedal and
it<00:03:30.510> uses<00:03:30.720> both<00:03:31.020> brakes<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.740> then<00:03:31.920> instead<00:03:32.400> of

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
it uses both brakes and then instead of

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.310 
it uses both brakes and then instead of
having<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.970> shifting<00:03:33.510> rod<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.990> goes<00:03:34.020> above
