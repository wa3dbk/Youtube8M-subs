00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 on an unfamiliar maze you need to go 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.500
 almost clinging to the wall back 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.500
 hold the gun near the hip 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.840
 the environment around you need 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.980
 to control 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.189
 lateral and direct vision to move 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.710
 necessary before the cross step it 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.750
 allows you to sharply turn around 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.769
 body heels to the side 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.760
 emerged danger like this happens 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.760
 turn in heels 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.290
 here so it can happen in kind 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.130
 one must also look down 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.780
 the opponent is always given out socks 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.490
 this is the Achilles heel of those who hid 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.190
 tightly put the feet of the brush in this 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.340
 able to opponent can he loses 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.340
 equilibrium 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.220
 in that case he is pulled out with a gun 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.549
 put sides and shifted to the left 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.549
 a hand 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.890
 the enemy is on the left in this case the gun 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.890
 right hand 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.570
 you can train your hand flexibility 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.430
 holding gun for his 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.210
 instant brush reversal 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.210
 right left 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.920
 during the passage of the maze of suspicious 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.810
 side passages need to go away 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.880
 shift weapons from them 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.540
 necessary at the moment for 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.540
 firing arm 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.769
 if necessary, work out in detail 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.989
 any side rooms 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.870
 employee moves carefully 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.190
 semicircle away from the entrance keeping under 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.840
 constant sight 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 opening space 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.680
 while the enemy does not open immediately 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.680
 but gradually he loses the benefits 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.670
 here he is the enemy 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.550
 if from a corner some money to go far 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.040
 it goes around in the lower level target in 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.770
 lower level are poorly perceived and 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:10.770
 its appearance for the enemy will be 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:12.870
 unexpected right corner is most dangerous 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.570
 and the criminal element is good about it 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.209
 learns therefore the purpose behind 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.890
 right corner need to work out 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.100
 gun shifted in advance 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.890
 left hand and posed sides holding 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.050
 away from the corner itself so much easier and 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:37.110
 safer to get a gun 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.450
 delivered to the sides allows the employee 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:43.669
 drastically reduce your silhouette from 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.669
 oncoming defeat by enemy fire 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.209
 you see a case when when going to 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.989
 crossroads maze need 

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:06.539
 control the situation from all sides 

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:08.360
 straight along the employee she is obvious when 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.379
 a pistol in your right hand is easier 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.409
 control what is behind 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.929
 angle left in unexpected collisions 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:18.959
 with an opponent around this corner you can 

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:21.179
 shoot and hit him but you need to 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:23.189
 control the situation and behind the right 

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:27.719
 employeeâ€™s angle 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:29.279
 back so the corner passes in the bottom 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.379
 level and employee immediately 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:34.339
 unfolds to fire back at 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.339
 right side corner 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.779
 the left hand employee holds the corner 

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:45.479
 it will help him in the occurrence 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:51.839
 unforeseen circumstances go sharply 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:56.069
 back to where it came from let's look at 

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:58.139
 this is again a training process 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.619
 such actions need to work to 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:00.619
 full automatism
