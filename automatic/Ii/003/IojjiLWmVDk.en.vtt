 he became famous for eating 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.789
 inorganic metal objects and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.820
 glass latte then ate on average per day 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.039
 about 900 grams of inorganic substances 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.890
 mixing them with mineral oil and 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 clogging more water in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.110
 then added oil to lubricate the throat and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.290
 washed down with water the doctors examined 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.750
 Sheryl otitis claimed that his 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.840
 the digestive system has adapted to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.210
 so exotic product thickness

 times more than the average person 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.539
 his most significant achievement

 who participated in fights with bulls 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.549

 barehanded and even five kilos and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.479
 a hammer is simply impossible but mas oyama 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:37.110
 proved that man is capable of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:39.689
 incredible things scott flensburg 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.450
 so-called human calculator 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.880
 scott flensburg in 15 seconds right 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 folded arbitrarily chosen two-digit 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.110
 number 38 by itself 36 times when people 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.240
 they take the calculator in their hands 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.200
 manages to keep numbers like cattle already 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.540
 says answer 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000
 however, scientists have not yet been able to establish 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.040
 is this ability innate 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.909
 or was it developed by scott 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.909
 by myself 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.800
 Mafia gang so -called electro 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.110
 man if he takes the cable on 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.260
 which will be 220 volts 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.940
 its outflow will not hit it it can take 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.510
 for the bare cable and in the other hand 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.490
 take a light bulb and it lights it can 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.800
 no problem repairing electrical circuits 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.880
 bare hands without using any 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.610
 current protection 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.710
 why is it not shocked yet no one 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.140
 knows but scientists have already taken for it 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:42.050
 investigation you have them so yet 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.510
 called ice man he is capable 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.650

 frozen lake for the first time vim distinctly 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.370
 realized his abilities at 17 when 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.010
 conducted several experiments on 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.290
 their body experts say 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.100
 that ice man is definitely 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.920
 a phenomenon 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.230
 however the Dutchman does not agree he is convinced 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.040
 is that the thing is around the clock 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.620
 training sessions 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.920
 his inhuman abilities are 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.650
 the result of long labor now 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.050
 time he continues to train hard with 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.000
 aim of achieving new records already 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.860
 more than twenty years dutchman not 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.870

 It is believed that chopping such a dream 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.250
 dad effort is very close to trumpet not

 time he struck in the footsteps of 250 blows 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.850
 the sword should be understood that he himself is quite 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.510

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:29.180
 Slave hour freediver Dave Mullins He 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.250
 set two whole world records in 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.520
 Dave's first record was achieved 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.800
 an incredible result to swim two hundred 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.620
 sixty five meters to the surface 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.680
 under water the time he spent under 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.830
 water was 4 minutes and one second 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:50.330
 two days later dave put another 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.870
 record in dynamics without flippers swimming 218 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.300
 meters for the same time 4 minutes 1 second 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.830
 certainly to confirm both 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.800
 records required results 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.440
 doping control in david truly 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.349
 unique physiological volume data 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.479
 lightweight record holder is 15 liters 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.210
 it can be under water without 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.940
 breathing 8 minutes 7 seconds 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.919
 this is an athlete's personal record now 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.800
 mullins which over the past three years 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.810
 set at least 5 world records 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.810
 will be preparing for the world championship 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.659
 freediving where he will 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.659
 dive to a depth of more than 150 meters 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.350
 kim rush american is phenomenal memory 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.920
 remembered 98 percent read 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.510
 information for it got the nickname 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.610
 computer under the assumption of scientists 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.000
 brain neurons in the absence of corpus callosum 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.470
 bodies created a new connection that 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.310
 led to a multiple increase 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:54.890
 Kim Kim's memory capacity has developed a special 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.900
 reading technique a total of 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.980
 reading one standard book 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.260
 reversal took about 8-10 seconds with 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.840
 this he did not care how is 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.300
 the text is relative to its very end 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:15.350
 life kim kept in mind the contents 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:18.200
 about 12,000 previously read books ben 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.460
 underwood this blind boy has 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.470
 capture opportunity 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.810
 echo and on this basis can exactly 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.930
 locate individual 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.080
 objects it uses echolocation as 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.210
 bat he doesn't help himself with his hands 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.880
 even if it moves in an unfamiliar 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.910
 room instead he uses 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.730
 his tongue language he creates clicks 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.400
 sharp short sounds that are reflected 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.800
 from nearest facilities at age 7 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.110
 he was able to identify and systematize 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.420
 their unique for their sound and this 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.210
 allowed him even more clearly and accurately 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.400
 understand and see your surroundings he 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.470
 learned by sound much faster 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.780
 identify surrounding objects and 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.570
 pretty quickly honed their unique 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.910
 abilities to such perfection 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:09.980
 what can easily ride a bike 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:12.710
 roller skate and skateboard and close our 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.780
 list of people with super powers tom 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:18.530
 sitas he set a world record 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.800
 breath delay for 22 minutes 22 seconds 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.630
 it's just unbelievable if you were 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:27.100
