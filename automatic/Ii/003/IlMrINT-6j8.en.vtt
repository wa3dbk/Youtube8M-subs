00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.249 
of bad blood and I guess it goes back a
couple<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.909> years<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.420> when<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> flames<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
couple of years to when the flames and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
couple of years to when the flames and
the<00:01:28.320> Oilers<00:01:28.560> went<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> seven<00:01:29.130> game<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.970> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the Oilers went to seven game well it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
the Oilers went to seven game well it
definitely<00:01:30.479> did<00:01:31.070> we<00:01:32.070> took<00:01:32.189> him<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.340> seven

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
definitely did we took him to seven

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.950 
definitely did we took him to seven
games<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.360> just<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.780> great

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
games there and that was just a great

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.530 
games there and that was just a great
series<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> uh<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:35.369> i<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> was<00:01:35.850> beyond

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
series and uh but i think it was beyond

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.149 
series and uh but i think it was beyond
that<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.439> goes<00:01:37.619> beyond<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:37.979> two

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
that I think it just goes beyond the two

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.380 
that I think it just goes beyond the two
cities<00:01:38.689> whether<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.079> CFL<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.390> Edmonton

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
cities whether it's the CFL the Edmonton

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
cities whether it's the CFL the Edmonton
Eskimos<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> Stampeders<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> i

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
Eskimos or the Stampeders is just the i

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.880 
Eskimos or the Stampeders is just the i
guess<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.390> city's<00:01:45.810> dislike<00:01:46.229> each<00:01:46.409> other<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
guess the city's dislike each other and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.580 
guess the city's dislike each other and
and<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.329> can't<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.840> say<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> players

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
and I can't really say that the players

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.840 
and I can't really say that the players
are<00:01:49.770> fond<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> each<00:01:50.130> other<00:01:50.250> either<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.820> uh

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
are fond of each other either so uh

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
are fond of each other either so uh

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.790 
all-time and I think evaluating great or
Wayne<00:02:24.060> when<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.150> give<00:02:25.300> him<00:02:25.390> more<00:02:25.570> time<00:02:25.800> he's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
Wayne when you give him more time he's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.280 
Wayne when you give him more time he's
great<00:02:26.980> more<00:02:27.640> time<00:02:27.880> he<00:02:28.000> has<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.840> better<00:02:28.990> he<00:02:29.170> is

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
great more time he has the better he is

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.020

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
the second shot third period coming up

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.060 
the second shot third period coming up
the<00:03:46.690> crowd<00:03:46.900> obviously<00:03:47.410> a<00:03:47.440> factor<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:47.769> lot<00:03:47.950> of

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
the crowd obviously a factor a lot of

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.140 
the crowd obviously a factor a lot of
emotion<00:03:48.489> out<00:03:48.579> there<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:48.880> guess<00:03:49.030> that's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
emotion out there and I guess that's

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.630 
emotion out there and I guess that's
what<00:03:49.329> you'd<00:03:49.450> be<00:03:49.540> going<00:03:49.660> on<00:03:49.959> well<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:51.130> think<00:03:51.370> this

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
what you'd be going on well I think this

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.420 
what you'd be going on well I think this
team<00:03:52.049> java<00:03:53.049> flames<00:03:53.320> that<00:03:53.560> we<00:03:53.739> plan<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> motion

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
team java flames that we plan a motion

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.069 
team java flames that we plan a motion
like<00:03:54.940> i<00:03:55.000> said<00:03:55.209> we're<00:03:55.390> just<00:03:55.420> honest<00:03:55.840> players

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
like i said we're just honest players

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.750 
like i said we're just honest players
and<00:03:56.380> I<00:03:56.560> think<00:03:56.769> whenever<00:03:57.160> you're<00:03:57.430> in<00:03:57.459> your<00:03:57.640> home

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and I think whenever you're in your home

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.759 
and I think whenever you're in your home
building<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.780> crowd<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.380> crowd<00:03:59.470> really

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
building and the crowd the crowd really

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.800 
building and the crowd the crowd really
gets<00:03:59.980> going<00:04:00.040> no<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.090> think<00:04:01.209> it's<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.540> worthy<00:04:01.660> goal

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
gets going no I think it's a worthy goal

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.539 
gets going no I think it's a worthy goal
or<00:04:02.079> two<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.380> hopefully<00:04:02.799> we<00:04:03.070> get<00:04:03.160> that<00:04:03.310> goal<00:04:03.459> or

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
or two and hopefully we get that goal or

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.220 
or two and hopefully we get that goal or
two<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.850> third<00:04:03.910> period<00:04:04.180> all<00:04:04.660> right<00:04:04.870> take<00:04:05.170> a
