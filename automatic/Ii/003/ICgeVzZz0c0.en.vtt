recommend that you should start with the
very<00:00:48.540> bare<00:00:48.870> basics<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.980> instead<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> writing<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
very bare basics so instead of writing a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.760 
very bare basics so instead of writing a

law<00:00:52.950> and<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.280> have<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.540> focus<00:00:54.540> mainly<00:00:54.720> on<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
law and what have you focus mainly on a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.910 
law and what have you focus mainly on a
development<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.850> character<00:00:57.470> so<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.500> young
