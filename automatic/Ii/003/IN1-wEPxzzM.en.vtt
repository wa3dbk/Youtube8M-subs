so<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.609> can<00:01:42.759> put<00:01:42.939> 22<00:01:43.450> apps<00:01:44.289> on<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.530> screen<00:01:44.740> at

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
so you can put 22 apps on the screen at

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.450 
so you can put 22 apps on the screen at
the<00:01:44.829> same<00:01:44.920> time

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
the same time

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.250 
the same time
like<00:01:45.549> this<00:01:45.729> additionally<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.870> can<00:01:46.990> go<00:01:47.080> into

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
like this additionally we can go into

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.580 
like this additionally we can go into
our<00:01:47.700> qslide<00:01:48.700> apps<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.780> pull<00:01:49.960> out<00:01:49.990> one<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.440> have

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
our qslide apps and pull out one to have

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.230 
our qslide apps and pull out one to have
a<00:01:50.799> third<00:01:51.040> app<00:01:51.250> on<00:01:51.490> top<00:01:51.700> of<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.909> out<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.090> two

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
a third app on top of the out of two

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.210 
a third app on top of the out of two
halves<00:01:52.450> so<00:01:53.080> if<00:01:53.260> you<00:01:53.380> want<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.560> multitask<00:01:53.979> while

point<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.690> this<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.650> jelly<00:02:11.920> bean<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:13.209> asked

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
point to this is jelly bean we asked

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.180 
point to this is jelly bean we asked
about<00:02:13.660> when<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> update<00:02:14.590> would<00:02:14.770> be<00:02:14.890> coming

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
about when the update would be coming

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.229 
about when the update would be coming
out<00:02:15.310> for<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.790> nothing<00:02:16.090> has<00:02:16.209> been

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
out for it and nothing has been

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.640 
out for it and nothing has been
announced<00:02:16.510> yet<00:02:16.750> so<00:02:17.110> that's<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.560> little

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
announced yet so that's a little

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.430 
announced yet so that's a little
unfortunate<00:02:18.100> but<00:02:18.880> I'm<00:02:19.090> sure<00:02:19.300> cyanogenmod<00:02:20.110> and

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
unfortunate but I'm sure cyanogenmod and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.990 
unfortunate but I'm sure cyanogenmod and
whatever<00:02:20.769> else<00:02:20.830> will<00:02:21.100> probably<00:02:21.489> work<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.820> top

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
whatever else will probably work on top

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.580 
whatever else will probably work on top
so<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.300> just<00:02:22.390> fine<00:02:22.630> when<00:02:22.900> when<00:02:23.350> it<00:02:23.470> does

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
so it's just fine when when it does

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.250 
so it's just fine when when it does
become<00:02:23.739> available<00:02:24.540> other<00:02:25.540> than<00:02:25.750> that<00:02:25.810> it

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
become available other than that it

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.170 
become available other than that it
seems<00:02:26.500> quite<00:02:26.800> nice<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.280> performance<00:02:27.820> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
seems quite nice and performance the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.940 
seems quite nice and performance the
720p<00:02:28.870> screen<00:02:29.019> doesn't<00:02:29.590> seem<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.830> be<00:02:29.920> a

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
720p screen doesn't seem to be a

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.530 
720p screen doesn't seem to be a
hindrance<00:02:30.190> like<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.790> would<00:02:31.000> probably<00:02:31.300> expect

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
hindrance like I would probably expect

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.620 
hindrance like I would probably expect
it<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> be<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.830> I'm<00:02:33.250> quite<00:02:34.060> pleased<00:02:34.360> with<00:02:34.540> the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
it to be and I'm quite pleased with the

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.390 
it to be and I'm quite pleased with the
look<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.930> feel<00:02:35.050> of<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.350> feels<00:02:35.800> very<00:02:36.010> solid<00:02:36.160> I

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
look and feel of it feels very solid I

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.680 
look and feel of it feels very solid I
don't<00:02:36.580> want<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> do<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.940> demonstration<00:02:37.120> where

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
don't want to do the demonstration where

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.120 
don't want to do the demonstration where
we<00:02:37.810> lay<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.050> down<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.380> actually<00:02:38.470> flatten<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
we lay it down and actually flatten it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.680 
we lay it down and actually flatten it
but<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.940> also<00:02:40.090> an<00:02:40.300> option<00:02:40.390> it<00:02:40.660> is

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
but that is also an option it is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.750 
but that is also an option it is
flexible<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.620> will<00:02:41.920> give<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.550> little

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
flexible so it will give you a little

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.520 
flexible so it will give you a little
bit<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:42.970> flexibility<00:02:43.510> there<00:02:43.750> all<00:02:44.140> right<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.470> we

bit of flexibility there all right so we

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.780 
bit of flexibility there all right so we
