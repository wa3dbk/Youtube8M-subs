five<00:00:38.080> years<00:00:38.350> ago<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:39.430> even<00:00:39.699> before<00:00:40.360> any<00:00:40.660> of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
five years ago that even before any of

five years ago that even before any of
this<00:00:40.900> came<00:00:41.140> over<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.500> horizon<00:00:41.589> that<00:00:42.600> there's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
this came over the horizon that there's

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.900 
this came over the horizon that there's
two<00:00:43.900> factors<00:00:44.230> at<00:00:44.559> work<00:00:44.589> that<00:00:45.309> are<00:00:45.460> gonna<00:00:45.610> cause

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
two factors at work that are gonna cause

and the Australians are probably going

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
nothing the government can do is going

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:48.929 
nothing the government can do is going
to<00:01:46.810> stop<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:48.219> only<00:01:48.399> thing<00:01:48.549> that<00:01:48.729> might

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
to stop this the only thing that might

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.940 
to stop this the only thing that might
stop<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.539> would<00:01:49.719> be<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.899> collapse<00:01:50.350> in<00:01:50.499> global

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
stop it would be a collapse in global

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.770 
stop it would be a collapse in global
trade<00:01:51.130> which<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:51.939> course<00:01:51.969> would<00:01:52.270> even<00:01:52.509> give<00:01:52.659> us

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
trade which of course would even give us

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.730 
trade which of course would even give us
a<00:01:52.869> bigger<00:01:53.049> problem<00:01:53.380> to<00:01:53.649> deal<00:01:53.829> with<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.590> that's

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
a bigger problem to deal with so that's

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.440 
a bigger problem to deal with so that's
the<00:01:56.950> first<00:01:57.159> thing<00:01:57.249> we're<00:01:57.700> all<00:01:57.969> gonna<00:01:58.119> have<00:01:58.299> to

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
the first thing we're all gonna have to

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.359 
the first thing we're all gonna have to
deal<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.899> the<00:01:59.469> second<00:01:59.799> thing<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.249> it

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
deal with the second thing is is it

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.010 
deal with the second thing is is it
we're<00:02:00.549> actually<00:02:00.789> over<00:02:01.359> something<00:02:01.780> called

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
we're actually over something called

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.859 
we're actually over something called
peak<00:02:02.289> oil<00:02:02.590> I'm<00:02:03.490> sure<00:02:04.240> you've<00:02:04.389> heard<00:02:04.539> of<00:02:04.600> peak

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
peak oil I'm sure you've heard of peak

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.840 
peak oil I'm sure you've heard of peak
oil<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:07.659> is<00:02:07.689> gonna<00:02:08.050> be<00:02:08.289> ever<00:02:08.860> less<00:02:09.399> oil

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
oil there is gonna be ever less oil

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.320 
oil there is gonna be ever less oil
available<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.929> us<00:02:11.140> from<00:02:11.560> Iranian<00:02:11.950> and<00:02:12.850> that

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
available to us from Iranian and that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.090 
available to us from Iranian and that
means<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> price<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.319> oil<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.800> going<00:02:15.040> to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
means that the price of oil is going to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.610 
means that the price of oil is going to
go<00:02:15.160> ever<00:02:15.400> higher<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.810> that's<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.440> real

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
go ever higher and that's in real

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.160 
go ever higher and that's in real
dollars<00:02:18.130> it's<00:02:18.850> going<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.090> go<00:02:19.209> higher<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.780> then

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
dollars it's going to go higher and then

oil without oil we can't grow the food

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.520 
oil without oil we can't grow the food
we<00:02:31.060> can't<00:02:31.300> make<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.630> tractor<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.200> turn<00:02:32.380> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
we can't make the tractor to turn the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.260 
we can't make the tractor to turn the
ground<00:02:32.710> over<00:02:32.980> we<00:02:33.220> can't<00:02:33.460> make<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> chemicals

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
ground over we can't make the chemicals

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.420 
ground over we can't make the chemicals
to<00:02:34.360> make<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.720> fertilizers<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.920> entire<00:02:36.220> food

system<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.030> based<00:02:37.240> on<00:02:37.420> petroleum<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.410> so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
system is based on petroleum and so

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.150 
system is based on petroleum and so
everything<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.300> we<00:02:40.990> buy<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.680> going<00:02:41.920> to<00:02:42.010> start
