here but on the ten point eight inch
screen<00:00:18.930> that's<00:00:19.320> definitely<00:00:19.770> after<00:00:19.980> have<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
slower intel atom processor is all right

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.580 
slower intel atom processor is all right
but<00:00:24.449> if<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.570> want<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> game<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.230> anything<00:00:25.380> like

bigger one video country or anything

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.550 
bigger one video country or anything
like<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> rather<00:00:29.970> for<00:00:30.560> students

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
like this this is rather for students

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.990 
like this this is rather for students
the<00:00:31.769> surface<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.610> nice<00:00:32.759> because

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the surface to be but it's nice because

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.709 
the surface to be but it's nice because
it<00:00:33.239> has<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> 32<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.670> display<00:00:35.670> also<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
it has a 32 to display also so this is a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.540 
it has a 32 to display also so this is a
ten<00:00:36.930> point<00:00:37.079> eight<00:00:37.260> inch<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> 12<00:00:38.370> inch

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
ten point eight inch there is a 12 inch

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
ten point eight inch there is a 12 inch
and<00:00:39.239> also<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.600> use<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.050> both<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> stylus

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and also we can use on both the stylus

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.680 
and also we can use on both the stylus
but<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:41.850> inside<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> package<00:00:42.540> for

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
but here it's not inside the package for

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.869 
but here it's not inside the package for
4<00:00:42.870> 99<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.160> still<00:00:44.340> use<00:00:44.550> this

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
4 99 and but you can still use this

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.279 
4 99 and but you can still use this
quite<00:00:45.059> nicely<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> intel<00:00:46.140> atom

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
quite nicely here with the intel atom

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
quite nicely here with the intel atom
processor<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.520> course<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> features

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
processor and of course all the features

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
processor and of course all the features
that<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:50.010> surface<00:00:50.399> pro

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
that you know and from this surface pro

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.670 
that you know and from this surface pro
3<00:00:50.670> if<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.600> checked<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.379> already

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
3 if you have checked that out already

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110 
3 if you have checked that out already
so<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.340> short<00:00:53.610> comparison<00:00:54.059> video

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
so this just a short comparison video

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.180 
so this just a short comparison video
and<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> outside<00:00:55.590> also<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and the from the outside also so you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.439 
and the from the outside also so you
guys<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.149> both<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
guys can see that we have on both the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
guys can see that we have on both the
display<00:00:57.719> ports<00:00:58.050> USB<00:00:58.410> nvm<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.250> course<00:00:59.340> microUSB

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
display ports USB nvm of course microUSB

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
display ports USB nvm of course microUSB
also<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> brand<00:01:00.690> new<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.350> charging

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
also on a brand new one for charging

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.110 
also on a brand new one for charging
which<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.980> quite<00:01:02.100> amazing<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:02.520> before<00:01:02.969> we

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
which is quite amazing because before we

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.570 
which is quite amazing because before we
had<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> m<00:01:04.199> external<00:01:05.010> adapter<00:01:05.220> here

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
had to have this m external adapter here

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.219 
had to have this m external adapter here
which<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.240> at<00:01:06.390> handy<00:01:06.720> if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.049> want

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
which is not at handy if you just want

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
which is not at handy if you just want
to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> go<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.640> charge<00:01:09.360> your

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450

smartphone anything with the same mus be

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.149 
smartphone anything with the same mus be
a<00:01:12.060> charge<00:01:13.020> which<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.530> quite<00:01:13.710> nice<00:01:13.950> you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
a charge which is really quite nice you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.520 
a charge which is really quite nice you
to<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.729> one<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.240> crew<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.479> me<00:01:15.720> both<00:01:16.320> have

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to just have one my crew is me both have

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
to just have one my crew is me both have
micro<00:01:16.830> SD<00:01:17.070> card<00:01:17.250> slot<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> expand<00:01:18.119> into

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
micro SD card slot so we can expand into

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
micro SD card slot so we can expand into
a<00:01:18.390> memory<00:01:18.630> that's<00:01:19.110> usually<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> problem<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
a memory that's usually a problem that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
a memory that's usually a problem that
there's<00:01:20.189> not<00:01:20.280> enough<00:01:20.520> space<00:01:20.670> inside<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.360> we

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
there's not enough space inside but we

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.730 
there's not enough space inside but we
have<00:01:21.600> also<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.140> course<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> headset

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have also here of course the headset

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.230 
have also here of course the headset
port<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.610> want<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.820> use<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> dual

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
port so if you don't want to use a dual

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.929 
port so if you don't want to use a dual
