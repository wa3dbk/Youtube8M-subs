00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.610
 the importance of sealing techniques 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.960
 steadily increasing because of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.220
 new technologies and materials 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.740
 used in construction 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.720
 different automobile solicitations 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.000
 expectations for applications 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.350
 respective authorities requires not only 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 product knowledge 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.070
 but also concerning the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 characteristics of assembled materials 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.219
 the company says 'no' to develop 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.110
 different inite sealants 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.790
 role for its applications and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.070
 adapt to material dilation 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.430
 shifting structure and resistance 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.430
 expected 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.629
 said nitre 700 is a product 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.719
 June's sealant to components 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.730
 based on ms polymers applicable by 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.219
 spray that hardens through 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 the humidity of the air by means of the pistol 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.149
 appropriate the product and sealing 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.360
 can be sprayed so to 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.920
 reproduce the original surface 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.360
 setting the gun nozzle the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 modification of the pressure of 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.760
 spraying materials allows 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.659
 to get a smooth or rough surface 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.170
 the application on different widths 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.720
 from June is also possible 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.280
 the miniter 700 is also suitable as 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.409
 protection against projections of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.890
 stones or as noise protection 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.450
 it can be painted before drying 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.860
 spraying also helps 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 to treat areas without problem 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.490
 hard to reach 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.049
 the dimeet 700 presents excellent 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.470
 adhesion characteristics without 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.149
 application according to the previous subject 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.210
 can be applied directly to 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.680
 galvanized steel cleaning media 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 wood most types of aluminum 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.330
 but also painted surfaces or 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.039
 lend and can be covered with a 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.750
 paint layer for up to five 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.310
 days the dimeet recipes without bag is a 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 detach product to play a mono 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.569
 components the polymer base ms 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.220
 applicable to the pin that hardens to 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.380
 the humidity of the air and can be 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.330
 covered almost all the systems of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.230
 painting for a period of up to 5 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.780
 days 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.150
 the denigrated 410 uv is a paste 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.430
 polyurethane adhesive sealing the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.650
 component high and good resistance 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.049
 UV stability and dries quickly and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.349
 flexible and can be covered with the 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.599
 most title painting systems 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.099
 the said to be 410 uv so perfectly 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.650
 adapted to the pond change of joints 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:44.709
 right overlap and dilation 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.690
 in the apparent areas the denigrates 410 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.730
 uv is used throughout the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.890
 automotive construction material 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.019
 adheres to metals lent with 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.000
 agents of adherents also appropriate 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:03.609
 on hard plastics the wood and the 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.410
 glass of 10 liters 705 is a product 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.840
 detachment from June mono components to 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.489
 polymer base m is applicable to the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.920
 brush that hardens to the humility of the air 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.599
 and can be covered by almost everyone 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.650
 paint systems during a 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.650
 up to 5 days 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.170
 the product has very good 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.810
 adhesion characteristics even without 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.459
 the use of a bonding agent 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.500
 can be applied directly to 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.079
 galvanized steel cleaning media 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.480
 wood most types of aluminum 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:38.790
 as well as painted surfaces or 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.379
 lending denial 3,705 is used in the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.659
 automotive domain for tanches mans 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:45.359
 right overlapping joints and 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.310
 expansion of the seals 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.379
 realized in factories can be 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.599
 perfectly imitated with the brush before 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:56.370
 cover the joints still wet with a 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.170
 paint layer clean the area of ​​the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.709
 seal and cord carefully audi 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.379
 nitre 76,60 the anti silicone cleaner to 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.180
 fast drying so the surface 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.180
 is free of oils and greases 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.280
 apply the paw of June 10 liters 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.229
 410 uv or 705 inite to the brush of 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.440
 homogenous way up and down on the 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.440
 seals 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.220
 Then they reconstituted and the 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:34.780
 original surface made in factory at 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:36.640
 way of a big said nitrous 400 is 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.680
 a sealing step and mono components 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.070
 based on rubber that is durably 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.890
 flexible and sasha the air it applies to the 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.170
 brush or putty knife during 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.610
 paint bodywork operations there 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.500
 can be applied on rates and 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.750
 raw clean bodywork be lent 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.290
 as well as on surfaces with 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.910
 painting after and finishing the 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.290
 denigrate 4 spell is in numbers 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.880
 durably weld seams 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.650
 horizontal and vertical 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.720
 for example in the engine compartment 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.970
 at the bottom of the chest of the cash register 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.800
 cars as well as on big 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.170
 remorseful surfaces and assemblages 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.000
 Threaded thanks to its excellent aptitude 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.710
 at the pin application it is 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.270
 possible to reconstitute technically 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.330
 and visually the seals 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.250
 original made in the factory apply the 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.630
 oyster sealing paste 400 from 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.460
 homogeneous way on the joints 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.990
 riding with a brush and 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.810
 restore the original surface 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.250
 made in the factory the product can also 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.250
 to be used on welding points
