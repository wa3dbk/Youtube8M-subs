00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 the psol of that sick video in the video 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.470
 this time on the serve with a video after a 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.500
 month of absence on the channel exactly see 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.440
 a month off is for some reasons I 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.969
 I will mention them in this corn is mainly 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.440
 to give the channel a little time to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.039
 think a little bit about chad that i would 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.109
 bring and what they were being tam 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.869
 you who come with my twitter know the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.340
 Why? What if you did not go out on the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.349
 description will be there my link from 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.199
 twitter and if we go there you know 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.430
 always news come out of food talk 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.410
 With you it's hard 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730
 so what I said on twitter that the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.370
 my source 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.320
 and my graphics card had 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.360
 burn it exactly that's what 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.670
 happened to my graphics card burned 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.160
 or is in the same house to burn because 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.170
 it was reaching 110 degrees 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.329
 reaching 50 degrees as a ticket does not 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.309
 I know because my graphics card was running 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.270
 much bigger craft lately was 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.680
 running at 60 70 fps when listening to 360 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 but it will hurt 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.129
 I have something new for you. 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.989
 very good life 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.869
 first I bought a board 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.670
 a new source is that both in the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 county as boxing no one on the canal 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.850
 future and one that you no longer have 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.979
 videos of food or almost daily 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.119
 They will have very often the videos 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.830
 not before 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.590
 now it will happen because it has a plaque 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.509
 that runs all the best now can not 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.950
 I really do. Andressa is going to be a bit 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.720
 It is more difficult to make a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.680
 bit harder but I'll try to do 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.329
 this for you 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.070
 the videos will be a bit shorter 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.840
 for example seven minutes but with less 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.770
 good to have come from food and with 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 frequency 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.610
 This is going to be very good for you. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 own style and will also change 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.119
 I hope you like a system 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.700
 so more relaxed not so much time 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.430
 focused on the comment but nobody plate 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.049
 for playing and you are in listening to what I 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.759
 I'll do is come in as if I was 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.740
 simply play but I'm recording the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.659
 video, I think you noticed 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.460
 will see many new features on the non-channel 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.200
 I want to prolong this video a lot 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.149
 I just want to say that I'm back. 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.189
 now with a graphics card a source 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.020
 will see much more quality in the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.520
 channel and much more content therefore 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.079
 Stay tuned, the girl is going to be a new one. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.560
 video so I hope to count on this 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.539
 support 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.920
 in the videos that will go and 100 in the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.959
 channel for gaming board 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.440
 different is different hope to count on 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.550

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.320
