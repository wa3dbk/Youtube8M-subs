lines for the fuel module but other than

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.290 
lines for the fuel module but other than
that<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:25.180> looks<00:00:26.580> like<00:00:27.580> it's<00:00:27.820> gonna<00:00:27.940> be<00:00:28.119> ready

immediately<00:00:54.040> I<00:00:55.040> integrated<00:00:55.910> all<00:00:56.330> the<00:00:57.040> key

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
immediately I integrated all the key

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.770 
immediately I integrated all the key
functions<00:00:58.640> and<00:00:59.060> all<00:00:59.360> that<00:00:59.630> in<00:00:59.840> with<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.780> with

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
functions and all that in with the with

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.200 
functions and all that in with the with
the<00:01:03.940> dashboard<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.600> I've<00:01:06.080> got<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.820> ich<00:01:07.820> for

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
the dashboard and I've got the ich for

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.630 
the dashboard and I've got the ich for
test<00:01:08.960> connectors<00:01:09.440> right<00:01:09.650> here<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.370> they're

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
test connectors right here so they're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.300 
test connectors right here so they're
easily<00:01:10.940> accessible<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.900> then<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.160> key

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
easily accessible and then the key

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.050 
easily accessible and then the key
switch<00:01:13.460> I'll<00:01:13.790> just<00:01:13.970> turn<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.240> off<00:01:14.360> real<00:01:14.869> quick

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
switch I'll just turn it off real quick

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:26.470 
switch I'll just turn it off real quick
shuts<00:01:17.060> off<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.600> starts<00:01:18.410> right<00:01:18.619> up

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.750 

let's<00:01:27.480> see<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:27.870> that's<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.890> check<00:01:29.580> engine

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
let's see and that's the check engine

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.420 
let's see and that's the check engine
light<00:01:30.350> it's<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:33.110> there<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.590> bunch

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
light it's on because there are a bunch

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.910 
light it's on because there are a bunch
of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> missions<00:01:36.060> things<00:01:36.870> that<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.260> not

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
of the missions things that are not

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
of the missions things that are not
hooked<00:01:38.160> up<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.750> once<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.900> installed<00:01:40.410> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
hooked up and once I installed the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
hooked up and once I installed the
tweeker<00:01:40.950> I'll<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.760> able<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> tune<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:44.119> change

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
tweeker I'll be able to tune or change

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.730 
tweeker I'll be able to tune or change
some<00:01:45.360> scalars<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:47.869> turn<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> stuff<00:01:49.440> off

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
some scalars and turn all that stuff off

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.730 
some scalars and turn all that stuff off
and<00:01:50.580> hopefully<00:01:50.850> extinguish<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:57.470> so<00:01:58.470> that's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and hopefully extinguish that so that's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.040 
and hopefully extinguish that so that's
the<00:01:58.920> update
