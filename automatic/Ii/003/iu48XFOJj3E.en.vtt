00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.450
 at the level of the organization of the subject 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.090
 everything that surrounds us is matter the water 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.030
 the air the plants we are 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.100
 made of matter let's see how it was 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.610
 it remains 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.680
 we start with the subatomic particles 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.110
 a subatomic particle is considered the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 smaller matter that exists is in 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.550
 we know them all as a proton 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.650
 neutron and electron 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.619
 these particles are in a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.469
 atom that is a particle integrated by 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.180
 protons and neutrons and electrons these 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.120
 atoms have a nucleus formed by 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.210
 protons and neutrons and have levels of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.280
 energy around where the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.710
 electrons 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.789
 the atoms form the chemical elements 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.130
 as the hydrogen sulfur phosphorus carbon 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.140
 and everyone 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.940
 after the atoms follow the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.680
 biomolecules 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 what is a set of the six elements 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.790
 vital that are hydrogen carbon 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.960
 nitrogen nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur that 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.840
 together they form proteins 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.350
 liquid carbohydrates and acids 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350
 nucleic 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.289
 organelles are cellular structures 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.719
 formed by biomolecules and has a 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.060
 defined function an example is the 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.030
 mitochondria that supplies the energy of 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.580
 The animal cell 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.530
 then there are the cells that is the unit 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.260
 of structural and functional of all being 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.659
 alive formed by 1 organelles or organs 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.690
 cellular like a neuron or a 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.729
 bacteria or a globule when they come together 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.460
 these cells and perform a function in 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.920
 common form a tissue there are many types 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.480
 of tissues such as heart tissue or 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.120
 muscle that can be striated or smooth 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.550
 the organs now arrive if they do not know that 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.320
 they are paying attention is a set of 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.050
 tissues that have a function in common 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.600
 a clear example is the heart that 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.180
 pumps blood to the body or lung or 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 stomach or liver and so on 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380
 one with a different function 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.720
 what happens if we have many organs with 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.480
 functions in common a system like 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.280
 respiratory or digestive and if we add 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.010
 all of those we get an organism 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:23.110
 multicellular either an insect a 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.110
 plant an animal or a human being 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.500
 a species is a set of organisms 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.659
 with structural characteristics and 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.239
 similar functionalities that can be 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.730
 reproduce and have fertile offspring and 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.950
 have a common ancestor 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 population is a set of organisms 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.540
 who share a common area 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.690
 community is a set of populations 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.690
 that occupy a certain area 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.260
 ecosystem is a set of factors 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.940
 biotic and abiotic is to say is a 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.720
 community that has lifeless objects 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.880
 like the sun or the air and finally the 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.890
 biosphere that is the layer on earth and 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.030
 its atmosphere where life exists and it 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.290
 find all levels of 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.290
 organization of matter
