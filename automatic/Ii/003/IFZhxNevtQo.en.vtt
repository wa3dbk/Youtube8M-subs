and after challenge come up with the
last<00:00:34.870> fastball<00:00:35.200> that's<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:36.040> perfect<00:00:36.579> spot<00:00:36.790> for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
last fastball that's a perfect spot for

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.819 
last fastball that's a perfect spot for
the<00:00:37.149> follow-up<00:00:37.570> right<00:00:38.260> at<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.559> knees<00:00:40.829> inside

the follow-up right at the knees inside

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.829 
the follow-up right at the knees inside
as<00:00:42.190> that<00:00:42.399> perhaps<00:00:42.640> will<00:00:43.000> back<00:00:43.149> him<00:00:43.300> off<00:00:43.480> a<00:00:43.510> bit

one<00:00:44.110> in<00:00:44.290> two<00:00:44.500> that's<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.339> good<00:00:45.640> spot<00:00:46.150> for<00:00:46.180> that

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540
