00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.220
 from fortuna tv 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.350
 around fortuna sittard last saturday 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.300

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.439
 program we will talk to in a moment 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.690
 no uncle billy woods and games 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.489
 flexibility and chains about this 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.489

 next Friday the derby against VVV 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.690
 what do you think it will be 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.590
 computer would have a 2021 victory 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.960
 be very beautiful 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.590
 think is afraid that the three points no 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.680
 What if you then say about playoffs 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.720
 plays more often and also good lately 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.329
 how can this be due to injuries 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.550
 suspensions got a chance from trainer and me 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.470
 do my thing and i've tried 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.270
 medical doctor should play well and it flourishes 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.560
 you sometimes 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.940
 how do you always prepare 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.270
 If you at a later time as I 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.860
 hit in falling yes so it is whole 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.440
 normal for me 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.210
 and I do so specially so we if I have to 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.830
 stand to site 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.759
 how is it that now often draws 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.840
 case is roel janssen crash course with 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.299
 the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.000
 and monks are not in the lawyers 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.680
 race once you have been absent so and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.540
 then you get the chance and then there arises 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.850
 an i'm going full book 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.549
 it says the trainer mantinge yes you are 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.619
 u instructions what I can do better and so on 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.500
 and try to follow up and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.200
 wants the sp god you expect an upcoming 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.070
 Friday I vvv that a nice law them 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.049
 become 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.860
 vvv naturally wants to win again 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.650
 they are there again so we'll see how 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.880
 well he actually knew the team tastes 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.770
 not very good 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.540
 many new boys two are coming this year 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.220
 so we wait 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.689
 the assignment was clear we last week 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.360
 had to pick up three points him well 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.009
 Have listened to nodes yes yes partly 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.489
 the football itself was falling and falling 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.200
 rise 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.390
 we are the second better 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.730
 done and then you see that you do more 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.110
 enforce on a sparta and think so 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.730
 take the lead what happened to us 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.810
 actually with the second goal because 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.470
 she was not entirely clear to me 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.630
 second goal for us is expected asami 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.850
 Sparta come on yeah situation and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.550
 injury time he can be happy you 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.050
 then 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.610
 another man sjef van der and two points 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.040
 but I was not allowed with the 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.190
 concentration fixed will three naty sometimes through 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 35 minutes then you see that three one in the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.730
 pocket is so everyone thinks so 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.470
 and then you can goal against how it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.630
 lucky also have a positive balance of 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.180
 10 I think and that's nice 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.550
 because in the end it is just possible 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.410
 be decisive and play or post 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.930
 because so many teams have the same point 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.610
 have a got a goal so will have a point 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.130
 exodus it is important to have one 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.070
 keep it new so i will get you early 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.560
 channel is what faith some said yes 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.660
 we are now fully participating again 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.820
 faith is always a goal you must 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.430
 on the trainer for every mostly 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.230
 focused on that sometimes less 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.910
 runs than we used them that 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.830
 even so his or phase 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.810
 competitions where we do two fine and 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.490
 In the end we are the last matches 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.650
 what fewer chances need to 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.050
 score to come find pleasant 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.970
 next Friday we vvv-venlo anyway 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.310
 another part always fun anyway 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.170
 yes i think next two weeks that you are with 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.940
 using the down and down series you know 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.270
 had fantastic matches 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.100
 and finally also for a play or 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.450
 place so that is completely beautiful 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.470
 mainly otherwise we were busy with the 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.209
 boiler 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.400
 ultimately it's about who goes 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.959
 best with your press that will lead well 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.870
 english to 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.400
 is in battle plan battle plan is always 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.400
 we must have wanted to have had to win 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.790
 mini camping Christmas the last 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.959
 games played well in the base 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.850
 also yes first off a bit more difficult 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.670
 like the telephone the team the white but 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.110
 it you that we at our well expect more 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.550
 pushing along in blocks plays along 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.410
 a win is most important at the 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.060
 coach was very clear last time 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.549
 you had to get 3 points 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.739
 also done oh yes certainly but the results 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.169
 Friday was important to us as 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.690
 we get the three points and we have too 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.570
 so nicely done your party 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:32.090
 celebrated and when x because we are there 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.419
 are not there yet but was 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.419
 bit vs make times are focused on tourist information 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.430
 and we see what happens 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.599
 how am i gonna make my kevin vulnerable fortuna 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:48.229
 well i think a first year good 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:50.449
 case is watch play i play the most 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.090
 game so that was also one of the 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:56.030
 most important and good atmosphere in your team 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.310
 so now for animal and standing number 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.599
 Friday vvv-venlo as follows 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.580
 the match 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.469
 yes like everyone else because those three points 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.969
 if we want the team to stand and then 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:08.150
 we must put the three points to the way 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.349
 against whom like a thumb so three 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.460
 points 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:16.060
 how live that play like yours 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:19.159
 actually then you were a bit 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.569
 a had to but ultimately we have 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:24.590
 seen that there are many teams 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.930
 so just peeing over the hang 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.849
 Paul was taken 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.270
 grabbed many points so I think we 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.969
 to do such a farther and their match 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.979
 it becomes watching and thank you 3 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:40.940
 Grab points then come then the remains 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.599
 what do you expect from a fine result 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.599
 me also on nature
