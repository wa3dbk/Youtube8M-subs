00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
think I've played a version of this at

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.009 
think I've played a version of this at
some<00:02:06.030> point<00:02:06.420> probably<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.470> long<00:02:08.450> time<00:02:09.450> ago<00:02:09.840> I'm

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
some point probably a long time ago I'm

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.699 
some point probably a long time ago I'm
probably<00:02:10.500> had<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> similar<00:02:11.340> response<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
probably had a similar response to it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:21.100 
probably had a similar response to it
which<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.790> this<00:02:15.769> kinda<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:17.330> horrible

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
so the fact I think that's what my

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
so the fact I think that's what my
response<00:02:27.260> put<00:02:28.260> AB<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.769> is<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:32.150> horrible

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390

actually no that does not work I do this
maybe<00:04:00.400> maybe<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:02.510> will<00:04:02.720> fix<00:04:03.109> it

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
maybe maybe it will fix it

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:15.490 
maybe maybe it will fix it
probably<00:04:05.269> not<00:04:05.510> oh<00:04:08.709> man<00:04:13.690> this<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:14.750> one<00:04:15.200> of<00:04:15.319> those

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
probably not oh man this is one of those

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.199 
probably not oh man this is one of those
games<00:04:15.919> where<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:18.739> want<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.340> give<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:20.060> author

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
games where I want to give the author

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.310 
games where I want to give the author
credit<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.979> doing<00:04:22.130> something<00:04:23.110> but<00:04:24.110> it's

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
credit for doing something but it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.250 
credit for doing something but it's
really<00:04:24.620> hard<00:04:25.160> to<00:04:25.700> do<00:04:25.849> that<00:04:25.880> when<00:04:26.389> obviously<00:04:26.690> it

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
really hard to do that when obviously it

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.250 
really hard to do that when obviously it
wasn't<00:04:27.530> tested<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.520> well<00:04:28.760> it<00:04:29.240> was<00:04:29.870> probably

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
wasn't tested that well it was probably

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.730 
wasn't tested that well it was probably
tested<00:04:30.830> on<00:04:31.070> Z<00:04:31.370> sness<00:04:31.700> and<00:04:32.030> as<00:04:32.990> much<00:04:33.200> as<00:04:33.470> it<00:04:33.590> may

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
tested on Z sness and as much as it may

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.960 
tested on Z sness and as much as it may
look<00:04:34.070> like<00:04:34.099> it<00:04:34.610> I'm<00:04:34.760> not<00:04:34.970> playing<00:04:35.479> on<00:04:35.810> GCSE<00:04:36.410> and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
look like it I'm not playing on GCSE and

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.480 
look like it I'm not playing on GCSE and
because<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.750> hack<00:04:39.620> was<00:04:39.979> not<00:04:40.220> tested

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
because of that the hack was not tested

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.900 
because of that the hack was not tested
thoroughly<00:04:41.919> whenever<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.130> make<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.340> hack<00:04:43.639> you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
thoroughly whenever you make a hack you

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.480 
thoroughly whenever you make a hack you
should<00:04:44.120> test<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.479> on<00:04:44.630> at<00:04:45.169> least<00:04:45.590> two<00:04:45.949> of<00:04:46.340> the

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
should test it on at least two of the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.950 
should test it on at least two of the
major<00:04:47.169> emulators<00:04:48.280> zzzz<00:04:49.280> nests<00:04:49.610> and<00:04:49.880> snus<00:04:50.599> 9x

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.540 

there's<00:04:54.960> nothing<00:04:55.470> really<00:04:55.650> else<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:56.160> say<00:04:56.370> about

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
there's nothing really else to say about

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.890 
there's nothing really else to say about
that<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:56.970> is<00:04:57.030> going<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.480> be<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.570> very<00:04:57.810> short

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
that this is going to be a very short

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.260 
that this is going to be a very short
video<00:04:58.440> I'm<00:04:58.740> not<00:04:58.770> going<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.400> attempt<00:04:59.790> to<00:04:59.910> get<00:05:00.240> a

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
video I'm not going to attempt to get a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.750 
video I'm not going to attempt to get a
further<00:05:00.810> in<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.350> this<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.760> completely

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
further in this this is completely

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.110 
further in this this is completely
broken<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:04.100> judging<00:05:05.100> by<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.310> first<00:05:05.700> level

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
broken and judging by the first level

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.830 
broken and judging by the first level
it's<00:05:06.450> not<00:05:06.870> going<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.380> get<00:05:07.560> ain't<00:05:07.770> better<00:05:08.840> so

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
it's not going to get ain't better so

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.960 
it's not going to get ain't better so
I'm<00:05:09.990> going<00:05:10.260> to<00:05:10.320> leave<00:05:10.590> this<00:05:10.770> here<00:05:11.130> this<00:05:11.910> is

I'm going to leave this here this is

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.920 
I'm going to leave this here this is
