00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 one of the most common queries that 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.610
 receive is how to lose weight 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.050
 face with makeup how to sculpt what 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.210
 how to take advantage of our factions 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.999
 playing with lights and shadows and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.400
 today I'm going to play with a product 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:24.150
 of hungry 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.279
 and we are going to work the structure of the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.919
 face to make it finer for 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.390
 define your volumes hello how about 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.730
 I am lewis any officer of max 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.340
 actor and this is telva dotcom as I say 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.830
 let's work with the number 245 of 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.100
 soft wire protection frauds that stops 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.589
 me is a product like line that is a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.300
 intermediate brown tone that gives us 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:49.560
 Pretty game when it comes to shading 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.290
 and mark our factions 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.290
 we will help ourselves with a brush 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.460
 having then 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.530
 parts and we will go shading 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.190
 removing the excess product and as 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.720
 always from less to more 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.720
 we will define the nose 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.910
 the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.590
 cheekbone depth we will fight 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.490
 making an imaginary diagonal from 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.530
 the ear towards the lip 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.310
 and we will apply the shading giving 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.409
 small touches 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.659
 as always from less to more until 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.869
 get 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.460
 the desired volume and we are seeing how 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.920
 bigger our cheekbone depth 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.920
 we can also define the oval 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.480
 slightly shading this part in the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.860
 if we have a very valuable 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.010
 square and we want 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.000
 create an effect of a facial oval more 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.000
 thin more oval 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.070
 and we see how we are already deciding ways 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.410
 in our oval 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.140
 we are doing all the contour for 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.130
 tune the oval that's in case 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.510
 We want to narrow the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.510
 as here 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.120
 our plane flyer and here we have the 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.040
 we have created volumes from 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.689
 the shading we have defined 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.659
 and the chin we have shaded the maxilla 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:36.000
 lower to make the face narrower 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.110
 we have done depth of cheekbone a 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.390
 darker outline 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.500
 and we have done a shading at the temples 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.500
 to sculpt the face 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 good and you see how with this shading 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.020
 we have sculpted we have deepened we have 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.849
 delimited the cheekbones and we have 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.150
 narrowed the lower part of the maxilla 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.030
 lower 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.340
 in your face, you see, it 's very 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.720
 simple and I hope you put it in 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.000
 practice and especially that I have 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.799
 liked and stable we see here the 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.480
 next week with another video that I hope 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.069
 that is of interest to you 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.069
 I am lewis and that is the dow dotcom
