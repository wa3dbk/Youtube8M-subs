00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.480
 then saw on the Internet 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.160
 video where one guy in his garage 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:15.030
 made a separate analysis. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.730
 I somehow lecturing two options 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.170
 Iâ€™ll just say that my machines 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.890
 unsuccessful 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 stone processing my that is without 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:35.579
 bearings on the sleeves this strap 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:40.200
 moved that is such a rough 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:46.850
 Well, here I want to work now 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.850
 tell me more about that is a miracle 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:54.570
 I really liked the idea of this guy 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 that's all very simple elementary minimum 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.090
 turning turning milling now wanna 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:12.409
 More to tell and show how 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:12.409
 working on their own country did not emery 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.900
 bottom stone removed third-party was on 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.090
 wait here 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.350
 The base is mounted on the plates 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:34.860
 millimeter plate here here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:39.290
 mounted under it stands here is movable 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:46.500
 a strap that moves here with this screw 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:48.649
 back and forth rocker with diamond better 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.110
 hold or this rocker on 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 bearings well such is simple 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.909
 supporting spring design 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.659
 roller 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 it means here the plate is also possible 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.200
 move 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:13.129
 when stony wear out now wanna 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.129
 show how it works 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.420
 neatly sum 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.420
 most 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.219
 can we leave 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.820
 there is a surface sanded so 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.820
 here without difficulty 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.820
 will allow 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.989
 9 not blindly 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.000
 at the door 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:51.860
 sanded crush and divert diamond 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:54.520
 that radius I also did everything 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.520
 limit 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.420
 power between 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.959
 accommodate children 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.930
 millimeters from as far as many 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:11.629
 here it is set to 10 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.629
 around the city that radius well or there 10 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.269
 like 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.879
 good luck 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.759
 I also wanted to say that it is very convenient 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:35.039
 that the center can be adjusted 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:39.020
 With the help of this stud, it is from two 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.020
 parties that is what my profile was 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:51.890
 Here is uneven if you need what size 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.890
 there I can pass to remove write in a personal
