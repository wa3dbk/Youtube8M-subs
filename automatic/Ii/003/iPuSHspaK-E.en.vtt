00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.600
 what is repentance because the 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:18.050
 bible says for example that some 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.000
 people sought repentance 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.070
 but they did not receive forgiveness for their 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.130
 sins although they repented with 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.650
 tears the bible says that about israel 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.670
 what is repentance 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.770
 repentance comes from a 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.290
 interesting Greek word in the new 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.260
 testament that has to do with a 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.480
 attitude change or a change of 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.710
 mentality 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.620
 then the genuine repentance 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.289
 occurs when the power of conviction of 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.870
 Holy spirit leads me to change 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.870
 mentality with regard to sin what 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.679
 before I enjoyed now I reject it what 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.989
 I hate what I once loved I accepted and 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:01:01.609
 I estimate now it brings me sadness and pain 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.159
 how we come to genuine repentance 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:08.540
 how can we really change our 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:11.090
 mentality when we repent we 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.790
 I'll say like when we got in touch 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.480
 with jesus and when we meditate on the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.540
 cross of 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.670
 variously and when we get to that cross and 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.550
 our hearts are broken through guilt 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.280
 of sin and we see what our 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.600
 sins have made Jesus my sin 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.080
 has brought Jesus to the cross my sin 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.290
 has brought Jesus to Calvary and when 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.170
 I see the pain in the eyes of Jesus and the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.060
 agony on his face and he came to the cross and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.670
 I see nails in his hands and blood 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:48.140
 running around his wrists when I see him 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.180
 there alone on the cross carrying the sins 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.480
 of the condemned world when I see it and 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.150
 doing in agony I say Jesus changes 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.100
 my mentality changes my attitude with 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.140
 regarding sin sir I do not want 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.480
 do nothing that hurt you I do not want 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.850
 do anything that causes you pain the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.590
 repentance comes when we look at 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.929
 Jesus and when we look at him 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.929
 we truly renounce sin
