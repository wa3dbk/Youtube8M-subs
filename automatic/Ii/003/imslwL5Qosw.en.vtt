00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240 
going to stress the plant out and it's
going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.720> cause<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> orchid<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> drop<00:01:50.040> its

going to cause the orchid to drop its

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
going to cause the orchid to drop its
flowers<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.450> make

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
flowers you don't want to do that make

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.469 
flowers you don't want to do that make
sure<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.350> wait<00:01:52.590> once<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.700> done<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
sure you just wait once it's done you

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.399 
sure you just wait once it's done you
can<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.720> begin<00:01:55.320> repotting<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.280> orchid

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
can then begin repotting your orchid

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
can then begin repotting your orchid
also<00:01:58.409> another<00:01:58.590> reason<00:01:58.770> why<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.070> left<00:01:59.390> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
also another reason why we left the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
also another reason why we left the
inflorescence<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.619> because<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.759> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
inflorescence on is because a lot of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.539 
inflorescence on is because a lot of
times<00:02:03.119> people<00:02:03.960> say<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.380> cut<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.920> off<00:02:05.070> however

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
times people say to cut it off however

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
times people say to cut it off however
there's<00:02:05.759> two<00:02:06.149> different<00:02:06.750> thoughts<00:02:07.530> with<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
there's two different thoughts with this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.949 
there's two different thoughts with this
one<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> leave<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.720> create

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
one is if you leave it on it can create

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.690 
one is if you leave it on it can create
a<00:02:10.020> Kiki<00:02:10.410> which<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> second<00:02:11.160> plan<00:02:11.400> that's

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
a Kiki which is a second plan that's

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.830 
a Kiki which is a second plan that's
great

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
great

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600 
great
or<00:02:12.900> other<00:02:13.410> people<00:02:13.739> say<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> cut<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.489> off

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
or other people say to cut it off

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.240 
or other people say to cut it off
because<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.050> does<00:02:16.319> not<00:02:16.349> look<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:17.040> best

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
because it just does not look the best

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.540 
because it just does not look the best
on<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.090> plant<00:02:18.330> here<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:19.050> we're<00:02:19.200> going<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.550> make

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
on the plant here so we're going to make

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.449 
on the plant here so we're going to make

roots<00:02:30.180> growing<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.720> bottom<00:02:31.019> here<00:02:31.290> these

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
roots growing in the bottom here these

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.449 
roots growing in the bottom here these
roots<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.239> don't<00:02:33.269> want<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.200> risk<00:02:34.530> ripping<00:02:35.250> off

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
roots you don't want to risk ripping off

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
don't need to be damaged to cut down one

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.600 
don't need to be damaged to cut down one
end<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.799> cut<00:02:50.010> down<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.250> other<00:02:50.370> end

end and cut down the other end

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.250 
end and cut down the other end
this<00:02:51.120> plant<00:02:51.390> desperately<00:02:51.989> needed<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
this plant desperately needed to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.110 
this plant desperately needed to
repotting<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.890> was<00:02:53.040> pushing<00:02:53.610> its<00:02:53.850> way<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.090> of

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
repotting it was pushing its way out of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.400 
repotting it was pushing its way out of
the<00:02:54.239> pot<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:57.590> alright<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:01.019> now<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.170> you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
growing medium to drop out once you've

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.729 
growing medium to drop out once you've
tickled<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> roots<00:03:19.200> you're<00:03:19.380> going<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> notice

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
tickled the roots you're going to notice

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.599 
tickled the roots you're going to notice
that<00:03:19.769> there<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.130> no<00:03:20.519> more<00:03:21.290> excess<00:03:22.290> bark<00:03:23.280> here

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
that there is no more excess bark here

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.069 
that there is no more excess bark here
it's<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.180> free<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.660> its<00:03:24.810> growing

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
it's going to be free of all its growing

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.770 
it's going to be free of all its growing
medium<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.650> now<00:03:26.519> we<00:03:26.579> can<00:03:26.850> continue<00:03:27.239> with<00:03:27.660> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
medium and now we can continue with the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.199 
medium and now we can continue with the
fresh<00:03:28.049> gray<00:03:28.319> medium<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.400> you're<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
fresh gray medium so you're going to

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.400 
fresh gray medium so you're going to
want<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:31.319> position<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.690> plant<00:03:33.930> upside<00:03:34.260> down

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
want to position the plant upside down

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.050 
want to position the plant upside down
and<00:03:34.620> make<00:03:34.739> sure<00:03:34.950> you<00:03:35.069> put<00:03:35.640> some<00:03:35.670> growing

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
and make sure you put some growing

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.650 
and make sure you put some growing
medium<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:37.700> that<00:03:38.700> hole<00:03:38.970> there<00:03:39.799> because<00:03:40.799> having

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
medium in that hole there because having

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.900 
medium in that hole there because having
any<00:03:42.660> air<00:03:43.260> gaps<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.769> not<00:03:43.920> good<00:03:44.160> for<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.519> failing

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
any air gaps is not good for a failing
