00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.810
 hi to all from w9 colf yankee enki 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:13.120
 then see shown here on the left 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:15.550
 the new tv and tth uv f9 the sense of 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.680
 this video is simply to 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.789
 demonstrate to those already in possession of the 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.680
 bau feng or 5 r that can use it 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.330
 same charger and the same 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.519
 battery for both devices 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.039
 then this is the original battery 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.989
 of the whiting team has a capacity of 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.479
 1,600 milian for here from the pro you see 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.949
 here is the active writing and unfortunately you 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:41.350
 from the video camera you can't see very well 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.319
 and this is the original battery of the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.929
 undoubted mouse 5r in this case I have 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:48.839
 sent to pick up the red battery 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.699
 precisely because the apparatus in red 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.670
 moreover, the differences are that this 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:58.510
 battery and 1600 milan for this other 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.909
 and from 1800 you know very well that on TV 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.780
 and you get charged through this little one 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:09.180
 door there is its special pin serves 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.009
 precisely to recharge the battery e 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.090
 I said who is already in possession of the bau 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.890
 franco coppi 5 can use the same 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.140
 charger that this is here 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.850
 use the 5- inch long battery 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.000
 go with the cultivated tea 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.430
 I'll give you a good example right away 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.430
 and the baff battery we said the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 let's put on the whitey team we turn on 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 to the apparatus here you see it works 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.840
 perfectly and you can also very well 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.899
 rest an apparatus in his in the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.899
 mouse base 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.360
 ubi 5 and in this way it can be loaded 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.060
 with the same base, two radios if yes 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.069
 also wants to have that bear on 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.080
 around only one of the two radios and have 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.490
 in the spare battery you can or 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.679
 charge the upi 5 battery on the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.409
 its base or hold this 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:08.970
 battery in the tt being of more capacity 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.250
 big and take the original battery 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.470
 in stock by loading it from its special 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.900
 charger in this way you will have two 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.319
 batteries that you could use 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.090
 for both radios we therefore say 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.000
 in this way increases versatility e 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.400
 the total capacity of the radios of 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.120
 being able to operate in this case is a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.709
 advantage of tv.it because precisely the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.049
 type and who has a standard battery from 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.019
 1600 Milan because I repeat it is this while 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.690
 that of undoubted bofa 5 and from 1800 for 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.420
 to which I can reiterate this 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.769
 battery on tv.it using the charge 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.560
 original battery of 5 b in such a way 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.060
 such as to have greater capacity e 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.019
 charge both radios with one 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.970
 battery charger 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.359
 thanks to all I consider it more 9 golf in 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.359
 chianti
