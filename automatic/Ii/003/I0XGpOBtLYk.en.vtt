okay<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.230> let's<00:00:13.230> talk<00:00:13.440> about<00:00:13.500> some<00:00:14.490> Tai<00:00:14.849> Chi

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
okay so let's talk about some Tai Chi

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.529 
okay so let's talk about some Tai Chi
principles<00:00:15.630> okay<00:00:16.699> so<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> most

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
principles okay so one of the most

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
principles okay so one of the most
important<00:00:18.960> ones<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:20.240> relaxed<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.340> alpha

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
important ones is relaxed so the alpha

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.240 
important ones is relaxed so the alpha
body<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.390> be<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:25.080> relaxed<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.130> know

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
body has to be really relaxed you know

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.240 
body has to be really relaxed you know
just<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:27.359> has<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.720> so<00:00:28.019> soft<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.800> upper<00:00:29.039> body

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
just it has to be so soft the upper body

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.049 
just it has to be so soft the upper body
you<00:00:29.820> know<00:00:30.679> very<00:00:31.679> very<00:00:31.859> relaxed<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.850> no

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you know very very relaxed like no

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.229 
you know very very relaxed like no
tension<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> muscles<00:00:34.140> very<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.649> soft

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
tension in the muscles very very soft

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.319 
tension in the muscles very very soft
but<00:00:36.530> for<00:00:37.530> all<00:00:37.739> softness<00:00:38.399> there's<00:00:38.850> always<00:00:39.000> some

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
but for all softness there's always some

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.410 
but for all softness there's always some
hidden<00:00:39.629> strength<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> here<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> strength<00:00:42.210> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
hidden strength so here the strength is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.340 
hidden strength so here the strength is
in<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.950> is<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.309> spiraling<00:00:45.090> rooting<00:00:45.989> power

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
in the is in the spiraling rooting power

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
in the is in the spiraling rooting power
in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> base<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.469> body<00:00:49.649> okay<00:00:50.489> so

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
in the in the base of the body okay so

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.360 
in the in the base of the body okay so
for<00:00:51.480> example<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:52.110> we're<00:00:52.260> doing<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.980> very

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
for example when we're doing this very

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.840 
for example when we're doing this very
classical<00:00:54.090> triple<00:00:54.989> twist<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:56.219> upper<00:00:56.250> body<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
classical triple twist the upper body is

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.660 
classical triple twist the upper body is
totally<00:00:57.210> relaxed<00:00:57.840> totally<00:00:58.829> soft<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.430> relaxed

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
totally relaxed totally soft and relaxed

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 
totally relaxed totally soft and relaxed
but<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.539> lower<00:01:01.109> body<00:01:01.410> has<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.039> very

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
but the lower body has this very

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.200 
but the lower body has this very
powerful<00:01:02.629> coiling<00:01:03.890> spiraling<00:01:04.890> action<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
powerful coiling spiraling action so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.340 
powerful coiling spiraling action so
what<00:01:06.540> happens<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:08.400> twist<00:01:08.460> my<00:01:09.299> waist<00:01:09.780> here

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
what happens is as I twist my waist here

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.070 
what happens is as I twist my waist here
the<00:01:11.340> usual<00:01:11.820> pattern<00:01:12.060> most<00:01:12.540> people<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.049> they

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
the usual pattern most people if they

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.160 
the usual pattern most people if they
twist<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.670> leg<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.479> twist<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
twist here this leg will also twist and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.640 
twist here this leg will also twist and
that's<00:01:17.009> big<00:01:17.430> mistake<00:01:17.960> so<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.229> want<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.500> do

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that's big mistake so what we want to do

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.420 
that's big mistake so what we want to do
is<00:01:19.950> when<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.729> twist<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> waist<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.140> way<00:01:22.430> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is when we twist the waist this way this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609 
is when we twist the waist this way this
thigh<00:01:23.790> muscle<00:01:24.299> has<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> turn<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
thigh muscle has to turn in in a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.580 
thigh muscle has to turn in in a
counterforce<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.509> actually<00:01:27.810> turn<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.439> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
counterforce so we actually turn it in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
counterforce so we actually turn it in
towards<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> groin<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.810> does<00:01:31.020> is

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
towards the groin so what that does is

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
towards the groin so what that does is
it<00:01:31.380> creates<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.040> powerful<00:01:32.750> counter<00:01:33.750> force

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
it creates a very powerful counter force

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.469 
it creates a very powerful counter force
it<00:01:34.170> also<00:01:34.320> protects<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.159> knee<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.360> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it also protects the knee because if you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.050 
it also protects the knee because if you
twisted<00:01:36.990> me<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:38.009> damage<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> need<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.939> these

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
twisted me you damage the need and these

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
twisted me you damage the need and these
are<00:01:39.119> not<00:01:39.390> designed<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.990> move<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.409> way<00:01:40.680> only

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
are not designed to move this way only

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.210 
are not designed to move this way only
up<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.400> down<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> what<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.740> create

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
up and down so what we do is we create

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.389 
up and down so what we do is we create
this<00:01:44.460> counter<00:01:44.909> force<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:47.009> upper<00:01:47.189> body

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
this counter force and the upper body

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
this counter force and the upper body
very<00:01:47.670> relaxed<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.240> twist<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.899> twist<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.439> twist

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
very relaxed we twist we twist we twist

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.789 
very relaxed we twist we twist we twist
we<00:01:49.890> twist<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:51.030> Christon<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.140> this

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
we twist and this Christon more and this

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.679 
we twist and this Christon more and this
twisting<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> let's<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:53.909> go<00:01:54.060> further<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
twisting on it let's just go further and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.319 
twisting on it let's just go further and
further<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.110> further<00:01:55.399> now<00:01:56.399> we<00:01:56.460> shift<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
further and further now we shift the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.590 
further and further now we shift the
weight<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.369> exactly<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> same<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
weight and we do exactly the same on the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.389 
weight and we do exactly the same on the
other<00:02:00.630> side<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> twist

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
other side so now we're going to twist

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.250 
other side so now we're going to twist
this<00:02:02.700> thigh<00:02:03.030> in

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
this thigh in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.100 
this thigh in
and<00:02:04.440> the<00:02:04.770> waste<00:02:04.980> is<00:02:05.160> gonna<00:02:05.370> flit<00:02:05.640> around<00:02:06.110> twist

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and the waste is gonna flit around twist

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.020 
and the waste is gonna flit around twist
twist<00:02:07.440> twist<00:02:07.620> twist<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.730> have<00:02:08.940> this

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
twist twist twist now we have this

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
twist twist twist now we have this
tremendous<00:02:10.070> coiled<00:02:11.070> up<00:02:11.250> power<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.970> here<00:02:12.270> that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
tremendous coiled up power in here that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.360 
tremendous coiled up power in here that
we<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.320> release<00:02:15.170> now<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> Sochi<00:02:16.830> moment

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
we can release now in the Sochi moment

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.940 
we can release now in the Sochi moment
we<00:02:17.460> release<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.940> slowly<00:02:18.590> there's<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.680> lot<00:02:19.830> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
we release it slowly there's a lot of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.800 
we release it slowly there's a lot of
power<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.250> gets<00:02:20.550> released<00:02:20.850> there<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.690> I'm

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
power that gets released there but I'm

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.390 
power that gets released there but I'm
not<00:02:21.840> actually<00:02:22.110> doing<00:02:22.770> anything<00:02:23.100> I'm<00:02:23.370> just

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
not actually doing anything I'm just

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.450 
not actually doing anything I'm just
letting<00:02:24.030> that<00:02:24.180> power<00:02:24.510> release<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
letting that power release so in a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.170 
letting that power release so in a
strike<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.700> but<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:30.060> let

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
strike it's like that but you just let

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.260 
strike it's like that but you just let
the<00:02:30.300> power<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.690> release<00:02:31.850> this<00:02:32.850> right<00:02:33.090> there's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the power of release this right there's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.470 
the power of release this right there's
nothing<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.660> do<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.910> that's<00:02:36.060> why<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.300> most

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
nothing to do so that's why the most

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120 
nothing to do so that's why the most
important<00:02:36.870> principles<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> spiraling

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
important principles the spiraling

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.070 
important principles the spiraling
twisting<00:02:39.060> twisting<00:02:40.050> force<00:02:40.730> there<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.930> other

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
twisting twisting force there the other

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.450 
twisting twisting force there the other
principle<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.640> Tai<00:02:44.850> Chi<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.660> height<00:02:46.460> so

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
principle the Tai Chi is the height so

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.900 
principle the Tai Chi is the height so
when<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.760> start<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.210> form<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:50.280> connect<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
when we start the form we we connect and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.640 
when we start the form we we connect and
we<00:02:51.390> sink<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.670> once<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:55.350> stay

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
we sink and once you think you stay

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.910 
we sink and once you think you stay
there<00:02:56.210> so<00:02:57.210> it's<00:02:57.480> very<00:02:57.570> important<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.740> Tai

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
