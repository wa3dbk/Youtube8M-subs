computer could function using just an
internet<00:00:23.760> browser<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> borrowed<00:00:25.230> one

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
internet browser and so I borrowed one

then well over the background you put
chrome<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.760> here<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.850> go<00:00:50.879> it's<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:53.670> know

the operating system they've been using

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.110 
the operating system they've been using
for<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> while<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.280> works<00:00:56.520> fine<00:00:56.760> here

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
for a while and it's it works fine here

for a while and it's it works fine here
it's<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.350> terribly<00:00:58.859> different

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
it's a you know not terribly different

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.150 
it's a you know not terribly different
from<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.579> other<00:00:59.730> version<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.180> PC<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.649> anyway

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
from the other version on PC so anyway

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.709 
from the other version on PC so anyway
you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.460> surf<00:01:02.640> web<00:01:02.910> sites<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.600> it's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you can surf web sites and it's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.530 
you can surf web sites and it's
everyone's<00:01:04.229> relatively<00:01:04.830> smoothly<00:01:08.330> like<00:01:09.330> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
everyone's relatively smoothly like the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.660 
everyone's relatively smoothly like the
Tulsa<00:01:09.869> world's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.290> fairly<00:01:10.710> complex<00:01:11.100> website

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
Tulsa world's a fairly complex website

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700 
Tulsa world's a fairly complex website
and<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> usually<00:01:12.270> pulls<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.900> up<00:01:12.990> relatively

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
and it usually pulls it up relatively

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.440 
and it usually pulls it up relatively
quickly<00:01:14.040> our<00:01:14.250> Wi-Fi<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.970> weak<00:01:15.119> here

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
quickly our Wi-Fi is a little weak here

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450 
quickly our Wi-Fi is a little weak here
so<00:01:15.780> maybe<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> little<00:01:16.890> slower<00:01:17.100> than<00:01:17.310> your

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so maybe it's a little slower than your

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
so maybe it's a little slower than your
experience<00:01:17.970> might<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.659> well<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:19.650> else

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
experience might be so well what else

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
experience might be so well what else
can<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.369> when<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.090> click<00:01:21.270> down

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
can you do with it when we click down

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
can you do with it when we click down
here<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.710> variety<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> apps

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here and you have a variety of apps

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.429 
here and you have a variety of apps
something<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.689> might<00:01:24.840> notice<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
something you might notice is that

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.890 
something you might notice is that
they're<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.610> done<00:01:26.880> by<00:01:27.030> Google<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.750> need

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
they're all done by Google so you need

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.210 
they're all done by Google so you need
to<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.080> pretty<00:01:28.290> happy<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.740> being<00:01:28.979> within

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
to be pretty happy with being within

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.330 
to be pretty happy with being within
Google's<00:01:29.729> ecosystem<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.710> Google<00:01:31.710> provides<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
Google's ecosystem but Google provides a

Google's ecosystem but Google provides a
probably<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.939> more<00:01:33.150> robust<00:01:33.650> experience<00:01:34.650> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
probably a more robust experience in

probably a more robust experience in

the files that's that I sent over even

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.850 
the files that's that I sent over even
though<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.560> lot<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:03.180> formats<00:03:04.180> are<00:03:04.360> supported<00:03:04.860> so

though a lot of formats are supported so

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.940 
though a lot of formats are supported so
at<00:03:06.549> any<00:03:07.209> rate<00:03:07.329> the<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.170> Chromebook<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.709> very

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
at any rate the the Chromebook is a very

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680 
at any rate the the Chromebook is a very
interesting<00:03:09.280> beast<00:03:09.760> I<00:03:10.000> would<00:03:10.120> actually<00:03:10.239> call

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
interesting beast I would actually call

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.229 
interesting beast I would actually call
it<00:03:10.870> more<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.799> tablet<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> keyboard

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
it more of a a tablet with a keyboard

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.030 
it more of a a tablet with a keyboard
than<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> true<00:03:14.380> laptop<00:03:15.100> if<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.890> doesn't<00:03:17.890> put

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
than a true laptop if that doesn't put

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.400 
than a true laptop if that doesn't put
you<00:03:18.160> off<00:03:18.370> then<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:19.420> know<00:03:19.510> maybe<00:03:20.200> this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
you off then you know maybe this

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.880 
you off then you know maybe this
wouldn't<00:03:20.680> be<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.920> bad<00:03:21.519> alternative<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.860> a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
wouldn't be a bad alternative to to a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.319 
wouldn't be a bad alternative to to a
tablet<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:24.489> don't<00:03:24.670> mind<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.940> relatively

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
tablet if you don't mind a relatively

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.930 
tablet if you don't mind a relatively
lacking<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:26.049> app<00:03:26.410> selection<00:03:27.040> plus<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.820> only

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
lacking a app selection plus it only

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080 
lacking a app selection plus it only
costs<00:03:28.269> 250<00:03:28.720> dollars<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.530> that's<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:30.130> lot<00:03:30.880> better

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
costs 250 dollars so that's a lot better

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.360 
costs 250 dollars so that's a lot better
than<00:03:31.269> most<00:03:31.390> tablets<00:03:31.840> out<00:03:31.959> there<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.500> it's<00:03:32.680> it's

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
than most tablets out there so it's it's

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.140 
than most tablets out there so it's it's
worth<00:03:33.610> considering<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.209> least

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
worth considering the least

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.209 
worth considering the least
