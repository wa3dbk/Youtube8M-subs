and one of the reasons I did that was

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.580 
and one of the reasons I did that was
because<00:00:10.400> for<00:00:11.400> one<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.759> cheap<00:00:12.380> number<00:00:13.380> two

out there's no adjustment etc it can be
tough<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.320> wrists<00:00:26.269> this<00:00:27.269> one<00:00:27.480> set<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.869> for

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
tough on your wrists this one set up for

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.139 
tough on your wrists this one set up for
water<00:00:28.140> fed<00:00:28.410> pole<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.130> weight<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> it's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
water fed pole the weight of it it's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.830 
water fed pole the weight of it it's
just<00:00:33.660> glass<00:00:33.899> fiber<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:36.239> only<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> hundred

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
just glass fiber but it's only a hundred

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.660 
just glass fiber but it's only a hundred
and<00:00:37.020> something<00:00:37.500> grams<00:00:37.980> heavier<00:00:38.250> than<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
and something grams heavier than the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.180 
and something grams heavier than the
Harris<00:00:38.969> Poll<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.559> within<00:00:41.040> reason

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
Harris Poll so you know within reason

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.060 
Harris Poll so you know within reason
it's<00:00:41.790> still<00:00:42.059> okay<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.500> about<00:00:43.559> 18

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it's still okay to use it's about 18

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
it's still okay to use it's about 18
foot<00:00:44.370> long<00:00:45.140> it's<00:00:46.140> got<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.469> anti<00:00:46.770> twist<00:00:47.480> system

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
foot long it's got an anti twist system

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.410 
foot long it's got an anti twist system
in<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.309> other<00:00:50.430> words<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.000> won't<00:00:51.210> get

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
in it so in other words you won't get

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.250 
in it so in other words you won't get
any<00:00:51.600> twist<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.980> way<00:00:53.750> like<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> Harris

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
any twist this way like the Harris

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.130 
any twist this way like the Harris
because<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.100> got<00:00:56.280> sort<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> ridges<00:00:57.420> actually

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
because it's got sort of ridges actually

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.029 
because it's got sort of ridges actually
on<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.640> profile<00:00:59.640> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> actual<00:01:00.840> pole<00:01:01.140> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
on the profile of the actual pole so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.329 
on the profile of the actual pole so
that's<00:01:02.250> good<00:01:03.470> as<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.040> got

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that's good as you can see it's got

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.440 
that's good as you can see it's got
these<00:01:05.659> nice<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:06.900> clamps<00:01:08.000> I'm<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.270> sure

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
these nice little clamps I'm not sure

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.300 
these nice little clamps I'm not sure
about<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> quality<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> them<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.770> far<00:01:11.070> so

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
about the quality of them but so far so

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.260 
about the quality of them but so far so
good<00:01:11.340> they're<00:01:11.640> okay

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
good they're okay

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.249 
good they're okay
nice<00:01:12.930> needs<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> use<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:14.189> smooth<00:01:15.259> running

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
nice needs to use pretty smooth running

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.700 
nice needs to use pretty smooth running
up<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.890> down<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> pole<00:01:18.350> they're<00:01:19.350> really

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
up and down the pole they're really

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.859 
up and down the pole they're really
quick<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.159> use<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.580> simple<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.720> no

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
quick to use and simple there's no

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.590 
quick to use and simple there's no
effort<00:01:22.140> required<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> how<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.430> poles<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
effort required like the how is poles so

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.300 
effort required like the how is poles so
it<00:01:24.900> might<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.170> worth<00:01:25.290> investing<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.040> something

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it might be worth investing in something

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.179 
it might be worth investing in something
like<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:29.479> as<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.009> bring

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
like this as you can see when you bring

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.960 
like this as you can see when you bring
the<00:01:32.310> pole<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.420> flip<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:37.970> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the pole down you can just flip it a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.690 
the pole down you can just flip it a
little<00:01:39.840> bit<00:01:39.990> heavier<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.829> pole<00:01:41.130> comes<00:01:41.520> in

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
little bit heavier this pole comes in

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.170 
little bit heavier this pole comes in
about<00:01:41.970> 18<00:01:42.360> foot<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.170> 17

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
about 18 foot and how it's at about 17

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.780 
about 18 foot and how it's at about 17
when<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> put<00:01:45.659> an<00:01:46.560> angle<00:01:46.770> adapter<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
when you put an angle adapter on as you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.819 
when you put an angle adapter on as you
can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.600> an<00:01:48.810> aluminium<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
can see here this is an aluminium one so

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.950 
can see here this is an aluminium one so
be<00:01:49.950> careful<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.670> order<00:01:51.000> them<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.780> some

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
be careful when you order them for some

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
be careful when you order them for some
of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.140> younger<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.649> -<00:01:52.829> like<00:01:53.040> weigh<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> ton

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
of the younger one - like weigh a ton

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
of the younger one - like weigh a ton
anything<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.329> put<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.720> top<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.219> pole

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
anything you put on the top of your pole

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.210 
anything you put on the top of your pole
will<00:01:57.270> act<00:01:57.509> like<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:58.200> leverage<00:01:58.860> effect

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
will act like a leverage effect

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.920 
will act like a leverage effect
very<00:02:00.520> difficult<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.180> so<00:02:01.540> I'm<00:02:01.660> tracking

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
very difficult to you so I'm tracking

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.140 
very difficult to you so I'm tracking
everything<00:02:02.470> as<00:02:02.680> light<00:02:02.830> as<00:02:02.980> possible<00:02:03.150> let's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
everything as light as possible let's

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.230 
everything as light as possible let's
consider<00:02:04.510> why<00:02:04.840> Tony<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.700> younger<00:02:07.030> comb

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
consider why Tony and the younger comb

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.750 
consider why Tony and the younger comb
their<00:02:07.600> which<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.040> again<00:02:09.490> when<00:02:09.670> he

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
their which I like because again when he
