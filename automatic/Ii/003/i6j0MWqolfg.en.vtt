00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
yourself on axis I'm on my back foot for

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.580 
yourself on axis I'm on my back foot for
exaggerated<00:02:42.040> effect<00:02:42.690> okay<00:02:43.690> there's<00:02:44.410> more

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

here<00:02:45.660> again<00:02:46.660> I'll<00:02:46.810> go<00:02:46.900> up<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.230> camera<00:02:47.850> it's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
here again I'll go up to the camera it's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.170 
here again I'll go up to the camera it's
this<00:02:49.060> it's<00:02:49.450> not<00:02:50.040> people<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.340> don't<00:02:51.910> know<00:02:52.030> what

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
people think is this it's not this is

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.410 
people think is this it's not this is
here<00:02:54.720> okay<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:56.820> why<00:02:57.820> does<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.150> work<00:02:58.390> for

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
here okay so why does this work for

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
here okay so why does this work for
Tyson<00:02:58.810> welfare<00:02:59.350> stuff<00:03:00.570> he<00:03:01.570> has<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.780> body<00:03:02.110> type

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
Tyson welfare stuff he has a body type

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.460 
Tyson welfare stuff he has a body type
for<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.970> guy<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.209> naturally<00:03:04.840> shorter<00:03:05.320> than

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
for this guy is naturally shorter than

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.140 
for this guy is naturally shorter than
most<00:03:05.590> his<00:03:05.830> opponent<00:03:06.310> but<00:03:06.880> when<00:03:07.030> you're

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
most his opponent but when you're

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.120 
most his opponent but when you're
shorter<00:03:07.570> it's<00:03:07.959> easy<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.620> under<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.920> punch

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
shorter it's easy to get under the punch

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.620 
shorter it's easy to get under the punch
you<00:03:09.340> don't<00:03:09.489> have<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.880> do<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.510> under

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
you don't have to do this to get under

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.380 
you don't have to do this to get under
the<00:03:10.810> punch<00:03:10.989> he's<00:03:11.709> here<00:03:12.040> looking<00:03:12.430> up<00:03:12.549> he's<00:03:13.150> on

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
the punch he's here looking up he's on

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.470 
the punch he's here looking up he's on
his<00:03:13.540> axis<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.110> he's<00:03:14.230> under<00:03:14.500> already<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.670> it's

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
his axis and he's under already so it's

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.090 
his axis and he's under already so it's
more<00:03:16.660> comfortable<00:03:16.989> for<00:03:17.170> him<00:03:17.230> if<00:03:17.890> you're

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
more comfortable for him if you're

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.560 
more comfortable for him if you're
taller<00:03:18.430> than<00:03:18.549> your<00:03:18.790> opponent<00:03:19.269> you're<00:03:19.450> the
