00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.460
 We all have a dish that resists us when it comes to doing it. 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.010
 I always in the restaurant that some client tells me that he does not achieve a point, always 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.380
 refers to rice, always. 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.430
 For this reason now barrier overcome, with Brillante Sabroz rice will always be in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.340
 the point and we will enjoy making those recipes. 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.680
 Today we are going to make a recipe for Cod Salad. 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.980
 For this we need Sabroz rice, cod, a little parsley to decorate, chives, 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.930
 orange, black olive, tomato, olive oil and salt. 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:53.510
 To start with the cod salad, we put a saucepan with water to boil and a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.870
 little salt 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.970
 And we just have to open our Sabroz rice with the easy open, which is super simple 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:09.320
 and we are going to add two cups: one and the second. 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.630
 More or less with this amount we will have about four people. 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.450
 We leave it for about 18 minutes to boil. 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.080
 I like to add a lot of ingredients to my dishes, that's why I use Sabroz rice 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.610
 of Brilliant, because I know that thanks to its extraordinary absorption it will have everything 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 the taste and it will make the result delicious. 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.060
 And always at your point. 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.270
 After the time, we only have to drain it. 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.490
 And cool it, in the cold water jet. 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.330
 Come follow us. 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.070
 Once we have cooked the rice, we only have the rest of the ingredients. 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.210
 Let's catch the cod. 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.210
 It's salted cod. 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.210
 We have desalted it. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.320
 We are going to remove a little skin. 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.530
 See? 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 We help each other with the knife. 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.600
 We put the skin down, throw it and without more we can make some strips. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 We make some strips. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.610
 Come on, we have the cod on the one hand. 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 Here I had a little more chopped. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.390
 We are going to add it to a bowl. 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:17.180
 The olive, the cod that is protagonist along with the rice and finally the chive. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.099
 We take away the green zone. 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.099
 And we're going to bite it. 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.269
 We are going to chop it in a julienne that is finite finite. 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.629
 For this along. 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.290
 As you can see we have it and with the knife as I have always told you with the tips of the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.409
 fingers inwards. 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.430
 Supporting is super simple to cut. 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.859
 We make a fine julienne and the other also. 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.029
 What do you think? 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.019
 The recipe is very simple. 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.609
 Simple and very tasty. 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.779
 We undo the onion a little bit. 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.530
 The onion, better said. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.809
 More tender, more aromatic. 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:50.559
 And we add it. 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.049
 All we have left is to add the rice. 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.049
 For the salad that we are going to make, this amount will be enough. 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.620
 We are going to enrich it with a good jet of olive oil. 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.049
 Finally, a little salt. 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.189
 And we just have to remove our salad. 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.620
 What do you think? 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.409
 The cod along with the rice, the unctuousness of the olive. 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.109
 It will have an exquisite taste in addition to the olive stream that we have thrown out. 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.290
 What do you think? 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.870
 It looks great. 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.379
 We are going to plaster. 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.769
 An elongated dish I have chosen, let's put a little bed in the center, to put it 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.029
 somehow. 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.290
 Look what it looks like! 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.629
 And you'll see when we finish it. 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.049
 Come let's give it the color dot. 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.809
 For this, a tomato. 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:42.780
 We take our ass off a little, we throw it away. 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.040
 And we're going to do it in slices as thin as we can. 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.389
 In this case, as you can see, for this always a knife always always well sharpened. 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.499
 It's the best way to not cut ourselves. 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.359
 And on the other hand we're going to make the orange, the same. 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.150
 We remove the two little points. 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.409
 With a knife we're going to peel it, it's easy. 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.790
 We have to peel it without being afraid to cut part of the orange. 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.340
 Always remove all the white part, because it can be very unpleasant later. 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.950
 Once we have it well peeled. 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.769
 We get rid of this and it's as easy as taking the segments between line and line, 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.769
 See? 

00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:27.780
 We will always be clean clean and the juiciest part of the orange. 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.010
 Once we have the tomato and the segments, what we are going to do is finish the dish. 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.900
 We place the tomato on the rice without covering it completely. 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.720
 See how simple and what color? 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.700
 And finally the orange segments. 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.430
 I like to put them like that. 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.090
 What do you think? 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.750
 What do you think? 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.420
 What do you think? 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.940
 What a wonderful salad easy, super simple to make and also if you can not 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.020
 sit down to eat it, you can keep it perfectly in the fridge because with Sabroz rice a day 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.150
 next is exactly the same as if we had done it at the time. 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.949
 Enjoy your meal!
