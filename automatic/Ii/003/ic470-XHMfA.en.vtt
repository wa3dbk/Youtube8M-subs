00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
goes in to the injector system next

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.389 
goes in to the injector system next
we're<00:01:00.820> gonna<00:01:00.879> put<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.329> air<00:01:01.450> filter<00:01:01.840> in<00:01:02.050> and

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
other end is blocked up to make it even

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.710 
other end is blocked up to make it even
easier<00:01:13.149> to<00:01:13.479> put<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.750> air<00:01:13.869> filter<00:01:14.259> in<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.509> may

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
easier to put the air filter in you may

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.219 
easier to put the air filter in you may
just<00:01:17.080> lift<00:01:17.440> it<00:01:17.649> out<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:19.030> its<00:01:19.330> case<00:01:19.599> right<00:01:19.929> there

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
just lift it out of its case right there
