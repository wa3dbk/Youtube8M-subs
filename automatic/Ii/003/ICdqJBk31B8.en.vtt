00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
currently roams if this is the case then

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.660 
currently roams if this is the case then
it<00:01:01.170> makes<00:01:01.440> sense<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.859> Mewtwo<00:01:02.280> comes<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it makes sense that Mewtwo comes to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
it makes sense that Mewtwo comes to
Ash's<00:01:03.059> rescue<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.780> he<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.960> attacked<00:01:04.110> by<00:01:04.470> the

awakening<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.570> movies<00:01:09.990> are

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
awakening so if these two movies are

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.890 
awakening so if these two movies are

but it's pretty unlikely that they had
this<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.960> mind<00:01:52.229> 13<00:01:52.890> years<00:01:53.250> ago<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.790> mean<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
this in mind 13 years ago I mean of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
this in mind 13 years ago I mean of
course<00:01:54.509> they<00:01:55.140> might<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.530> thought<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.159> they

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
course they might have thought that they

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.190 
course they might have thought that they
would<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.000> something<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.479> me<00:01:57.750> too<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.079> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
would do something with me too in the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.190 
would do something with me too in the
future<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.310> seriously<00:01:59.729> doubt<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.899> they

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
future but I seriously doubt that they

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.499 
future but I seriously doubt that they
knew<00:02:01.649> ash<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.340> gonna<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.670> travelling<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
knew ash was gonna be travelling to a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.859 
knew ash was gonna be travelling to a
new<00:02:03.780> region<00:02:04.140> into<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.979> new<00:02:05.399> city<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.119> with

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
new region into this new city and with

all these new pokemons
keeping<00:02:09.399> that<00:02:09.550> in<00:02:09.610> mind<00:02:10.000> I've<00:02:10.239> also<00:02:10.450> noticed

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
keeping that in mind I've also noticed

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.559 
keeping that in mind I've also noticed
some<00:02:11.319> other<00:02:11.440> small<00:02:12.220> links<00:02:12.760> between<00:02:12.940> you<00:02:13.330> twos

the<00:03:14.410> aura<00:03:14.829> I<00:03:15.220> think<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:16.000> very<00:03:16.209> possible<00:03:16.989> that

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
the aura I think it's very possible that

with the moon and there is some
