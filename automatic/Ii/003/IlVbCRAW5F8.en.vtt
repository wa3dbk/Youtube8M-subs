00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
see the video that I made on the subject

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.880 
see the video that I made on the subject
here<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.660> what<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:17.530> really

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
here this is what I do and this really

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.770 
here this is what I do and this really
really<00:02:18.010> works<00:02:18.400> it<00:02:18.640> has<00:02:18.670> done<00:02:19.120> for<00:02:19.390> quite<00:02:19.750> a

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
really works it has done for quite a

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.050 
really works it has done for quite a
while<00:02:19.989> for<00:02:20.049> me<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.650> try<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.040> definitely<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
while for me so try it definitely and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.410 
while for me so try it definitely and
how<00:02:22.720> many<00:02:22.900> back<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> diet<00:02:23.790> low-sodium<00:02:24.790> is

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
how many back to the diet low-sodium is

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.650 
how many back to the diet low-sodium is
so<00:02:25.840> important<00:02:26.709> because<00:02:26.849> salt<00:02:27.849> holds<00:02:28.510> a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
so important because salt holds a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.530 
so important because salt holds a
hundred<00:02:29.170> times<00:02:29.410> its<00:02:29.799> weight<00:02:30.069> in<00:02:30.519> water<00:02:31.150> in

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
hundred times its weight in water in

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.530 
hundred times its weight in water in
your<00:02:31.630> body<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.920> lot<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.370> people<00:02:33.670> have<00:02:33.910> tons

the<00:03:37.260> next<00:03:37.350> thing<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.740> I've<00:03:37.800> got<00:03:37.920> HTH<00:03:38.580> sessions

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
the next thing so I've got HTH sessions

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.850 
the next thing so I've got HTH sessions
do<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.360> couple<00:03:39.420> times<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.020> week<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.710> want

use<00:03:47.880> that<00:03:48.120> term<00:03:48.540> loosely<00:03:48.860> but<00:03:50.420> these<00:03:51.420> sort<00:03:51.780> of

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
use that term loosely but these sort of

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.930 
use that term loosely but these sort of
exercises<00:03:52.560> are<00:03:52.740> great<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.280> firming<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
exercises are great for firming up the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.840 
exercises are great for firming up the
skin<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.780> making<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.530> arms<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.130> here<00:03:56.430> leaner

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
skin and making the arms of here leaner

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.960 
skin and making the arms of here leaner
as<00:03:57.180> well<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.950> is<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.280> resistance<00:03:59.580> man

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
as well so this is my resistance man

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.360 
as well so this is my resistance man
it's<00:04:00.300> quite<00:04:00.600> thick<00:04:01.080> this<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.800> actually<00:04:02.190> the

you'll see results quite quickly that

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.530 
you'll see results quite quickly that
way<00:04:21.770> or<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.040> can<00:04:23.130> do<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.370> at<00:04:23.460> home<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:24.090> know

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
way or you can do it at home you know

about three sets of that a couple of
times<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.600> week<00:04:54.630> maybe<00:04:55.080> every<00:04:55.200> second<00:04:55.830> day<00:04:55.980> you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
times a week maybe every second day you

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.580 
times a week maybe every second day you
know<00:04:56.940> see<00:04:57.120> results<00:04:57.570> eventually

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
know see results eventually

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.670 
know see results eventually
stick<00:04:58.740> with<00:04:58.920> it<00:04:59.870> and<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.080> they're<00:05:01.230> not<00:05:01.350> really

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
stick with it and so they're not really

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.590 
stick with it and so they're not really
relevant<00:05:01.920> minutes<00:05:02.430> doing<00:05:02.670> some<00:05:03.060> chin-ups

are making the arms you know a lot
leaner<00:05:16.800> get<00:05:17.490> building<00:05:17.940> the<00:05:18.060> muscle<00:05:18.540> in<00:05:18.660> there

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
leaner get building the muscle in there
