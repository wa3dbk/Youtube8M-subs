00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
which you can coincidentally see down

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.360 
which you can coincidentally see down
there<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.320> then<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.859> reset<00:00:59.219> the

realize you could do something else for
the<00:01:06.420> noise<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> alarm<00:01:07.229> that's<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.860> set

make<00:01:18.330> things<00:01:18.450> too<00:01:18.720> compact<00:01:19.140> because<00:01:19.530> i<00:01:19.979> feel

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
out there's a problem and where the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.070 
out there's a problem and where the
problem<00:01:25.290> originates<00:01:25.920> from<00:01:26.299> but<00:01:27.299> oh<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:27.600> so

let me go talk you through the circus
we've<00:01:30.479> got<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.400> here<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.540> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
we've got here so here for the on and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.770 
we've got here so here for the on and
off<00:01:34.200> switch<00:01:34.259> we've<00:01:35.070> got<00:01:35.490> several<00:01:35.939> things<00:01:36.329> now

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
off switch we've got several things now

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.359 
off switch we've got several things now
this<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.049> where<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.290> main<00:01:37.530> impulse<00:01:38.130> comes

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this is where the main impulse comes

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.789 
this is where the main impulse comes
from<00:01:38.640> two<00:01:39.360> blocks<00:01:39.630> behind<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.320> blocks<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
from two blocks behind the blocks the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490 
from two blocks behind the blocks the
buttons<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.640> once<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:43.049> example<00:01:43.380> i

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
buttons on them and once for example i

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.889 
buttons on them and once for example i
say<00:01:43.860> i<00:01:44.220> press<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.850> button<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.479> car<00:01:45.689> will

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
say i press the on button the car will

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
say i press the on button the car will
travel<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.530> into<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.850> 80

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
travel here into this which is 80

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.380 
travel here into this which is 80
flippity<00:01:48.840> flop<00:01:49.140> flop<00:01:49.590> flop<00:01:49.790> which<00:01:50.790> basically

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
flippity flop flop flop which basically

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.139 
flippity flop flop flop which basically
converts<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.110> pulse<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> button<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:56.149> pressure

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
converts a pulse so a button a pressure

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.249 
converts a pulse so a button a pressure
plate<00:01:57.619> trip<00:01:58.619> wire<00:01:58.920> into<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> permanent<00:02:00.420> signal

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
plate trip wire into a permanent signal

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
plate trip wire into a permanent signal
so<00:02:01.740> what<00:02:01.920> happens<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.280> when<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.670> power<00:02:02.909> goes

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
so what happens here when the power goes

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.209 
so what happens here when the power goes
into<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.600> block<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.200> switches<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.950> torch

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
into this block it switches the torch

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.540 
into this block it switches the torch
off<00:02:06.350> which<00:02:07.350> then<00:02:07.590> switches<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.160> redstone

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
off which then switches this redstone

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.980 
off which then switches this redstone
off<00:02:09.679> which<00:02:10.679> means<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
off which means that the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.010 
off which means that the
this<00:02:12.110> tour<00:02:12.380> switches<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.390> which<00:02:14.390> means<00:02:14.690> this

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
this tour switches on which means this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.570 
this tour switches on which means this
block<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.680> pushed<00:02:16.040> over<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:17.510> redstone<00:02:17.990> torch

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
block is pushed over this redstone torch

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.690 
block is pushed over this redstone torch
and<00:02:19.580> because<00:02:20.270> it's<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.570> pulse<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.920> piston

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and because it's a pulse that piston

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.250 
and because it's a pulse that piston
more<00:02:22.850> then<00:02:23.000> retract<00:02:23.450> after<00:02:23.780> its<00:02:23.870> then<00:02:24.020> days

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
more then retract after its then days

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.520 
more then retract after its then days
aren't<00:02:24.560> sticky<00:02:25.070> pistons<00:02:25.430> FYI<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:27.110> once<00:02:27.410> that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
aren't sticky pistons FYI so once that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.080 
aren't sticky pistons FYI so once that
block<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.010> above<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.400> resident<00:02:28.790> which<00:02:28.910> that

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
block is above that resident which that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.390 
block is above that resident which that
means<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.810> block<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.230> powered<00:02:30.770> which

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
means that that block is powered which

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.770 
means that that block is powered which
means<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.790> current<00:02:32.120> will<00:02:32.240> then<00:02:32.420> travel

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
means the current will then travel

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.440 
means the current will then travel
through<00:02:32.960> here<00:02:33.680> permanently<00:02:34.520> analyst<00:02:35.360> a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
through here permanently analyst a

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.420 
through here permanently analyst a
switch<00:02:35.660> on<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:36.110> like<00:02:36.260> over<00:02:36.530> here<00:02:36.740> and<00:02:36.890> will

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
switch on just like over here and will

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.280 
switch on just like over here and will
power<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> light<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:38.390> that's<00:02:38.600> that's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
power the light so that's that's

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.780 
power the light so that's that's
essentially<00:02:39.920> how<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.130> make<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.580> lights

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
essentially how I make the lights

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.820 
essentially how I make the lights
permanently<00:02:41.480> switch<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:41.960> again<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.710> I<00:02:42.770> know

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
permanently switch on again and I know

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.530 
permanently switch on again and I know
that<00:02:43.100> there<00:02:43.310> are<00:02:43.340> smaller<00:02:43.820> designs<00:02:44.210> 40

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
that there are smaller designs 40

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.660 
that there are smaller designs 40
flip-flops<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.770> this<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.190> what<00:02:46.310> I'm<00:02:46.430> quite

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
flip-flops but this is what I'm quite

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.600 
flip-flops but this is what I'm quite
familiar<00:02:46.820> with<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.510> quite<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:49.340> it's

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
familiar with and I quite like so it's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.520 
familiar with and I quite like so it's
the<00:02:49.700> same<00:02:49.910> this<00:02:50.210> as<00:02:50.360> when<00:02:50.510> it's<00:02:50.660> off<00:02:50.840> so

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
the same this as when it's off so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.730 
the same this as when it's off so
obviously<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.190> signal<00:02:52.640> at<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.940> moment<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.740> is

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
obviously the signal at the moment is is

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.830 
obviously the signal at the moment is is
being<00:02:55.520> currently<00:02:55.760> being<00:02:56.060> powered<00:02:56.360> by<00:02:56.480> this

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
being currently being powered by this

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.050 
being currently being powered by this
block<00:02:57.110> about<00:02:57.380> that<00:02:57.530> torch<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.820> light

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
block about that torch so that light

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.440 
block about that torch so that light
over<00:02:59.090> there<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.600> being<00:03:00.410> powered<00:03:01.270> so<00:03:02.270> let<00:03:02.390> me

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
over there is being powered so let me

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.390 
over there is being powered so let me
just<00:03:02.600> quickly<00:03:02.690> show<00:03:02.900> you<00:03:03.310> yet<00:03:04.310> either<00:03:06.400> yeah

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
just quickly show you yet either yeah

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.070 
just quickly show you yet either yeah
viewed<00:03:07.850> her<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.980> let<00:03:10.910> me<00:03:11.000> just<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.270> i<00:03:11.360> go<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.870> i

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
viewed her so let me just it i go and i

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.840 
viewed her so let me just it i go and i
will<00:03:12.260> do<00:03:12.410> it<00:03:12.470> slow<00:03:12.800> motion<00:03:13.250> so<00:03:13.460> you<00:03:13.520> guys<00:03:13.730> can

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
will do it slow motion so you guys can

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:25.100 
will do it slow motion so you guys can
see<00:03:14.150> it

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.330 

so<00:03:26.110> obviously<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.620> don't<00:03:26.800> actually<00:03:26.980> need

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
so obviously you don't actually need

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.120 
so obviously you don't actually need
this<00:03:27.660> I've<00:03:28.660> just<00:03:28.840> realized<00:03:29.230> that<00:03:29.530> doesn't<00:03:30.040> do

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
this I've just realized that doesn't do

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.330 
this I've just realized that doesn't do
anything<00:03:30.490> Lowell<00:03:31.020> but<00:03:32.020> yet<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.590> what's<00:03:32.950> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
anything Lowell but yet so what's that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.250 
anything Lowell but yet so what's that
so<00:03:33.640> that's<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.000> light<00:03:34.300> circuit<00:03:34.870> going<00:03:35.140> on

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
so that's the light circuit going on

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.550 
so that's the light circuit going on
there<00:03:35.910> how<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.150> make<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.140> alarm

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
there how do I make it so that the alarm

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.230 
there how do I make it so that the alarm
is<00:03:38.740> toggled<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.400> off<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:39.880> moment<00:03:40.150> is

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
is toggled on and off so the moment is

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.420 
is toggled on and off so the moment is
on<00:03:40.510> i'm<00:03:41.350> going<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.590> show<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:41.770> down<00:03:42.100> below

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
on i'm going to show you down below

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.380 
on i'm going to show you down below
there<00:03:42.700> if<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.180> look<00:03:43.300> at<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.480> purple<00:03:44.050> wall<00:03:45.390> to

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
there if you look at that purple wall to

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.390 
there if you look at that purple wall to
see<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.660> it's<00:03:46.840> pushed<00:03:47.200> over<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:48.220> little

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
see that it's pushed over that little

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.490 
see that it's pushed over that little
gap<00:03:48.640> i<00:03:48.880> want<00:03:49.300> to<00:03:49.330> press<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.630> funds<00:03:49.780> get<00:03:50.080> on<00:03:50.260> it

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
gap i want to press the funds get on it

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.190 
gap i want to press the funds get on it
switches<00:03:50.860> back<00:03:51.210> so<00:03:52.210> what<00:03:52.510> we<00:03:52.660> got<00:03:52.840> going<00:03:53.110> on

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
switches back so what we got going on

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.040 
switches back so what we got going on
there<00:03:53.610> right<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:54.970> once<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.510> current<00:03:55.810> someone

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
there right so once the current someone

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.960 
there right so once the current someone
to<00:03:56.200> press<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.920> button<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.460> current<00:03:57.850> will

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
to press the on button the current will

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.060 
to press the on button the current will
travel<00:03:58.360> down<00:03:58.570> here<00:03:58.990> did<00:03:59.260> it<00:03:59.380> alert<00:03:59.740> into<00:03:59.950> this

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
travel down here did it alert into this

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.120 
travel down here did it alert into this
big<00:04:00.310> ugly<00:04:00.520> underground<00:04:01.180> base<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.680> what<00:04:02.950> we've

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
big ugly underground base so what we've

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.320 
big ugly underground base so what we've
got<00:04:03.370> here<00:04:03.400> is<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:05.290> monostable<00:04:06.100> circuits<00:04:06.790> now

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
got here is to monostable circuits now

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.970 
got here is to monostable circuits now
the<00:04:07.390> reason<00:04:07.630> I<00:04:07.810> do<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:07.990> is<00:04:08.170> because<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.710> need

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
the reason I do this is because I need

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.310 
the reason I do this is because I need
this<00:04:09.190> block<00:04:09.460> to<00:04:09.670> be<00:04:09.790> pushed<00:04:10.090> over<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:11.140> then

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
this block to be pushed over and then

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.870 
this block to be pushed over and then
pulled<00:04:11.620> back<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.130> need<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> sticky<00:04:12.700> piston

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
pulled back so I need a sticky piston

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.740 
pulled back so I need a sticky piston
but<00:04:13.630> sticky<00:04:14.440> pistons<00:04:14.950> will<00:04:15.730> only<00:04:16.060> leave<00:04:16.540> the

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
but sticky pistons will only leave the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.780 
but sticky pistons will only leave the
block<00:04:17.020> over<00:04:17.710> somewhere<00:04:18.040> will<00:04:18.220> only<00:04:18.400> leave<00:04:18.670> the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
block over somewhere will only leave the

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.610 
block over somewhere will only leave the
block<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.090> not<00:04:19.239> retract<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.780> if<00:04:19.930> it's<00:04:20.170> powered

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
block and not retract it if it's powered

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.370 
block and not retract it if it's powered
by<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.830> pulse<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.640> a<00:04:21.670> short<00:04:22.060> tick<00:04:22.360> pulse<00:04:22.660> which

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
by a pulse so a short tick pulse which

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.890 
by a pulse so a short tick pulse which
is<00:04:23.530> what<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.820> monostable<00:04:24.820> circuit<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.450> for

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
is what this monostable circuit is for

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.380 
is what this monostable circuit is for
once<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:26.920> current<00:04:27.160> travels<00:04:27.310> down<00:04:27.640> here<00:04:27.940> goes

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
once the current travels down here goes

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.570 
once the current travels down here goes
into<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:28.810> this<00:04:29.140> torch<00:04:29.410> search<00:04:29.620> is<00:04:29.800> off<00:04:29.920> which

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
into this this torch search is off which

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.460 
into this this torch search is off which
means<00:04:30.820> this<00:04:31.000> block<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.600> no<00:04:32.110> longer<00:04:32.290> being

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
means this block is no longer being

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.080 
means this block is no longer being
powered<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:32.950> that<00:04:33.070> touch<00:04:33.280> structures<00:04:33.640> on<00:04:33.790> but

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
powered so that touch structures on but

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.530 
powered so that touch structures on but
also<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:34.720> repeater<00:04:35.170> tick<00:04:35.950> later<00:04:36.330> powers<00:04:37.330> the

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
also this repeater tick later powers the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.090 
also this repeater tick later powers the
block<00:04:37.750> which<00:04:38.020> means<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.380> torch<00:04:38.590> switches<00:04:39.010> off

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
block which means the torch switches off

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.860 
block which means the torch switches off
again<00:04:39.370> which<00:04:40.000> means<00:04:40.030> very<00:04:40.300> short<00:04:40.570> today<00:04:40.690> in

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
again which means very short today in

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.380 
again which means very short today in
the<00:04:40.960> block<00:04:41.140> is<00:04:41.320> dropped<00:04:41.650> over<00:04:42.040> here<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:43.210> the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
the block is dropped over here so the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.960 
the block is dropped over here so the
signal<00:04:44.050> from<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.440> alarm<00:04:44.890> system<00:04:45.580> from<00:04:45.820> that

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
signal from the alarm system from that

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.480 
signal from the alarm system from that
pressure<00:04:46.270> plate<00:04:46.540> cannot<00:04:47.440> pass<00:04:47.650> so<00:04:48.040> therefore

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
pressure plate cannot pass so therefore

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.760 
pressure plate cannot pass so therefore
the<00:04:48.640> alarm<00:04:48.850> is<00:04:48.970> disabled<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:50.620> we've<00:04:50.740> got

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
the alarm is disabled what we've got

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.370 
the alarm is disabled what we've got
here<00:04:50.950> is<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.790> block<00:04:52.390> below<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:53.140> pressure

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
here is the block below the pressure

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.740 
here is the block below the pressure
plate<00:04:53.760> so<00:04:54.760> on<00:04:54.910> someone<00:04:55.210> walks<00:04:55.390> on<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.690> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
plate so on someone walks on it the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.870 
plate so on someone walks on it the
power<00:04:55.930> travel<00:04:56.440> over<00:04:56.620> here<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:57.430> alarm<00:04:57.670> is<00:04:57.760> off

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
power travel over here the alarm is off

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.460 
power travel over here the alarm is off
it<00:04:58.090> won't<00:04:58.270> go<00:04:58.390> any<00:04:58.420> further<00:04:58.720> if<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.170> alarm<00:04:59.320> is

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
it won't go any further if the alarm is

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.950 
it won't go any further if the alarm is
on<00:04:59.740> as<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.730> is<00:05:00.880> now<00:05:01.120> then<00:05:01.420> it<00:05:01.510> will<00:05:01.600> be<00:05:01.660> able<00:05:01.750> to

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
on as it is now then it will be able to

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.990 
on as it is now then it will be able to
travel<00:05:02.170> and<00:05:02.440> then<00:05:02.980> go<00:05:03.160> into<00:05:03.280> these<00:05:03.520> series<00:05:03.970> of

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
travel and then go into these series of

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.740 
travel and then go into these series of
note<00:05:04.390> blocks<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:06.010> that<00:05:06.040> is<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:07.150> on<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:07.570> off

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
note blocks so that is the on and off

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.350 
note blocks so that is the on and off
for<00:05:08.350> the<00:05:08.410> alarm<00:05:08.890> system<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:10.150> same

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
for the alarm system and the same

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.890 
for the alarm system and the same
happens<00:05:10.750> when<00:05:10.900> you're<00:05:11.020> switching<00:05:11.230> it<00:05:11.500> off

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
happens when you're switching it off

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.210 
happens when you're switching it off
basically<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.020> current<00:05:14.290> travels<00:05:14.470> from<00:05:14.860> here

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
basically the current travels from here

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.330 
basically the current travels from here
that<00:05:15.550> it<00:05:15.670> editor<00:05:16.200> down<00:05:17.200> into<00:05:17.620> this<00:05:17.710> monostable

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
that it editor down into this monostable

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.240 
that it editor down into this monostable
circuit<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.120> makes<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.450> tick<00:05:20.070> obviously<00:05:21.070> if

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
circuit and makes it tick obviously if

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.190 
circuit and makes it tick obviously if
you<00:05:21.430> do<00:05:21.640> press<00:05:21.940> the<00:05:22.090> button<00:05:22.390> more<00:05:22.600> than<00:05:22.780> once

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
you do press the button more than once

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.310 
you do press the button more than once
then<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.970> will<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.450> screw<00:05:25.660> things<00:05:25.900> up<00:05:26.080> and

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
then it will kind of screw things up and

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.380 
then it will kind of screw things up and
it<00:05:26.470> will<00:05:26.590> be<00:05:26.680> inverted<00:05:27.130> I<00:05:27.310> did<00:05:28.000> contemplate

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
it will be inverted I did contemplate

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.590 
it will be inverted I did contemplate
doing<00:05:28.780> this<00:05:29.050> with<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.320> single<00:05:29.890> button<00:05:30.450> which<00:05:31.450> I

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
doing this with a single button which I

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.110 
doing this with a single button which I
could<00:05:31.840> do<00:05:32.110> but<00:05:32.919> I<00:05:33.130> would<00:05:33.430> challenge<00:05:33.610> myself<00:05:33.910> to

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
could do but I would challenge myself to

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.810 
could do but I would challenge myself to
do<00:05:34.240> it<00:05:34.270> with<00:05:34.390> two<00:05:34.540> buttons<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:35.140> manage<00:05:35.979> still

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
do it with two buttons and manage still

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
do it with two buttons and manage still
managed<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.210> recognize

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
managed to recognize

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.420 
managed to recognize
things<00:05:37.990> throughout<00:05:38.380> all<00:05:38.560> the<00:05:38.710> red<00:05:38.889> stone<00:05:39.100> ms

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
things throughout all the red stone ms

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.520 
things throughout all the red stone ms
but<00:05:40.210> i<00:05:40.240> think<00:05:40.630> it's<00:05:40.750> quite<00:05:40.930> cool<00:05:41.080> having<00:05:41.410> two

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
but i think it's quite cool having two

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.409 
but i think it's quite cool having two
buttons<00:05:41.860> it's<00:05:42.070> an<00:05:42.340> extra<00:05:42.730> cues<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.030> have<00:05:43.240> two

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
buttons it's an extra cues to have two

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.110 
buttons it's an extra cues to have two
lights<00:05:44.130> so<00:05:45.130> that's<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.580> that's<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.910> part<00:05:46.060> of

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
lights so that's that that's the part of

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.060 
lights so that's that that's the part of
the<00:05:46.180> circuit<00:05:46.479> so<00:05:46.630> then<00:05:46.810> we've<00:05:46.960> got<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.410> these

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
the circuit so then we've got the these

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.830 
the circuit so then we've got the these
blocks<00:05:48.520> here<00:05:48.850> that<00:05:49.030> are<00:05:49.120> being<00:05:49.240> powered<00:05:49.810> by

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
blocks here that are being powered by

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.590 
blocks here that are being powered by
the<00:05:50.139> repeaters<00:05:50.830> which<00:05:51.280> then<00:05:51.580> power<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.419> note

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
the repeaters which then power the note

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.110 
the repeaters which then power the note
blocks<00:05:52.810> on<00:05:52.990> top<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.380> on<00:05:54.100> either<00:05:54.310> side<00:05:54.729> because

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
blocks on top and on either side because

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.450 
blocks on top and on either side because
then<00:05:55.449> they<00:05:55.600> power<00:05:55.810> these<00:05:56.020> repeaters<00:05:56.410> so<00:05:57.310> that

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
then they power these repeaters so that

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.270 
then they power these repeaters so that
goes<00:05:57.639> through<00:05:57.910> here<00:05:58.090> parcel<00:05:58.510> three<00:05:58.750> then

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 
goes through here parcel three then

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.740 
goes through here parcel three then
obviously<00:06:00.280> we<00:06:00.520> don't<00:06:00.760> only<00:06:00.940> alarm<00:06:01.210> Sun<00:06:01.510> once

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
obviously we don't only alarm Sun once

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.590 
obviously we don't only alarm Sun once
because<00:06:02.050> that's<00:06:02.229> just<00:06:02.380> useless<00:06:03.090> so<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.389> goes

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
because that's just useless so it goes

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.860 
because that's just useless so it goes
around<00:06:04.780> here<00:06:05.229> in<00:06:05.470> a<00:06:05.620> clock<00:06:06.160> and<00:06:06.660> I'll<00:06:07.660> keep

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
around here in a clock and I'll keep

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.020 
around here in a clock and I'll keep
going<00:06:08.050> round<00:06:08.260> and<00:06:08.650> round<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:09.310> round<00:06:09.400> round

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
going round and round and round round

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.460 
going round and round and round round
and<00:06:12.479> yeah<00:06:13.479> we'll<00:06:13.660> keep<00:06:13.810> going<00:06:13.990> round<00:06:14.320> and

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
and yeah we'll keep going round and

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.219 
and yeah we'll keep going round and
round<00:06:14.620> until<00:06:15.100> you<00:06:15.910> press<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.510> reset<00:06:17.169> button

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229 
round until you press the reset button

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.030 
round until you press the reset button
up<00:06:18.100> sale<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:18.820> can<00:06:19.000> see<00:06:19.210> Ellie<00:06:19.389> set<00:06:19.600> alarm<00:06:20.040> and

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
up sale you can see Ellie set alarm and

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.950 
up sale you can see Ellie set alarm and
what<00:06:21.220> that<00:06:21.370> is<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.820> current<00:06:22.210> travels<00:06:22.419> down<00:06:22.780> on

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
what that is the current travels down on

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.350 
what that is the current travels down on
this<00:06:23.169> little<00:06:23.440> staircase<00:06:23.830> here<00:06:24.250> and<00:06:24.490> goes<00:06:25.120> into

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
this little staircase here and goes into

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.110 
this little staircase here and goes into
this<00:06:25.600> pulse<00:06:26.110> lengthen<00:06:27.010> ER<00:06:27.100> so<00:06:27.850> this<00:06:28.000> will

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
this pulse lengthen ER so this will

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.690 
this pulse lengthen ER so this will
lengthen<00:06:28.300> the<00:06:28.630> pulse<00:06:28.870> enough<00:06:29.680> so<00:06:30.430> that<00:06:30.460> this

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:30.700 
lengthen the pulse enough so that this

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.700 
lengthen the pulse enough so that this
piston<00:06:31.150> stays<00:06:31.389> extended<00:06:31.539> so<00:06:32.110> it<00:06:32.260> covers<00:06:32.470> this

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
piston stays extended so it covers this

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.379 
piston stays extended so it covers this
so<00:06:32.979> if<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.190> current<00:06:33.550> is<00:06:33.639> still<00:06:33.910> Midway

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:34.389 
so if the current is still Midway

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:35.909 
so if the current is still Midway
traveling<00:06:34.840> through<00:06:35.080> here<00:06:35.289> it's<00:06:35.380> like<00:06:35.530> no<00:06:35.740> no

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
traveling through here it's like no no

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.520 
traveling through here it's like no no
no<00:06:35.949> no<00:06:36.100> no<00:06:36.340> this<00:06:37.120> pistol<00:06:37.600> will<00:06:37.720> still<00:06:38.289> be

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
no no no this pistol will still be

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.610 
no no no this pistol will still be
extended<00:06:39.070> because<00:06:39.310> of<00:06:39.850> that<00:06:40.180> pulse<00:06:40.620> extender

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
extended because of that pulse extender

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.190 
extended because of that pulse extender
means<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:42.700> pulse<00:06:42.910> goes<00:06:43.240> on<00:06:43.450> for<00:06:43.660> a<00:06:43.690> longer<00:06:43.900> one

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
means the pulse goes on for a longer one

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.680 
means the pulse goes on for a longer one
so<00:06:45.039> that<00:06:45.400> blocks<00:06:45.700> it<00:06:45.850> off<00:06:45.970> then<00:06:46.240> the<00:06:46.330> current

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
so that blocks it off then the current

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.409 
so that blocks it off then the current
runs<00:06:46.990> out<00:06:47.229> because<00:06:47.560> it<00:06:47.680> has<00:06:47.830> nowhere<00:06:48.160> to<00:06:48.310> go

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
runs out because it has nowhere to go

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.379 
runs out because it has nowhere to go
therefore<00:06:49.419> the<00:06:49.510> alarm<00:06:49.780> is<00:06:49.990> then<00:06:50.350> reset<00:06:50.950> a

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:51.389 
therefore the alarm is then reset a

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:53.790 
therefore the alarm is then reset a
voila<00:06:52.389> Madame<00:06:52.780> Z<00:06:53.050> miss<00:06:53.200> your<00:06:53.380> ladies<00:06:53.650> and

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
nick of time and i'm pretty sure unless

you do very very accurately there is no
way<00:07:15.400> possible<00:07:15.430> that<00:07:15.820> that<00:07:16.030> pulse<00:07:16.300> will<00:07:16.510> stay

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
way possible that that pulse will stay

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.219 
way possible that that pulse will stay
der<00:07:16.810> and<00:07:17.310> then<00:07:18.310> once<00:07:18.550> again<00:07:18.880> i<00:07:19.120> was<00:07:19.840> switch<00:07:20.050> the
