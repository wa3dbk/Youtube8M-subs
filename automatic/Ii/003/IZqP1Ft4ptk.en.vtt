00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
would tend attack from there that are

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.770 
would tend attack from there that are
left<00:00:44.629> corner<00:00:45.399> and<00:00:46.399> I<00:00:46.850> don't<00:00:47.000> care<00:00:47.149> where<00:00:47.750> you

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
left corner and I don't care where you

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.319 
left corner and I don't care where you
place<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.260> traps<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.800> don't<00:00:49.699> really<00:00:49.879> find<00:00:50.120> it

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
place the traps I don't really find it

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.410 
place the traps I don't really find it
that<00:00:51.020> important<00:00:51.530> but<00:00:53.019> if<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.800> really<00:00:55.010> find<00:00:55.879> my

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
that important but if you really find my

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.650 
that important but if you really find my
place<00:00:56.660> when<00:00:56.809> traps<00:00:57.050> bad<00:00:57.230> and<00:00:57.500> change<00:00:57.829> them<00:00:58.010> up

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
place when traps bad and change them up

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.619 
place when traps bad and change them up
okay<00:00:59.660> now<00:00:59.870> um<00:01:00.219> my<00:01:01.219> place<00:01:01.910> is<00:01:02.210> based<00:01:02.449> on

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
okay now um my place is based on

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.150 
okay now um my place is based on
compactness<00:01:03.350> and<00:01:03.649> what<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:03.920> mean<00:01:04.100> by

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
compactness and what I mean by

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.710 
compactness and what I mean by
compactness<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.520> if<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:08.299> guy<00:01:08.540> right

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
compactness is that if that guy right

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.190 
compactness is that if that guy right
there<00:01:08.780> gets<00:01:09.110> tacked<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.250> Archer<00:01:10.580> tower<00:01:10.759> I

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
there gets tacked that Archer tower I

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.710 
there gets tacked that Archer tower I
have<00:01:12.200> other<00:01:12.470> guys<00:01:12.770> packing<00:01:13.250> it<00:01:13.340> up<00:01:13.430> like<00:01:13.759> see

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
have other guys packing it up like see

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.920 
have other guys packing it up like see
it<00:01:15.020> just<00:01:15.770> right<00:01:16.189> there<00:01:16.430> perfectly<00:01:16.880> place<00:01:17.240> so

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
it just right there perfectly place so

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.830 
it just right there perfectly place so
that<00:01:18.049> cannon<00:01:18.740> would<00:01:18.950> have<00:01:19.070> gotten<00:01:19.490> up<00:01:19.840> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
that cannon would have gotten up the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.950 
that cannon would have gotten up the
troops<00:01:21.049> out<00:01:21.290> with<00:01:21.470> an<00:01:21.590> attacking<00:01:21.890> larger<00:01:22.310> town

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
troops out with an attacking larger town

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.999 
troops out with an attacking larger town
so<00:01:23.960> if<00:01:24.259> was<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.250> setup<00:01:25.540> if<00:01:26.540> one<00:01:26.869> guy<00:01:27.110> gets

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
so if was this setup if one guy gets

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.740 
so if was this setup if one guy gets
attacked<00:01:28.900> technically<00:01:29.900> five<00:01:30.110> other<00:01:30.320> guys<00:01:30.549> is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
attacked technically five other guys is

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.240 
attacked technically five other guys is
yeah<00:01:32.750> you<00:01:32.810> guys<00:01:33.409> know<00:01:33.590> what<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.740> me<00:01:33.890> right<00:01:34.100> here

yeah you guys know what a me right here

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.510 
yeah you guys know what a me right here
it's<00:01:34.970> like<00:01:35.119> Hydra<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.930> caught<00:01:36.110> 102<00:01:36.829> others<00:01:36.979> oh

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.880 

yeah<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.820> we<00:01:41.509> might<00:01:41.689> not<00:01:41.869> know<00:01:42.229> what<00:01:42.350> those

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890

actually I think most people attack from

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.289 
actually I think most people attack from
that<00:01:49.070> line<00:01:49.219> with<00:01:49.399> corner<00:01:49.670> because<00:01:50.180> my

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
that line with corner because my

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.469 
that line with corner because my
