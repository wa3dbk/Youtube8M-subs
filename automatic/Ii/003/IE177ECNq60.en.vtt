entire head took a really long time but

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.060 
entire head took a really long time but
here<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.480> is<00:00:22.599> the<00:00:22.840> more<00:00:23.080> I<00:00:23.109> stare<00:00:23.380> at<00:00:23.650> it<00:00:23.679> the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070

more<00:00:24.250> like<00:00:24.519> it<00:00:24.730> at<00:00:24.910> first<00:00:25.060> I<00:00:25.300> thought<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:25.539> looked

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
more like it at first I thought I looked

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.779 
more like it at first I thought I looked
like<00:00:25.890> Raggedy<00:00:26.890> Ann<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.710> I'm<00:00:29.980> starting<00:00:30.759> to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
like Raggedy Ann but I'm starting to

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.510 
like Raggedy Ann but I'm starting to
grow<00:00:30.939> on<00:00:31.029> me

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
grow on me

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450 
grow on me
so<00:00:33.520> I'll<00:00:33.940> do<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.270> spin<00:00:34.600> around<00:00:34.630> so<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.140> can<00:00:35.320> see

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
so I'll do it spin around so you can see

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:47.349 
so I'll do it spin around so you can see
what<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.610> inside<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.239> place

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.130 

so<00:00:47.929> that's<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:49.300> some<00:00:50.300> pros<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.600> some<00:00:51.079> cons

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
so that's it some pros and some cons

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.399 
so that's it some pros and some cons

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
when I went to the back I noticed that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.210 
when I went to the back I noticed that
my<00:01:20.299> moods<00:01:20.569> weren't<00:01:20.840> as<00:01:20.990> tight<00:01:21.229> as<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.619> usually

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
my moods weren't as tight as I usually

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.490 
my moods weren't as tight as I usually
have<00:01:22.429> them<00:01:22.670> when<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:22.940> retwist<00:01:23.539> they<00:01:24.289> look

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
have them when I retwist they look

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.460 
have them when I retwist they look
they're<00:01:24.649> coming<00:01:25.039> they're<00:01:25.250> really<00:01:25.520> loose

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
they're coming they're really loose

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.160 
they're coming they're really loose
I<00:01:27.500> don't<00:01:28.490> usually<00:01:28.640> tend<00:01:29.299> to<00:01:29.420> keep<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.990> when<00:01:30.140> I

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
I don't usually tend to keep it when I

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.910 
I don't usually tend to keep it when I
retwist

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
retwist

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.120 
retwist
but<00:01:31.690> it's<00:01:32.690> really<00:01:33.140> really<00:01:33.319> loose<00:01:33.619> so<00:01:33.799> I'm<00:01:33.950> not

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
but it's really really loose so I'm not

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.800 
but it's really really loose so I'm not
sure<00:01:34.190> what<00:01:34.610> that's<00:01:34.759> going<00:01:35.030> to<00:01:35.090> look<00:01:35.209> like<00:01:35.420> when

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
sure what that's going to look like when

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.120 
sure what that's going to look like when
I<00:01:35.840> take<00:01:36.110> them<00:01:36.289> down<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:36.709> I'm<00:01:36.799> not<00:01:36.950> so

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
I take them down but I'm not so

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.559 
I take them down but I'm not so
concerned<00:01:37.369> about<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.970> because<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.270> don't<00:01:38.330> we

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
concerned about that because I don't we

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:41.080 
concerned about that because I don't we
twist<00:01:38.899> that<00:01:39.080> often<00:01:39.440> anyways<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.729> mean<00:01:41.000> I

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
twist that often anyways but I mean I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.059 
twist that often anyways but I mean I
just<00:01:41.299> took<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.810> time<00:01:42.020> off<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.380> retwist<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:42.920> was

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
just took the time off to retwist I was

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.499 
just took the time off to retwist I was
hoping<00:01:43.340> everything<00:01:43.670> would<00:01:43.819> still<00:01:44.119> be<00:01:44.240> tight

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
hoping everything would still be tight

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.010 
hoping everything would still be tight
but<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:45.830> he<00:01:46.100> living<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:46.459> there

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
but it's okay he living in there

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.350 
but it's okay he living in there
so<00:01:48.020> another<00:01:48.860> thing<00:01:49.159> I'll<00:01:49.459> when<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.119> went<00:01:50.330> to

close<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.650> root<00:02:12.860> those<00:02:13.129> are<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.430> ones<00:02:13.610> that

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
close to root those are the ones that

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.280 
close to root those are the ones that
bother<00:02:14.030> me<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.480> ended<00:02:14.690> up<00:02:14.810> having<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.260> take

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290

if<00:02:50.630> I<00:02:50.750> visit<00:02:51.050> again<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.130> did<00:02:52.280> my<00:02:52.430> entire<00:02:52.730> head

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
if I visit again if I did my entire head

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.470 
if I visit again if I did my entire head
again

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
again

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.540 
again
I<00:02:53.510> was<00:02:53.840> definitely<00:02:53.990> even<00:02:54.590> in<00:02:54.680> longer<00:02:55.010> than<00:02:55.160> so

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
I was definitely even in longer than so

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.870 
I was definitely even in longer than so
we<00:02:55.580> are<00:02:56.410> just<00:02:57.410> because<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:58.190> just<00:02:58.250> took<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.670> long

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
we are just because it just took a long

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.620 
we are just because it just took a long
time<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.210> do<00:02:59.680> but<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:01.010> think<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.270> I<00:03:02.360> want<00:03:02.480> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
time to do but I think that I want to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.240 
time to do but I think that I want to
try<00:03:02.840> this<00:03:02.900> style<00:03:03.380> again

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
try this style again

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.520 
try this style again
however<00:03:05.180> only<00:03:05.540> thing<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> was<00:03:05.990> differently<00:03:06.470> I

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
however only thing I was differently I

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.350 
however only thing I was differently I
was<00:03:06.830> probably<00:03:07.160> just<00:03:07.580> do<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.760> bang

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
was probably just do a bang

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.050 
was probably just do a bang
I've<00:03:08.630> always<00:03:08.840> wanted<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.350> bang<00:03:09.530> but<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.850> not

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
I've always wanted a bang but it's not

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.460 
I've always wanted a bang but it's not
so<00:03:11.240> sure<00:03:11.420> if<00:03:11.510> I'm<00:03:11.630> going<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:11.840> cut<00:03:12.020> it<00:03:12.140> because<00:03:12.230> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
so sure if I'm going to cut it because I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.100 
so sure if I'm going to cut it because I
do<00:03:12.530> get<00:03:12.770> irritated<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.640> want<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.660> pull<00:03:14.870> my<00:03:15.080> hair

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110

back<00:03:15.470> off<00:03:15.680> my<00:03:15.860> forehead<00:03:16.130> sometimes<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.209> put

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
back off my forehead sometimes and put

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:19.480 
back off my forehead sometimes and put
the<00:03:18.110> bang<00:03:18.290> I'm<00:03:18.590> afraid<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.160> won't<00:03:19.310> be<00:03:19.459> able

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
the bang I'm afraid that I won't be able

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.100 
the bang I'm afraid that I won't be able
to<00:03:19.760> do<00:03:19.850> that<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:23.060> will<00:03:23.240> be<00:03:23.360> my<00:03:23.540> full<00:03:23.840> bang
