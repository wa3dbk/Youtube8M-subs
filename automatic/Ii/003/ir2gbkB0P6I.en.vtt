day<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> day<00:01:05.700> lives<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.530> ended<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.590> creating<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
day to day lives I ended up creating a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.760 
day to day lives I ended up creating a
100<00:01:08.610> page<00:01:08.820> magazine<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.290> designed

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
100 page magazine so I actually designed

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
100 page magazine so I actually designed
the<00:01:10.890> layout<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> whole<00:01:11.490> thing<00:01:11.760> including

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the layout of the whole thing including

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690 
the layout of the whole thing including
imagery<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.770> graphic<00:01:14.280> layout<00:01:14.430> as

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
imagery and you know graphic layout as

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.969 
imagery and you know graphic layout as
well<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.180> basically<00:01:15.780> writing<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.530> entirety

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
well as basically writing the entirety

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.340 
well as basically writing the entirety
of<00:01:17.009> all<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.060> research<00:01:18.390> into<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.320> was

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
of all of my research into it there was

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
of all of my research into it there was
this<00:01:19.830> gap<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.490> knowledge<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.509> industry

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this gap of knowledge in the industry

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 
this gap of knowledge in the industry
and<00:01:22.170> somehow<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.310> was<00:01:23.520> able<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.820> fill<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> with

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
and somehow I was able to fill it with

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.370 
and somehow I was able to fill it with
new<00:01:24.659> information
