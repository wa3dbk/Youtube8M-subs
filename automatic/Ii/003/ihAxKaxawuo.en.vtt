 two 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 hi my dear fashionistas 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.000
 the pool has been standing for weeks 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.880
 and well my hair was dry and without 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.430
 thankfully I know a 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.470
 moisturizing treatment based on honey 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.410
 bee and olive oil which 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.660
 I will show in this video starts with 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.359
 look for an empty container where you can 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.039
 make your mix in case you get over 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.010
 you can save them take any 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.470
 conditioner that you have at home I go 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.670
 to use this one that I have based on 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.200
 almonds adds a generous portion 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.600
 I will also add an envelope of 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.149
 repair mask which is optional 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.289
 can use any product that 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.719
 have in your house 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.270
 apart in my house I had oil of 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.699
 Shea so I put a few drops on my 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.670
 mix you can also put oil 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.640
 almonds if you have now add the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.430

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.079
 one tablespoon of olive oil and one 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.079
 spoonful of honey 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.060
 preferably aluminum if you do not have 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.430
 and wait about 20 minutes before washing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.280

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.610

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.340

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.619
 treatment 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.240
