sleight of hand pro is that I can reload
faster<00:00:27.539> because<00:00:27.990> usually<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.560> die<00:00:28.680> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
faster because usually when I die it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.800 
faster because usually when I die it's
when<00:00:29.640> someone<00:00:30.000> catches<00:00:30.390> me<00:00:30.539> while<00:00:30.689> I'm

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
when someone catches me while I'm

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100 
when someone catches me while I'm
reloading<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.730> use<00:00:32.730> assassin<00:00:33.329> because<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.050> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
reloading I use assassin because it's a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.479 
reloading I use assassin because it's a
big<00:00:34.290> help<00:00:34.530> when<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.010> show<00:00:35.070> up<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
big help when you don't show up on the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.389 
big help when you don't show up on the
map<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.739> pointless<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
map and it's kind of pointless if you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.190 
map and it's kind of pointless if you
use<00:00:38.489> assassin<00:00:39.000> without<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.300> silencer<00:00:39.840> because

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
use assassin without a silencer because

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
use assassin without a silencer because
you<00:00:41.129> still<00:00:41.370> show<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> map<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you still show up on the map from the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.479 
you still show up on the map from the
shoot<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> that's<00:00:43.920> why<00:00:44.040> I'm<00:00:44.100> rocking<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
shoot so that's why I'm rocking the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.020 
shoot so that's why I'm rocking the
silencer<00:00:46.100> dead<00:00:47.100> silence<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.879> using
