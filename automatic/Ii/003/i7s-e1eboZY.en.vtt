00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone accompanying my channel 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.940
 In this video I will evaluate the speed 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:15.839
 that the moto x has in capturing the signal of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 GPS right offline mode that is using 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.039
 only the internal antenna of the unit without 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 assisted connection in the GPS call to 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.439
 this test is just the device 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 it turns off, right? 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.040
 and you will follow from the beginning 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.790
 even taking a speed test 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:46.440
 boot is this test or curiosity 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.140
 is an item you do not find easy on 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 Internet, but the device is just 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.300
 released when buying the device 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 Staff says that this has gps in the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.829
 another is not always as effective and this 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 video to demonstrate what the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 motorcycle x behavior 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.820
 as you can see has no network 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.729
 Data is activated active now is the antenor 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.299
 gps and the program to make the connection 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.200
 that gps test 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 reminding me that I am in an environment 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.610
 closed're not'm in an open environment 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.600
 and would facilitate a little more in the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.729
 bill of the signal 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.549
 even in this condition 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.549
 Let's see how he behaves. 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 ready you already got the satellite signal 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:50.280
 same environment that is annoying 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:54.090
 he was fast very fast and how are you 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.810
 can see up here that demonstrates it 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.520
 how many meters does it have for accuracy 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:07.729
 here in case it was 3 meters I hope to have 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.729
 cooperated there a total hug
