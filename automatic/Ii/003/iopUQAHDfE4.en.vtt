00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:42.290
 millimeter 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:48.320

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:52.860
 that's when you beat him already need him 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:59.309
 cut out this look like this jigsaw and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 I still have 6th grade 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.550
 long process i won't shoot right away 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.550
 I will come to business 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.220
 also need to cut out just such 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 the part is the knife handle itself 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 she will be used to return 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:25.650
 such details we need near that 1 so 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:32.460
 we should have a pacifier 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:35.850
 here it is ceramica and we will also have 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.090
 such here are these details with you 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 hilt then we take glue second well 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:53.000
 or whatever you want you can take a moment on 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:55.920
 to the tree and attach like this and 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.939
 glue and your that was us right you 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.320
 this is not very comfortable until we 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:07.350
 it is not from skuri shit ordinary 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.759
 sandpaper that was not here in all saw 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:15.799

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.879
 after we have his skin on my 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:24.319
 the picture shows that there are such slots 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:25.610
 as if for the fingers we make ordinary 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:35.569
 round file 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:38.359
 so there is a lot to be fingers 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.819
 it was more convenient to hold anything about painting 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:45.049
