00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.880 
so to do that both of these switches are
now<00:02:24.580> down<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.250> we<00:02:28.000> have<00:02:28.210> to<00:02:28.360> move<00:02:28.710> this<00:02:29.710> switch

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
now down and we have to move this switch

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.020 
now down and we have to move this switch
up<00:02:31.620> which<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.800> our<00:02:32.950> flight<00:02:33.160> mode<00:02:33.430> switch<00:02:33.760> move

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
up which is our flight mode switch move

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.800 
up which is our flight mode switch move
that<00:02:34.240> switch<00:02:34.510> up<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:37.240> hold

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that switch up like that and then hold

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.030 
that switch up like that and then hold
this<00:02:38.110> stick<00:02:39.030> either<00:02:40.030> right<00:02:40.540> or<00:02:40.810> left<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.650> also

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
this stick either right or left and also

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.210 
this stick either right or left and also
down<00:02:42.340> now<00:02:42.790> this<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.120> mode<00:02:43.360> 2<00:02:43.630> radio<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:45.160> I'm

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
down now this is mode 2 radio so I'm

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.640 
down now this is mode 2 radio so I'm
just<00:02:45.400> holding<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.450> down<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.140> left<00:02:47.260> I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
just holding it down and to the left I

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.040 
just holding it down and to the left I
could<00:02:47.830> go<00:02:48.010> down<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.520> to<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.640> right<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.440> then

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
could go down and to the right and then

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.710 
could go down and to the right and then
okay<00:02:53.400> there's<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.580> problem<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.209> motor<00:02:55.450> is

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
okay there's the problem the motor is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.130 
okay there's the problem the motor is
now<00:02:55.930> running<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.910> we<00:02:58.030> are<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.420> program<00:02:58.900> mode

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
now running but we are in program mode

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.890 
now running but we are in program mode
as<00:02:59.830> you<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.250> see<00:03:00.430> there<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.940> what<00:03:01.510> we<00:03:01.630> have<00:03:01.780> to

as you can see there so what we have to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.740 
as you can see there so what we have to
do<00:03:02.020> is<00:03:02.170> fix<00:03:02.380> that<00:03:02.620> problem<00:03:03.209> okay<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.270> here's

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
the same problem with the throttle

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.000 
the same problem with the throttle
running<00:03:07.480> all<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> time<00:03:07.930> in<00:03:08.110> program<00:03:08.470> mode<00:03:08.680> but

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
running all the time in program mode but

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.990 
running all the time in program mode but
we're<00:03:09.190> using<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.640> DX<00:03:10.090> 7f<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:11.080> time<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:12.000> this

I'm gonna hold that down and to the

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.230 
I'm gonna hold that down and to the
right<00:04:22.260> or<00:04:22.740> lift<00:04:23.130> doesn't<00:04:23.310> matter<00:04:23.610> I'm<00:04:23.910> just

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
right or lift doesn't matter I'm just

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.090 
right or lift doesn't matter I'm just
gonna<00:04:24.330> go<00:04:24.510> right<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:25.410> hold<00:04:25.590> it<00:04:25.710> for<00:04:25.830> six

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
gonna go right and hold it for six

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.420 
gonna go right and hold it for six
seconds<00:04:27.200> when<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.380> happens<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.070> screen

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
seconds when that happens the screen

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.600 
seconds when that happens the screen
should<00:04:29.910> go<00:04:30.870> to<00:04:30.990> programming<00:04:31.440> mode<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.430> now

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
should go to programming mode and now

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.640 
should go to programming mode and now
the<00:04:32.670> motor<00:04:33.210> runs<00:04:33.600> all<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.050> time<00:04:34.260> just<00:04:34.290> like

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
the motor runs all the time just like

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.260 
the motor runs all the time just like
before<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:37.920> diff<00:04:38.070> motor<00:04:38.370> is<00:04:38.610> running<00:04:38.790> all<00:04:39.090> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
before the diff motor is running all the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.140 
before the diff motor is running all the
time<00:04:39.450> and<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.860> only<00:04:41.010> way<00:04:41.190> to<00:04:41.250> stop<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.820> is<00:04:41.910> just

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
time and the only way to stop it is just

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.290 
time and the only way to stop it is just
unplug<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.900> batteries<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.210> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
unplug the batteries and that is the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.939

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:06.859 
it with a trained us we've done it with
the<00:05:03.959> dx7<00:05:04.589> and<00:05:05.039> both<00:05:05.819> radios<00:05:06.299> do<00:05:06.479> the<00:05:06.629> same

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:06.869 
the dx7 and both radios do the same

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:08.809 
the dx7 and both radios do the same
thing<00:05:07.259> so<00:05:07.559> we<00:05:07.589> just<00:05:07.889> need<00:05:08.069> to<00:05:08.219> know<00:05:08.339> how<00:05:08.579> to<00:05:08.609> get
