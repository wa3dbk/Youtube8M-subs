00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
straight was much faster and I had to

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.230 
straight was much faster and I had to
staff<00:03:34.300> just<00:03:34.930> for<00:03:35.170> summoning<00:03:35.500> Adrian<00:03:36.240> because

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
staff just for summoning Adrian because

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.090 
staff just for summoning Adrian because
when<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.480> do<00:03:37.600> it<00:03:37.690> with<00:03:37.780> a<00:03:37.810> bow<00:03:38.050> it's<00:03:38.260> really

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
when you do it with a bow it's really

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.430 
when you do it with a bow it's really
really<00:03:39.520> slow

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.170 

it's<00:03:44.040> funny<00:03:44.220> because<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.580> have<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.730> staff<00:03:45.000> on

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
it's funny because I have a staff on

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.080 
it's funny because I have a staff on
switching<00:03:45.630> didn't<00:03:45.900> seem<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.200> be<00:03:46.320> much<00:03:46.350> faster

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
switching didn't seem to be much faster

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.420 
switching didn't seem to be much faster
not<00:03:48.090> funny<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.750> we're<00:03:49.350> pointing<00:03:49.890> out

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.000 

that<00:03:55.909> looked<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.329> lag<00:03:56.569> spike<00:03:56.870> but<00:03:57.170> I<00:03:57.349> am<00:03:57.590> no

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
that looked like a lag spike but I am no

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.520 
that looked like a lag spike but I am no
idea

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.540
