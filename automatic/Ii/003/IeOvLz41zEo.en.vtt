00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and well this world is moving spock so 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.069
 I hope you are well apart for 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.779
 it's going very well 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.760
 and today I will explain 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.840
 how to make a good effort and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.460
 win every time 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 so obviously to make buzz 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.500
 attack is to make a support a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.020
 maximum resources and explain to you 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
 how to choose a good village with 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.859
 a lot of resources to be able to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.550
 brakes the resources accessible very 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 easily for your level and how 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.529
 to make minimum of 50% or take loose 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 beginning then you make three 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.190
 gorgeous four gorgeous attack 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.329
 which is a good taste really very very 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.590
 beautiful egg and a more than 250 cases of 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.750
 150000 each of ours where I do little 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.489
 nearly 2300 black voters 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.930
 and I could have much more of 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 experts and gold but I did not have 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.590
 a lot of troops and a third 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.960
 stopped the fourth set at war 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.219
 of clans or it's really a big 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.210
 carnage to the pig and that's it I find 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 that she is really very magnetic 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.280
 so then already the questions and the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 criteria for taking a good village 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.960
 therefore already a village in and defenses 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.280
 that you can beat easily because 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.630
 that this video is based instead on the 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.070
 people who live and have a parent at 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.009
 level 1 of clash of plant since otherwise 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.229
 they know how to play so here I am you 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.820
 explain how to succeed these attacks to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 all the shots and in any case do of 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 nice attacks and succeed them all 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.470
 the costs of which already must be taken 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.079
 village with a lot of resources to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.210
 not too powerful defenses 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:37.079
 then take a village with 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.630
 things buildings be it 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.909
 mining extractors from the camps 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.619
 military barracks etc which are at 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.880
 outside the ramparts that are not 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.380
 protected presents the village x does 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.850
 will not walk since everything is protected where 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.259
 almost everything is protected from the island 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.049
 to make 50% it's very complicated 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.540
 so here we go take a village with 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.930
 so some things that are not 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.880
 protected on the sides then we go 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.430
 take the village with resources 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.259
 which a lot of resources for me 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.020
 one month my selection criterion is 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.850
 really 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.490
 two hundred thousand one hundred and seventy thousand 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.950
 roughly below 150 cities this is 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.090
 really useless I do not attack if apart 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.530
 if they are really very very very 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.710
 easy to take but otherwise I attack 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.300
 to 200,000 full time here 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.680
 we are going to attack a village with a lot 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.000
 resources and who are good 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.600
 obviously easy to take 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.640
 so either you are lucky and the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.220
 hedges and reserves of gold and elixir 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.980
 and dx black hours are on the sides 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.460
 from the village so they are very simple 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.940
 to take care of all the resources 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.560
 are in the extractors and mines 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.160
 and in those cases it's even more 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.680
 simple to take 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.050
 so you have to know that if the extractors 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.150
 and the mines are full we can loot 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.130
 more than if the tanks and is where 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.800
 she wandered to have its ereaders 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.010
 plan for example I say that space was 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.790
 very well finally if it's very very 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.510
 simple to understand 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.100
 for example in a mine level 11 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.180
 we can have a hundred thousand I believe that 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.520
 that's it I'm not sure but I 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.190
 accompanied 5 million so imagine 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.020
 that all the reasons and the gold mines 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.700
 are full and that we assimilate in 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.130
 each and well we can pay more we will 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.270
 to say that we can plunder 70000 thursday a 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.550
 little anything i'm really not 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.400
 sure but that's to explain one can 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.600
 pay 70 miles into a mine while 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.270
 if the gold tank is full so 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.850
 there can be a million is good for 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.800
 support that one hundred thousand or even two bones in 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.360
 line in each 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.040
 so we can pay more if the 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.540
 extractors and the 1000's are full 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.160
 wants to attack him inactive villages 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.180
 since that means that the kind the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.980
 people have not picked up is what they 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.050
 had in the tank x and gold 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.990
 in their register author of easy rider 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.400
 sorry I want nothing so here you go 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.040
 crowd attacked villages in rivka and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.160
 with arches and we break all good 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.830
 that's how it is so I'm actually 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.940
 best troops to attack 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.880
 this type of village 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.100
 it's going to be archers and barbarians 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.370
 so for my part I attack with 200 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.340
 archers on the 25th 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.620
 you can of course attacked with 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.120
 barbarians and archers and even 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.039
 even goblins for the fastest 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.440
 but I personally prefer 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.160
 attack with oneself archers scarf at 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.630
 barbaric archers because he had 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.970
 goblins the prof of the goblins is that 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.440
 as long as there are resources to 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.639
 learn 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.990
 no matter what hole the ramparts 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.020
 complained for her are in the middle of the 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.759
 village and that there is only one 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.050
 the goblins will go back to 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.520
 resources and will not go to a 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.449
 for example I have no huts or ddd 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.729
 barracks to do the 50% so 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.220
 while archers and barbarians 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.720
 will go to the huts where the 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.910
 barracks for fall of 50% 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.710
 so it's better to make archers and 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.160
 barbarians to reach 2 50% not to 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.320
 lose too much done so I'm attacking with 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.630
 200 archers and I will attack with 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.599
 arches and finally age to pose archers there 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.970
 where he was going to connect extractor and 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.919
 the gold mines that are full excuse 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.449
 me if one day he needs it so we go 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.909
 to make a child in a coiled circuit 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.650
 village to take everything there is 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.229
 in the air and in the caterers and 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.990
 in the mines and break everything he 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.789
 are around the village that is not 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.680
 protected by ramparts such as 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.210
 barracks of workers' huts 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.870
 tara military bodies to reach the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.449
 50% 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.400
 if you have gold mines and 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.110
 extractors that are protected by 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.449
 ramparts it's the best technique 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.279
 it's about making archers to be able to 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.930
 save time and break 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.159
 that a lot of little things that are 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.219
 last rampart but who are really 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.569
 very accessible by the markets so a 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:53.999
 once we have laid all the 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.800
 archers like these archers in 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.539
 are going are going to break everything there is 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.189
 on their way and since the 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.909
 extractors at the mines are the things 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:03.949
 the least protected we will say of the game of 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.819
 relay resources they protected me 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.770
 if they are hardly in fact you're going 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.409
 really make you one of the norms 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.539
 and so you will tighten 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.849
 archives have tightened we 've broken everything 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.099
 who to anything that is not protected by 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.870
 the ramparts and so here you go 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.969
 you need a lot of money 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.509
 know that if you are a hdv 7 and 15 pm 

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:26.909
 v8s at all hours strata and 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:30.749
 the full mines you can pay to 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:33.330
 total 350 miles it's pretty huge on 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:35.810
 a hdv 8 1 hr tours on a hdv 7 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.370
 you pay 250 1300 lines pretty much 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.990
 so here you know very well that more 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.490
 you loot one by one 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.279
 someone who is stronger than you 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.909
 the more you will come to win a lot 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:49.409
 many more happy resources 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.419
 so here it is really very very well 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.729
 as a technique sometimes you have to wait 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.919
 very long before you can find 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:00.180
 a village that is inactive with the 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:02.279
 extractors and the hymn full but it gets 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.979
 find pretty quickly it takes crazy 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.360
 you have to persevere false false 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:08.039
 to be patient but that's the end is 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.229
 really well paid and I can tell you 

00:07:08.039 --> 00:07:12.569
 that it's really a pleasure to 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:14.550
 half an hour have no honor at all 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:15.779
 nearly an hour to get 500 miles 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.180
 gold and 500 military 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:19.770
 it's really very good in everything 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.139
 case I love this technique so 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.849
 here I repeat it must be done 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.860
 sometimes you are in villages with 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:27.569
 a lot of buildings outside of 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.080
 ramparts to reach the 50% 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:33.930
 easily and attacked villages where 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.669
 all resources are either very 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.430
 close to the edge and therefore very accessible 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.499
 either everything in the extractors and in 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.300
 mines to make a maximum of wheat
