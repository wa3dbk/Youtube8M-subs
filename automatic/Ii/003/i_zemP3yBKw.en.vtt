00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399 
the flour until it makes bread crumbs

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.380 
the flour until it makes bread crumbs
and<00:00:29.329> you<00:00:30.050> must<00:00:30.320> use<00:00:30.470> strong<00:00:31.369> plain<00:00:31.640> flour<00:00:32.029> for

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
and you must use strong plain flour for

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.360 
and you must use strong plain flour for
this<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:32.899> because<00:00:33.559> obviously<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:34.070> want<00:00:34.250> the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
this and because obviously you want the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.360 
this and because obviously you want the
gluten<00:00:34.730> content<00:00:35.200> which<00:00:36.200> will<00:00:36.500> rise<00:00:36.800> up<00:00:37.100> and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
gluten content which will rise up and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.020 
gluten content which will rise up and
track<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:37.790> bubbles<00:00:38.260> from<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.410> yeast<00:00:39.560> so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
track the bubbles from the yeast so

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.490 
track the bubbles from the yeast so

Chloe East but just warm enough to get
it<00:01:29.820> activated<00:01:31.969> so<00:01:32.969> going<00:01:33.179> to<00:01:33.240> add<00:01:33.420> most<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it activated so going to add most of

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.929 
it activated so going to add most of
that<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.679> leaving<00:01:35.069> a<00:01:35.130> little<00:01:35.159> drop<00:01:35.700> back

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that just leaving a little drop back

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.350 
that just leaving a little drop back
just<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.420> case<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.780> need<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.939> then<00:01:38.939> get<00:01:39.270> your

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
just in case I need it then get your

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.340 
just in case I need it then get your
hands<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> bring<00:01:42.569> it<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.780> together<00:01:43.020> into

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
hands in and bring it all together into

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.499 
hands in and bring it all together into
a<00:01:43.439> softer<00:01:43.920> obviously<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.670> use<00:01:44.819> a<00:01:44.850> mixer

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
a softer obviously you can use a mixer

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.359 
a softer obviously you can use a mixer
for<00:01:45.539> this<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.959> you<00:01:46.079> prefer<00:01:46.469> they'll<00:01:47.069> be<00:01:47.189> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
for this if you prefer they'll be really

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.980 
for this if you prefer they'll be really
sticky<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.909> start<00:01:48.179> with<00:01:48.329> but<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.569> will<00:01:48.689> come

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
sticky to start with but it will come

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.179 
sticky to start with but it will come
together<00:01:50.630> all<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> need<00:01:52.110> more<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> will<00:01:52.979> come

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
together all you need more it will come

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.630 
together all you need more it will come
together<00:01:53.399> once<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.179> gets<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.569> this<00:01:54.720> stage

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
together once it gets to this stage

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.429 
together once it gets to this stage
probably<00:01:56.640> easier<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.329> just<00:01:57.659> tip<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.020> out<00:01:58.200> onto

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
probably easier to just tip it out onto

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.210 
probably easier to just tip it out onto
the<00:01:58.709> worktop<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.649> start<00:02:04.920> bringing

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
the worktop and you can start bringing

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.859 
the worktop and you can start bringing
it<00:02:05.520> together

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.790 

on<00:02:09.590> the<00:02:09.739> trick<00:02:10.009> with<00:02:10.160> kneading<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:12.590> gather

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
on the trick with kneading is to gather

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000 
on the trick with kneading is to gather
the<00:02:13.099> dough<00:02:13.340> into<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.330> ball<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:15.110> push<00:02:15.800> away

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
the dough into a ball and then push away

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.339 
the dough into a ball and then push away
with<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.610> palm<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.970> your<00:02:17.000> hands<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:17.660> gather

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
with the palm of your hands so gather

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.690 
with the palm of your hands so gather
and<00:02:18.739> push<00:02:19.569> gathered<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.750> push<00:02:21.430> gathered<00:02:22.430> push

and push gathered and push gathered push

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.690 
and push gathered and push gathered push
away<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:24.290> keep<00:02:24.500> doing<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:24.890> until<00:02:25.280> you've
