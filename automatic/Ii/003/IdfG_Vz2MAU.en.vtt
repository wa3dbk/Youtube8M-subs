hi this is a follow-up video and showing
from<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> installing<00:00:05.339> of<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:06.109> vortex<00:00:07.109> tower

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
from the installing of the vortex tower

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.780 
from the installing of the vortex tower
high-definition<00:00:08.340> digital<00:00:08.460> terrestrial

high-definition digital terrestrial
receiver<00:00:09.420> showing<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.440> how<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.559> actually

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
receiver showing you how to actually

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.740 
receiver showing you how to actually
tune<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> channels<00:00:11.880> onto<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> box<00:00:12.420> itself

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
tune in the channels onto the box itself

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.049 
tune in the channels onto the box itself
okay<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.650> basically<00:00:13.889> what<00:00:14.309> we<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.639> here<00:00:14.670> is

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
okay so basically what we have here is

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.849 
okay so basically what we have here is
and<00:00:15.299> when<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> install<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.470> box<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and when you install the box for the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730 
and when you install the box for the
first<00:00:16.890> time<00:00:17.279> by<00:00:17.900> default<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> installation

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
first time by default the installation

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.439 
first time by default the installation
guide<00:00:19.890> comes<00:00:20.250> up<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.490> top<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.850> screen<00:00:21.060> okay

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
guide comes up on top of the screen okay

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.029 
guide comes up on top of the screen okay
so<00:00:21.930> we've<00:00:22.080> got<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.470> different<00:00:22.740> options

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
so we've got you two different options

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.250 
so we've got you two different options
that<00:00:23.070> are<00:00:23.160> available<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.789> us<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:25.109> can

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
that are available to us here and we can

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.890 
that are available to us here and we can
see<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.760> OSD<00:00:26.760> language<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.689> wish

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
see that the OSD language that we wish

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.929 
see that the OSD language that we wish
to<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.140> English<00:00:28.680> that's<00:00:28.980> perfect<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
to have English that's perfect and the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.630 
to have English that's perfect and the
next<00:00:30.150> major<00:00:30.330> choice<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> contra<00:00:31.289> itself

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
next major choice is the contra itself

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
next major choice is the contra itself
around<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> default<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.110> some

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
around and is the default one for some

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.080 
around and is the default one for some
strange<00:00:34.710> region<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:35.940> good

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
strange region but it's actually as good

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.510 
strange region but it's actually as good
as<00:00:36.210> any<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.739> we<00:00:37.980> can<00:00:38.129> leave<00:00:38.399> it

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
as any and so we can we can leave it

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
as any and so we can we can leave it
chosen<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> Ireland's<00:00:39.600> not<00:00:39.780> on<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
chosen that that Ireland's not on the

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
chosen that that Ireland's not on the
list<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.530> gonna<00:00:40.710> come<00:00:40.890> down<00:00:41.040> along<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.520> I'm

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
list I'm gonna come down along then I'm

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.040 
list I'm gonna come down along then I'm
gonna<00:00:41.879> choose<00:00:42.059> channel<00:00:42.540> search<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> we

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
gonna choose channel search and we

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.440 
gonna choose channel search and we
couldn't<00:00:43.379> come<00:00:43.559> along<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.950> press<00:00:44.190> okay<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:45.329> if

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
couldn't come along on press okay so if

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.119 
couldn't come along on press okay so if
we<00:00:45.570> look<00:00:45.750> here<00:00:45.780> anyway<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
we look here anyway we can see it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.889 
we look here anyway we can see it
actually<00:00:47.219> kicks<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> end<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> VHF

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
actually kicks off in the end the VHF

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.920 
actually kicks off in the end the VHF
band<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> unnecessary<00:00:49.980> because

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
band which is unnecessary because

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
band which is unnecessary because
Ireland<00:00:51.930> only<00:00:52.020> broadcast<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> dtt<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
Ireland only broadcast in the dtt in the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.510 
Ireland only broadcast in the dtt in the
UHF<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.770> come<00:00:55.949> along<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.399> actually

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
UHF but if we come along we can actually

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
UHF but if we come along we can actually
skip<00:00:56.850> quite<00:00:57.090> quickly<00:00:57.329> forward<00:00:57.660> by<00:00:58.140> using<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
skip quite quickly forward by using the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
skip quite quickly forward by using the
menu<00:00:59.190> button<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> skip<00:00:59.969> forward<00:01:00.239> okay<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
menu button to skip forward okay it's a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
menu button to skip forward okay it's a
right-click<00:01:01.500> menu<00:01:02.190> button<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.239> skip

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
right-click menu button here we can skip

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.359 
right-click menu button here we can skip
forward<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.110> as<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> jump<00:01:04.619> massively

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
forward you know as a jump massively

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
forward you know as a jump massively
there<00:01:05.549> anyway<00:01:05.939> going<00:01:06.180> between<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.960> VHF

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
there anyway going between the you VHF

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
there anyway going between the you VHF
and<00:01:07.710> uhf<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.520> from<00:01:08.850> 200<00:01:09.180> something<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> four

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and uhf so from 200 something up to four

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.640 
and uhf so from 200 something up to four
at<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> foreign<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:11.900> I<00:01:12.900> think<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.439> 80

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
at the foreign and and I think it's 80

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.380 
at the foreign and and I think it's 80
or<00:01:13.860> something<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.060> we're<00:01:15.210> going

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
or something like this so if we're going

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.399 
or something like this so if we're going
through<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.049> see<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> rate

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
through this here you can see the rate

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.420 
through this here you can see the rate
we're<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.590> through<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
we're going through but if you

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
we're going through but if you
continuously<00:01:17.939> hit<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> menu<00:01:18.720> button<00:01:18.840> if

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
continuously hit the menu button if

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
continuously hit the menu button if
we're<00:01:19.619> passing<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:20.189> an<00:01:20.280> area<00:01:20.549> where<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.820> know

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
we're passing by an area where we know

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789 
we're passing by an area where we know
for<00:01:21.180> certain<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.600> frequencies<00:01:22.020> won't<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.409> we

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
for certain the frequencies won't be we

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.039 
for certain the frequencies won't be we
can<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.070> bypass<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.670> area<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.630> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
can just bypass this area so and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.600 
can just bypass this area so and
depending<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> country

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
depending on where we are in the country

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580 
depending on where we are in the country
and<00:01:27.240> which<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.570> local<00:01:27.840> transmitter<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> at

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and which your local transmitter is at

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.870 
and which your local transmitter is at
the<00:01:28.650> dependent<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> frequency<00:01:29.729> would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the dependent where the frequency would

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.140 
the dependent where the frequency would
be<00:01:29.970> actually<00:01:30.270> picked<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.820> wait<00:01:32.970> for

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
be actually picked up so just wait for

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.670 
be actually picked up so just wait for
this<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> proceed<00:01:33.600> ahead<00:01:33.750> where<00:01:34.500> we're

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
this to proceed ahead where we're

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.830 
this to proceed ahead where we're
speaking<00:01:34.860> right<00:01:35.040> now<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> transmit

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
speaking right now I have to transmit

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.499 
speaking right now I have to transmit
her<00:01:36.960> an<00:01:37.200> aerial<00:01:38.009> aiming<00:01:38.820> towards<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> pure

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
her an aerial aiming towards the pure

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.600 
her an aerial aiming towards the pure
but<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.259> I'm<00:01:40.619> able<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> pick<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.250> normally

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
but also I'm able to pick up normally

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850 
but also I'm able to pick up normally
signal<00:01:42.000> from<00:01:42.299> Mount<00:01:42.899> Lancer<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.470> exactly

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
signal from Mount Lancer what exactly

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.950 
signal from Mount Lancer what exactly
was<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.070> with<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.250> same<00:01:44.520> area<00:01:44.850> Paulito<00:01:45.659> 90

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
was it with the same area Paulito 90

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
was it with the same area Paulito 90
degrees<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> wrong<00:01:46.560> direction<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
degrees in the wrong direction but the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.550 
degrees in the wrong direction but the
dtt<00:01:47.909> signal<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> strong<00:01:48.930> that's<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
dtt signal is so strong that's a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
dtt signal is so strong that's a
relatively<00:01:49.950> common<00:01:50.220> problem<00:01:50.670> where<00:01:50.820> you

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
relatively common problem where you

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.190 
relatively common problem where you
accidentally<00:01:51.360> pick<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.720> from<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.960> number<00:01:52.170> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
accidentally pick up from a number of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.020 
accidentally pick up from a number of
different<00:01:52.560> transmitters<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> see

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
different transmitters so if you see

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
different transmitters so if you see
here<00:01:54.329> we<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.960> see<00:01:55.110> about<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> channel<00:01:55.860> list

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
here we can see about the channel list

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.249 
here we can see about the channel list
here<00:01:56.250> there's<00:01:56.490> seven<00:01:56.759> dtt<00:01:57.240> channels<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:58.020> T

this go and very end the lists are at

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.600 
this go and very end the lists are at
this<00:02:25.440> point<00:02:25.650> if<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.950> want<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.489> were

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
this point if you want that and you were

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.400 
this point if you want that and you were
confident<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.510> actually<00:02:27.660> hit<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.110> exit

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
confident you can actually hit the exit

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.350 
confident you can actually hit the exit
button<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.160> hit<00:02:29.280> exit<00:02:29.700> here<00:02:29.879> now<00:02:32.360> it's

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
button so just hit exit here now it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.150 
button so just hit exit here now it's
actually<00:02:33.629> save<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.989> now<00:02:34.379> your<00:02:34.739> tank<00:02:35.010> would

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
actually save this now your tank would

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.530 
actually save this now your tank would
say<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.459> going<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.670> have<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> duplicate<00:02:36.299> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
say you're going to have a duplicate and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.880 
say you're going to have a duplicate and
because<00:02:37.080> you've<00:02:37.200> tuned<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.590> from<00:02:37.709> two

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
because you've tuned in from two

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.619 
because you've tuned in from two
different<00:02:38.069> transmitter<00:02:38.549> but<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> very<00:02:39.330> very

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
different transmitter but a very very

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.320 
different transmitter but a very very
clever<00:02:39.870> feature<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.910> very<00:02:41.910> very<00:02:42.150> clever

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
clever feature a very very clever

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.440 
clever feature a very very clever
feature<00:02:42.690> of<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.739> box<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.000> chooses

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
feature of this box is that it chooses

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.390 
feature of this box is that it chooses
which<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> strongest<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.769> signal<00:02:47.250> and

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
which is the strongest and signal and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.729 
which is the strongest and signal and
deletes<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.090> owner<00:02:48.239> signal<00:02:48.660> okay<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.470> what<00:02:49.620> we

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
deletes the owner signal okay so what we

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.259 
deletes the owner signal okay so what we
actually<00:02:49.860> have<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.190> is<00:02:50.579> that<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:51.000> it's

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
actually have here is that it's it's

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.970 
actually have here is that it's it's
chosen<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.750> hang<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.019> to<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.260> pit<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.440> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
chosen to hang on to the pit and the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.860 
chosen to hang on to the pit and the
signal<00:02:53.310> coming<00:02:53.549> from<00:02:53.670> computer<00:02:54.239> 48

transmitter<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.680> okay<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.400> we<00:02:56.549> simply

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
transmitter is a and okay so we simply

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.289 
transmitter is a and okay so we simply
