00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
trees that are basically growing in the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.440 
trees that are basically growing in the
wild<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.410> they're<00:02:04.160> very<00:02:04.369> expensive<00:02:04.729> there

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
wild and they're very expensive there

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.440

are<00:02:05.630> four<00:02:06.399> black<00:02:07.399> walnuts<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.209> shell

are four black walnuts in the shell
they're<00:02:09.140> about<00:02:09.380> six<00:02:10.009> dollars<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.550> pound<00:02:11.739> so

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
they're about six dollars a pound so

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.870 
they're about six dollars a pound so
thinking<00:02:13.400> about<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:14.060> why<00:02:15.020> would<00:02:15.320> anybody

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
thinking about this why would anybody

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.310 
thinking about this why would anybody
come<00:02:16.880> walking<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.769> highway<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:21.080> come

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
come walking in from the highway to come

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.759 
come walking in from the highway to come
into<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.739> camp<00:02:22.540> next<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.720> mine<00:02:23.959> during<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
into a camp next to mine during the

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.720 
into a camp next to mine during the
night<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.540> leave<00:02:26.830> walnuts<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:28.040> our<00:02:28.430> black

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
night and leave walnuts on our black

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.240 
night and leave walnuts on our black
walnuts<00:02:29.180> on<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.900> pylons<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.650> stump<00:02:30.980> and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
walnuts on the the pylons and stump and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.560 
walnuts on the the pylons and stump and
then<00:02:32.209> walk<00:02:32.480> back<00:02:32.510> out<00:02:33.790> there's<00:02:34.790> no<00:02:35.000> way<00:02:35.239> they

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
then walk back out there's no way they

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.900 
then walk back out there's no way they
could<00:02:35.810> have<00:02:35.840> drove<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.560> without<00:02:37.250> me<00:02:37.489> seeing

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
could have drove in without me seeing

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.030 
could have drove in without me seeing
and<00:02:38.120> hearing<00:02:38.330> them<00:02:38.600> they<00:02:39.380> definitely<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
and hearing them they definitely have a

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.229 
and hearing them they definitely have a
sweet<00:02:40.760> tooth<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:42.430> guess<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:43.790> because

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
sweet tooth and I guess that's because

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.710 
sweet tooth and I guess that's because
most<00:02:44.630> everything<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.590> they<00:02:45.769> need<00:02:45.799> here<00:02:46.720> with

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
most everything that they need here with

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.450 
most everything that they need here with
the<00:02:47.959> exception<00:02:48.709> of

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
the exception of

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.980 
the exception of
the<00:02:49.850> ripe<00:02:50.090> apples<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:51.650> probably<00:02:52.430> bitter<00:02:52.990> or

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
the ripe apples is probably bitter or

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.450 
the ripe apples is probably bitter or
sour<00:02:54.380> or<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:56.510> know<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.630> was<00:02:56.990> wrong<00:02:57.440> flavor<00:02:58.130> to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
sour or you know I was wrong flavor to

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.960 
sour or you know I was wrong flavor to
it<00:02:58.990> so<00:02:59.990> no<00:03:00.710> I'm<00:03:00.860> thinking<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.640> they

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
it so no I'm thinking that that they

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.720 
it so no I'm thinking that that they
have<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> real<00:03:02.480> desire<00:03:02.990> for<00:03:03.380> speech<00:03:06.670> now<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
have a real desire for speech now the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.400 
have a real desire for speech now the
one<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.240> reasons<00:03:08.570> why<00:03:08.750> they<00:03:08.960> may<00:03:09.170> have

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
one of the reasons why they may have

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.360 
one of the reasons why they may have
created<00:03:09.920> mean<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:11.680> nutty<00:03:12.680> buddy<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.190> some

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
created mean that nutty buddy you some

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.360 
created mean that nutty buddy you some
stuff<00:03:13.640> like<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.270> as<00:03:14.920> these<00:03:15.920> nuts<00:03:15.950> might

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
stuff like that is as these nuts might

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.320 
stuff like that is as these nuts might
be<00:03:16.550> getting<00:03:17.030> old<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:18.740> know<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:19.370> don't<00:03:19.910> know<00:03:20.180> how

be getting old you know I don't know how

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.090 
be getting old you know I don't know how
long<00:03:20.510> they<00:03:20.750> would<00:03:20.900> see<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.560> they<00:03:24.830> may<00:03:25.040> be

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
long they would see so they may be

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.860 
long they would see so they may be
thinking<00:03:25.640> that<00:03:25.970> they<00:03:26.120> need<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.330> get<00:03:26.540> rid<00:03:26.810> of

thinking that they need to get rid of
them<00:03:27.110> for<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.930> new<00:03:30.080> crop<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.770> new<00:03:30.950> crop

Jim this fall but something they have an

Jim this fall but something they have an
overabundance<00:03:35.450> of<00:03:35.900> black<00:03:36.290> walnut<00:03:36.710> up<00:03:37.580> in

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
overabundance of black walnut up in

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.940 
overabundance of black walnut up in
higher<00:03:38.120> elevation<00:03:38.930> there's<00:03:39.080> black<00:03:39.440> walnut

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
higher elevation there's black walnut

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.460 
higher elevation there's black walnut
week<00:03:40.300> everywhere<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.630> mean<00:03:42.440> tons<00:03:42.830> of<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:45.440> I

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
week everywhere I mean tons of and so I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.890 
week everywhere I mean tons of and so I
wouldn't<00:03:45.890> be<00:03:46.100> much<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.730> an<00:03:46.970> effort<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.330> them<00:03:47.690> to

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
wouldn't be much of an effort to them to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.290 
wouldn't be much of an effort to them to
gather<00:03:48.580> up<00:03:49.580> tons<00:03:50.240> of<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.780> coma

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
gather up tons of a coma

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.110 
gather up tons of a coma
and<00:03:52.420> possibly<00:03:52.900> score<00:03:53.560> them

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
and possibly score them

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.950

no<00:03:56.760> my<00:03:57.760> son

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
no my son

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.940 
no my son
it<00:04:00.830> looked<00:04:01.100> like<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.310> footprint<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.300> ground

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
it looked like a footprint on the ground

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.520 
it looked like a footprint on the ground
my<00:04:03.950> neck<00:04:04.190> was<00:04:04.760> all<00:04:05.000> kinds<00:04:05.420> of<00:04:05.510> cracked<00:04:05.900> black

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
my neck was all kinds of cracked black

my neck was all kinds of cracked black
walnut<00:04:08.110> so<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:10.070> is<00:04:10.100> where<00:04:10.490> i'm<00:04:10.580> getting<00:04:10.910> my

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
walnut so this is where i'm getting my

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.240 
walnut so this is where i'm getting my
idea<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.810> maybe<00:04:12.050> they<00:04:12.380> can<00:04:12.770> during<00:04:13.040> the

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
idea that maybe they can during the

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.970 
idea that maybe they can during the
winter<00:04:13.640> pass<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:14.900> time<00:04:15.140> if<00:04:15.500> you're<00:04:15.710> sitting

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980

there looking out over the snow and

there looking out over the snow and
stuff<00:04:20.420> like<00:04:20.600> that<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:21.170> can<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.620> I'm<00:04:21.830> hardly

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
stuff like that you can and I'm hardly

insight to Bigfoot that most people

insight to Bigfoot that most people
might<00:04:32.720> not<00:04:32.960> have<00:04:33.110> thought<00:04:33.140> about<00:04:34.900> you<00:04:35.900> know<00:04:35.930> we

might not have thought about you know we

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.300 
might not have thought about you know we
got<00:04:36.170> to<00:04:36.380> start<00:04:36.620> thinking<00:04:36.650> out<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.250> box

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
got to start thinking out of the box

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.280 
got to start thinking out of the box
we're<00:04:38.060> going<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.330> start<00:04:38.510> researching<00:04:38.930> these

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
we're going to start researching these

we're going to start researching these
critters<00:04:39.700> got<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.850> think<00:04:41.060> outside<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.540> box

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
critters got to think outside the box

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.270 
critters got to think outside the box
now<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.320> gather<00:04:42.710> information<00:04:42.980> on<00:04:43.700> them

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
now to gather information on them

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.230 
now to gather information on them
because<00:04:46.280> they're<00:04:46.640> not<00:04:46.760> going<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.090> cooperate

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
because they're not going to cooperate

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.840 
because they're not going to cooperate
you<00:04:48.200> know<00:04:48.350> they're<00:04:48.650> not<00:04:49.310> going<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.520> give<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.820> a

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
to give up a loved one so you have to

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.080 
to give up a loved one so you have to
basically<00:04:59.920> infer<00:05:00.920> or<00:05:01.330> get<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:03.710> clues<00:05:04.090> as

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
basically infer or get you the clues as

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.959 
basically infer or get you the clues as
to<00:05:05.120> what<00:05:05.420> their<00:05:05.630> nature<00:05:06.110> is

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:06.969 
to what their nature is

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:09.959 
to what their nature is
how<00:05:07.509> they<00:05:07.569> survive<00:05:08.139> what<00:05:09.099> the<00:05:09.279> birthrate<00:05:09.909> is

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:09.969 
how they survive what the birthrate is

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.939 
how they survive what the birthrate is
what<00:05:10.659> your<00:05:10.839> grill<00:05:11.079> plate<00:05:11.409> is<00:05:11.619> their<00:05:12.610> lifespan

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
what your grill plate is their lifespan

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.359 
what your grill plate is their lifespan
technische<00:05:14.949> stuff<00:05:15.219> so<00:05:17.009> you<00:05:18.009> know<00:05:18.039> if<00:05:18.219> all

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:18.369 
technische stuff so you know if all

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:20.369 
technische stuff so you know if all
guesswork<00:05:18.669> right<00:05:19.209> now<00:05:19.419> but<00:05:19.839> you<00:05:20.229> know

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:20.379 
guesswork right now but you know

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:22.769 
guesswork right now but you know
eventually<00:05:20.709> if<00:05:21.399> you<00:05:21.429> collected<00:05:22.179> data<00:05:22.449> and

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
eventually if you collected data and

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.009

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:26.019 
more and more data you might get more

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:29.279 
more and more data you might get more
and<00:05:26.199> more<00:05:26.259> until<00:05:26.709> four<00:05:27.419> why<00:05:28.419> because<00:05:29.019> that's

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
and more until four why because that's

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:39.910 
and more until four why because that's
