you how to do a gutter leak and this is
what<00:00:07.379> we<00:00:07.500> got<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:07.890> this<00:00:08.069> one<00:00:08.280> but<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.120> NDA

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
what we got here this one but the NDA

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.089 
what we got here this one but the NDA
leaks<00:00:09.660> like<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.900> sieve<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.410> mine<00:00:10.650> I've<00:00:10.920> been

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
leaks like a sieve on mine I've been

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.160 
leaks like a sieve on mine I've been
meaning<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.610> for<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> while<00:00:11.940> now<00:00:12.210> bolts

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
meaning to do it for a while now bolts

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.810 
meaning to do it for a while now bolts
where<00:00:13.440> line<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.309> it's<00:00:14.429> probably<00:00:14.549> going

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
where line here and it's probably going

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.250 
where line here and it's probably going
to<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> job<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.360> get<00:00:15.480> any<00:00:15.660> washers<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.170> that

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
to be a job to get any washers for that

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.109 
to be a job to get any washers for that
they<00:00:16.440> may<00:00:16.800> still<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.100> available<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.820> can't

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
they may still be available you can't

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.870 
they may still be available you can't
check<00:00:18.359> but<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:19.050> way<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.260> do<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:20.039> using<00:00:20.730> good

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
check but the way I do it is using good

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640 
check but the way I do it is using good
old<00:00:21.029> solid<00:00:21.270> magic<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:21.840> you've<00:00:21.990> got<00:00:22.080> any<00:00:22.230> joints

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
old solid magic so you've got any joints

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
old solid magic so you've got any joints
at<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:22.949> cut<00:00:23.789> means<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.330> well<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> why<00:00:25.710> I

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
at all cut means as well this is why I

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.640 
at all cut means as well this is why I
always<00:00:25.890> do<00:00:26.310> them<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> first<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.050> pour<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
always do them so first we just pour the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710 
always do them so first we just pour the
end<00:00:28.800> off<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:29.880> assistant<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.599> an

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
end off because my assistant is an

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.110 
end off because my assistant is an
easier<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.520> leads<00:00:32.790> us<00:00:32.940> like

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
easier one to do and that leads us like

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.459 
easier one to do and that leads us like
this<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.480> we've<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.870> before<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.320> do

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
