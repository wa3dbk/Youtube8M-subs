00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.100
 it's a good question what makes me 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.839
 grace that you respond so you have the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.579
 comments to answer it and now yes 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.530
 let's start with the analysis of 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.079
 higuain mats hands how we got in 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.670
 screen we have here to higuaín and wayne 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.559
 hands of more the first hands of match 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.379
 which I think you can do a 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.620
 review we can see our your letter 83 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.280
 of rhythm 84 dribble 91 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.050
 shot 70 of pass and 76 of physical video 184 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.600
 has three of corners and four of 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.980
 bad leg to me cost me 547 thousand 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.530
 coins although their price is now around 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.240
 same between 540 thousand and 560 thousand 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 It usually varies during the day but 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.350
 surely its price ends up falling in 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.600
 a future not much either but I do not think 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.980
 stay in these 550 thousand coins that I 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.020
 it cost to me now you are seeing the team 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.820
 in which I used a baggage 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.070
 awesome released wanted to try another 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.410
 player the likes of equaled at least 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.410
 that is different from the normal letter and is 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.670
 cazorla not that as you see 85 on average 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.920
 quite I liked the team on 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.110
 all the manga defense and kabul are 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 awesome the goalkeeper also the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.680
 side panels very solid above all zabaleta 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.470
 I was surprised by how good the center 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.280
 from the field very very creative the two 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.990
 pretty good and herrera have 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.970
 surprised mostly defensively I 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.010
 has stolen many balls the area too 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.690
 it used to be defended quite well and the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.580
 ends then two for the balah above all 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.650
 keita has seemed spectacular fast 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.479
 and strong with a brutal clock very very 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.860
 good and as for higuaín while you see 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.360
 the goals that I put with him I will go 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.640
 commenting that I have found in the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.050
 field 83 of rhythm I think so to see 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.830
 neither more nor less is it true that your 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.020
 acceleration 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.390
 it's just good it's hard to start 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.830
 quite and at the time of leaving in 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.240
 speed costs him but it's true that 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.310
 once he has stretched a long ball and 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.990
 he starts running when he caught the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.700
 speed thanks to its strength is 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.430
 unstoppable because we have a great 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.080
 stride is not a player that is going to 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.650
 solve matches thanks to its speed 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.170
 but yes it looks 83 of rhythm 84 of 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.940
 dribble does not have 84 dribble is a 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.310
 pity because that dribble would be 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.800
 a perfect setback but it does not have 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.900
 three of skills does not have much 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.390
 hip movement to break the 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.220
 rivals hurt them quite 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.830
 to leave the rivals in dribbling the truth 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.030
 It's not a big dribbler to be said 91 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.340
 of shooting I think yes a great 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.290
 definition with two legs shot 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.940
 powerful is it true that I have gotten into 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.860
 no side but for the simple fact of 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.500
 that he did not used to be in position to 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.330
 throwing them is usually very close to the area 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.910
 and that's a great asset for him a great 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.440
 positioning but what has been said has not 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.550
 committed no madman for the simple fact 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.990
 of that he has a great 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.400
 positioning and is like a forward 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.290
 center has always good 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.910
 positioned that if shot that has 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.370
 possibility of entering shot that goes to 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.470
 enter your shot you notice it if you truly 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.140
 its great virtue is the great quality of 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.990
 this player his 70 shot pass as neither 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.670
 more or less to see I have not made much use 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.460
 of your pass you win I can not evaluate 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.310
 how much 76 of physical if great physicist 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.410
 spectacular over 76 without any doubt 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.500
 It's very, very strong, if I 'm not mistaken 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.960
 It has 85 strength is very corpulent and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.160
 is one of its main virtues the 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.780
 shot and his strength helping a lot 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.580
 also as I said before it has great 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.290
 stride and that together with his strength I 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.280
 He remembers the little finger a lot when he gets 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.770
 to run 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.020
 a maximum and when it is put 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.700
 One side if you do not try to push it will fall 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.770
 the defense on the side because it's very very 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.360
 strong the truth is a great player but 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.310
 yes it is true that it has to fit 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.319
 with your style of play you have development 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.240
 use it if you are looking for a center forward that 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.220
 this auction goals this studio the club 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.260
 Perfect center but if you are looking for a 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.319
 forward that truly is fast 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.450
 play a lot of color with your classmates 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.250
 have a lot of movement is not your 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.590
 player is not your player profile 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.330
 you need to know how to use it and the question of 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.810
 million is worth buying higuaín 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.810
 hands others 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.420
 no not worth at all worth it is a 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.040
 very very expensive player for performance 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.620
 that gives so it's true that in a 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.720
 future costs 200 thousand 300 thousand coins yes 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.580
 It will be worth it but truly 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.010
 in the series there are a lot of players 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.580
 better than the easiest to complete 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.530
 and that truly give much better 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.150
 level that the truth the performance that 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.860
 Da and wine is good but for the price 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.930
 that is not good in its quality 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.880
 price is not good we have or you cover like 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.090
 ibarbo the normal version of tv is the 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.060
 tv version and the second yf that is more 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.580
 cheap that guaymas de max I do not know there 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.190
 great players in the series and wayne is 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.590
 good but it's not in the top 3 of the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.210
 series without a doubt so I do not recommend 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.530
 but do not buy it if it is not 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.660
 your style of play if you create a 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.270
 Front center killer try it because 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.680
 is very very good in that aspect but not 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.480
 I recommend you buy it and good 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.730
