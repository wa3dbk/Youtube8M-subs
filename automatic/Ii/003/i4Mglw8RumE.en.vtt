00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
found it a bit difficult so you could

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.020 
found it a bit difficult so you could
stay<00:00:45.600> over<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:47.219> side<00:00:47.280> your

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
stay over here on this side your

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.760 
stay over here on this side your
teammates<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.870> also<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.260> can't

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
teammates can get up here also you can't

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.279 
teammates can get up here also you can't
pick<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.010> power-ups<00:00:50.550> stuff<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.539> but

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
pick up power-ups stuff like that but

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.959 
pick up power-ups stuff like that but
this<00:00:52.530> part<00:00:52.800> sped<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.579> want<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> do

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this part sped up so what you want to do

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.490 
this part sped up so what you want to do
if<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.750> other<00:00:54.899> side<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
if you want to get to the other side is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.490 
if you want to get to the other side is
go<00:00:55.680> prone<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.239> keep<00:00:57.539> wiggling<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:58.020> way<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
go prone and keep wiggling your way and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
go prone and keep wiggling your way and
looking<00:00:58.710> around<00:00:58.859> back<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.520> forth<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.940> does

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
looking around back and forth it does

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
looking around back and forth it does
take<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> while<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> first<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.190> anyway

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
take a while if for the first one anyway

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.179 
take a while if for the first one anyway
so<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.850> once<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> wiggle<00:01:03.510> through<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.189> this

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so then once you wiggle through it this

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.920 
so then once you wiggle through it this
this<00:01:05.640> part<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.360> there's<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
this part right here there's not a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
this part right here there's not a
barrier<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> walk<00:01:07.650> across<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
barrier to walk across so what you do is

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
barrier to walk across so what you do is
you<00:01:09.150> fall<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.689> onto<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> Ledge<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.650> right

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you fall down onto a Ledge that's right

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
you fall down onto a Ledge that's right
below<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> move<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.299> slowly

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
below you you want to move really slowly

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140 
below you you want to move really slowly
forward<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> move<00:01:14.610> over<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.000> your

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
forward like that move over to your

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.120 
forward like that move over to your
right<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.659> make<00:01:15.840> sure<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.380> jump<00:01:16.710> because

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
right and make sure you can jump because

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.499 
right and make sure you can jump because
if<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> can't<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.729> not<00:01:17.880> going<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.360> this

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
if you can't you're not going to do this

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.450 
if you can't you're not going to do this
make<00:01:18.869> sure<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.229> jump<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
make sure you can jump you're going to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
make sure you can jump you're going to
want<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.670> jump<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> then<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.540> spring

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
want to jump and then it's spring

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
want to jump and then it's spring
forward<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.439> midair<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.189> should<00:01:23.400> land<00:01:23.580> on

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
forward in midair and you should land on

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.859 
forward in midair and you should land on
the<00:01:23.850> barrier<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.509> side<00:01:24.840> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the barrier that's on the other side of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.219 
the barrier that's on the other side of
this<00:01:25.490> like<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.840> there<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.020> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
this like what I do there you go and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.620 
this like what I do there you go and
then<00:01:28.710> what<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.520> move<00:01:29.759> slowly

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
then what you want to do is move slowly

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.940 
then what you want to do is move slowly
over<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.590> fall<00:01:31.710> down

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
over to right so you don't fall down

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.999 
over to right so you don't fall down
crouch<00:01:32.729> jump<00:01:33.060> up<00:01:33.150> onto<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.600> turn<00:01:34.530> around<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
crouch jump up onto this turn around and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.219 
crouch jump up onto this turn around and
go<00:01:35.100> prone<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.479> one's<00:01:36.659> much<00:01:36.810> easier

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
go prone and then this one's much easier

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
go prone and then this one's much easier
and<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.590> wiggle<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.250> out<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
and you just wiggle your way out the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.649 
and you just wiggle your way out the
back<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.150> you're<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> other<00:01:39.479> side

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
back and then you're on the other side

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
back and then you're on the other side
of<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.159> now<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.520> said<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.880> can't<00:01:42.119> pick

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of this now like I said you can't pick

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060
