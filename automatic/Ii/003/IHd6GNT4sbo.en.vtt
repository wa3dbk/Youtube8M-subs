00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
a position we talked about great

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.999 
a position we talked about great
protection<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> lot<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> times<00:01:31.710> it's

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
protection but a lot of times it's

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.969 
protection but a lot of times it's
difficult<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.610> get<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.600> defender<00:01:34.049> so

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
difficult to get by a good defender so

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
difficult to get by a good defender so
we<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.250> use<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.640> stick<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> hang<00:01:37.439> it

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
we can use that stick and we can hang it

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.030 
we can use that stick and we can hang it
a<00:01:37.710> bit<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.810> focus<00:01:40.680> on<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
a bit so that they have a focus on it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.460 
a bit so that they have a focus on it
and<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.220> want<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> lean<00:01:41.729> towards<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.509> alright

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and they want to lean towards it alright

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.469 
and they want to lean towards it alright
so<00:01:43.950> anytime<00:01:44.159> I'm<00:01:44.460> making<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.820> move<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.149> may<00:01:45.299> bring

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
so anytime I'm making a move I may bring

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
so anytime I'm making a move I may bring
it<00:01:45.600> here<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.229> may<00:01:46.500> bring<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.909> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it here I may bring it there but as I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300

right<00:01:50.520> space<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.270> between<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.500> he<00:01:52.680> can't

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
right space in between so that he can't

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
right space in between so that he can't
