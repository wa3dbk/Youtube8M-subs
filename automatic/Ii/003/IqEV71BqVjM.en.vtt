height<00:04:09.670> they<00:04:10.390> should<00:04:10.570> turn<00:04:10.720> off<00:04:11.970> yeah<00:04:12.970> see

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:26.850 

let's<00:04:18.760> see<00:04:18.970> here<00:04:19.710> the<00:04:20.710> animations<00:04:21.190> work<00:04:25.860> good

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
let's see here the animations work good

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.810 
let's see here the animations work good
bug<00:04:27.070> that<00:04:27.220> I've<00:04:27.340> noticed<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:27.850> far<00:04:28.120> is<00:04:28.900> this

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
bug that I've noticed so far is this

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.790 
bug that I've noticed so far is this
lock<00:04:30.820> ring<00:04:31.120> when<00:04:31.990> you<00:04:32.080> change<00:04:32.320> its<00:04:32.500> setting

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
lock ring when you change its setting

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.220 
lock ring when you change its setting
this<00:04:33.180> doesn't<00:04:34.180> work<00:04:34.300> right<00:04:34.480> right<00:04:34.690> and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
this doesn't work right right and

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.880 
this doesn't work right right and
there's<00:04:35.500> another<00:04:36.960> that's<00:04:37.960> strange<00:04:38.320> there's

there's another that's strange there's

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.070 
there's another that's strange there's
another<00:04:41.370> icon<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:43.180> notice<00:04:43.390> how<00:04:43.480> it<00:04:43.510> clicks<00:04:43.960> to

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
another icon you notice how it clicks to

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.700 
another icon you notice how it clicks to
that<00:04:44.200> one<00:04:44.380> immediately<00:04:45.100> I<00:04:45.370> go<00:04:46.180> down<00:04:46.360> here<00:04:46.710> goes

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
that one immediately I go down here goes

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.140 
that one immediately I go down here goes
to<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.890> bottom<00:04:48.160> -<00:04:48.310> it's<00:04:48.610> just<00:04:48.850> kind<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.030> off

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
to the bottom - it's just kind of off

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.820 
to the bottom - it's just kind of off
the<00:04:49.300> edge<00:04:49.390> of<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:49.600> screen<00:04:52.530> okay<00:04:53.530> let's<00:04:53.680> launch

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
the edge of the screen okay let's launch

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.960 
the edge of the screen okay let's launch
a<00:04:53.950> couple<00:04:54.100> applications<00:04:54.960> let's<00:04:55.960> go<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.970> camera

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
a couple applications let's go to camera

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:09.049 
a couple applications let's go to camera
so<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.180> can<00:04:58.270> see<00:04:58.980> no<00:04:59.980> camera

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:09.059 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.609 

practice<00:05:10.059> settings<00:05:10.359> one<00:05:10.479> more<00:05:10.599> time<00:05:10.779> to<00:05:11.469> show

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:11.619 
practice settings one more time to show

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:13.919 
practice settings one more time to show
you<00:05:11.649> a<00:05:11.799> SD<00:05:12.609> card<00:05:12.639> mounting<00:05:13.179> is<00:05:13.299> not<00:05:13.539> working

storage<00:05:17.439> you<00:05:17.619> saw<00:05:17.769> that<00:05:23.789> apps<00:05:24.789> crashes<00:05:25.389> too

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
storage you saw that apps crashes too

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.479 
storage you saw that apps crashes too
because<00:05:25.839> he<00:05:25.929> can't<00:05:26.109> find<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.409> SD<00:05:26.739> card<00:05:27.039> I

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:32.489 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:36.509 

don't<00:05:33.489> know<00:05:33.789> yet<00:05:34.089> if<00:05:34.299> GPS<00:05:34.719> works<00:05:35.099> we<00:05:36.099> need<00:05:36.219> data

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:36.519 
don't know yet if GPS works we need data

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:42.059 
don't know yet if GPS works we need data
obviously<00:05:39.869> date<00:05:40.869> and<00:05:41.019> time<00:05:41.259> all<00:05:41.769> that<00:05:41.919> good

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:42.069 
obviously date and time all that good

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.969 
obviously date and time all that good
stuff<00:05:42.099> works<00:05:42.549> of<00:05:42.969> course<00:05:43.299> as<00:05:43.629> you<00:05:43.839> can<00:05:43.959> tell<00:05:44.139> it

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.360 

performance<00:06:11.830> I<00:06:16.889> haven't<00:06:17.889> messed<00:06:18.010> around<00:06:18.160> with

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
performance I haven't messed around with

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.050 
performance I haven't messed around with
these<00:06:18.580> yet

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
these yet

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.379 
these yet
I<00:06:19.090> really<00:06:19.990> haven't<00:06:21.000> but<00:06:22.000> I<00:06:22.030> have<00:06:22.150> a<00:06:22.180> feeling

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
I really haven't but I have a feeling

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.420 
I really haven't but I have a feeling
that<00:06:22.660> they<00:06:22.780> will<00:06:22.870> work

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
that they will work

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.219 
that they will work
synergy<00:06:24.430> compile<00:06:24.790> the<00:06:24.970> kernel<00:06:25.150> for<00:06:25.479> this<00:06:25.630> and

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229 
synergy compile the kernel for this and

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.110 
synergy compile the kernel for this and
I<00:06:26.320> think<00:06:26.350> he<00:06:26.680> included<00:06:27.930> overclocking<00:06:28.930> support

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
I think he included overclocking support

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.520 
I think he included overclocking support
it<00:06:31.120> looks<00:06:31.600> like<00:06:31.750> almost<00:06:32.620> 2<00:06:32.889> gigahertz<00:06:34.410> I'm<00:06:35.410> not

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530 
it looks like almost 2 gigahertz I'm not

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:42.030 
it looks like almost 2 gigahertz I'm not
gonna<00:06:35.680> mess<00:06:35.800> with<00:06:35.830> that<00:06:36.040> now<00:06:39.000> all<00:06:40.000> right<00:06:41.040> if

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040
