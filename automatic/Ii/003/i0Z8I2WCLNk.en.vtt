hi everyone Felix eagerness today we're
talking<00:00:03.300> about<00:00:03.570> grip<00:00:04.049> care<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.920> late

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
talking about grip care in the late

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.030 
talking about grip care in the late
winter<00:00:05.640> season<00:00:06.330> some<00:00:06.779> pruning<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.710> also<00:00:08.010> a

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
winter season some pruning and also a

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.290 
winter season some pruning and also a
little<00:00:08.250> bit<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.550> how<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.790> train<00:00:09.120> these

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
little bit about how to train these

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.410 
little bit about how to train these
plants<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.490> four<00:00:11.490> year<00:00:11.700> old<00:00:11.730> grapevine

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
plants this is a four year old grapevine

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.240 
plants this is a four year old grapevine
here<00:00:12.719> we've<00:00:12.870> trained<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> primary<00:00:14.009> shoot

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
here we've trained the primary shoot

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.369 
here we've trained the primary shoot
nicely<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:14.969> you're<00:00:15.150> planting<00:00:15.660> would<00:00:15.839> be<00:00:15.990> here

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
nicely so you're planting would be here

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.390 
nicely so you're planting would be here
you<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.220> cane

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
you have that cane

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.950 
you have that cane
we<00:00:18.520> coming<00:00:18.820> up<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.120> it<00:00:19.210> would<00:00:19.330> break<00:00:19.510> a<00:00:19.570> chute

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
we coming up and it would break a chute

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.450 
we coming up and it would break a chute
and<00:00:20.140> you<00:00:20.230> want<00:00:20.380> to<00:00:20.470> train<00:00:20.740> that<00:00:20.770> nice<00:00:21.190> and

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
and you want to train that nice and

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.120 
and you want to train that nice and
straight<00:00:21.730> like<00:00:21.970> we<00:00:22.120> have<00:00:22.330> here<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.710> for<00:00:24.100> a

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
straight like we have here and for a

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.800 
straight like we have here and for a
single<00:00:24.490> curtain<00:00:24.820> system<00:00:25.000> like<00:00:25.360> we've<00:00:25.540> trained

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
single curtain system like we've trained

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.260 
single curtain system like we've trained
this<00:00:25.960> guy<00:00:26.200> which<00:00:26.500> is<00:00:26.530> really<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:26.980> nice<00:00:27.280> training

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
this guy which is really a nice training

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.570 
this guy which is really a nice training
system<00:00:28.750> for<00:00:28.930> mass<00:00:29.140> productions<00:00:29.980> really<00:00:30.430> to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
system for mass productions really to

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.460 
system for mass productions really to
good<00:00:30.700> productivity

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
good productivity

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.110 
good productivity
basically<00:00:32.470> we<00:00:32.680> took<00:00:32.860> one<00:00:33.130> suit<00:00:33.460> taking<00:00:33.970> one

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
basically we took one suit taking one

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.660 
basically we took one suit taking one
direction<00:00:34.600> here<00:00:34.810> for<00:00:34.960> this

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.450 

two<00:00:37.870> primary<00:00:38.870> shoots<00:00:39.170> to<00:00:39.440> make<00:00:39.590> our<00:00:40.010> single

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
two primary shoots to make our single

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.479 
two primary shoots to make our single
person<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:40.940> are<00:00:41.059> on<00:00:41.180> this<00:00:41.360> top<00:00:41.600> wire

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
person that are on this top wire

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.950 
person that are on this top wire
so<00:00:43.489> there's<00:00:43.700> old<00:00:43.879> Irvine<00:00:44.239> who<00:00:44.570> has<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.720> lot<00:00:44.930> of

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
so there's old Irvine who has a lot of

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.010 
so there's old Irvine who has a lot of
last<00:00:45.350> season's<00:00:45.860> growth<00:00:46.129> on<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.550> which<00:00:46.699> of<00:00:46.879> the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
last season's growth on it which of the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.900 
last season's growth on it which of the
shoots<00:00:48.440> here<00:00:48.649> that<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.890> about<00:00:49.010> pencil<00:00:49.489> bag<00:00:49.700> a

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
shoots here that are about pencil bag a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.209 
shoots here that are about pencil bag a
little<00:00:49.969> thicker<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.600> on<00:00:51.500> these<00:00:51.680> shoots<00:00:51.980> of

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
little thicker and on these shoots of

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.950 
little thicker and on these shoots of
some<00:00:52.399> buds<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.879> can<00:00:53.030> see<00:00:53.300> here<00:00:53.510> they<00:00:53.629> haven't

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
some buds you can see here they haven't

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.810 
some buds you can see here they haven't
broken<00:00:54.170> yet<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:54.680> you<00:00:54.800> can<00:00:54.920> see<00:00:55.160> them<00:00:55.399> you<00:00:55.579> look

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
broken yet but you can see them you look

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.240 
broken yet but you can see them you look
closely<00:00:56.120> here<00:00:56.660> but<00:00:57.230> that's<00:00:57.379> right<00:00:57.860> there<00:00:58.070> is<00:00:58.220> a

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
closely here but that's right there is a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.369 
closely here but that's right there is a
but<00:00:58.730> that's<00:00:58.910> going<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.269> break<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.809> there<00:01:00.290> will

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
but that's going to break and there will

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.560 
but that's going to break and there will
be<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.530> flower<00:01:01.489> shoot<00:01:01.940> off<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.390> that's

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
be a flower shoot off of that that's

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.509 
be a flower shoot off of that that's
where<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.840> cluster<00:01:03.110> will<00:01:03.469> form<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:03.890> on<00:01:04.009> that<00:01:04.220> new

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
where a cluster will form is on that new

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.600 
where a cluster will form is on that new
shoot<00:01:04.820> coming<00:01:05.210> after

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
shoot coming after

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.670 
shoot coming after
so<00:01:07.610> for<00:01:07.850> pruning<00:01:08.149> you<00:01:09.020> look<00:01:09.200> along<00:01:09.500> this

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
so for pruning you look along this

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.950 
so for pruning you look along this
curtain<00:01:10.130> here<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:11.060> have<00:01:11.180> a<00:01:11.210> number<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.659> those

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
curtain here we have a number of those

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.850 
curtain here we have a number of those
that<00:01:12.229> have<00:01:12.380> come<00:01:12.409> out<00:01:12.619> last<00:01:13.070> season

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
that have come out last season

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.340 
that have come out last season
and<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.520> we<00:01:15.670> only<00:01:15.880> want<00:01:16.210> two<00:01:16.750> or<00:01:16.780> three

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
and really we only want two or three

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.460 
and really we only want two or three
shoots<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:17.980> break<00:01:18.250> off<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.470> last

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
shoots to break off of this last

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.470 
shoots to break off of this last
season's<00:01:20.860> growth<00:01:21.100> so<00:01:21.370> the<00:01:21.550> pruning<00:01:21.850> approach

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
season's growth so the pruning approach

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.620 
season's growth so the pruning approach
here<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:23.020> to<00:01:23.620> take<00:01:23.920> these<00:01:24.100> match<00:01:24.400> 2-1<00:01:24.760> -<00:01:25.330> we

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
here is to take these match 2-1 - we

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.770 
here is to take these match 2-1 - we
have<00:01:25.750> another<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.230> on<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.500> other<00:01:26.680> side<00:01:27.780> I'm

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
have another but on the other side I'm

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.360 
have another but on the other side I'm
just<00:01:28.930> going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.140> leave<00:01:29.290> two<00:01:29.590> there<00:01:29.830> so<00:01:30.250> we're

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
just going to leave two there so we're

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.100 
just going to leave two there so we're
going<00:01:30.460> to<00:01:30.520> trim<00:01:30.730> this<00:01:30.910> back<00:01:30.970> see<00:01:31.870> a<00:01:31.900> nice

- it's weird vibes and we'll show later
in<00:02:45.340> another<00:02:45.880> video<00:02:46.230> how<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.260> shoots<00:02:47.620> will

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
in another video how the shoots will

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.710 
in another video how the shoots will
initiate<00:02:48.100> from<00:02:48.490> there<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:48.970> then<00:02:49.540> you'll<00:02:49.660> be

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
initiate from there and then you'll be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.900 
initiate from there and then you'll be
able<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:50.020> see<00:02:50.200> how<00:02:50.380> flower<00:02:50.710> bud<00:02:50.980> develops<00:02:51.520> off

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
able to see how flower bud develops off

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.790 
able to see how flower bud develops off
of<00:02:52.210> those<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.930> we'll<00:02:53.080> cover<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.650> you're

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
of those and we'll cover that so you're

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.290 
of those and we'll cover that so you're
not<00:02:53.890> identifying<00:02:54.520> your<00:02:54.580> flower<00:02:54.850> buds<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
not identifying your flower buds and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.090 
not identifying your flower buds and
where<00:02:55.450> your<00:02:55.600> clusters<00:02:56.020> will<00:02:56.200> be<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.860> then<00:02:56.980> in

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
where your clusters will be and then in

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.440 
where your clusters will be and then in
another<00:02:57.190> video<00:02:57.640> we'll<00:02:57.820> talk<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.060> little<00:02:58.270> bit

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
another video we'll talk a little bit

another video we'll talk a little bit
about<00:02:58.480> fruit<00:02:58.930> thinning<00:02:59.410> then<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.770> your

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
about fruit thinning then in your

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.790 
about fruit thinning then in your
cluster<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.520> get<00:03:00.610> math<00:03:01.020> massive<00:03:02.020> berries

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
cluster so you get math massive berries

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.120 
cluster so you get math massive berries
and<00:03:03.040> just<00:03:03.490> balanced<00:03:03.970> crop<00:03:04.300> load<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.690> this<00:03:04.870> vine

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.380 
and just balanced crop load on this vine
and<00:03:06.130> those<00:03:06.280> will<00:03:06.430> be<00:03:06.520> some<00:03:06.700> nice<00:03:06.820> points<00:03:07.180> to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
and those will be some nice points to

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.570 
and those will be some nice points to
look<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.720> on<00:03:08.140> some<00:03:08.380> later<00:03:08.680> videos<00:03:09.040> thanks<00:03:09.430> for
