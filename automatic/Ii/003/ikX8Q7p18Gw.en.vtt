00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.570 
thing in all of colonial history is the
Second<00:00:15.480> Amendment<00:00:15.830> because<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.980> think<00:00:17.369> it's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
Second Amendment because I think it's

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
crazy but not because it gives you the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
crazy but not because it gives you the

right to own a gun that I think is very

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.550

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the British which in and of itself is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.950 
the British which in and of itself is
hysterical<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.399> there's<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.480> country

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
hysterical like there's this country

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
hysterical like there's this country
full<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> these<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.590> rough<00:00:37.860> frontiersman

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
full of these like rough frontiersman

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:59.709 
full of these like rough frontiersman
living<00:00:39.030> off<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> land<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:40.200> here's<00:00:40.530> afraid

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.450 

and<00:01:00.719> he's<00:01:01.079> talking<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.559> two<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:01.980> dogs<00:01:02.219> you

and he's talking to two little dogs you
follow<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:05.880> think<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> Second<00:01:06.659> Amendment

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
follow but I think the Second Amendment

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.560 
follow but I think the Second Amendment
is<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.500> weird<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.970> Second

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
is so weird because it's the Second

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.410 
is so weird because it's the Second
Amendment<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.430> second<00:01:11.970> thing<00:01:12.240> they

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
