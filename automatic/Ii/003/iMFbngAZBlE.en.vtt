bangbang<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.160> if<00:01:28.310> you<00:01:28.460> can<00:01:28.640> tell<00:01:28.850> from<00:01:29.030> that

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
bangbang and if you can tell from that

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.060 
bangbang and if you can tell from that
safer<00:01:29.810> up<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.229> better<00:01:30.380> than<00:01:30.619> me

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
safer up you better than me

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.609 
safer up you better than me
I<00:01:31.100> guess<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:32.270> centerfield<00:01:32.840> camera<00:01:33.080> might<00:01:33.440> be

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
I guess the centerfield camera might be

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.650 
I guess the centerfield camera might be
a<00:01:33.650> little<00:01:33.800> bit<00:01:33.979> better<00:01:34.190> angle<00:01:34.729> because<00:01:35.210> you'll

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
a little bit better angle because you'll

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.249 
a little bit better angle because you'll
know<00:01:35.930> when<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.530> glove<00:01:36.860> hits<00:01:37.190> them<00:01:37.400> in<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:38.840> leg

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
know when the glove hits them in the leg

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.380 
know when the glove hits them in the leg
but<00:01:39.560> from<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.070> angle<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:40.729> me<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.150> looked

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
but from that angle for me it looked

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.330 
but from that angle for me it looked
like<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.810> foot<00:01:42.110> got<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.560> there
