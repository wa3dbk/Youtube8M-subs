00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 two 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.759
 and 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.560
 hello everyone how about in this video we're going 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.080
 to see the makeup trend for 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.410
 this winter 2015 in terms of nails 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.420
 or the nail polish is more 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.390
 that swims colors what colors are going 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.190
 to bring good color especially 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.160
 colors that you are going to wear is going to be the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.500
 black have already finished matte or glossy 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.080
 Black is the color that will carry the most 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.699
 and difference with other seasons is that 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.190
 before when we put our fingernails 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.399
 black was the same in a night look a 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.590
 look a little bit rocker a bit pimp 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.040
 but now black is worn even with 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.559
 the looks more news more night more soft 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.480
 habits of the world well with those in fact 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.940
 Well, you can see some celebrities like that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.760
 out there on the red carpet they're going 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.740
 the same with a chiffon dress in shades 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.930
 nude makeup and wear nail 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.550
 black are worn both day and 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.340
 night and as I say with the more looks 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.070
 sweet that those nails can happen 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.020
 in black are the biggest trend and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.550
 we have good then that advantage that before 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.640
 they also gave the nails of narwhal 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.070
 for at night and then for the day 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.930
 It seemed that depending on what looks 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.700
 hit the good so now we can 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 paint them black and they last us all 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 the week could already a week what 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.619
 last and we can take it is totally 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.150
 of trend because I already tell you that it 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.540
 They have all kinds of looks and I'm going to 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.759
 teach three black enamels that are the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.830
 191 of isadora what they have 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.440
 black enamels depending on what is 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:51.090
 that sometimes you need to give several layers 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.030

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.990

 is the 48 black of málaga another color 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.800
 super trend for nails is the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.240
 gray but a dark gray just like for 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.000
 the eyes that are also worn by 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.540

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.050
 little glitter leaves as an effect of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.300
 very finite glitter and east golden 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.430

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.530
 glitter like silver that has the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.130
 another here you see them this first one is the one 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.630
 Mary Kay and this one from Golden Rose the one 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.670
 glitter and this without her and is also 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.530
 gray that you have already seen me in some 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.570
 photo of isadora that is a gray but 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.870
 it has like golden glitters the 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:53.750
 medicaid that of golden rose and that of 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.000
 Isadora after they take a lot of 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.870
 blue blues pretty strong 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.790
 pretty marked 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.610
 this for example of isadora is the tone 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.800
 758 aquatic 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.750
 this delhi plus makes a lot of 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.210
 mercadona time but that to me 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.310
 it's still going great that it's 68 and 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.370
 Surely some of you do not do it 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.410
 a lot of time is a blue a god 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.560
 that we have it from years ago and I do not know 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.030
 dry and it is perfectly then this of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.980
 magdala dening the 178 and the smoking lu 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.650
 153 bad there you can see them 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 the one of isadora the one of deliplus and the two 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.340
 from málaga 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.770
 and finally they get a lot of purple 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.320
 to burgundy as in the shadows 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.300
 of bass I have also this weak and plus 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.430
 a long time ago but that follows me 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.020
 saying very well just like the other one that 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.819
 is number 67 on 7 76 crown jewels of 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.459
 isadora 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:01.340
 that its purple a little and stewed as with 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:03.019
 glitter ditto supports the onyx 245 this 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:08.209
 We were talking about him once 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:10.900
 instagram or photos and the 809 of kiko here 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.659
 you have the one of deliplus the one of isadora 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.280
 the maga's and Kiko also 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.039
 It takes a lot of gold both 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.680
 makeup to bring a touch of light 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.440
 golden to illuminator mode for example in 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.960
 the upper part of the cheekbone or in the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.699
 eye shadows a little dot of gold and 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.139
 also in the nails I have to 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.880
 golden of magdala that is the 160 and os what 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.889
 I teach because I eat gold so I 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.750
 cover and look beautiful there are not many 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.700
 so that you see it so you have 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.800
 an idea if you fancy 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.139
 to the sun 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.930
 since we are all taught everyone there to 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.440
 sun that from what I see are much more 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.440
 pretty 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.900
 and finally as I said this 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:01.000
 season the glazes are worn as much 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.940
 bright as Tuesday but glazes 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.190
 mates is not so easy to find at least 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.229
 not in all the tones and I will take advantage 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.729
 this video to show you this product 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.500
 If you do not know it, many of you 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.629
 you will know from behind that it is not 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.639
 product that is thrown on top of the enamel 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.810
 of nails and get with a normal enamel 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.699
 what of mate 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.440
 I have two this is from coast to sense 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.789
 but good things from coast to 6 yo 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.710
 I think I'm going to stop talking about 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.389
 them because when we started with the 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.039
 subject of many things only videos 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.319
 they got at cost the sense that is a 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.389
 come back American but now there is 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.819
 infinity of Spanish websites and above with 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.740
 the roll this that they charge us what 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.840
 they stop customs and everything else and we 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.909
 they charge a lot, well, come on, I do not 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.870
 I ask for nothing until 6 I bought everything in 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:46.960
 Spanish websites then I show you this 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.879
 another that is of excellence is a top coat 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.770
 they are a product that is thrown on top of the 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.629
 enamel to make any enamel 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.310
 become mate then if we can catch 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.259
 a color that we love that they have not 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.150
 mate that shine we put this and 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.190
 we get it in the one I'm going to 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.840
 teach how it is because so that you do not 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.880
 know for sure that they find it 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.340
 curious I'm going to paint myself that I know then a 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.060
 nail with this isadora blue for example 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:12.780
 another with the purple east delhi plus 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.340
 who has more years than me to dry 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:19.090
 so you can see that it will continue to work 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:22.270
 perfectly another with the black manna 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.010
 48 speaks and another with golden gray 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.710
 rose 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.900
 this is how they are in their version 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.969
 Original say the see how it shines 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.129
 the sun 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:36.679
 and now let's wait for them to dry and 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:41.169
 we apply the mate we take the top coat 

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:41.169
 As I say, I 'm going to use this essence 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.569
 and see what a difference they have made 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.909
 totally matted 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.039
 well this is the trend what 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:55.639
 is going to take about colors and 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:57.649
 finished this season on the nails already 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:00.649
 you know mostly bet on black 

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:02.389
 and for the dark colors I hope that you 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:06.789
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.789
 video a little kiss chao
