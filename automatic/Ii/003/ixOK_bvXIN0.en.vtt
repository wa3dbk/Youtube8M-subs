00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.030
 meanwhile aiming to count this 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.060
 story here of a village that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.030
 disappeared in Canada in the 1930s 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.799
 the hunter joe bell he was running from 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 a storm then decided to go to 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.659
 Inuit who sits on the lake shores in 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 diquini to look for shelter 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.900
 arriving there that time he started to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.990
 wonder that he did not see smoke from the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.549
 chimney not a barking dog 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.290
 movement he found strange, 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.390
 decided to enter the houses when the cut 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 it could have happened that he was 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.979
 encountered some things that did not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.579
 they were logical there was not a person 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.450
 even Ávila elaborated more or less 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.030
 1,200 e is not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.720
 he noticed that they disappeared 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.100
 very quickly because they left 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.850
 in the stoves that came to stay. 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.869
 burned or take the fire on 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.909
 found the weapons 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.430
 they never left without a gun to visit a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.060
 the popular region has 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.240
 bear very wolf encounter fur coats 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.800
 he found the prestige of the animals 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.330
 found to brasilia and in the arena that 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.120
 means that people did not have 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.590
 party venue long ago do only 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.760
 two weeks that he had been 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 in that village 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.209
 in one of the houses he visited 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
 even found the food dishes 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.380
 with the fish tails up 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.780
 the person who was there simply 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.670
 left that he was afraid of the meal and 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.160
 He disappeared and has since been 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.360
 scared right because he saw there, I thought 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.720
 I will not stay here not 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.000
 He took the vase and was able to reach it. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.180
 tell the police the real mounted police 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.370
 in Canada of what had happened and the 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.930
 Police were there getting there on site 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.730
 the police found that they did not really 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.760
 there was nobody there and who was there went up 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.870
 the pieces but she discovered two things 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.630
 very interesting 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.230
 her about the dogs of the locals 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:58.190
 are covered with frozen snow the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.220
 dogs there are very valuable 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.170
 I was not going to let his dogs 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.840
 tied up and take the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.600
 movie hunger strung on trees and another 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.170
 Even more queer thing was that a 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.230
 Their cemetery was 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.870
 went there to take the land and take some pigs 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.150
 also, and look, that's where he was. 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.310
 outside china is hard of the cement type 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.840
 business and it was not unusual because 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.790
 police found that the same 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.760
 hills next to all the usual ones there 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.269
 for the people in the Inuit c profane one 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.100
 cemetery then it was to very very grave 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.320
 what happened there is looking for 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.030
 of more information the police began to 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.519
 scouring the site they found a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.920
 bell of a hunter called to 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.870
 What did you tell the police? 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.500
 that he and his family were seeing 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.480
 Strange lights during various 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.760
 nights in a row so much that he did not 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.430
 let your children leave home 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.380
 and they stayed there the whole time with 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.730
 free after coughing that if any 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.950
 thing and 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.470
 how to defend he said he came to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.830
 see 15 of these objects one night flies 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.030
 different altitudes to very well what 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.820
 It generates strange has just become 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.940
 Strange a village of 1,200 people 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.639
 simply disappears and lights 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.280
 strangers are sighted in the sky by 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.650
 occurred the desecration of the cemetery of 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.560
 dogs died of frozen starvation 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.410
 there the police issued a report 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.820
 and there was his sergeant Nelson and did the 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.949
 following report saying that 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.740
 simply Ávila migrated from a local 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.560
 to another 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.740
 that there were no traces of 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.449
 footprints, nothing but a sergeant is not 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.520
 known simply migrated from a place 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:51.560
 to the other and this sergeant 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.979
 never been there it was not 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.110
 participated in the local investigations 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.539
 but this was the final verdict of the police 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.330
 It's logical headline won the cases in the 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.949
 Canada at the time in 1930 began to 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.690
 compare it with the case of rock fame 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.860
 giving the United States and such 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.440
 what will have happened there curry feet 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.860
 if they fully disappear is a 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:18.169
 Mystery to this day then comes back to that 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.760
 again to invite for today at 8 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.610
 watched what would happen if 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.169
 the entire population of the planet 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.080
 disappear with what the world is to stay 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.450
 then one day 10 years six months 100 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 what is standing 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.639
 I do not miss the world's special likes 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.440
 this young man here who helps to spread 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.389
 A lot of this video here is a 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.220
 comment is over what happened

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.720
 and maybe I make a special one 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:48.380
 a little more detailed about what 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.680
 may have happened there haunted until 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.680
 more
