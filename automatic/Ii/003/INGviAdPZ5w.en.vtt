but<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.470> tell<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.800> white<00:00:16.980> housing

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
but as you can tell it to white housing

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.310 
but as you can tell it to white housing
and<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.670> LED<00:00:18.300> configurations<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.080> little<00:00:19.230> bit

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and the LED configurations a little bit

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.990 
and the LED configurations a little bit
different<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.740> i<00:00:19.980> believe<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.430> amber<00:00:20.820> is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
different and i believe it's amber is

different and i believe it's amber is
going<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> add<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.539> into<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> LED<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.529> Allen

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
going to add it into the LED so Allen

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.970 
going to add it into the LED so Allen
take<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.550> away<00:00:23.640> let's<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.150> cool<00:00:24.710> as<00:00:25.710> Kyle

head just like the other freedom pars
but<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.239> one<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.739> has<00:01:04.949> these

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
but this one if you can see it has these

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.000 
but this one if you can see it has these
little<00:01:05.580> slots<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> corners<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.770> that's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
little slots on the corners and that's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.340 
little slots on the corners and that's
for<00:01:08.430> diffusion<00:01:08.909> film<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.049> don't<00:01:10.200> want

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
for diffusion film so if you don't want

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.510 
for diffusion film so if you don't want
it<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.590> straight<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> wall<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it to go straight up the wall like a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
it to go straight up the wall like a
column<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> little<00:01:12.960> diffuser

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
column you can put in a little diffuser

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.630 
column you can put in a little diffuser
there<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:13.890> make<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> little<00:01:14.460> bit

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there and actually make it a little bit

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
there and actually make it a little bit
more<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.970> wider<00:01:15.210> coverage<00:01:15.479> sure<00:01:15.930> sure

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
more of a wider coverage sure sure

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
more of a wider coverage sure sure
that's<00:01:16.650> what<00:01:16.770> that's<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.600> now<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> LED

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that's what that's for now the LED

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.899 
that's what that's for now the LED
configuration<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.920> different<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.549> how<00:01:20.729> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
configuration is different here how is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179 
configuration is different here how is
this<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:21.960> better<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.409> how<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:22.890> was

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
this it is this better than how it was

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
this it is this better than how it was
in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> past<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.909> different<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
in the past it's different I like the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.510 
in the past it's different I like the
effects<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> little<00:01:26.070> bit<00:01:26.220> different<00:01:26.430> there

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
effects are a little bit different there

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.010 
effects are a little bit different there
that's<00:01:26.670> pretty<00:01:26.820> cool<00:01:26.970> yeah<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> effects<00:01:27.840> are

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that's pretty cool yeah the effects are

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.090 
that's pretty cool yeah the effects are
there<00:01:28.170> because<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.619> want<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> be

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
there because we want it to be

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
there because we want it to be
compatible<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> existing<00:01:30.360> freedoms

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
compatible with the existing freedoms

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
compatible with the existing freedoms
the<00:01:31.890> existing<00:01:32.280> freedoms<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.820> segmented

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the existing freedoms have segmented

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.990 
the existing freedoms have segmented
control<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.430> different<00:01:35.430> patterns<00:01:35.729> looks

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
control and different patterns looks

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.520 
control and different patterns looks
like<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> color<00:01:36.450> strip<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> freedom<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> all

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
like the color strip and freedom and all

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.679 
like the color strip and freedom and all
that<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.700> didn't<00:01:39.270> want<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> lose<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that so we didn't want to lose that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.660 
that so we didn't want to lose that
functionality<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.250> use<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.549> little

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
functionality so you can use it a little

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520 
functionality so you can use it a little
bit<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.299> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.600> want<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.140> lights<00:01:43.320> can

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
bit as I can if you want the lights can

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.139 
bit as I can if you want the lights can
bounce<00:01:43.740> kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> bounce<00:01:44.310> chase<00:01:44.610> off<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.970> wall

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
bounce kind of bounce chase off the wall

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
bounce kind of bounce chase off the wall
and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.170> all<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.350> compatible<00:01:46.829> with

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and this will all be compatible with

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.010 
and this will all be compatible with
that<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.340> master/slave<00:01:48.000> mode<00:01:48.030> as<00:01:48.329> well

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
that in master/slave mode as well

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.380 
that in master/slave mode as well
and<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.189> said<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.490> wireless<00:01:50.700> uses<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
and like you said it's wireless uses the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.450 
and like you said it's wireless uses the
the<00:01:51.750> beef<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.990> system<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.439> i<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.100> use<00:01:53.219> any

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
the beef I system so i can use any

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.499 
the beef I system so i can use any
controller<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.149> i<00:01:54.179> have<00:01:54.359> whatever
