00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
college ball playing at BYU and then

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490 
college ball playing at BYU and then
taking<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> next<00:00:42.090> step<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:43.050> something

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
taking that next step that's something

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
taking that next step that's something
that<00:00:43.610> they<00:00:44.610> found<00:00:44.820> difficult<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.719> kind<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that they found difficult or you kind of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
that they found difficult or you kind of
take<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.530> almost<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.890> you've<00:00:47.010> taken<00:00:47.160> it

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
take it it's almost like you've taken it

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.580 
take it it's almost like you've taken it
in<00:00:47.460> stride<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.149> point<00:00:48.420> yeah<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.260> mean<00:00:49.440> it's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in stride at this point yeah I mean it's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
in stride at this point yeah I mean it's
a<00:00:49.770> difficult<00:00:49.950> transition<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a difficult transition but you know you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.939 
a difficult transition but you know you
just<00:00:51.960> kind<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.469> take<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> stride

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
just kind of have to take it in stride

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.430 
just kind of have to take it in stride
and<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and you have to you know just know that

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.720 
and you have to you know just know that
it's<00:00:55.949> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> take<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> lot<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> hard<00:00:56.699> work

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's going to take a lot of hard work

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.029 
it's going to take a lot of hard work
and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> biggest

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
and I think one of the biggest

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.840 
and I think one of the biggest
differences<00:00:59.039> between<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.430> college<00:00:59.670> game<00:00:59.789> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
differences between the college game and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.250 
differences between the college game and
