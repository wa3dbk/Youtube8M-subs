00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.740 

functionality<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.820> number<00:01:42.180> one<00:01:42.360> because

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
functionality is number one because

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.190 
functionality is number one because
safety<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.320> involved<00:01:43.710> looks<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.840> close

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
safety is involved looks is right close

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.310 
safety is involved looks is right close
