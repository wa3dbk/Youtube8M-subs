their great power transfer again one of
the<00:00:49.440> reasons<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.859> a<00:00:49.979> great<00:00:50.190> entry-level

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the reasons this is a great entry-level

the reasons this is a great entry-level
fitness<00:00:51.149> skate<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.409> they<00:00:52.589> are

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
fitness skate and then they are

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
fitness skate and then they are
laterally<00:00:53.489> adjustable<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.269> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.389> adjust

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
laterally adjustable so you can adjust

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.379 
laterally adjustable so you can adjust
the<00:00:55.109> frames<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.339> Custom<00:00:56.760> Fit<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.239> of

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:57.389 
the frames to get that Custom Fit out of

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.419 
the frames to get that Custom Fit out of
them<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> great<00:00:58.050> boot<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.069> this<00:00:59.249> is

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
them which is great boot on this is

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.039 
them which is great boot on this is
vented<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.179> can<00:01:00.359> tell<00:01:00.569> there's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.839> great

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
vented as you can tell there's a great

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:02.599 
vented as you can tell there's a great
amount<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.350> venting<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> skate<00:01:02.280> itself

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
amount of venting on the skate itself

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.219 
amount of venting on the skate itself
provide<00:01:03.179> great<00:01:03.449> air<00:01:03.600> flow<00:01:03.629> coming<00:01:04.110> through

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
provide great air flow coming through

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.080 
provide great air flow coming through
the<00:01:04.409> skate<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.159> nice<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:06.060> are

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090

the skate which is nice and they are
anatomically<00:01:06.870> molded<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.620> you're<00:01:07.770> gonna<00:01:07.860> have

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
anatomically molded so you're gonna have

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.040 
anatomically molded so you're gonna have
good<00:01:08.280> contours<00:01:08.910> that<00:01:08.940> reach<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.480> provide

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.050 
good contours that reach up provide

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.900 
good contours that reach up provide
excellent<00:01:10.620> support<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.370> back<00:01:11.610> here

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
excellent support on the back here

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.700

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
especially with this nice thick cuff

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.430 
especially with this nice thick cuff
which<00:01:14.610> isn't<00:01:14.760> going<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.150> too<00:01:15.180> too<00:01:16.170> thick

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
which isn't going to be too too thick

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.230 
which isn't going to be too too thick
but<00:01:16.980> then<00:01:17.100> again<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
skate the liner inside of this is the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.970 
skate the liner inside of this is the
specialized<00:01:23.730> 5<00:01:24.180> star<00:01:24.510> fit<00:01:24.540> liner<00:01:24.870> which<00:01:25.740> means

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
separate of the shell to provide an even

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.880 
separate of the shell to provide an even
more<00:01:30.120> dynamic<00:01:30.300> fit<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.380> memory<00:01:31.680> foam

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
more dynamic fit and the memory foam

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.310 
more dynamic fit and the memory foam
inside<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.790> does<00:01:33.090> still<00:01:33.540> contour<00:01:34.050> to
