00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
is that there's no way to kill these

I<00:01:41.409> don't<00:01:42.100> understand<00:01:42.640> why<00:01:42.789> this<00:01:42.850> level<00:01:43.329> comes

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
I don't understand why this level comes

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.179 
I don't understand why this level comes
in<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.719> middle<00:01:44.049> Donkey<00:01:44.560> Kong<00:01:44.740> is<00:01:44.770> released

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
in the middle Donkey Kong is released

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.679 
in the middle Donkey Kong is released
from<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.430> cage<00:01:45.729> so<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.180> would<00:01:46.390> think<00:01:46.420> that

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
from the cage so you would think that

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.420 
from the cage so you would think that
this<00:01:46.899> will<00:01:47.020> be<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.170> end<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.590> game<00:01:47.799> but

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
this will be the end of the game but

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.700 
this will be the end of the game but
this<00:01:48.640> stage<00:01:48.909> comes<00:01:49.240> at<00:01:49.359> the<00:01:49.479> end<00:01:49.659> you<00:01:50.380> ascend

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
this stage comes at the end you ascend

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.590 
this stage comes at the end you ascend
this<00:01:50.829> level<00:01:51.219> similar<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.909> first<00:01:52.119> level<00:01:52.509> in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
this level similar to the first level in
