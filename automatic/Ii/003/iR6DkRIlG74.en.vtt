two millimeter wetsuit and what makes it

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
two millimeter wetsuit and what makes it
high<00:00:11.370> performance<00:00:11.969> is<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.599> use<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> materials

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
high performance is the use of materials

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.709 
high performance is the use of materials
and<00:00:13.889> construction<00:00:14.490> what<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.910 
proprietary neoprene from body 11 as you
can<00:00:22.500> see<00:00:22.740> it's<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.340> gummy<00:00:24.740> additionally<00:00:25.740> if

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
can see it's very gummy additionally if

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
can see it's very gummy additionally if
you<00:00:26.279> look<00:00:26.519> at<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.699> actual<00:00:27.090> construction<00:00:27.420> we

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you look at the actual construction we

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.019 
you look at the actual construction we
don't<00:00:28.380> have<00:00:28.560> any<00:00:28.830> seams<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> underarm

a superstretch neoprene wetsuit like

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
a superstretch neoprene wetsuit like
this<00:00:37.230> much<00:00:37.620> easier<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.219> in<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> as

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
this much easier to get in and out of as

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.299 
this much easier to get in and out of as
well<00:00:39.840> as<00:00:40.020> move<00:00:40.260> around<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> get<00:00:41.040> less

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
well as move around so you get less

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is a four-way stretch neoprene the scene

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.810 
is a four-way stretch neoprene the scene
is<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:49.110> sealed<00:00:49.469> its<00:00:49.829> first<00:00:50.399> glued

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
is actually sealed its first glued

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.630 
is actually sealed its first glued
together<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.870> blind<00:00:52.260> stitched<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:53.100> blind

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
together and then blind stitched a blind

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400

stitch<00:00:53.940> does<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.390> penetrate<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> way

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
stitch does not penetrate all the way

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.049 
stitch does not penetrate all the way
through<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.829> only<00:00:55.949> goes<00:00:56.160> halfway<00:00:56.520> through

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
through it only goes halfway through

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
through it only goes halfway through
that<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.170> water<00:00:58.559> leakage<00:00:58.980> in

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that way you don't have water leakage in

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
that way you don't have water leakage in
the<00:00:59.219> sea<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> nice<00:01:00.420> sealed<00:01:00.750> seen

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the sea so we have a nice sealed seen

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.719 
the sea so we have a nice sealed seen
here<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:02.219> collar<00:01:02.600> we<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> great<00:01:04.049> um

you have the same mesh in panel as you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
you have the same mesh in panel as you
did<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> front<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> both<00:01:43.170> wind
