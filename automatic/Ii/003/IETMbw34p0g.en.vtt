00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.350
 in contrast to the complexity of 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.340
 1,029 the sukhoi su-25 freud food is a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.110
 pretty simple plane 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.730
 is designed to operate in the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.730
 dangerous environment of low levels 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.170
 as a light attack aircraft in an era 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.850
 in which most of the aircraft of 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.090
 combat have been designed with the currency 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.780
 taller faster farther the sukhoi 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.650
 s 125 was designed with the closest plus 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.720
 low and quieter this plane is a s 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.280
 a twenty-eight frankfurt version of 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.520
 single-seater combat training 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.860
 of attack s 25 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.800
 the nickname of NATO is that of Freud Food 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.670
 and each frog but the Russian pilots 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.670
 they call rook 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.530
 it's a close support aircraft you'll be 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.170
 used to knock out 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.810
 the enemy battle tanks is a 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.550
 low trencher fighter and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.480
 fight in support of ground forces 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.370
 almost as eladio so buster to use and 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.350
 its history goes back to the second 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.900
 world war when the Soviet Union 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.670
 he developed the sturmovik a very airplane 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.670
 hard and robust ground attack 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.960
 the one in su-25 looks like a cross between the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.360
 jaguar skin to 10 is smaller and almost 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.060
 lighter half that although 10 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.920
 their missions are similar 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.030
 [Music] 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.130
 like in the a 10 the sukhoi s a 25 is 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.810
 well protected with the pilot sitting 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.229
 inside a shielding tub of 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.229
 titanium 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.510
 its armament includes a two- tube cannon 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.890
 30 millimeters in the bow that can beat 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.890
 light armored vehicles 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.000
 the wings can carry up to 8 pumps 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.130
 500 kilograms or missiles the fort hood is 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.849
 he employed in combat in afghanistan starting 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.160
 of 1980 the mujahideen knew him as 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.989
 the german reactor a little man 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.370
 current due to the poor aim of 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.860
 the other bombing reactors 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.620
 Soviet 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.390
 the from food however was respected and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.020
 dreaded as a very attack aircraft 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.910
 powerful 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.400
 the biggest enemy of frob food in 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.700
 afghanistan was the portable missile as the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.770
 American stinger this plane is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.280
 flown by colonel alexandr roots coi 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.820
 that in 1965 was shot down in another Ford 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.430
 food for a stinger 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.799
 [Music] 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.480
 to counter this threat it 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.300
 they added flare launchers in the 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.179
 rear of the plane 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.179

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.050
 an infrared guide missile detects the

 heat of the motor novels 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.890
 the flares create false images 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.230
 thermal that confuse the visible

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.310
 in addition to the basic attack version 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.640
 there are training versions of the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.030
 frob food as the s a 28 coach 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.200
 polyvalent he is the 28 is is 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.700
 becoming the reactor of 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.709
 standardized training for 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 Russian aviators replacing the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.140
 old mi-17 useful is a stable airplane and 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.849
 reliable very appropriate for the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.470
 training that is also used 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.269
 to train the first generation 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.849
 of naval aviators for the new 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.900
 Russian aircraft carrier especially in the 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.000
 training in the difficult 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.000
 score skills with hook
