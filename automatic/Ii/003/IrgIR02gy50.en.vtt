 of that or put a 500gb hard drive 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.250
 when they knew that the games have 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.590
 to install in the console and we're going 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.080
 when you buy you have six or seven 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.210
 games or a little more we go the hard drive 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.090
 it's already full full bar 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.250
 And if you add apart, if you buy from 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 Sometimes stories let's go fill 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.440
 disk at once stable so for 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.890
 I was a shit start that the ps4 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.899
 twist had 500 gigs all is the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.970
 second model that will come out worth is the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.610
 pc 4 model c 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.580
 1200 weigh less than the current console 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.560
 and until the least electricity the button 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.200
 of ignition and to remove the discs already 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.570
 it will not be electrostatic but there will be 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.790
 than press it to work this 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.430
 model will have 500 gb things 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.290
 I understand kids and it will go on sale in 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.460
 September the price will be the same as 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.920
 the one on the current console and now here 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.140
 we say and what console we bought were going 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.110
 to leave two models as to see by 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.150
 example in my case I would buy the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.250
 capacity cloth console let's go 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.649
 because the clear if you have a lot of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.810
 games and you are going to fill the hard drive 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.060
 then I would buy from a 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.860
 capacity fabric over comes out on 15 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.570
 July so you guys buy us 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.270
 no console until July 15 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.790
 but then clear it depends already for likes 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.080
 if you're not going to buy in many games 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.450
 of pc 4 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.730
 let 's you'll have it that three or 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.370
 four or five games because like 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.760
 you deserve more the other 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.590
 model that will consume less energy 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.600
 but that is already for each case the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.430
