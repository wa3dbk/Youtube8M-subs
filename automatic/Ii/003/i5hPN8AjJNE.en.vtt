00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.740
 hi guys and guys I hope you are very 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.170
 well I will notice that today's video 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.630
 It will be a little different from what I have 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.850
 accustomed because this time they 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.370
 give my opinion about 50 shades of gray 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.750
 but the movie is not the book so you 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.640
 I ask that you stay until the end of 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.920
 video and once you've seen it tell me 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.220
 if you agree with me or not so 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.280
 let's go with the video 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.280
 ah 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.830
 Well the first thing I want to tell you is 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.080
 that I read the book and I was surprised that 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.000
 I would have liked it so much since I am a 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.310
 man and how will you know the general opinion 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.370
 of people is to say that the book is 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.260
 made for future women sexually and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.840
 that if you are a man and you read it 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.090
 you probably get the case 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.370
 I really liked this book so it 's 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.650
 waiting for the movie with enough 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.010
 expectation now you can see it I must say 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.510
 that has your abnormal you know in the first 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.060
 instead the film moves at a rhythm 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.280
 frantic yes yes I know that by wearing a 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.970
 528 page book to the screen 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.490
 big 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.320
 it's normal that they omit things but like me 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.910
 I see him they took away much in the mystic 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.500
 that I had the book I for example 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.490
 I spent the first 20 minutes of the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.490
 movie like this 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.270
 since due to the accelerated pace of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.830
 the movie at 20 minutes and the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.780
 stay had interviewed cristian 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 he had found it from weather and 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.010
 they had done the session of another session of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.120
 photos that lasted a minute and that I'm 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.310
 sure that women would have 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.170
 dear that will last a little longer at 20 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 minutes already they had also almost kissed 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.830
 after drinking coffee and having the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.670
 incident with the cyclist and most 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.770
 funny 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.710
 anaya had gotten drunk and vomited 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.960
 that is , this signature bases the film 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.310
 jumping from one scene to another apparently 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.140
 very abruptly 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.450
 they also skipped parts of the book that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 I liked that they appeared so 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.990
 Then the scenes that come 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.369
 from my point of view I think that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.100
 They should have come out of the movie 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.750
 first the departure of ana I made up to take 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.280
 beer number 2 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.860
 the cake speech in the recording 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.990
 number 3 an insistence that always 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.270
 I had cristian so that ana would eat something 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.670
 number 4 in the book cristian has to 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.500
 aberri and gives him another year but in the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.050
 movie he has an iphone though 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.480
 normal because honestly nobody has 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.370
 a blackberry at this time number 5 the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.150
 negotiation of the contract was supposed to 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.340
 they made it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.769
 private room of a hotel restaurant 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.110
 there is no cristian 06 company 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.090
 they showed so many sex scenes but not 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.240
 they showed the only one in which cristian 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.880
 let it win it happy a thousand views 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.260
 you know what I mean 0 7 no 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.350
 They showed the meeting with the gynecologist 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.690
 they just mentioned it 08 they did not 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.160
 reference to that she was not wearing panties 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.560
 when they met with the family of 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.300
 cristian so probably those that 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.030
 they did not read the book they did not give 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.590
 account 9 did not show interviews to 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.960
 the ones I earned to look for work 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.420
 after graduating from college 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.850
 10 we did not meet Mrs. Jones the mistress 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.740
 of keys of cristian 11 did not mention 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.900
 the private 10 that did not grow Christian 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.270
 stay when this visit sylvain 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.010
 where his mother of 12 and did not show either 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.840
 how cristian took care that in the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.570
 Anastasia flight will be transferred to 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.940
 first class 13 showed when 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.610
 cristian visits ana in georgia but not 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.590
 showed that she stayed that night in 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.720
 the hotel where he was staying 11 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.610
 to 14 they showed us when at the end of 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.850
 do it insult and they tell you 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.850
 textually 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.799
 about the movie just tells him that he does not know 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.930
 approach you number 15 do not show the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.000
 gift that anastasia leaves cristian before 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.250
 to leave your apartment good now 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.680
 decide the things that I'm glad you do not 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.750
 have come out in the movie but not 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.260
 they showed as hernÃ¡n after losing 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.510
 virginity makes him his first 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.310
 Christian relationship but two do not 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.190
 they showed the part in which cristian 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.810
 account to which he was going to whores and who 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.299
 that's how he learned to do things 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.480
 who knows how to make six girls in bed 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.070
 cristian was going on whores number three no 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.350
 has shown the part where they have 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.039
 relationships even though anastasia 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.550
 they are with the rule thank you for that and already 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.550
 just those three things 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.889
 I am also sure that all the 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.069
 people who did not read the book and 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.569
 that they thought was only about sex and 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.789
 sadomasochism now with this movie 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.319
 they will have been quite convinced of 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.479
 this for this because in the 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:42.240
 movie focuses a lot on the part of 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.520
 section and health more and I know that sex 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.229
 is a fundamental part of the book but I 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.690
 I think they should have given it more importance 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:51.270
 to the romantic details that they have 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.889
 Christians with anna details like when 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.900
 you give them daily to these at first 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.729
 class that also with replacement of at 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.280
 side so that nobody feels right to 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:01.379
 between a controlling gesture but at the same time 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.539
 tender should also have emphasized 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.280
 more in the elegance of cristian as per 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.440
 example the tastes are taken for the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.780
 classical music and for the same things that 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.240
 he loves them as well as he has 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.759
 proved more the exchange of mail 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.319
 sexy and tender that they had cristian and 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.940
 anna in the movie it appeared that 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.530
 they spoke way is talking about that 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.719
 They should have shown one of the 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.940
 mail that is very important to the 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:26.639
 history where they walk the cristian day 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.349
 point by point all the fears that 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.460
 have one of which is that the 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.699
 trial period 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.590
 of three things that I do not remember have 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.509
 I said in the movie that I was scared 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.190
 that after that time christian to 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.590
 leave what he answers from a 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.590
 very tender way telling him that he was 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.389
 willing to lengthen it while loving 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.400
 I would like to prove to the conclusion the 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.069
 movie is aimed at those who read 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.990
 the book and everything you probably read 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.330
 do not understand many of the things that 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.130
 I personally prefer the book 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.410
 since imagination has no limits 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.080
 I clarify that the book does not leave any 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.729
 personal message neither to overcome nor 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.669
 nothing like that the book looks for 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:08.009
 entertain and awaken eroticism and what 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.870
 he achieves I am normal laughed and they want to read it 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.430
 I suggest you do it using a 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.770
 application called one 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.720
 so you can read it from a cell phone or 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.910
 from a tablet with the advantage that 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.889
 can leave comments and discuss the 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.990
 parts of the book that they are calling 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.970
 the attention and good this was the day of 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.340
 the week if you liked it do not forget to give it 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.979
 click the button I like and subscribe 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.409
 clicking on this other button doing 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.759
 those two things you help me too much in 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.830
 the comments can leave me your 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.639
 opinion about the movie and also if 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.770
 they want me to do 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:39.210
 a criticism about another movie at the end 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.650
 from the next video I will put the 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.180
 comments you like best 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.830
 good and considering that many of 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.199
 you have been asking me for greetings 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.039
 I have decided to create the section greetings to 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.029
 community 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.029
 so greetings to 

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:58.379
 buzzi and paraguay lacked some 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.789
 dismissals for fast and that well the greeting 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:01.770
 for the next video now in 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.449
 go ahead I will do this section of greetings to 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.889
 end of all my videos I like and now 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.749
 onwards if they want to be greeted by 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.759
 end of the videos is to ask for a favor and 

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:11.099
 I hope there are not many euros ask 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:13.439
 by twitter sending a tweet to the channel 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.240
 with the numeral the fifth baton greets me 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:17.580
 I do it for convenience because for me it is 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.650
 easier to catch in all those numerals 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.819
 and once you put them in the video because 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.279
 while our comments 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:25.139
 youtube or on facebook I like it very much 

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:27.620
 So, it seems to me that this is more 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:27.620
 organized 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:34.000
 If I am the contra week, we will return 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.010
 with the normal content of the channel is 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.140
 say that the other week there will be videoblog 

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.030
 within two weeks of news and 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.530
 within three other episodes of france 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.000
 for put on social networks 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.740
