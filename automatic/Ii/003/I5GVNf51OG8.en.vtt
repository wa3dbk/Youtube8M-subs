00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.750 

but<00:01:09.840> that's<00:01:10.080> why<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:10.770> practice<00:01:11.340> races

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
but that's why there are practice races

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.180 
but that's why there are practice races
after<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.690> there<00:01:13.140> isn't<00:01:13.320> perhaps<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
after all and there isn't perhaps a

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.250 
after all and there isn't perhaps a
better<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.940> assess<00:01:15.480> one's<00:01:15.810> performance

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
better way to assess one's performance

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.540 
better way to assess one's performance
than<00:01:16.680> sail<00:01:17.010> close<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.610> one's<00:01:17.820> rivals

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.390 

this<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.870> is<00:01:22.110> easier<00:01:22.620> to<00:01:22.680> realize<00:01:23.130> how

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this way it is easier to realize how

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.150 
this way it is easier to realize how
fast<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.180> may<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.260> here<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> Poland's

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160
