00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.850
 hello everyone dad with you today like me 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.460
 and promised we compare ipod shuffle 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.769
 ipod nano first we look at them 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.200
 boxes box ipod shuffle almost on 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:22.750
 a third less box need cat let's 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.140
 now move on to the ipod device itself 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.060
 shuffle 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.029
 very small compared to the ipod 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.520
 it is necessary and it gives him some advantages 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.739
 which there is no ipod on on both 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.809
 devices have a clip thanks to them you 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.449
 be able to wear both devices on clothes 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.559
 or fasten one of the pluses on the strap 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.030
 ipod shuffle 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.030
 and he is his minus 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.249
 at the same time that he has no screen + me 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.350
 is ease of management we can 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.739
 manage and then despite it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.440
 but minus is what we can't find out 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.839
 song title and another plus my breathing 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.299
 this is the top panel on which is located 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.429
 one key voice control 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.159
 however much to also on this top 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.710
 the panel is a headphone jack and 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.730
 cottages which will show included where you have 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.570
 ipod shuffle 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.220
 or is it now discharged + ipod nano then 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.980
 what is he going to not only from 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.080
 computer but also from the outlet as opposed to 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.310
 ipod shuffle which we can charge 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.180
 only from computer 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.790
 also a plus ipods on it is 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.590
 screen but again it is it 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.140
 minus we can look at the title 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.170
 songs watch playlists name 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 see beautiful pictures of albums and 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.700
 much more on the screen but cons 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.140
 because we can't manage 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.719
 music is not looking at ipod and it is not 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.390
 very convenient if you did not buy ipod 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.820
 nano myself for whatever purposes like doing 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.860
 cheat sheets even willingly but you can 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.929
 can be used as a clock of age 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.079
 just attach to the strap and wear on 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.880
 arm and these were the main pros and cons 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.729
 ipod shuffle 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.140
