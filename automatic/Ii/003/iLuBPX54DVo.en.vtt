going<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.290> take<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.500> look<00:00:04.740> at<00:00:05.040> how<00:00:05.250> they

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
going to take a look at how they

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.880 
going to take a look at how they
transfer<00:00:05.850> files<00:00:06.120> wirelessly<00:00:06.810> to<00:00:07.170> your<00:00:07.200> Nexus

7 transferring files to the Nexus 7 can

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.780 
7 transferring files to the Nexus 7 can
be<00:00:11.670> difficult<00:00:12.179> especially<00:00:12.620> since<00:00:13.790> sometimes

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
be difficult especially since sometimes

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.570 
be difficult especially since sometimes
it<00:00:15.030> requires<00:00:15.360> third-party<00:00:16.049> software

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
it requires third-party software

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.300 
it requires third-party software
specifically<00:00:17.580> on<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> Mac<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:19.310> sometimes

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
specifically on the Mac and sometimes

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.029 
specifically on the Mac and sometimes
the<00:00:20.580> USB<00:00:21.029> cable<00:00:21.210> isn't<00:00:21.570> available<00:00:22.410> whether

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
the USB cable isn't available whether

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.950 
the USB cable isn't available whether
you've<00:00:23.340> lost<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> cable<00:00:24.539> doesn't<00:00:24.720> work

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
you've lost it or the cable doesn't work

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.279 
you've lost it or the cable doesn't work
so<00:00:26.599> transferring<00:00:27.599> files<00:00:27.750> through<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so transferring files through the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.990 
so transferring files through the
network<00:00:28.619> makes<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.170> process<00:00:31.170> rather<00:00:31.439> easy<00:00:32.000> so

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
network makes the process rather easy so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.780 
network makes the process rather easy so
the<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.300> step<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.780> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.440> be

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
the first step is going to be

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
the first step is going to be
