00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.270
 Steffen and I show you today like you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 saved system passwords from mac 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.019
 os can read 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.150
 that means saved fighters from one 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.219
 keychain such as your w 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.859
 lan cares if you forget that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.830
 should have and go first 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.699
 We now in the enemies and there in 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.099
 the folder program and then in the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 we give the folder utilities and 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 Here we find the keychain 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.769
 administration if he is very foul 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.210
 You can also just be up here 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.460
 go to spotlight and here after 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.629
 Keyword administration so do i 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.180
 Of course, there is something else I know 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.309
 search that is in the case my wlan 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.860
 that is, if you are yours from that 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.360
 wlan what you want to search then you can 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.280
 you just enter them up here 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.660
 now in the search box alternatively if 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.550
 her just for a wireless password 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.199
 wanted to search times yours 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.719
 you simply have system stores here 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.530
 at the top of the airport 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.820
 and now I see here for example 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 that's what I am 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 wanted to search and that's the word of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.460
 become fbi surveillance 13 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 that means I click on it and 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.360
 would like to show the camp 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.650
 tip once my account password one 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.130
 what i use on my computer 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.130
 to register 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.110
 tell me okay , you know that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.970
 test 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.680
 Now, for example, I have camper 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.600
 changed from my wlan and now can 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.049
 I simply enter the new password 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.790
 here fitness new scans changes 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.290
 secure and that 's it in principle already 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.619
 that is now the new quarter 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.329
 secured in it and your computer should 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.860
 then it will be hotspot with the wlan 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.500
 Alternatively, you can connect 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.060
 simply detach the request and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.159
 so it shall again anyway in 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.689
 ask for a password if you like that 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.570
 next time with your wlan access point 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.360
 Of course you wanted to connect what you are doing here 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.829
 in it also can still search are 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.590
 general application would come to 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.670
 example from google chrome stores 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.369
 his fighters saved by his 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.899
 in here from or safari, too 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.310
 So if I'm after now 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.399
 I would need a few facebook searches 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.689
 entries to facebook find exactly her 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.819
 I show them now better 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.319
 but not in general you can now 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.730
 here also that camper to watch what 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.430
 saved from a facebook account 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.470
 is indeed that was it already again 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.569
 if you still have any questions 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.930
 have writes write the comments 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.520
 write to e mail and if you like that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.170
 has liked a nice video 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.170
