00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:19.850
 and I would describe my personal style as 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.540
 constantly changing I think that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.600

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.690
 country like canada where so many people arrive 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.390

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.530

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.300
 When I'm with friends, some coffee came out 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.840
 to have lunch something where I do not have to walk 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.180
 running so much I have a very converse 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.220
 basic white one without cane that I feel 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.619
 that uses more leg I have about 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.500
 jeans that I'm obsessed with this 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.759
 style jeans the boy boy fanning that is 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.300
 as wider 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.920
 I have a shirt they go long with a 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.720
 I play a coral color that I am 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.780
 literally exceptional with this color 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.550
 and I also have I think I have more than 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 these caps than any other kind of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.780
 I run in Spanish 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.850
 and I take care of my skin there are many ways to 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.210
 take care of herself is to always take 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.030
 water but it's more than I know nothing but 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.980
 it is true that water is essential 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.980
 the skin as bright and departÃ­a eat 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.570
 well what you eat it shows in your 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.560
 body only in your hair if not so much 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.040
 Smiles 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.650
 do sport also this look what 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.810
 I would use a day that I am very for a day 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.040
 of meetings but a look where I'm not going to 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.080
 have time to get to my house and I'll 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.660
 to go out later with my friends have 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.550
 some shoes some booties with a cue 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:11.470
 very comfortable black shorts skirts there 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.180
 a vest neither big as loose and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.830
 the wreath of flowers 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.140
 I like the pastel colors that it has 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.859
 like they bring the whole look and like 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.560
 they close them with grace 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:26.420
 this is a look for the night to 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.450
 an event that I have to wear a 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.389
 bit easier a little bit more 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.239
 elegant and it's my version of dress by 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:39.379
 say it like that, an entire with a pattern 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.260
 I love the sampler then it comes 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.239
 with a white cross top with black 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.010
 combine with many prints that I 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:52.269
 I put as an aero as a means 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.230
 of futuristic good this is my room 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.540
 look is the look that sports have as 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.500
 the basic sports your closet is 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.180
 essential today exists as fashion 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.129
 of being skinny but I think that sport 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.959
 goes far beyond that as to 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.090
 clean energy and to be living a 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.269
 healthy life then match with some 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.549
 good sneakers with good support 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.890
 good support for jogging shoes 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.190
 I like the circuit tighter 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.930
 a t-shirt also of the same style with 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.150
 the same fabric very comfortable to make 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.220
 sport and I really like the box 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.459
 soils levels of cardio to transpire 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.870
 and obviously that also after a 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.970
 long session of sport how do you have to 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.500
 Take care of your skin, clean it again 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.170
 moisten it and take care of it as 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.260
 corresponds 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.349
 well this is my look number 5 is a 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.420
 look more at night is a night look 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.489
 as a rocker for the jacket as for 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.950
 iker I like this jacket because I have 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.920
 a colorful pattern with bananas 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.160
 half crazy different with a 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.610
 tube dress with the face of a 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.170
 black leopard and the shoes are 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.840
 us about how to have a taco 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.540
 delgadito but they have like their good 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.330
 I grab a purple lip and I feel that 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.160
 is identifying me a lot lately 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.910
 and a tomato to close like a look 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.850
 other than brown super simple hair 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.290
 a tomato like shock like more more 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.130

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.130
 the messy
