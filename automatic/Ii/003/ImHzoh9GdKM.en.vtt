clipper over comb as we've stated in the
past<00:00:22.830> when<00:00:23.189> we<00:00:23.400> work<00:00:23.580> with<00:00:23.730> clipper<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.180> comb

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
past when we work with clipper over comb

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.870 
past when we work with clipper over comb
we<00:00:24.900> want<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.410> hold<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.859> comb<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.279> an<00:00:26.369> angle<00:00:26.730> if

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
we want to hold the comb at an angle if

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
we want to hold the comb at an angle if
you<00:00:27.029> hold<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> comb<00:00:27.740> horizontally<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.220> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you hold the comb horizontally and you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.890 
you hold the comb horizontally and you
zip<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:29.789> all<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.150> hair<00:00:30.269> hanging<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
zip off all the hair hanging out of the

zip off all the hair hanging out of the
comb<00:00:31.230> you're<00:00:31.560> gonna<00:00:31.650> leave<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> step<00:00:32.250> ledge

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610

Ridge<00:00:32.940> or<00:00:33.210> demarcation<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.739> want<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.219> work

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
Ridge or demarcation so we want to work

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.100 
Ridge or demarcation so we want to work
at<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.640> angle<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.210> there's<00:00:36.390> two<00:00:36.630> techniques

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
at an angle and there's two techniques

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.470 
at an angle and there's two techniques
we<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> use<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.430> cameraman<00:00:38.760> zooms<00:00:39.270> in

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
we want to use as the cameraman zooms in

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
we want to use as the cameraman zooms in
here<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.079> two<00:00:40.320> techniques<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:41.040> want<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.340> look

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
here the two techniques we want to look

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.779 
here the two techniques we want to look
at<00:00:41.700> our<00:00:41.969> cross<00:00:42.450> cutting<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:44.430> cutting

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
at our cross cutting and up cutting

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
at our cross cutting and up cutting
notice<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.780> both<00:00:45.989> techniques<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.770> comb<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
notice in both techniques the comb is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.029 
notice in both techniques the comb is
held<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.520> an<00:00:47.579> angle<00:00:47.910> cross<00:00:48.570> cutting<00:00:49.140> involves

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
held in an angle cross cutting involves

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.610 
held in an angle cross cutting involves
cutting<00:00:50.280> across<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.270> comb<00:00:51.510> with<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> clipper

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
cutting across the comb with the clipper

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.610 
cutting across the comb with the clipper
blade<00:00:52.770> moving<00:00:53.309> 90<00:00:53.820> degrees<00:00:54.239> or<00:00:54.620> perpendicular

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
to the comb teeth that's cross cutting

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.029

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.690 
cross-cutting cross cutting up cutting
as<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:03.300> name<00:01:03.480> implies<00:01:04.129> involves<00:01:05.129> moving<00:01:05.610> the

as the name implies involves moving the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.719 
as the name implies involves moving the
Clipper<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.470> parallel<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.830> teeth<00:01:08.100> think
