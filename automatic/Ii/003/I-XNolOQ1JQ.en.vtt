exactly all right point nine three eight
it's<00:03:29.900> not<00:03:30.019> very<00:03:30.200> much<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.739> yeah<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:32.330> you

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
it's not very much is it yeah if you

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.110 
it's not very much is it yeah if you
want<00:03:32.630> to<00:03:33.220> light<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> light<00:03:34.489> bulb<00:03:34.700> we're<00:03:35.030> gonna

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
want to light a light bulb we're gonna

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.509 
want to light a light bulb we're gonna
need<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.330> lot<00:03:35.420> more<00:03:35.480> than<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.870> right<00:03:36.110> yeah<00:03:36.709> so

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
need a lot more than that right yeah so

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.750 
need a lot more than that right yeah so
what<00:03:38.060> do<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.209> think<00:03:38.420> we're<00:03:38.540> gonna<00:03:38.600> do<00:03:38.900> next

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.970 

connect<00:03:43.760> them<00:03:43.970> all<00:03:44.000> together<00:03:44.380> exactly<00:03:45.380> all

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
connect them all together exactly all

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.470 
connect them all together exactly all
right<00:03:46.130> here<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.400> go<00:03:46.549> we're<00:03:47.000> going<00:03:47.150> for<00:03:47.360> more

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
right here we go we're going for more

00:03:47.480 --> 00:04:03.940 
right here we go we're going for more
power

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:14.240 

we're<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.010> finished<00:04:05.250> now<00:04:12.860> you<00:04:13.860> want<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.040> test

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
we're all finished now you want to test

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.069 
we're all finished now you want to test
it

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.159 

let's<00:04:21.680> see<00:04:21.829> you<00:04:21.919> tested<00:04:22.340> even<00:04:25.840> good<00:04:26.840> job<00:04:27.020> is

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
let's see you tested even good job is

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:28.809 
let's see you tested even good job is
that<00:04:27.319> does<00:04:27.650> it<00:04:27.800> feel<00:04:27.949> stronger<00:04:28.460> than<00:04:28.610> they<00:04:28.699> did

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
that does it feel stronger than they did

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.059 
that does it feel stronger than they did
before<00:04:29.020> let's<00:04:30.020> see<00:04:30.199> how<00:04:30.319> much<00:04:30.440> stronger<00:04:30.740> it<00:04:31.039> is

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
before let's see how much stronger it is

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.749 
before let's see how much stronger it is
even<00:04:31.970> why<00:04:32.090> don't<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.330> connect<00:04:32.690> up<00:04:32.949> the<00:04:33.949> the

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
even why don't you connect up the the

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:50.559 
even why don't you connect up the the
machine<00:04:47.650> alright<00:04:48.650> we're<00:04:49.370> getting<00:04:49.580> somewhere

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
machine alright we're getting somewhere

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:52.779 
machine alright we're getting somewhere
close<00:04:51.229> to<00:04:51.259> three<00:04:51.830> volts<00:04:52.310> two<00:04:52.580> and

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
close to three volts two and

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:59.170 
close to three volts two and
three-quarters<00:04:53.300> volts<00:04:53.979> very<00:04:54.979> good<00:04:57.849> now<00:04:58.849> I

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
three-quarters volts very good now I

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.649 
three-quarters volts very good now I
want<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.199> boys<00:05:00.409> to<00:05:00.650> explain<00:05:01.190> to<00:05:01.340> me<00:05:01.490> how<00:05:01.699> it

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
want you boys to explain to me how it

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:12.490 
want you boys to explain to me how it
works<00:05:09.639> all<00:05:10.639> right<00:05:10.849> guys<00:05:11.090> I<00:05:11.419> want<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.139> to<00:05:12.289> tell

works all right guys I want you to tell

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:42.070 
works all right guys I want you to tell
me<00:05:12.680> why<00:05:13.389> this<00:05:14.389> works

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.409 

very<00:05:42.469> good<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.009> see<00:05:43.520> Isaac<00:05:43.729> you<00:05:44.090> want<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.300> see

very good I see Isaac you want to see

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.059 
very good I see Isaac you want to see
you<00:05:44.539> want<00:05:44.690> to<00:05:44.719> see<00:05:44.840> okay<00:05:45.169> Lovato<00:05:45.440> despite<00:05:45.949> our

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
you want to see okay Lovato despite our

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:49.180 
you want to see okay Lovato despite our
best<00:05:46.250> efforts<00:05:46.520> we<00:05:47.029> were<00:05:47.419> unable<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.960> get<00:05:48.770> our

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
best efforts we were unable to get our

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.070 
best efforts we were unable to get our
lemon<00:05:49.789> battery<00:05:50.150> to<00:05:50.330> power<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.690> flashlight

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
lemon battery to power a flashlight

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.670 
lemon battery to power a flashlight
light<00:05:51.860> bulb<00:05:52.099> or<00:05:52.639> a<00:05:52.699> clock<00:05:53.240> or<00:05:53.840> really<00:05:54.409> anything

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
light bulb or a clock or really anything

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.950 
light bulb or a clock or really anything
and<00:05:55.129> I<00:05:55.520> think<00:05:55.729> a<00:05:55.759> lot<00:05:56.029> of<00:05:56.060> it<00:05:56.240> had<00:05:56.389> to<00:05:56.419> do<00:05:56.659> with

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
and I think a lot of it had to do with

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.080 
and I think a lot of it had to do with
the<00:05:57.740> wires<00:05:57.979> we<00:05:58.279> were<00:05:58.430> attempting<00:05:58.759> to<00:05:58.789> attach

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
the wires we were attempting to attach

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.519 
the wires we were attempting to attach
these<00:05:59.330> were<00:05:59.479> able<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.020> really<00:06:00.229> make<00:06:00.349> good

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
these were able to really make good

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.070 
these were able to really make good
contact<00:06:01.099> but<00:06:01.940> we<00:06:02.060> were<00:06:02.180> able<00:06:02.360> to<00:06:02.690> at<00:06:03.020> least

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
contact but we were able to at least

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.110 
contact but we were able to at least
measure<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:04.159> amount<00:06:04.400> of<00:06:04.460> electricity<00:06:04.789> that

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
measure the amount of electricity that

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.700 
measure the amount of electricity that
was<00:06:05.240> coming<00:06:05.599> out<00:06:05.690> of<00:06:05.750> those<00:06:05.960> wires<00:06:06.229> using<00:06:06.590> the

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
was coming out of those wires using the

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.709 
was coming out of those wires using the
voltmeter<00:06:07.090> anyway<00:06:08.090> I<00:06:08.120> hope<00:06:08.270> that<00:06:08.449> was<00:06:08.569> good

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
voltmeter anyway I hope that was good

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.919 
voltmeter anyway I hope that was good
enough<00:06:08.900> and<00:06:09.110> thank<00:06:09.440> you<00:06:09.560> for<00:06:09.680> your<00:06:09.770> time
