00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
there's a really really long cord so if

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.549 
there's a really really long cord so if
you<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.879> outlets<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:51.989> very<00:00:52.170> far<00:00:52.530> from

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you have outlets that are very far from

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.400 
you have outlets that are very far from
mirror<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.789> are<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.239> luck<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:54.930> this

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
mirror you are in luck because this

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.450 
mirror you are in luck because this
thing<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.860> stretch<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.430> far<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:58.460> there's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
thing can stretch pretty far and there's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
thing can stretch pretty far and there's
also<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> swivel<00:01:00.149> cord<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.570> makes<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.899> very

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
also a swivel cord which makes it very

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.310 
also a swivel cord which makes it very
easy<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.680> use<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:03.210> cord<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.110> turn

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
easy to use so this some cord can turn

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.859 
easy to use so this some cord can turn
around<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.750> very

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
around like that so you know it's very

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.539 
around like that so you know it's very
easy<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.350> move<00:01:07.710> around<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.420> startup<00:01:09.420> time<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
easy to move around the startup time is

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
easy to move around the startup time is
under<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> minute<00:01:11.909> probably<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.540> heats<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
under a minute probably it heats up to

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.219 
under a minute probably it heats up to
380<00:01:13.650> degrees<00:01:13.880> but<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.939> believe<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.750> can<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.200> up

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
380 degrees but I believe it can go up

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.219 
380 degrees but I believe it can go up
to<00:01:17.210> 420<00:01:18.710> 430<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.400> which<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.540> hot<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.080> don't

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
to 420 430 I which is very hot I don't

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.870 
to 420 430 I which is very hot I don't
think<00:01:22.259> I've<00:01:22.409> ever<00:01:22.439> gone<00:01:23.070> up<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.369> far<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
think I've ever gone up that far but

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.460 
think I've ever gone up that far but
you're<00:01:24.450> curling<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.840> hair<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.140> might<00:01:25.200> want
