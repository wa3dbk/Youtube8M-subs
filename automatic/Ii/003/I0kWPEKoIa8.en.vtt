 Welcome to a new video here 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.940
 heads training

 I am stock I show you this today 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.559
 very interesting and indeed a new one 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.610
 console recording device from terratec but 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.380
 I will not only show what 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.599
 exactly is what you do with it everything 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.580
 but can still recognize today in 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.320
 win this video such a device 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.859
 That's why the video looks to the end 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.240
 and good luck I sang 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.310
 As mentioned before, I would like to thank you 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.460
 device from terratec 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.320
 the grips text remady with that could 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.759
 just new console gameplay 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.070
 record something special 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 this product is without a pc it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.559
 means you can just directly for it 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.540
 save a hard disk 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.550
 that the big advantage of the like you 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.100
 see from the playstation xbox or from the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.829
 pc around the whole in high definition though 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.579
 even in full hd well then you can 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.110
 here is some information 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.940
 read through for those who like it 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 want and in the description is 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.480
 of course, a link to the terratec 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.149
 Side itself can do it all over again 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 read exactly what this device is all 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 for special details and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.699
 specifications has because they just still 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.780
 otherwise I wanted to know exactly 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.970
 short description just stop 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.450
 Gameplay from console can not be direct 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 in 1080p record without a pc or synonymous with 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.080
 Of course, pc software is also for 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.610
 the pc thereby the whole is as said 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.049
 from terratec you also have facebook and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 twitter of which everything is below in the 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.650
 description smoke and yes I want to say 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.740
 Let's start looking at something 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.240
 in the whole packaging is in it and 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.009
 Although we have a relatively normal here 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 easy packing just a very very 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.630
 Well secured in a carton 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.890
 there should not break anything and Japan 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.810
 then we can see that right away 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.400
 device itself that is very very small 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.220
 this little black box up here 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.869
 the main unit comes just then 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.299
 the signal in and out and we in the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.490
 background already extremely much accessories 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.770
 I'll come back to it now 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.180
 but each individual cable is yours 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.100
 see one cable on the other 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.930
 we get out of here you can with the device like that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.909
 how it gets started right away 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.479
 and record directly or just hold it 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.460
 use 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 you just maybe need another one 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 hdmi cable but mostly have at home 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.430
 otherwise everything is actually there 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.200
 a little cruise guide few others 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.299
 things and of course the software 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.970
 for video editing and video recording 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.979
 if you wanted to do that in front 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.200
 we have two switches at the top, namely 27 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.190
 1080p and to analog 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.470
 between different modes 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.030
 I also like to switch over 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.890
 why does he still have that, of course 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.450
 Recording button in the middle of a usb 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.459
 slot on the left even 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.410
 a microphone input and a few lamps 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.569
 the run show what fashion you are in right now 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.790
 time in the back then we have a hdmi 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.950
 h in and cars with hdmi directly 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.720
 connect or for the ps3 the analogue 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.050
 then to come in contact 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.450
 equal 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.640
 yes, that was very much the device at all 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 small then to the accessories here of course 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.060
 a power plug is it whole 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.470
 device also gets electricity are too 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.540
 important then you have one 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.069
 extension cable for your microphone 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.569
 or for headphones for example 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.680
 can use that are completely normal 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.959
 car or jack plug 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.549
 extension cable and could actually 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.130
 use every day whether for body or 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.170
 otherwise something completely net this is then 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.450
 important for the ps3 is a hd 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.680
 components cable the ps3 could unfortunately 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.780
 only via hd components cable 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.180
 thereafter, terratec has nothing 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.860
 but the ps3 has one 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.900
 copy protection over hdmi that means this 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.640
 make with this cable but it is 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.349
 everything in the scope and he 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.180
 could start right away then you have 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.769
 another converter of these 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.739
 components on a small connection 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.660
 the whole thing is not going to be that much and 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.750
 remains compact then you have one more 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.180
 small micro usb connection that could 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.459
 then put the device in the pc 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.590
 recommend so a hdmi cable wanted it 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.280
 you can also take socks with you 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.590
 if you want that 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.230
 if yes, a xbox main he needed 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.630
 of course two hdmi cable one except 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.310
 xbox one then watch TV 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.480
 actually nothing was needed with the ps3 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.250
 more because everything is actually in 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.750
 scope of delivery here again the 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.430
 small boxes again the things 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.120
 explained to the ps3 that all 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.370
 components cable then a hdmi cable hd 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.139
 components converter then we have 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.380
 of course the software then we have 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.459
 stream and a few other smaller ones 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.160
 things like the plug for 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.569
 the pc itself and yes that was still from 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.010
 the most important part you have inside 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.470
 can find and now even then 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.239
 a few comparisons and while holding 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.970
 still very good 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.069
 working hdp before autumn already 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.419
 a little older but I think so 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.680
 anyway that the difference from the 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.120
 size and of the subsequent 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.169
 extremist and that just gets so small 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.110
 is small black actually comes 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:25.419
 found everywhere 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.159
 do not extend to her see and yes 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.960
 very pleasant because it is also very easy 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.300
 is and takes up little space then 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.219
 we come to the big advantage of course 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.719
 takes the wonderful beautiful videos 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.669
 But the big advantage of this device 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:38.289
 you can do it directly from the usb 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.180
 make a drive you do not need a computer 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.550
 turn on power up but take 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.840
 put your usb stick in and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.120
 press the record button in the 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.620
 middle of these triangles and you finished 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.990
 can also do about hard drives 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.490
 as I said no pc start up no pc 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.129
 do not plug in a program on the pc 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.729
 start but press directly on it and 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.860
 take up 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.969
 No more needed and yes that was it 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.680
 already for this video 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:02.110
 I have the device for some time 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.520
 days and weeks tested and find it 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.860
 very very good i have a little too 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.599
 resume for you and while it is positive 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.889
 Of course, you heard a lot inside you 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.169
 many connections are you can too 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.229
 directly over hdmi do the whole thing 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.849
 also for 1080p edition software for 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.490
 Video editing and recording is also 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.629
 while the pc updates can be 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.159
 very easy to live that is when it is 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:23.620
 times problems should give the whole 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.819
 usually solved by an update is a 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.639
 very small light device of course 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:29.349
 also positive the recording over the usb 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.190
 stick and over the hard disk that is 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.659
 the most important 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.729
 that makes it different from his 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:36.849
 competition and it really is extremely school 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.139
 and super-practical edition up to 1080p 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.020
 just stop and work with 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.449
 playstation xbox pc goes on and on 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.729
 really very versatile negative thing 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.889
 I just stopped while testing 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.330
 The device is always the whole one 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.650
 flashing that means it has such a front 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.750
 little green light that always brings 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.189
 the knew of his fixed date for the 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.750
 you can put it that way somehow 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:57.759
 that it does not rain show you 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.319
 there is still a small problem that the 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:01.210
 Software only for windows is that is 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.889
 mac user will not be so happy 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.449
 you just can not do that 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.529
 Video editing program has just 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.419
 but we can use anyway 

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:10.180
 of course record because as I said you 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.689
 does not need a pc for purchase recommendation 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:15.789
 yes in any case it is as I said 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:17.139
 just a very good alternative to 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.520
 all other devices and we 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:21.550
 of course had the big advantage 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.770
 that he just stops without a pc too 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.240
 You can also use good water 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.770
 actually to the main video you like 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.289
 promised that comes now synonymous 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.029
 win and you can do that 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.069
 with all the accessories at so often in the 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:34.150
 video showed winners and two 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.310
 originally packed 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.800
 Terratec was not only so friendly to us 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.750
 a device for testing, etc 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.730
 with given but also another 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.230
 we 'll give it to you then 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.970
 can and of course like to
