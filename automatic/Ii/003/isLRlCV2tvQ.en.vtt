00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
have fall for it be created Bethesda but

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.600 
have fall for it be created Bethesda but
you're<00:01:46.049> definitely<00:01:46.259> pre<00:01:46.950> producing<00:01:47.430> right

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you're definitely pre producing right

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.990 
you're definitely pre producing right
now<00:01:47.640> Elder<00:01:48.509> Scrolls<00:01:48.869> 6<00:01:49.170> no<00:01:50.159> okay<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.850> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
now Elder Scrolls 6 no okay this is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.639 
now Elder Scrolls 6 no okay this is
another<00:01:51.240> argument<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:51.960> get<00:01:52.140> quite<00:01:52.320> often

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
another argument that I get quite often

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.620 
another argument that I get quite often
and<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.250> don't<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.909> possible<00:01:54.420> at<00:01:54.509> all

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and I don't think it's possible at all

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.499 
and I don't think it's possible at all
how<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> game<00:01:56.100> unannounced<00:01:56.909> not

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
how you can have a game unannounced not

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.270 
how you can have a game unannounced not
out<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> door<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.200> start<00:01:58.469> pre-production<00:01:59.219> on

out the door and start pre-production on

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.819 
out the door and start pre-production on
another<00:01:59.610> game<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:01.200> totally

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
another game that's just that's totally

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.870 
another game that's just that's totally
shooting<00:02:02.130> yourself<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> foot<00:02:02.610> you're

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
shooting yourself in the foot you're

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.670 
shooting yourself in the foot you're
putting<00:02:03.210> putting<00:02:03.479> resources<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.259> another

putting putting resources in another

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.420 
putting putting resources in another
game<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> don't<00:02:05.430> even<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:05.880> thing

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
game when you don't even have one thing

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.660 
game when you don't even have one thing
it's<00:02:07.030> just<00:02:07.420> not<00:02:07.810> possible<00:02:08.440> okay<00:02:08.740> its<00:02:09.190> Bethesda

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
it's just not possible okay its Bethesda

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.370 
it's just not possible okay its Bethesda
being<00:02:09.880> enough<00:02:10.060> studio<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:10.479> develop<00:02:10.990> two<00:02:11.170> games

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
being enough studio to develop two games

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.770 
being enough studio to develop two games
at<00:02:11.560> once<00:02:11.770> yeah<00:02:12.370> most<00:02:12.700> likely<00:02:12.790> they<00:02:13.210> are<00:02:13.360> but

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
at once yeah most likely they are but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.420 
at once yeah most likely they are but
they<00:02:13.870> are<00:02:13.930> also<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.290> studio<00:02:14.710> who<00:02:14.980> makes<00:02:15.190> great

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
they are also a studio who makes great

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.310 
they are also a studio who makes great
games<00:02:15.760> because<00:02:16.150> they<00:02:16.300> concentrate<00:02:16.930> all<00:02:17.140> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
games because they concentrate all the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.010 
games because they concentrate all the
studio's<00:02:17.710> effort<00:02:18.070> into<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:18.670> single<00:02:19.420> game<00:02:19.570> you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
studio's effort into one single game you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.380 
studio's effort into one single game you
take<00:02:20.200> new<00:02:20.440> be<00:02:20.590> soft<00:02:20.830> for<00:02:21.010> example<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.640> they

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
take new be soft for example and they

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.620 
take new be soft for example and they
split<00:02:22.660> up<00:02:22.810> into<00:02:23.310> million<00:02:24.310> studios<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.060> they

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
split up into million studios and they

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.940 
split up into million studios and they
all<00:02:25.840> work<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.260> separate<00:02:26.650> parts<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
all work on separate parts of the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.440 
all work on separate parts of the
project<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.520> since<00:02:27.640> there's<00:02:27.850> not<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.180> one

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
project and since there's not this one

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.450 
project and since there's not this one
cohesive<00:02:28.810> vision<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.470> all<00:02:29.830> doesn't<00:02:30.070> work<00:02:30.280> out

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
cohesive vision it all doesn't work out

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.070 
cohesive vision it all doesn't work out
so<00:02:30.640> naturally<00:02:31.120> that's<00:02:31.240> why<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.390> think<00:02:31.660> Bethesda

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
so naturally that's why I think Bethesda

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.600 
so naturally that's why I think Bethesda
likes<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.410> stick<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.830> one<00:02:33.040> project<00:02:33.250> at<00:02:33.580> a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
likes to stick with one project at a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.580 
likes to stick with one project at a
time<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.270> studio<00:02:34.540> that's<00:02:35.260> just<00:02:35.470> my

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
time in the studio that's just my

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.080 
time in the studio that's just my
thoughts<00:02:35.860> though<00:02:36.100> because<00:02:36.460> like<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.880> said

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
thoughts though because like I said

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240 
thoughts though because like I said
that's<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.420> constant<00:02:37.930> piece<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.860> argument

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
that's a constant piece of the argument

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.620 
that's a constant piece of the argument
that's<00:02:39.430> always<00:02:39.550> thrown<00:02:39.850> at<00:02:39.970> me<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
that's always thrown at me but the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.630 
that's always thrown at me but the
bottom<00:02:41.080> line<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.770> honestly<00:02:42.100> think

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
bottom line is that I honestly think

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.240 
bottom line is that I honestly think
that<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.870> really<00:02:44.230> boils<00:02:44.530> down<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.920> its

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
that all it really boils down to is its

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.670 
that all it really boils down to is its
fallouts<00:02:45.700> turn<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:47.170> put<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.530> you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
fallouts turn and that you put it you

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.860 
fallouts turn and that you put it you
have<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.190> include<00:02:48.370> Elder<00:02:48.880> Scrolls<00:02:49.180> online<00:02:49.360> I'm

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
have to include Elder Scrolls online I'm

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.870 
have to include Elder Scrolls online I'm
at<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.140> huge<00:02:50.500> Elder<00:02:50.800> Scrolls<00:02:51.070> fan<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.430> well<00:02:51.459> and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
at a huge Elder Scrolls fan as well and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.030 
at a huge Elder Scrolls fan as well and
I<00:02:52.390> still<00:02:52.810> consider<00:02:53.050> Elder<00:02:53.590> Scrolls<00:02:53.890> online

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
I still consider Elder Scrolls online

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.860 
I still consider Elder Scrolls online
even<00:02:54.520> though<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:54.850> not<00:02:55.000> my<00:02:55.209> favorite<00:02:55.570> game<00:02:55.720> in

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
even though it's not my favorite game in

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.000 
even though it's not my favorite game in
the<00:02:55.930> world<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.320> it's<00:02:56.440> probably<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> least

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
the world and it's probably the least

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.830 
the world and it's probably the least
favorite<00:02:57.310> Elder<00:02:57.550> Scrolls<00:02:57.820> game<00:02:58.000> ever<00:02:58.209> created

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
favorite Elder Scrolls game ever created

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.660 
favorite Elder Scrolls game ever created
it's<00:02:59.230> still<00:02:59.560> another<00:02:59.770> Scrolls<00:03:00.220> game<00:03:00.459> it's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
it's still another Scrolls game it's

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.940 
it's still another Scrolls game it's
still<00:03:00.970> considered<00:03:01.600> by<00:03:01.990> Bethesda<00:03:02.440> which<00:03:02.830> is

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
still considered by Bethesda which is

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.949 
still considered by Bethesda which is
the<00:03:03.010> most<00:03:03.190> important<00:03:03.610> fact<00:03:03.850> aid<00:03:04.300> with<00:03:04.540> an

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
the most important fact aid with an

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.290 
the most important fact aid with an
Elder<00:03:05.320> Scrolls<00:03:05.650> game<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.400> naturally<00:03:07.030> that's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
Elder Scrolls game so naturally that's

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.400 
Elder Scrolls game so naturally that's
supposed<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.630> be<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> long-term<00:03:08.140> project

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
supposed to be a long-term project

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.009 
supposed to be a long-term project
whether<00:03:08.740> it's<00:03:08.860> failing<00:03:09.490> or<00:03:09.640> not<00:03:09.820> whether<00:03:10.780> it's

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
whether it's failing or not whether it's

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.420 
whether it's failing or not whether it's
about<00:03:11.200> to<00:03:11.350> go<00:03:11.440> free-to-play<00:03:11.890> or<00:03:12.010> not<00:03:12.160> which<00:03:12.310> is

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
about to go free-to-play or not which is

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.400 
about to go free-to-play or not which is
the<00:03:12.459> latest<00:03:12.820> rumor<00:03:13.209> which<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.959> lot<00:03:14.110> of<00:03:14.200> people

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
the latest rumor which a lot of people

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.190 
the latest rumor which a lot of people
have<00:03:14.500> been<00:03:14.590> waiting<00:03:14.709> for<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:16.300> I<00:03:16.480> think<00:03:16.720> that's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
have been waiting for and I think that's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.330 
have been waiting for and I think that's
one<00:03:17.470> other<00:03:17.620> thing<00:03:17.860> that<00:03:17.890> we<00:03:18.040> have<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.190> mention

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
one other thing that we have to mention

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.190 
one other thing that we have to mention
is<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:18.880> Elder<00:03:19.510> Scrolls<00:03:19.750> online<00:03:19.870> going

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
is that Elder Scrolls online going

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.990 
is that Elder Scrolls online going
free-to-play<00:03:20.709> believe<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.550> or<00:03:21.640> not<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.910> will

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
free-to-play believe it or not that will

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.910 
free-to-play believe it or not that will
bring<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.510> lot<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.930> people<00:03:23.230> when<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.680> nicely

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
bring in a lot of people when the nicely

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.830 
bring in a lot of people when the nicely
public<00:03:24.610> online<00:03:25.209> or<00:03:25.450> whatever<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.780> called

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
public online or whatever it's called

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.740 
public online or whatever it's called
The<00:03:26.080> Old<00:03:26.440> Republic<00:03:26.580> when<00:03:27.580> free-to-play<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.300> had

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
The Old Republic when free-to-play I had

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.630 
The Old Republic when free-to-play I had
to<00:03:28.900> try<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.140> out<00:03:29.320> because<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.739> loved<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.519> Old

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
to try it out because I loved the Old

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.030 
to try it out because I loved the Old
Republic<00:03:30.820> series<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:32.200> brought<00:03:32.500> me<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.800> and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
Republic series and it brought me in and

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.310 
Republic series and it brought me in and
I<00:03:33.100> played<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.519> lot<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.660> naturally<00:03:35.290> I

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
I played it a lot and so naturally I

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.449 
I played it a lot and so naturally I
think<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.980> same<00:03:36.100> thing<00:03:36.160> will<00:03:36.430> happen

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
think that the same thing will happen

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.340 
think that the same thing will happen
with<00:03:36.730> Elder<00:03:37.209> Scrolls<00:03:37.480> online<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.840> bringing<00:03:38.290> a

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
with Elder Scrolls online and bringing a

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.130 
with Elder Scrolls online and bringing a
lot<00:03:38.500> more<00:03:38.530> people<00:03:39.130> so<00:03:39.550> I<00:03:39.820> think<00:03:39.970> Bethesda<00:03:40.750> has

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
lot more people so I think Bethesda has

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.360 
lot more people so I think Bethesda has
the<00:03:41.290> feeling<00:03:41.650> right<00:03:41.800> now<00:03:41.950> that<00:03:42.130> they<00:03:42.280> don't

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
the feeling right now that they don't

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.979 
the feeling right now that they don't
need<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.760> make<00:03:42.850> another<00:03:43.120> Elder<00:03:43.510> Scrolls<00:03:43.780> game

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
need to make another Elder Scrolls game

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.020 
need to make another Elder Scrolls game
for<00:03:44.200> a<00:03:44.230> while<00:03:44.290> we've<00:03:44.890> had<00:03:45.100> Skyrim<00:03:45.550> we've<00:03:45.850> had

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
for a while we've had Skyrim we've had

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.520 
for a while we've had Skyrim we've had
Elder<00:03:46.300> Scrolls<00:03:46.540> online<00:03:46.660> it's<00:03:47.140> fall<00:03:47.380> it's

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
Elder Scrolls online it's fall it's

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.750 
Elder Scrolls online it's fall it's
turned<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:47.980> know<00:03:48.040> this<00:03:48.310> should<00:03:48.489> sound<00:03:48.670> like

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
turned and I know this should sound like

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.509 
turned and I know this should sound like
a<00:03:48.850> big<00:03:49.269> reiteration<00:03:50.200> but<00:03:50.709> it's<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:50.980> comment

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
a big reiteration but it's a comment

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.920

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
getting a lot and I figured it's a topic

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.580
