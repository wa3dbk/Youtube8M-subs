northern<00:00:25.529> end<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.390> bookie<00:00:27.390> Valley<00:00:27.710> was<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
northern end of the bookie Valley was to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.990 
northern end of the bookie Valley was to
see<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.789> kind<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.949> reaction<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.340> see

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
see what kind of reaction we get see

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.319 
see what kind of reaction we get see
what<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> traffic<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:35.030> we<00:00:36.030> know

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
what kind of traffic is there we know

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.080 
what kind of traffic is there we know
that<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.810> come<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.340> spooky<00:00:38.850> Valley

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that they come and go from spooky Valley

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.660 
that they come and go from spooky Valley
and<00:00:39.420> therefore<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.989> should<00:00:40.230> probably<00:00:40.640> try<00:00:41.640> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
and therefore we should probably try to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.549 
and therefore we should probably try to
figure<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.090> where<00:00:42.449> their<00:00:42.719> trails<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.410> their

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
figure out where their trails are their

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.689 
figure out where their trails are their
egress<00:00:44.100> from<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.550> valley<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.160> might

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
egress from the valley is it also might

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.310 
egress from the valley is it also might
give<00:00:47.940> us<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:49.350> idea<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.570> locations<00:00:51.570> if

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
give us a good idea of the locations if

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.189 
give us a good idea of the locations if
one<00:00:52.680> recorder<00:00:53.250> picks<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.199> vocalization

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
one recorder picks up the vocalization

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.450 
one recorder picks up the vocalization
and<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:56.309> next<00:00:56.609> one's<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> don't<00:00:58.250> then<00:00:59.250> we

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and the next one's to it don't then we

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.080 
and the next one's to it don't then we
know<00:00:59.640> about<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.809> cross<00:01:01.109> through

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
know about where they cross through

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
know about where they cross through
another<00:01:03.090> thing<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> might<00:01:03.690> give<00:01:04.140> us<00:01:04.320> an

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
another thing it might give us an

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.800 
another thing it might give us an
indication<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.700> how<00:01:06.060> many<00:01:06.120> was<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
indication as to how many was in the

indication as to how many was in the
group<00:01:07.050> that<00:01:07.080> came<00:01:07.560> down<00:01:07.860> off<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> mountain

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600

they were to figure out that the pouch

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.320 
they were to figure out that the pouch
opens<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:41.340> court<00:01:41.670> required<00:01:42.120> can<00:01:42.300> be

put up six recorders this way and we had
some<00:01:54.240> interesting<00:01:54.390> results<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.530> which<00:01:55.710> I'll

several weeks before this was a second
pouch<00:02:53.090> however<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.989> managed<00:02:55.469> to<00:02:55.620> retrieve<00:02:56.219> it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
pouch however we managed to retrieve it

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.839 
pouch however we managed to retrieve it
we<00:02:56.670> found<00:02:56.999> it<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.319> sitting<00:02:58.859> on<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:59.010> branch<00:02:59.400> a

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
we found it it was sitting on a branch a

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.899 
we found it it was sitting on a branch a
good<00:03:00.480> 50<00:03:00.870> yards<00:03:01.230> away<00:03:01.379> from<00:03:01.829> where<00:03:02.069> we<00:03:02.249> where

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
good 50 yards away from where we where

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.009 
good 50 yards away from where we where
we<00:03:02.939> had<00:03:03.329> placed<00:03:03.599> it

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
we had placed it

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.170 
we had placed it
I<00:03:04.340> had<00:03:05.340> ripped<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.540> pouch<00:03:07.139> out<00:03:07.499> of<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.889> tree

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
I had ripped the pouch out of the tree

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.319 
I had ripped the pouch out of the tree
screws<00:03:09.180> and<00:03:09.389> all<00:03:09.829> now<00:03:10.829> we<00:03:10.889> still<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.819> lot

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
screws and all now we still have a lot

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.410 
screws and all now we still have a lot
of<00:03:12.359> audio<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.650> listen<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.310> because<00:03:14.700> that's<00:03:14.879> six

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
of audio to listen to because that's six

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.190 
of audio to listen to because that's six
recorders<00:03:16.290> with<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.739> week's<00:03:17.099> worth<00:03:17.459> of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
recorders with a week's worth of

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.470 
recorders with a week's worth of
stop-and-go<00:03:19.200> recording<00:03:20.099> so<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:21.120> going<00:03:21.359> to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
stop-and-go recording so it's going to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.449 
stop-and-go recording so it's going to
take<00:03:21.659> us<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> long<00:03:22.200> time<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.650> get<00:03:22.980> all<00:03:23.189> the<00:03:23.340> way

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
take us a long time to get all the way

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.220 
take us a long time to get all the way
through<00:03:23.760> all<00:03:23.999> of<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:25.370> various<00:03:26.370> recorders

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
through all of the various recorders

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.110 
through all of the various recorders
however<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.349> will<00:03:28.739> be<00:03:28.920> able<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.219> report<00:03:29.730> that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
however I will be able to report that

however I will be able to report that
each<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.629> every<00:03:31.079> recorder<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.980> was<00:03:32.040> put<00:03:32.519> up

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
each and every recorder that was put up

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.920 
each and every recorder that was put up
had<00:03:33.900> Sal<00:03:34.319> has<00:03:34.799> sounds<00:03:35.489> on<00:03:35.639> it<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:36.420> sounds

we really don't know what it was I mean
it<00:03:52.859> could<00:03:53.099> have<00:03:53.189> been<00:03:53.359> deer<00:03:54.359> sniffing<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:54.989> for

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
it could have been deer sniffing it for

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.420 
it could have been deer sniffing it for
all<00:03:55.290> we<00:03:55.529> know<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.609> it's<00:03:57.359> an<00:03:57.629> interesting

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
all we know but it's an interesting

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.909 
all we know but it's an interesting
experience<00:03:59.430> with<00:03:59.730> interesting<00:04:00.510> results<00:04:01.109> now

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
experience with interesting results now

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.739 
experience with interesting results now
if<00:04:02.069> we<00:04:02.249> do<00:04:02.489> make<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:02.999> all<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.239> way<00:04:03.359> through<00:04:03.389> our

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:03.749 
if we do make it all the way through our

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:05.300 
if we do make it all the way through our
recorders<00:04:04.379> and<00:04:04.590> find<00:04:04.829> something<00:04:05.129> that's

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
recorders and find something that's

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.500 
recorders and find something that's
really<00:04:06.060> your<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.629> interesting<00:04:07.939> it's<00:04:08.939> like

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
really your really interesting it's like

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.780 
really your really interesting it's like

like<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:11.909> we<00:04:12.659> will<00:04:12.840> certainly<00:04:13.230> share<00:04:14.189> that

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
like that we will certainly share that

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.960 
like that we will certainly share that
with<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:15.139> so<00:04:16.139> our<00:04:16.290> preliminary<00:04:16.820> results<00:04:17.820> of

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
with you so our preliminary results of

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.300 
with you so our preliminary results of
every<00:04:18.359> recorder<00:04:19.049> having<00:04:19.500> sounds<00:04:19.889> on<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.130> like

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
every recorder having sounds on it like

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.690 
every recorder having sounds on it like
it<00:04:20.519> was<00:04:20.669> being<00:04:20.880> tampered<00:04:21.209> with<00:04:22.310> leads<00:04:23.310> us<00:04:23.460> to

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
it was being tampered with leads us to

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.630 
it was being tampered with leads us to
the<00:04:24.150> wild<00:04:24.540> speculation<00:04:25.380> really<00:04:25.740> was<00:04:26.370> there<00:04:26.610> a

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
the wild speculation really was there a

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.170 
the wild speculation really was there a
Bigfoot<00:04:27.240> at<00:04:27.420> all<00:04:27.570> six<00:04:27.930> recorders<00:04:28.620> if<00:04:29.550> so<00:04:29.820> was

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
Bigfoot at all six recorders if so was

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.240 
Bigfoot at all six recorders if so was
it<00:04:30.210> one<00:04:30.600> Bigfoot<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.290> was<00:04:31.500> running<00:04:31.890> behind

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
it one Bigfoot that was running behind

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.230 
it one Bigfoot that was running behind
us<00:04:32.460> following

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
us following

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.660

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
all the way down the mountain as we put

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.330 
all the way down the mountain as we put
up<00:04:35.760> three<00:04:35.910> quarters<00:04:36.380> were<00:04:37.380> there<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.710> team<00:04:38.100> of

and saw us coming down the road and
relayed<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.210> the<00:04:45.330> next<00:04:45.630> team<00:04:46.040> it's<00:04:47.040> really

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
relayed it to the next team it's really

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.710 
relayed it to the next team it's really
hard<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.240> say<00:04:49.100> this<00:04:50.100> is<00:04:50.430> opening<00:04:50.880> up<00:04:51.090> some<00:04:51.360> real

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
hard to say this is opening up some real

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
hard to say this is opening up some real
good<00:04:52.230> new<00:04:52.800> stuff<00:04:53.900> however<00:04:54.900> looking<00:04:55.470> at<00:04:55.590> it

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
good new stuff however looking at it

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.700 
good new stuff however looking at it
from<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.070> skeptical<00:04:56.730> side<00:04:57.260> maybe<00:04:58.260> there<00:04:58.560> was

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
from the skeptical side maybe there was

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.900 
from the skeptical side maybe there was
a<00:04:58.740> deer<00:04:59.250> or<00:04:59.580> raccoon<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.780> every<00:05:01.320> position<00:05:02.250> that

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
a deer or raccoon in every position that

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.840 
a deer or raccoon in every position that
was<00:05:03.210> went<00:05:03.960> up<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.230> sniffed<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:04.800> like<00:05:04.950> the

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
was went up and sniffed and like the

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.930 
was went up and sniffed and like the
recorder<00:05:06.420> or<00:05:06.570> something<00:05:06.990> like<00:05:07.140> that<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:08.100> we

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
recorder or something like that so we

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.220 
recorder or something like that so we
still<00:05:09.210> have<00:05:09.390> no<00:05:09.570> proof<00:05:09.600> as<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.800> what<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.040> was
