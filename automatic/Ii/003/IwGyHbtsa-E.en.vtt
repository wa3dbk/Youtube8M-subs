of<00:00:56.520> Tom's<00:00:56.760> hand<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.480> he<00:00:57.629> would<00:00:57.780> have<00:00:57.870> fit<00:00:58.079> in

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
of Tom's hand or he would have fit in

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.139 
of Tom's hand or he would have fit in
his<00:00:58.320> hand<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> know<00:00:58.949> basically<00:00:59.730> that's<00:01:00.000> how

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
his hand you know basically that's how

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.340 
his hand you know basically that's how
big<00:01:00.359> he<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.660> finished<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> little

guess<00:02:50.640> they<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.940> go<00:02:51.090> all<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.269> way<00:02:51.329> around<00:02:51.450> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
guess they can go all the way around I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.690 
guess they can go all the way around I
just<00:02:52.709> feel<00:02:52.829> like<00:02:52.920> I'm<00:02:53.040> going<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.250> break<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.579> so

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
just feel like I'm going to break it so

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.440 
just feel like I'm going to break it so
I<00:02:53.730> don't<00:02:53.879> really<00:02:53.940> want<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.209> move<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.390> all

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
I don't really want to move it all

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.759 
I don't really want to move it all
around<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.959> looks<00:02:55.109> like<00:02:55.200> it<00:02:55.319> can<00:02:55.470> do<00:02:55.620> that

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
around but it looks like it can do that

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.220 
around but it looks like it can do that
and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.549> his<00:02:56.790> tail<00:02:57.090> looks<00:02:57.959> like<00:02:58.079> it's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
and then it his tail looks like it's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.110 
and then it his tail looks like it's
just<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.650> bendy<00:02:59.190> doesn't<00:02:59.489> necessarily

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just more like bendy doesn't necessarily

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.940 
just more like bendy doesn't necessarily
have<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> join<00:03:01.170> doesn't<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.560> move<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.890> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
have a join doesn't really move all the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.410 
have a join doesn't really move all the
way<00:03:02.010> around<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:02.879> is<00:03:02.970> definitely<00:03:03.299> like

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
way around but it is definitely like

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.240 
way around but it is definitely like
flexible<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.019> bendy<00:03:04.319> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.129> see

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
flexible and bendy and then you can see

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.800 
flexible and bendy and then you can see
his<00:03:05.340> legs<00:03:05.549> actually<00:03:06.120> his<00:03:06.390> feet<00:03:06.599> are<00:03:06.720> actually

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
his legs actually his feet are actually

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.259 
his legs actually his feet are actually
really<00:03:07.230> cool<00:03:07.440> right<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.159> his<00:03:08.609> legs<00:03:08.909> do

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
really cool right here and his legs do

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.780 
really cool right here and his legs do
some<00:03:09.450> kind<00:03:09.659> of<00:03:09.720> weird<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.500> don't<00:03:11.459> know<00:03:11.519> they

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
some kind of weird I don't know they

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.369 
some kind of weird I don't know they
kind<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.150> turn<00:03:12.420> all<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.659> way<00:03:12.690> around<00:03:12.989> it's

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
kind of turn all the way around it's

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.979 
kind of turn all the way around it's
kind<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.709> odd<00:03:14.010> though<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.760> then<00:03:15.390> also<00:03:15.629> he's

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
kind of odd though and then also he's

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.050 
kind of odd though and then also he's
got<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.470> belly<00:03:17.040> swivel<00:03:17.489> when<00:03:17.790> was<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:17.940> last

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
articulation here and it's like I mean

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.020 
articulation here and it's like I mean
if<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.590> really<00:03:49.949> want<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.220> try<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.609> do<00:03:50.849> two

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
if you really want to try to do two

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.339 
if you really want to try to do two
hands<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.359> can't<00:03:51.629> because<00:03:51.840> obviously<00:03:52.260> he

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
hands you can't because obviously he

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.379 
hands you can't because obviously he
can't<00:03:52.560> do<00:03:52.650> anything<00:03:52.829> with<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.250> hand<00:03:53.519> as<00:03:53.760> you

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
can't do anything with one hand as you

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.720 
can't do anything with one hand as you
can<00:03:54.540> see<00:03:54.750> it's<00:03:55.079> weird<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.250> then<00:03:56.459> he's<00:03:56.549> also

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
can see it's weird and then he's also

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.809 
can see it's weird and then he's also
got<00:03:57.690> his<00:03:57.840> block<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.230> cheese<00:03:58.379> here<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.549> mean

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
got his block of cheese here and I mean

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.250 
got his block of cheese here and I mean
I<00:03:59.910> guess<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.629> want<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.870> stretch<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.109> you

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
I guess so if you want to stretch it you

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.349 
I guess so if you want to stretch it you
know<00:04:01.440> he<00:04:01.560> probably<00:04:01.769> could<00:04:02.129> sort<00:04:02.910> of<00:04:02.970> hold<00:04:03.209> that

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
know he probably could sort of hold that

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:04.819 
know he probably could sort of hold that
it's<00:04:03.569> not<00:04:03.780> very<00:04:04.019> stable<00:04:04.319> though

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
it's not very stable though

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.610 
it's not very stable though
alright<00:04:05.699> here's<00:04:05.970> Tom<00:04:06.329> my<00:04:06.720> boy<00:04:06.900> right<00:04:07.199> here<00:04:07.440> and

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
alright here's Tom my boy right here and

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.699 
alright here's Tom my boy right here and
you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.129> see<00:04:08.310> that<00:04:08.459> he<00:04:08.639> has<00:04:08.989> the<00:04:09.989> same<00:04:10.230> kind<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
you can see that he has the same kind of

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.650 
you can see that he has the same kind of
wacky<00:04:10.980> articulation<00:04:11.940> and<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.299> can<00:04:12.419> see<00:04:12.540> his

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
wacky articulation and you can see his

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.170 
wacky articulation and you can see his
arms<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.079> can<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:13.379> see<00:04:14.000> how<00:04:15.000> their

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
don't know if it belongs in there or

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.530 
don't know if it belongs in there or
whatever<00:05:46.530> but<00:05:46.919> yeah<00:05:47.460> you<00:05:47.970> guys<00:05:48.120> can<00:05:48.330> be<00:05:48.419> the

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
whatever but yeah you guys can be the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.270 
whatever but yeah you guys can be the
judge<00:05:48.720> it<00:05:48.900> looks<00:05:49.050> like<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.380> probably<00:05:49.740> could

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
judge it looks like you probably could

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.370 
judge it looks like you probably could
just<00:05:50.520> shove<00:05:51.180> it<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.390> there<00:05:51.540> all<00:05:51.930> right<00:05:52.050> so<00:05:52.110> it

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
just shove it in there all right so it

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.810 
just shove it in there all right so it
looks<00:05:52.440> like<00:05:52.680> I<00:05:52.830> don't<00:05:52.890> really<00:05:53.220> recommend<00:05:53.520> you

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
looks like I don't really recommend you

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.400 
looks like I don't really recommend you
doing<00:05:54.240> that<00:05:54.570> because<00:05:54.600> it<00:05:54.960> looks<00:05:55.140> like<00:05:55.260> it

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
doing that because it looks like it

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.159 
doing that because it looks like it
might<00:05:55.620> hurt<00:05:55.919> the<00:05:56.640> hand<00:05:56.940> or<00:05:57.240> the<00:05:57.450> mousetrap<00:05:57.840> so

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
might hurt the hand or the mousetrap so

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.600 
might hurt the hand or the mousetrap so
I<00:05:58.200> don't<00:05:58.560> know<00:05:58.680> I<00:05:58.860> mean<00:05:59.070> I<00:05:59.160> guess<00:05:59.340> you<00:05:59.580> could

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
I don't know I mean I guess you could

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.820 
I don't know I mean I guess you could
and<00:06:00.120> then<00:06:00.840> you<00:06:00.870> know<00:06:01.050> if<00:06:01.229> you<00:06:01.380> wanted<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.680> keep

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
and then you know if you wanted to keep

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.010 
and then you know if you wanted to keep
it<00:06:02.010> like<00:06:02.130> that<00:06:02.160> for<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:02.580> while<00:06:02.760> otherwise<00:06:03.570> might

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
it like that for a while otherwise might

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.840 
it like that for a while otherwise might
just<00:06:04.260> damage<00:06:04.919> some<00:06:05.100> of<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.280> paint<00:06:05.520> I<00:06:05.669> don't

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850
