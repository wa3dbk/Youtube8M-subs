00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
think nothing of it so that's one way

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
think nothing of it so that's one way
that<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.930> put<00:01:22.320> together<00:01:22.500> some<00:01:22.890> NPCs<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
that you can put together some NPCs and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.950 
that you can put together some NPCs and
just<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.150> simply<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
just really simply have a little

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
just really simply have a little
conversation<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.799> them<00:01:26.119> I'll<00:01:27.119> show<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
conversation with them I'll show you the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.999 
conversation with them I'll show you the
code<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.020> pretty<00:01:28.290> simple<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:28.829> I'm<00:01:28.890> going

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
code for it's pretty simple so I'm going

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
code for it's pretty simple so I'm going
to<00:01:29.040> hold<00:01:29.189> ctrl<00:01:29.610> T<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.030> cancel<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.750> this<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
to hold ctrl T to cancel out of this and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.539 
to hold ctrl T to cancel out of this and
let's<00:01:32.159> edit<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> startup<00:01:32.850> program<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.979> first

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
let's edit the startup program so first

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.490 
let's edit the startup program so first
off<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.850> clears<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.630> terminal<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.170> he

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
off he clears that the terminal and he

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.219 
off he clears that the terminal and he
takes<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.159> monitor<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
takes that monitor up top that you see

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.140 
takes that monitor up top that you see
there<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> we're<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.520> name<00:01:41.670> him<00:01:41.850> lorg

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
there and we're going to name him lorg

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
there and we're going to name him lorg
and<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.570> change<00:01:42.810> his<00:01:42.990> name<00:01:43.140> pretty<00:01:43.409> simply

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and we can change his name pretty simply

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.090 
and we can change his name pretty simply
too<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.520> don't<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:46.579> Zef<00:01:47.579> us<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.509> example

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
too I don't know Zef us for example

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.410 
too I don't know Zef us for example
we're<00:01:50.100> telling<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.759> has<00:01:50.880> five<00:01:51.119> lines

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
we're telling it that it has five lines

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.730 
we're telling it that it has five lines
on<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> monitor<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:55.290> plate

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
on the monitor and the back is a plate

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.670 
on the monitor and the back is a plate
input<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> basically<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:58.079> we're<00:01:58.380> doing

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
input and so basically all we're doing

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
input and so basically all we're doing
is<00:01:58.799> whenever<00:01:59.189> he<00:01:59.460> says<00:01:59.700> something<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.659> goes<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is whenever he says something it goes to

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.999 
is whenever he says something it goes to
the<00:02:01.049> monitor<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:03.079> so<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.649> case<00:02:04.829> will

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
