00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
and despite looking this team I knew the

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.570 
and despite looking this team I knew the
Rayquaza<00:00:27.619> is<00:00:27.800> gonna<00:00:27.950> be<00:00:28.099> a<00:00:28.130> problem

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
Rayquaza is gonna be a problem

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.769 
Rayquaza is gonna be a problem
especially<00:00:28.759> since<00:00:29.119> it<00:00:29.210> has<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.480> airlock

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
especially since it has the airlock

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.359 
especially since it has the airlock
ability<00:00:30.170> but<00:00:30.619> actually<00:00:30.890> not<00:00:31.040> something<00:00:31.160> new

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
ability but actually not something new

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.800 
ability but actually not something new
today<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:31.849> is<00:00:31.939> that<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.480> know<00:00:32.570> with<00:00:32.780> the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
today and that is that you know with the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.479 
today and that is that you know with the
with<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.260> rate<00:00:33.410> causes<00:00:33.590> airlock<00:00:34.010> ability<00:00:34.370> it

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
with the rate causes airlock ability it

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.310 
with the rate causes airlock ability it
only<00:00:34.730> negates<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.450> effect<00:00:35.480> of<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.079> way<00:00:36.170> the

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
only negates the effect of the way the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.930 
only negates the effect of the way the
wall<00:00:36.560> sits<00:00:36.800> on<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:36.980> field<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.399> initially

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
wall sits on the field I initially

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.430 
wall sits on the field I initially
thought<00:00:37.970> that<00:00:38.120> as<00:00:38.329> soon<00:00:38.420> as<00:00:38.570> it<00:00:38.660> comes<00:00:38.780> on<00:00:39.290> to

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
thought that as soon as it comes on to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.630 
thought that as soon as it comes on to
the<00:00:39.530> field<00:00:39.770> then<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.220> weather<00:00:40.370> effects

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
the field then the weather effects

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.340 
the field then the weather effects
completely<00:00:41.090> disappear<00:00:41.510> but<00:00:41.720> it's<00:00:41.840> only<00:00:42.020> while

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
completely disappear but it's only while

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.870 
completely disappear but it's only while
sits<00:00:42.620> on<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.800> field<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.460> as<00:00:43.520> soon<00:00:43.640> as<00:00:43.730> you<00:00:43.790> can

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
sits on the field so as soon as you can

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.280 
sits on the field so as soon as you can
get<00:00:43.970> rid<00:00:44.120> of<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:44.239> Rakata<00:00:44.570> then<00:00:44.840> you're<00:00:45.110> where

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
get rid of the Rakata then you're where

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.450 
get rid of the Rakata then you're where
the<00:00:45.380> effects<00:00:45.590> will<00:00:45.710> come<00:00:45.860> back<00:00:45.980> into<00:00:46.130> place<00:00:46.340> so

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
the effects will come back into place so

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.830 
the effects will come back into place so
that<00:00:46.489> wasn't<00:00:46.970> too<00:00:47.059> much<00:00:47.239> of<00:00:47.329> an<00:00:47.420> issue<00:00:47.510> but

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
that wasn't too much of an issue but

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.900 
that wasn't too much of an issue but
what<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.559> was<00:00:48.980> very<00:00:49.129> lucky<00:00:49.309> that<00:00:49.460> he<00:00:49.609> did<00:00:49.760> have

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
what I was very lucky that he did have

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.060 
what I was very lucky that he did have
was<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.059> mega<00:00:50.269> Charles<00:00:50.570> on<00:00:50.660> why<00:00:50.870> because<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.039> have

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
was a mega Charles on why because I have

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.650 
was a mega Charles on why because I have
my<00:00:52.280> rain<00:00:52.489> down<00:00:52.699> stones<00:00:52.969> actually<00:00:53.300> did<00:00:53.449> run<00:00:53.600> out

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
my rain down stones actually did run out

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.329 
my rain down stones actually did run out
and<00:00:54.079> if<00:00:54.289> it<00:00:54.410> wasn't<00:00:54.559> for<00:00:54.710> that<00:00:55.129> drought

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
and if it wasn't for that drought

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.130 
and if it wasn't for that drought
ability<00:00:55.730> coming<00:00:56.000> in<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.269> don't<00:00:56.539> think<00:00:56.899> I<00:00:57.050> would

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
ability coming in I don't think I would

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.209 
ability coming in I don't think I would
have<00:00:57.170> been<00:00:57.260> able<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.530> accept<00:00:57.800> his<00:00:57.980> team

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
have been able to accept his team

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.040 
have been able to accept his team
because<00:00:58.519> Kass<00:00:59.030> wom<00:00:59.210> lives<00:00:59.570> in<00:00:59.780> the<00:00:59.870> weather

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.419 
because Kass wom lives in the weather
he's<00:01:00.320> pretty<00:01:00.530> much<00:01:00.620> useless<00:01:00.679> if<00:01:01.100> he's<00:01:01.190> not<00:01:01.309> in

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
he's pretty much useless if he's not in
