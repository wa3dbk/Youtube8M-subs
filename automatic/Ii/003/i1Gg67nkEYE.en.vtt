00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay so we're going to do a short video
here<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.130> steps<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.730> how<00:00:06.390> we<00:00:06.450> make<00:00:06.750> these

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
here on the steps of how we make these

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.770 
here on the steps of how we make these
actual<00:00:07.319> epoxy<00:00:08.010> resin<00:00:08.340> plaques<00:00:08.610> so<00:00:09.450> we<00:00:09.570> take<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
actual epoxy resin plaques so we take a

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.959 
actual epoxy resin plaques so we take a
plain<00:00:10.050> piece<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.469> wood<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.519> French

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
plain piece of wood here just a French

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.580 
plain piece of wood here just a French
corner<00:00:12.300> cut<00:00:12.509> 5x7

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
corner cut 5x7

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.150 
corner cut 5x7
plain<00:00:14.219> piece<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.429> wood<00:00:15.230> we<00:00:16.230> then<00:00:16.410> treat<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
plain piece of wood we then treat the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.150 
plain piece of wood we then treat the
piece<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.520> wood<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.850> give<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.119> that<00:00:18.270> authentic

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
piece of wood to give it that authentic

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.939 
piece of wood to give it that authentic
vintage<00:00:20.160> effect<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.060> see<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.769> lines<00:00:22.769> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
vintage effect you can see the lines in

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.120 
vintage effect you can see the lines in
the<00:00:23.010> wood<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.490> how<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> gives<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.240> effect

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
the wood and how it gives it that effect

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.160 
the wood and how it gives it that effect
then<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.160> put<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> image<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.330> top<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
then we put the image on top of the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.810 
then we put the image on top of the
piece<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.560> wood<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.429> see<00:00:29.609> right<00:00:29.789> there

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
piece of wood as you can see right there

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.450 
piece of wood as you can see right there
the<00:00:30.060> Divine<00:00:30.359> Mercy<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.099> next<00:00:32.250> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
the Divine Mercy and what we do next is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.610 
the Divine Mercy and what we do next is
we<00:00:32.520> actually<00:00:32.940> pour<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.360> epoxy<00:00:33.780> resin<00:00:34.200> we

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
we actually pour the epoxy resin we

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.459 
we actually pour the epoxy resin we
actually<00:00:34.950> pour<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.489> risen<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.870> plaques

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
actually pour the risen on the plaques

00:00:37.469 --> 00:01:08.499 
actually pour the risen on the plaques
to<00:00:38.629> get<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.840> glossy<00:00:40.410> finish

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.300 

ok<00:01:09.509> so<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> finished<00:01:10.920> plaques

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
ok so these are the finished plaques

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.630 
ok so these are the finished plaques
after<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.820> poured<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> epoxy<00:01:12.750> resin<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.640> we

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
after we poured the epoxy resin and we

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.270 
after we poured the epoxy resin and we
let<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:14.940> dry<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.630> little<00:01:16.470> close<00:01:16.740> up<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
let them dry a little close up here of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.780 
let them dry a little close up here of
the<00:01:17.400> actual<00:01:17.940> plaques<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> light

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the actual plaques you can see the light

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.350 
the actual plaques you can see the light
reflecting<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.290> epoxy<00:01:22.770> resin<00:01:23.240> gives<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
reflecting the epoxy resin gives it that

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.730 
reflecting the epoxy resin gives it that
colossi<00:01:25.220> glassy<00:01:26.220> texture<00:01:26.880> toward<00:01:27.299> loose<00:01:27.740> it

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
colossi glassy texture toward loose it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.130 
colossi glassy texture toward loose it
looks<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.039> poor<00:01:29.250> glass<00:01:29.549> actually<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:31.020> can

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
looks like poor glass actually you can

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.139 
looks like poor glass actually you can
see<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.530> shining<00:01:31.950> off<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> epoxy<00:01:32.820> resin

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
see it like shining off the epoxy resin

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.340 
see it like shining off the epoxy resin
there<00:01:34.250> that's<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.460> look<00:01:35.640> like

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
there that's what they look like

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.760 
there that's what they look like
we<00:01:37.350> poured<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.950> dried<00:01:38.220> them<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.690> also<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.649> do
