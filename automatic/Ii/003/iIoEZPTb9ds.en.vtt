yellow<00:00:36.920> right<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:38.120> so<00:00:38.420> we<00:00:38.510> got<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.660> small

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
yellow right and so we got a small

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.210 
yellow right and so we got a small
container<00:00:39.230> being<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:39.649> being<00:00:39.860> how<00:00:40.040> many

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
container being this being how many

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.330 
container being this being how many
liters<00:00:40.550> yes<00:00:41.030> that's<00:00:41.630> a<00:00:41.750> 6<00:00:42.020> liter<00:00:42.340> containers

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
liters yes that's a 6 liter containers

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.560 
liters yes that's a 6 liter containers
without<00:00:43.430> really<00:00:43.760> big<00:00:43.940> enough<00:00:44.120> for<00:00:44.180> one<00:00:44.480> of

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
without really big enough for one of

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.410 
without really big enough for one of
those<00:00:44.720> yeah<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.350> there's<00:00:45.890> a<00:00:45.980> dwarf<00:00:46.820> upright

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
those yeah and there's a dwarf upright

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.470 
those yeah and there's a dwarf upright
bush<00:00:47.720> varieties<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.430> container<00:00:49.820> like<00:00:50.210> this

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
bush varieties but a container like this

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.020 
bush varieties but a container like this
would<00:00:50.690> also<00:00:50.840> be<00:00:51.110> good<00:00:51.320> for<00:00:51.590> a<00:00:51.980> tall<00:00:52.340> variety<00:00:52.910> if

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
would also be good for a tall variety if

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.979 
would also be good for a tall variety if
it's<00:00:53.180> a<00:00:53.300> cherry<00:00:53.600> right<00:00:53.930> right<00:00:54.489> that's<00:00:55.489> another

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
it's a cherry right right that's another

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.840 
it's a cherry right right that's another
thing<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.170> consider<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:58.040> actual<00:00:58.309> size<00:00:58.640> of<00:00:58.790> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
thing to consider the actual size of the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.150 
thing to consider the actual size of the
tomato<00:00:59.239> you<00:00:59.360> intend<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.899> grow<00:01:00.230> yeah<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.010> if<00:01:01.100> you

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
tomato you intend to grow yeah so if you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.760 
tomato you intend to grow yeah so if you
grow<00:01:01.460> a<00:01:01.760> cherry<00:01:02.270> variety<00:01:02.870> it's<00:01:03.290> much<00:01:03.559> more

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
grow a cherry variety it's much more

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.459 
grow a cherry variety it's much more
likely<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.129> succeed<00:01:04.430> than<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.390> big<00:01:05.810> beefsteak

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
likely to succeed than a big beefsteak

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.020 
likely to succeed than a big beefsteak
for<00:01:06.499> a<00:01:06.740> case<00:01:07.280> if<00:01:07.429> we're<00:01:07.609> starting<00:01:07.729> off

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
for a case if we're starting off

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.709 
for a case if we're starting off
cherries<00:01:08.840> yes<00:01:09.530> and<00:01:09.829> the<00:01:09.889> right<00:01:10.069> size<00:01:10.310> pot<00:01:10.719> yeah

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
cherries yes and the right size pot yeah

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:14.499 
cherries yes and the right size pot yeah

absolutely brilliant okay yes and and
what<00:01:14.630> else<00:01:14.780> what<00:01:15.109> else<00:01:15.139> do<00:01:15.350> we<00:01:15.380> need<00:01:15.560> from<00:01:15.649> well

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
what else what else do we need from well

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.449 
what else what else do we need from well
and<00:01:16.159> it's<00:01:16.969> very<00:01:17.060> important<00:01:17.689> that<00:01:17.810> it's

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:18.459 
and it's very important that it's

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:22.209 
and it's very important that it's
received<00:01:19.459> both<00:01:19.729> oxygen<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.779> water<00:01:21.289> right

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
received both oxygen and water right

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.370 
received both oxygen and water right
course<00:01:22.459> we<00:01:22.609> can<00:01:22.759> give<00:01:23.149> water<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.600> roots<00:01:24.049> very

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
course we can give water to roots very

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.590 
course we can give water to roots very
easily<00:01:24.649> yeah<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:25.639> it's<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.819> oxygen<00:01:26.389> now<00:01:26.539> we

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
easily yeah but it's the oxygen now we

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.050 
easily yeah but it's the oxygen now we
get<00:01:26.810> your<00:01:26.990> challenge<00:01:27.709> right<00:01:27.859> strike<00:01:28.279> well<00:01:28.969> we

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
get your challenge right strike well we

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.019 
get your challenge right strike well we
can<00:01:29.209> add<00:01:29.329> perlite<00:01:29.840> yes<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:30.950> mix<00:01:31.159> okay<00:01:31.700> but

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.029 
can add perlite yes to the mix okay but

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.019 
can add perlite yes to the mix okay but
we<00:01:32.179> can<00:01:32.329> also<00:01:32.479> use<00:01:32.630> air<00:01:33.289> parts<00:01:33.770> right<00:01:34.219> and<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:35.029 
we can also use air parts right and the

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:37.209 
we can also use air parts right and the
holes<00:01:35.209> in<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.509> side<00:01:35.719> of<00:01:35.929> these<00:01:36.109> parts<00:01:36.619> allow

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
holes in the side of these parts allow

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.440 
holes in the side of these parts allow
oxygen<00:01:37.630> into<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.659> root<00:01:38.929> area<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.789> also<00:01:40.789> stop

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
oxygen into the root area and also stop

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.410 
oxygen into the root area and also stop
the<00:01:41.479> roots

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the roots

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.140 
the roots
some<00:01:42.780> circling<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.650> becoming<00:01:44.610> pot<00:01:44.850> bangs

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
some circling and becoming pot bangs

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.020 
some circling and becoming pot bangs
right<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.890> these<00:01:47.010> bees<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:47.310> amazing<00:01:47.880> looking

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
brilliant yeah great it's a fact that if

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.160 
brilliant yeah great it's a fact that if
fruits<00:01:59.490> receive<00:01:59.970> more<00:02:00.090> oxygen<00:02:00.630> yet<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
fruits receive more oxygen yet the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.770 
fruits receive more oxygen yet the
plants<00:02:01.530> grow<00:02:01.800> more<00:02:02.100> quickly<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.150> the

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
plants grow more quickly right and the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.290 
plants grow more quickly right and the
roots<00:02:03.930> will<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.170> more<00:02:04.470> healthy<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.640> overall

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
roots will be more healthy and overall

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.820 
roots will be more healthy and overall
the<00:02:06.420> plant<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.750> benefit<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.440> you've<00:02:07.560> really

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
the plant would benefit so you've really

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
the plant would benefit so you've really
noticed<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.220> difference<00:02:08.550> when<00:02:08.820> you<00:02:08.910> indeed

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
noticed a difference when you indeed

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
stand through the soil right before you

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.180 
stand through the soil right before you
add<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.510> soil<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.989> part<00:03:01.320> okay<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.890> that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
add the soil to a part okay and that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.990 
add the soil to a part okay and that
allows<00:03:02.519> air<00:03:02.850> down<00:03:03.630> into<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.049> root<00:03:04.230> area<00:03:05.000> and

allows air down into the root area and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.780 
allows air down into the root area and
that<00:03:06.450> works<00:03:06.810> almost<00:03:07.410> as<00:03:07.709> good<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.310> holes<00:03:08.640> in

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
that works almost as good as holes in

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.910 
that works almost as good as holes in
the<00:03:08.910> side<00:03:09.150> oh<00:03:09.450> that's<00:03:09.750> photo<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.410> just<00:03:10.680> put

varieties do benefit with some support

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.440 
varieties do benefit with some support
to<00:03:37.980> go<00:03:38.070> right<00:03:38.250> okay<00:03:38.579> especially<00:03:38.820> in<00:03:39.150> windy

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
to go right okay especially in windy

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.960 
to go right okay especially in windy
conditions

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.330 

with<00:03:43.970> watering<00:03:44.510> how<00:03:45.170> often<00:03:45.890> is<00:03:46.010> that<00:03:46.040> an

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
with watering how often is that an

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.970 
with watering how often is that an
important<00:03:46.820> part<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.390> it<00:03:47.600> is<00:03:47.660> yeah<00:03:48.170> it's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
important part of it it is yeah it's

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.740 
important part of it it is yeah it's
important<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.970> whole<00:03:50.180> of<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.450> soil

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
important that the whole of the soil

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.140 
important that the whole of the soil
area<00:03:51.200> your<00:03:51.620> saturated<00:03:52.100> with<00:03:52.370> water<00:03:52.400> right

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
area your saturated with water right

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.130 
area your saturated with water right
it's<00:03:54.140> very<00:03:54.200> easy<00:03:54.760> for<00:03:55.760> there<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:55.910> be<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.660> pocket

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
it's very easy for there to be a pocket

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.640 
it's very easy for there to be a pocket
of<00:03:57.380> dry<00:03:57.760> soil<00:03:58.760> below<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.360> surface<00:03:59.600> in<00:04:00.410> which

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
of dry soil below the surface in which

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.730 
of dry soil below the surface in which
case<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:02.240> water<00:04:02.390> jessa<00:04:02.750> chooses<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.380> path<00:04:03.530> of

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
case the water jessa chooses the path of

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.680 
case the water jessa chooses the path of
least<00:04:03.860> resistance<00:04:04.010> or<00:04:04.790> program<00:04:05.150> area<00:04:05.420> that's

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
least resistance or program area that's

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.320 
least resistance or program area that's
all<00:04:05.810> right<00:04:05.930> yes<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.950> what<00:04:07.550> I<00:04:07.580> do<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.060> every

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
all right yes so what I do is if every

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.690 
all right yes so what I do is if every
couple<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.660> weeks<00:04:08.720> or<00:04:09.020> so<00:04:09.200> I'll<00:04:09.650> add<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> cup<00:04:10.550> of

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
couple of weeks or so I'll add a cup of

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.090 
couple of weeks or so I'll add a cup of
washing<00:04:11.540> up<00:04:11.900> water<00:04:12.140> from<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.650> washing<00:04:12.980> up

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
washing up water from the washing up

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.240 
washing up water from the washing up
Bowl<00:04:13.480> into<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.630> into<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.380> watering<00:04:15.800> hand

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
Bowl into the into the watering hand

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.729 
Bowl into the into the watering hand
and<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.790> acts<00:04:17.030> as<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.209> wetting<00:04:17.450> agent<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.590> it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
and that acts as a wetting agent so it

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.229 
and that acts as a wetting agent so it
gets<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.130> all<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.250> places<00:04:19.370> that<00:04:19.760> might<00:04:20.060> have

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
gets to all the places that might have

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.450 
gets to all the places that might have
dried<00:04:20.510> out<00:04:20.690> underneath<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.470> soil<00:04:22.130> surface

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
dried out underneath the soil surface

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.420 
dried out underneath the soil surface
but<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.510> secrets<00:04:23.900> are<00:04:24.050> feeding<00:04:24.260> Tomatoes<00:04:24.890> B

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
but the secrets are feeding Tomatoes B

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.450 
but the secrets are feeding Tomatoes B
is<00:04:25.550> little<00:04:25.910> enough<00:04:26.150> than<00:04:26.480> right<00:04:26.750> but<00:04:27.740> a<00:04:27.980> small

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
is little enough than right but a small

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.430 
is little enough than right but a small
seedling<00:04:29.030> will<00:04:29.240> need<00:04:29.420> hardly<00:04:29.750> any<00:04:29.990> food<00:04:30.260> at

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
seedling will need hardly any food at

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.110 
seedling will need hardly any food at
all<00:04:30.560> right<00:04:31.040> in<00:04:31.220> fact<00:04:31.430> there'll<00:04:31.670> be<00:04:31.790> enough

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
all right in fact there'll be enough

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.720 
all right in fact there'll be enough
food<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:33.140> seed<00:04:33.350> compost<00:04:33.800> already<00:04:34.190> okay

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
food in the seed compost already okay

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.930 
food in the seed compost already okay
not<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.000> even<00:04:35.510> have<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:35.780> think<00:04:35.930> about<00:04:36.940> feeding

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
not so even have to think about feeding

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.390 
not so even have to think about feeding
but<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.810> starts<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.170> get<00:04:39.260> bigger<00:04:39.680> they<00:04:40.010> require

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
but it starts to get bigger they require

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.230 
but it starts to get bigger they require
more<00:04:40.670> food<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.560> so<00:04:42.560> by<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.860> time<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:43.490> plant<00:04:44.090> is

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
more food and so by the time a plant is

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.680 
more food and so by the time a plant is
in<00:04:44.390> fruits<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:45.620> really<00:04:46.160> very<00:04:46.910> hungry<00:04:47.150> indeed

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
in fruits it's really very hungry indeed

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.420 
in fruits it's really very hungry indeed
okay<00:04:48.550> hungry<00:04:49.550> B<00:04:49.700> that's<00:04:50.210> right
