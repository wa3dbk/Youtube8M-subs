difficult<00:00:50.020> with<00:00:50.650> this<00:00:50.890> fingering<00:00:51.430> because

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
difficult with this fingering because

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.869 
difficult with this fingering because
it's<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.150> weak<00:00:52.739> combination<00:00:53.739> now<00:00:54.430> one<00:00:54.730> thing

now<00:01:15.700> you<00:01:15.760> just<00:01:15.970> saw<00:01:16.150> it<00:01:16.270> right<00:01:16.390> there<00:01:16.450> when<00:01:16.720> I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
now you just saw it right there when I

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.110 
now you just saw it right there when I
pulled<00:01:17.110> off<00:01:17.290> see<00:01:17.890> the<00:01:18.010> whole<00:01:18.130> string<00:01:18.729> the

pulled off see the whole string the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.800 
pulled off see the whole string the
strings<00:01:19.390> move<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.820> that<00:01:22.030> strings<00:01:22.840> moving<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
strings move see that strings moving you

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.300 
strings move see that strings moving you
don't<00:01:25.900> want<00:01:26.200> that<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.560> makes<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:26.950> slur

don't want that that makes that slur

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.240 
don't want that that makes that slur
very<00:01:27.850> difficult<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:29.110> execute<00:01:29.740> if<00:01:29.920> you're

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
very difficult to execute if you're

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.430 
very difficult to execute if you're
pulling<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:31.150> if<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.480> strings<00:01:31.750> moving<00:01:32.320> is

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
pulling this if the strings moving is

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.970 
pulling this if the strings moving is
you're<00:01:32.590> trying<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.860> pull<00:01:33.100> off<00:01:33.370> and<00:01:33.810> remember

when you do a pull off on the inside
string<00:01:40.000> like<00:01:40.180> this<00:01:40.420> you<00:01:40.720> do<00:01:41.080> not<00:01:41.410> just<00:01:42.340> lift

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
string like this you do not just lift

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.240 
string like this you do not just lift
off<00:01:43.090> like<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.020> nothing's<00:01:44.530> going<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.740> happen

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250

going to help hold the string steady

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.800 
going to help hold the string steady
look<00:02:28.220> at<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.490> it<00:02:28.790> doesn't<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.510> string

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
look at that it doesn't the string
