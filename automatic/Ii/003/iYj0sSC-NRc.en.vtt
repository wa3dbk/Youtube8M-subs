issue<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.700> popular<00:00:33.090> science<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> was<00:00:36.870> quite

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
issue of popular science so I was quite

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.350 
issue of popular science so I was quite
pleased<00:00:37.320> when<00:00:37.559> my<00:00:37.790> experiment<00:00:38.790> turned<00:00:38.969> out<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
pleased when my experiment turned out to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.770 
pleased when my experiment turned out to
look<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.719> like<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:41.270> now<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> make<00:00:42.629> this

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
look just like that now to make this

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
look just like that now to make this
solution<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.440> dissolved<00:00:43.890> 10<00:00:44.190> grams<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.760> lead

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
solution I dissolved 10 grams of lead

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.650 
solution I dissolved 10 grams of lead
acetate<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.600> 100<00:00:45.960> milliliters<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.500> water<00:00:46.800> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
acetate in 100 milliliters of water and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
acetate in 100 milliliters of water and
do<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.960> added<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.320> small<00:00:49.590> amount<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> zinc

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
do this I added a small amount of zinc

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
do this I added a small amount of zinc
that<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.430> melted<00:00:50.670> along<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> brass<00:00:51.570> nut

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
that I melted along with the brass nut

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.029 
that I melted along with the brass nut
because<00:00:52.079> brass<00:00:52.500> contains<00:00:52.949> some<00:00:53.160> zinc<00:00:54.829> you<00:00:55.829> can

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
because brass contains some zinc you can

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
because brass contains some zinc you can
see<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> zinc<00:00:56.670> instantly<00:00:57.270> blackens<00:00:57.840> as

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
see that the zinc instantly blackens as

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
see that the zinc instantly blackens as

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
think that this proved that metal was

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
think that this proved that metal was
alive<00:01:39.689> because<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> spontaneously<00:01:41.310> grew<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
alive because it spontaneously grew and

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
in the shape of the tree now 24 develops

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.719 
in the shape of the tree now 24 develops
and<00:01:48.060> 24<00:01:48.840> hours<00:01:49.200> later<00:01:49.290> my<00:01:50.070> tree<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.490> well

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and 24 hours later my tree is well

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.569 
and 24 hours later my tree is well
developed<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.590> has<00:01:52.680> lots<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.100> big<00:01:53.310> bright

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
developed and it has lots of big bright

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.980 
developed and it has lots of big bright
crystals<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.540> problem<00:01:54.689> is

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
crystals on it but the problem is

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200 
crystals on it but the problem is
they're<00:01:55.950> kind<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> weak<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.820> they're<00:01:56.969> fragile

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
they're kind of weak and they're fragile

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.760 
they're kind of weak and they're fragile
you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.600> see<00:01:57.780> them<00:01:57.930> swaying<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.500> water

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
you can see them swaying in the water

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.719 
you can see them swaying in the water
and<00:01:59.070> I<00:02:00.469> tried<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> take<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> tree<00:02:02.369> out<00:02:02.399> of

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.399 
and I tried to take the tree out of
water<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.450> preserve<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.140> save<00:02:04.380> it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
water to kind of preserve it and save it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
water to kind of preserve it and save it
but<00:02:04.920> when<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> did<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.820> all<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> leaves

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
but when I did that all of the leaves

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.380 
but when I did that all of the leaves
melted<00:02:07.350> down<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:08.879> hard<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.090> retain

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
melted down and it was hard to retain

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.080 
melted down and it was hard to retain
its<00:02:09.569> original<00:02:09.660> shape<00:02:09.959> as<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:10.979> here

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
its original shape as you see here

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.490 
its original shape as you see here
although<00:02:13.090> it<00:02:13.210> does<00:02:13.360> look<00:02:13.570> cool<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:13.840> quickly

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
although it does look cool like quickly

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500 
although it does look cool like quickly

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
white coating a blood oxide on it now I

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.830 
white coating a blood oxide on it now I
tried<00:02:21.430> this<00:02:21.520> again<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.030> penny<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.570> I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
tried this again with a penny and I

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.280 
tried this again with a penny and I
tried<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.110> put<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.470> bottom<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:25.030> beaker

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
tried to put on the bottom of the beaker

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.900 
tried to put on the bottom of the beaker
but<00:02:26.290> instead<00:02:26.620> growing<00:02:27.100> up<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.580> forms<00:02:27.760> a

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
but instead growing up it just forms a

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.020 
but instead growing up it just forms a
flat<00:02:28.240> mass<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.780> small<00:02:29.080> crystals<00:02:29.760> well<00:02:30.760> thanks

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
flat mass of small crystals well thanks

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.610 
flat mass of small crystals well thanks
