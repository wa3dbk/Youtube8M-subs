00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.080
 maybe you think that none of this has anything to do with you 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.540
 such since you do you think this nature 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.610
 maybe when you hear the term global warming floors in movies 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.070
 of science fiction in radical environmental groups or even worse 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 many years for it to become reality maybe you're still 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.219
 wrong this is our planet 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.270
 the letter that surrounds him is the atmosphere 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.670
 is catching some of the sun's rays 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.580
 and keep them inside the planet to maintain a temperature of 15 degrees 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.770
 centigrade 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.660
 otherwise the sun's rays would escape 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.490
 and our planet would drop to a temperature of -18 degrees 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.340
 this is called a greenhouse effect and it's produced because that's how the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.040
 water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrogen oxides the bear 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.280
 did not manage to place artificial walls among others in an adequate proportion 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.150
 greenhouse gases do their job but you and increase your 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.500
 concentration the sun rays can not escape and the temperature of the 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.580
 planet rises with disastrous repercussions 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.510
 this is the concentration of carbon dioxide and global average temperature of 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.470
 the last 30 years 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.540
 and this is the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.960
 lucas some relation 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.310
 because they increase greenhouse gases there are three factors 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 fundamentals the burning of fossil fuels 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.859
 the destruction of forests that absorb carbon dioxide 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.059
 and the population increase 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.719
 everything is a vicious circle the population of the world increases 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.639
 vertiginously which supposes a greater demand of food water and resources 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.609
 natural 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.789
 the trees absorb a large percentage of the dioxide emanations 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:27.540
 carbon 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.170
 but now we are destroying our forests and jungles the lungs 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.029
 of our planet 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.899
 the artists of the demands that take us to the third point of the circle 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:37.939
 vicious 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.709
 obsolete technologies the human being still uses generators 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.049
 coal-based energy this translates into more than 2 thousand 500 million 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.340
 tons of carbon dioxide emitted annually into our atmosphere 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.970
 the excessive use of the automobile generate 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.900
 1500 million tons of carbon dioxide that are going away 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.069
 direct to the atmosphere what consequences this brings 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.520
 actions the answer is the 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.379
 and everywhere 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.299
 when getting caught more number of sun rays 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.689
 The temperature of the planet increases this causes serious water efficiency 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:11.989
 fires 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.180
 paradoxically 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.819
 global warming also produce rains that flood more 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.819
 severe 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.559
 the sun's rays increase the temperature of the oceans this causes 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.559
 greater evaporation and more severe rainfall 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.219
 but also when a hurricane the jam 

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.219
 in warmer waters 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.609
 temperatures also cause the funds to thaw and as 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.599
 consequence more water as a central guaranteed that raises the level of 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.080
 oceans causing severe floods the problem 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.450
 serious if the poles will thaw and the sea level will rise 6 meters 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.400
 araceli somewhere is like a club san francisco holland 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.749
 Galician confederacy division of Galicia and in Mexico has taken measures 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.749
 veracruz tabasco campeche 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.340
 do not be fooled because 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.729
 can you keep thinking 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.529
 there is still time to change 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:11.409
 it's someone else's problem as scientists will solve it here there 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.819
 Some 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.129
 600 points that you can adopt to help the planet 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.500
 I buy energy-saving lights instead of common bulbs 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.090
 in the long run 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.909
 they cost much less 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.930
 disconnect electrical appliances that you are not using 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:28.449
 and cell phone chargers even if they are off 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.740
 they continue to consume energy 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.169
 decreases the use of air conditioners and heaters, including in the 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.409
 car 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.219
 if you are going to buy a car 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.180
 choose one with low fuel consumption 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.970
 and less carbon dioxide emissions per kilometer per year 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.559
 Keep the tires of your car clear 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.460
 the engine will make less effort and now gasoline 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.119
 use public transport more or share the car 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:00.699
 house bicycle 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.319
 use less hot water to bathe 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.439
 I would like the front while in Japan the 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.420
 wash clothes with cold water 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.719
 otilia 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:10.790
 recycle 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.190
 If it's for garbage, buy recycled and recyclable products 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.830
 and give more than two scares to paper to glass and aluminum 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 forests, trees and nature take care 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.460
 and participate in the reforestation programs of your community 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.569
 we are running out of the planet 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:32.430
 this wonderful world that has given us so much 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.740
 we are still on time but we have to change our way of thinking and 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.749
 start acting now 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:41.680
 make yourself heard 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.389
 world is my commitment to stop global warming
