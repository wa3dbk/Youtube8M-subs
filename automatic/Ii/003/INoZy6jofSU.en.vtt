00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this step you're going to be plenty of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.370 
this step you're going to be plenty of
butterfly<00:01:45.570> clips<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.500> spray<00:01:46.890> bottle<00:01:48.380> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
butterfly clips and a spray bottle the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
butterfly clips and a spray bottle the
first<00:01:49.619> thing<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.520> detangling<00:01:51.149> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
first thing that I do when detangling is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.870 
first thing that I do when detangling is
section<00:01:52.020> off<00:01:52.140> my<00:01:52.320> hair<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.680> create<00:01:53.430> about<00:01:53.640> five

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
section off my hair I create about five

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
section off my hair I create about five
or<00:01:54.060> six<00:01:54.329> different<00:01:54.479> sections<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.409> do<00:01:55.470> this

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
or six different sections and I do this

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
or six different sections and I do this
because<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:56.130> find<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:56.729> easier<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
because I find that it's easier to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.969 
because I find that it's easier to
detangle<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:57.930> hair<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.439> i'm<00:01:58.560> working<00:01:58.740> with

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
detangle my hair when i'm working with

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.810 
detangle my hair when i'm working with
smaller<00:01:59.520> chunks<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:01.310> when<00:02:02.310> i'm<00:02:02.430> finished

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
smaller chunks of here when i'm finished

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.300 
smaller chunks of here when i'm finished
creating<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.509> section<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.140> clip<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.680> up<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.159> a

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
creating a section I clip it up at a

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.550 
creating a section I clip it up at a
butterfly<00:02:05.729> clip

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.900 

next<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.650> take<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> sections<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.880> hair

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
next I take one of the sections of hair

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.210 
next I take one of the sections of hair
and<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.630> spray<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:12.960> with<00:02:13.050> water<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.500> then<00:02:13.680> I

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
and I spray it with water and then I

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.820 
and I spray it with water and then I
begin<00:02:14.580> gently<00:02:15.270> finger<00:02:15.780> combing<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.320> section

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
begin gently finger combing that section

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.680 
begin gently finger combing that section
now<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.460> water<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.850> really<00:02:18.060> important

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
now the water is really important

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.510 
now the water is really important
because<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.140> helps<00:02:19.170> my<00:02:19.530> hands<00:02:19.800> more<00:02:20.100> easily

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
because it helps my hands more easily

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520 
because it helps my hands more easily
glide<00:02:20.850> through<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.090> hair<00:02:21.360> without<00:02:22.050> causing

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
glide through the hair without causing

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.580 
glide through the hair without causing
breakage<00:02:23.010> as<00:02:23.250> i<00:02:24.060> finger<00:02:24.270> comb<00:02:24.630> I'm<00:02:24.840> trying<00:02:25.320> to
