where<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> gets<00:01:27.840> me<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.860> guy<00:01:28.979> can

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
where it gets me and this guy can

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.770 
where it gets me and this guy can
actually<00:01:29.369> upgrade<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.759> items<00:01:30.060> beyond<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
actually upgrade your items beyond the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.030 
actually upgrade your items beyond the
level<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> couldn't<00:01:31.680> Dragon's<00:01:31.950> Dogma

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
level that you couldn't Dragon's Dogma

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
level that you couldn't Dragon's Dogma

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so if you finish Dragon's Dogma then

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.600 
so if you finish Dragon's Dogma then
you'll<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.920> get<00:01:35.040> an<00:01:35.159> item<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.579> you

you'll know that you get an item so you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.300 
you'll know that you get an item so you
can<00:01:35.820> upgrade<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.170> your<00:01:37.500> items<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.159> kind

can upgrade one of your items to be kind
of<00:01:38.340> super<00:01:38.729> super<00:01:39.030> good<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.020> can<00:01:40.140> actually

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
of super super good but you can actually

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
of super super good but you can actually
upgrade<00:01:40.619> beyond<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.490> by<00:01:41.939> spending<00:01:42.180> rift

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
upgrade beyond that and by spending rift

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.880 
upgrade beyond that and by spending rift

very tough at all to be honest they're

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.759 
very tough at all to be honest they're
one<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.750> first<00:02:27.930> main<00:02:28.080> areas<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.440> come<00:02:28.620> to

one of the first main areas we come to
is<00:02:28.830> pretty<00:02:29.130> much<00:02:29.280> full<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.640> woodland<00:02:30.090> animals

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
is pretty much full of woodland animals

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.970 
is pretty much full of woodland animals
that<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:30.660> just<00:02:30.810> scented<00:02:31.380> senselessly

sketched<00:02:36.060> out<00:02:36.239> by<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.510> stuff<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.440> then<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
sketched out by this stuff but then it

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.839 
sketched out by this stuff but then it
starts<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.130> open<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:38.640> realize

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.520 
starts to open up and you realize
actually<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.299> bit<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.810> black<00:02:39.959> Isle<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
actually the bit of black Isle is like a

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.770 
actually the bit of black Isle is like a
proper<00:02:40.799> dungeon<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.430> has<00:02:41.610> doors<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.660> go

through which leads kind of individual

through which leads kind of individual
sections<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:44.970> once<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.180> get<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.450> end

Dogma I think it's a really interesting
game<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:48.060> definitely<00:03:48.389> not<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.540> perfect<00:03:48.930> game

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
game it's definitely not a perfect game

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.020 
game it's definitely not a perfect game
but<00:03:49.799> one<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.100> things<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.459> did<00:03:50.700> think

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
but one of the things that I did think

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.970 
but one of the things that I did think
was<00:03:51.180> missing<00:03:51.690> from<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.319> full<00:03:52.530> game<00:03:52.709> was<00:03:52.950> that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
was missing from the full game was that

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.819 
was missing from the full game was that
whilst<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.090> dungeons<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.840> went<00:03:55.440> around<00:03:55.560> were

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
whilst the dungeons you went around were

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:56.930 
whilst the dungeons you went around were
really<00:03:56.069> exciting<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.459> really<00:03:56.609> interesting

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
really exciting and really interesting

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.309 
really exciting and really interesting
they<00:03:57.299> won't<00:03:57.480> actually<00:03:57.599> have<00:03:57.780> many<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.200> them

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
they won't actually have many of them

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.890 
they won't actually have many of them
and<00:03:58.639> it<00:03:59.639> kind<00:04:00.180> of<00:04:00.239> gots<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.540> end<00:04:00.660> of<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.780> game

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
and it kind of gots the end of the game

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.180 
and it kind of gots the end of the game
you<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.109> thought<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.440> would<00:04:01.620> have<00:04:01.709> been<00:04:01.799> nicer

if they had a few more of those kind of

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.199

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
it's sort of what the game needed I mean

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.379 
it's sort of what the game needed I mean
there<00:04:11.459> were<00:04:11.549> other<00:04:11.669> things<00:04:11.910> the<00:04:12.030> game<00:04:12.150> needed

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
there were other things the game needed

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.849 
there were other things the game needed
like<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.630> know<00:04:12.750> cities<00:04:13.230> that<00:04:13.380> actually<00:04:13.709> had

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
like you know cities that actually had

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:14.780 
like you know cities that actually had
people<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.489> them

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
people in them

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.219 
people in them
but<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.239> is<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.389> pretty<00:04:15.599> good<00:04:15.780> start<00:04:16.019> and

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
but this is a pretty good start and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.960 
but this is a pretty good start and
actually<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.519> pretty<00:04:17.549> good<00:04:17.849> deal

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
actually it's a pretty good deal

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.670 
actually it's a pretty good deal
obviously<00:04:18.150> they've<00:04:18.660> since<00:04:18.959> patched<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.590> an

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
obviously they've since patched in an

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.199 
obviously they've since patched in an
easy<00:04:19.919> mode<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.579> hard<00:04:20.789> mode<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.150> the

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.870 
Dogma game with it and yeah I'd
recommend<00:04:38.099> it's<00:04:38.340> worth<00:04:38.460> having<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.759> look

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.879 
recommend it's worth having a look

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
because basically it's a kind of budget

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.070
