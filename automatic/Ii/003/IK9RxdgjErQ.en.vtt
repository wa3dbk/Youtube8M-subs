00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.049
 vincent despite everything is it's a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 weekend that will give a little more 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.960
 more weight to the coach and the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.759
 federated a little more weight 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.019
 it's always been like that we know very well 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 Well, it's not the fault to pretend 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.580
 he is right to want rest but the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 clubs are also right to want that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 their players they pay that they 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 recruit who trains at the club plays 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
 so that's the problem is not the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 no one is wrong in truth it takes 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.490
 find one must find the right formula 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.399
 unemployment Friday 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 you see we still have a good location 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.120
 the side we have our hooker imagine 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 we lose 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.780
 you do not think that always been like that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.370
 pierrot there have been victories and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.680
 defeats he had done hellemmes crashes 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.789
 with tired men with men 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.270
 who had played the weekend before a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.950
 club it has always existed I you 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.780
 Saint-AndrÃ© is right when he wants 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.399
 rest like all breeders have 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.329
 yet asked when they are at this 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.039
 postage here 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 now what do you want 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.090
 blamed the club president who wants 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.920
 that their players like the stadium 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.309
 Toulouse or others play in their 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.769
 club 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.080
 we have to find the formula that's the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.549
 fault in the championship formula where and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 it's the fault of presences to live 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 in young people precisely because 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 this is the first year that there is this 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.710
 provision this is the first time that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 the system in quotation marks of this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
 masquerade 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 but these few months this convention 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 the clubs have gone further by doing 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 play the days that the team of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.939
 France that the staff of the team of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.500
 France did not want there is something that 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.250
 is a little blurry his concerts but it's 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.900
 dirty is that they have often right 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.400
 to impose or not but that's it 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.750
 so that was done for whoever it was 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.240
 been done why was it done as in 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.090
 helping and for what purpose 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.950
 it bothers me that bump me because they 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.030
 put six months our instances have put six 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.100
 months to lay this stuff 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.960
 and in the end it's worthless because 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.950
 it's not because nobody is it 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.360
 that he has the right to do or what does not 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.770
 should not be done around the world 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.270
 continue to do anything and everything 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.799
 which made stops again 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.479
 who are they paying for the broken pots 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.280
 well it's the players here we see 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.530
 still in whose arms this gold 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.299
 convention be written in black and white 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.820
 if it were necessary that his 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.990
 players will rest that these two 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.190
 players will be designated by the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.660
 coach had to go to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.310
 end to end at the end of the question and 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.470
 not do things there they did 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.090
 things it's a DIY what it was 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.230
 puncturing to please whoever I know 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.610
 I do not even know who's happy 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.750
 because it puts everybody in 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.940
 embarrassment because everyone gets 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.470
 said yes but well maybe three months I 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.620
 can I can not I leave you frozen 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.140
 this boutrand this one is going to have to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.900
 that one day our leaders and our 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.519
 leaders of our sport sit down 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.099
 around the table and take 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.140
 real decisions and to ask real ones 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.760
 things for french rugby 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.989
 so after that it will not please everyone 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.340
 the world for sure it will not go in the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.700
 everyone's sense it's safe and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.500
 certain 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.540
 we will have to give a line 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.250
 director of French rugby 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.920
 today it goes a little in all 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.110
 meaning and tails and as soon as that when 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.269
 we're talking about two decisions and you 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.440
 see after fifteen days that there is 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.390
 nothing that was done as it should be 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.420
 and it's a shame and it's damaging 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.640
 for sportsmen rugby players 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.110
 the clubs the coaches the staff of 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.730
 bompas for parents pass for 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.080
 guignols in nepal happily pass 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.750
 for pumps because we are not 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.280
 able to do something square 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.379
 this is with real haven rules and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.209
 regulations it's like dancing like back 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.769
 and as our rules on the ground a 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.940
 blow the moors before heels with the 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.159
 hands hands that by in front by 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.349
 behind after they reinterpret sai 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:26.069
 bcc like it's still is 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.060
 unbearable it's unbearable 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.260
 kept the players of the funds that's 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.860
 much more than a distant one we do not do 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.860
 on a rugby field
