it's going to be a reference video

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.550 
it's going to be a reference video
showing<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.429> kind<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.389> baseline<00:00:03.810> compression

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
on a new engine build this here is a

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.680 
on a new engine build this here is a
Blackwater<00:00:07.950> engine<00:00:08.429> rebuild<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.510> will

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
Blackwater engine rebuild and I will

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.290 
Blackwater engine rebuild and I will
replace<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> block<00:00:10.380> with<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.300> junkyard

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
replace the block with the junkyard

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.910 
replace the block with the junkyard
block<00:00:12.830> we<00:00:13.830> use<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> black<00:00:14.250> water<00:00:14.490> heads<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:15.920> lot

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
block we use a black water heads a lot

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.830 
block we use a black water heads a lot
of<00:00:17.070> parts<00:00:17.340> were<00:00:17.460> used<00:00:17.550> somewhere<00:00:18.240> new<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
of parts were used somewhere new and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.929 
of parts were used somewhere new and
we're<00:00:19.770> just<00:00:19.859> probably<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> oil<00:00:20.490> system<00:00:20.820> we

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
we're just probably the oil system we

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.820 
we're just probably the oil system we
figured<00:00:21.210> we'd<00:00:21.390> check<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.080> compression<00:00:22.410> just

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
figured we'd check the compression just

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.830 
figured we'd check the compression just
to<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.039> what<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> baseline<00:00:23.670> would<00:00:23.970> be<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.630> can

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
to see what a baseline would be you can

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.160 
to see what a baseline would be you can
only<00:00:24.990> later<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.949> we<00:00:26.099> shot<00:00:26.699> oil<00:00:26.939> in<00:00:27.180> all<00:00:28.019> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
only later and we shot oil in all the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.200 
only later and we shot oil in all the
cylinders<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.920> then<00:00:29.160> blew<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.939> then

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
cylinders and then blew it out and then

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:41.509 
cylinders and then blew it out and then
boot

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.849 

so<00:00:42.519> right<00:00:43.000> around<00:00:43.089> 4:10<00:00:43.629> there<00:00:43.960> episode

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
so right around 4:10 there episode

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.469 
so right around 4:10 there episode
number<00:00:45.030> cylinder<00:00:46.030> number<00:00:46.359> seven<00:00:48.479> cylinder

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
number cylinder number seven cylinder

00:00:49.479 --> 00:01:02.090 
number cylinder number seven cylinder
number<00:00:49.719> five<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.489> we've<00:01:00.789> got<00:01:00.909> about<00:01:01.000> 48<00:01:01.600> either

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
number five so we've got about 48 either

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.590 
number five so we've got about 48 either
the<00:01:03.100> next<00:01:03.339> two<00:01:03.460> cylinders<00:01:03.909> have<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.119> lot<00:01:04.299> of<00:01:04.330> oil

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
the next two cylinders have a lot of oil

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.320 
the next two cylinders have a lot of oil
get<00:01:05.049> into<00:01:05.289> them<00:01:05.409> from<00:01:05.590> going<00:01:06.580> to<00:01:06.729> oil<00:01:06.820> system

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
get into them from going to oil system

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.630 
get into them from going to oil system
we<00:01:08.289> don't<00:01:08.439> have<00:01:08.590> glow<00:01:08.890> plugs<00:01:09.220> in<00:01:09.369> it<00:01:09.430> right<00:01:09.580> now

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
we don't have glow plugs in it right now

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.070 
we don't have glow plugs in it right now
and<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.970> oil<00:01:10.149> just<00:01:10.270> drain<00:01:10.539> right<00:01:10.720> down<00:01:10.899> into

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
and the oil just drain right down into

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.859 
and the oil just drain right down into
the<00:01:11.170> growth<00:01:11.470> cycle<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.850> this<00:01:13.300> one<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.810> the

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
the growth cycle so this one and the

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.210 
the growth cycle so this one and the
next<00:01:13.899> two<00:01:14.289> probably<00:01:14.710> have<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.860> little<00:01:15.130> bit

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
next two probably have a little bit

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.990 
next two probably have a little bit
higher<00:01:15.369> compression<00:01:15.789> than<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.149> others

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
higher compression than the others

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.860 
higher compression than the others
cylinder<00:01:19.000> number<00:01:19.509> three

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.530 

so<00:01:29.870> I<00:01:29.900> got<00:01:30.230> about<00:01:30.470> 480<00:01:30.860> again<00:01:31.190> there<00:01:31.540> we

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
so I got about 480 again there we

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.410 
so I got about 480 again there we
actually<00:01:33.020> feels<00:01:33.260> mostly<00:01:33.830> to<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.580> oil<00:01:35.270> filter

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
actually feels mostly to the oil filter

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.570 
actually feels mostly to the oil filter
housing<00:01:35.600> there<00:01:36.080> we<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:36.890> we're<00:01:37.130> topping<00:01:37.370> it

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
housing there we just we're topping it

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.760 
housing there we just we're topping it
off<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:38.030> there<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.330> we<00:01:38.450> got<00:01:39.320> about<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.590> globe

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
off to there and we got about the globe

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.140 
off to there and we got about the globe
bugs<00:01:40.010> that's<00:01:40.760> how<00:01:40.910> we<00:01:40.970> got<00:01:41.180> oil<00:01:41.210> in<00:01:41.480> this<00:01:41.600> one

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
bugs that's how we got oil in this one

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:56.950 
bugs that's how we got oil in this one
cylinder<00:01:44.150> number<00:01:44.450> one<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:56.090> we<00:01:56.240> got<00:01:56.420> almost<00:01:56.810> a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
cylinder number one so we got almost a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
cylinder number one so we got almost a
500<00:01:57.410> there<00:01:59.590> cylinder<00:02:00.590> number<00:02:00.740> 8

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.199 

get<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.600> time

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.699 

all<00:02:18.209> right<00:02:18.360> about<00:02:18.780> 400<00:02:19.260> air<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.470> we're<00:02:19.590> getting

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
all right about 400 air so we're getting

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.890 
all right about 400 air so we're getting
less<00:02:19.920> compression<00:02:20.340> on<00:02:20.579> this<00:02:21.450> side<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.810> it

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
less compression on this side that it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.229 
less compression on this side that it
didn't<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> oil<00:02:22.939> stayed<00:02:23.939> in<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
didn't have the oil stayed in the

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.009 
didn't have the oil stayed in the
community<00:02:24.689> -<00:02:25.849> all<00:02:26.849> right<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.540> nur<00:02:27.599> -<00:02:27.750> number

all<00:02:39.950> right<00:02:40.070> about<00:02:40.370> 4:10<00:02:40.910> 4:15<00:02:44.140> cylinder

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
all right about 4:10 4:15 cylinder

00:02:45.140 --> 00:03:02.610 
all right about 4:10 4:15 cylinder
number<00:02:45.170> two<00:02:56.230> yeah<00:02:57.230> when<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.560> got<00:02:57.860> up<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.040> 390<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
number two yeah when I got up to 390 and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:19.140 
number two yeah when I got up to 390 and
finally<00:03:03.620> cylinder<00:03:04.250> number<00:03:04.520> two<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:16.000> 385<00:03:17.000> there

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
finally cylinder number two so 385 there

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.610 
finally cylinder number two so 385 there
so<00:03:20.150> those<00:03:20.870> are<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.230> two<00:03:22.160> highest<00:03:22.400> oh<00:03:23.620> yeah

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
so those are the two highest oh yeah

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:25.930 
so those are the two highest oh yeah
those<00:03:24.830> cylinders<00:03:25.070> have<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.460> least<00:03:25.640> amount<00:03:25.820> of

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
those cylinders have the least amount of

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:36.260 
those cylinders have the least amount of
oil<00:03:26.030> in<00:03:26.210> them<00:03:27.370> there's<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.430> pretty<00:03:28.640> engine

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.860 

good<00:03:37.270> boy
