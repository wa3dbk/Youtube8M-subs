you want more Kira likes it actually I
like<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.620> too<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.700> I'm<00:04:18.850> getting<00:04:19.000> all<00:04:19.150> my

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
like it too so I'm getting all my

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.930 
like it too so I'm getting all my
protein<00:04:20.220> from<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.810> suburbs<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:24.190> getting<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
protein from the suburbs and getting the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.600 
protein from the suburbs and getting the
vitamins<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.810> nutrition<00:04:26.789> from<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.930> chives

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
vitamins and nutrition from the chives

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.750 
vitamins and nutrition from the chives
so<00:04:30.610> overall<00:04:30.940> it's<00:04:31.180> pretty<00:04:31.389> good<00:04:32.250> but<00:04:33.250> that's

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
so overall it's pretty good but that's

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.870 
so overall it's pretty good but that's
probably<00:04:33.880> not<00:04:34.060> something<00:04:34.330> down<00:04:34.690> oh<00:04:35.340> I'm<00:04:36.340> sick

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
probably not something down oh I'm sick

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.680 
probably not something down oh I'm sick
after<00:04:37.740> every<00:04:38.740> dinner<00:04:38.940> let's<00:04:39.940> get<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.180> 100

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
after every dinner let's get a 100

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.230 
after every dinner let's get a 100
percent<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.110> how<00:04:41.200> I<00:04:41.229> give<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:43.620> 80<00:04:44.620> percent

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
percent of how I give this a 80 percent

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:56.879 
percent of how I give this a 80 percent
actually<00:04:46.240> probably<00:04:46.660> lower<00:04:47.580> 70<00:04:48.580> 80<00:04:48.700> percent

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889
