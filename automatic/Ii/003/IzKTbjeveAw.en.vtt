00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.469
 kennel method 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.419
 now let's go and look for the method shortens 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.719
 and accept all the various tables and so on 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.949
 hallo 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.969
 I would say that for 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.870
 this episode we can stop 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.819
 here otherwise you are in danger of going 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.449
 to explain so many things to make confusion then summarizing 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.119
 we begin to give a structure to our game 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.939
 declare 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.319
 those who are ours to control within death - 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.129
 we create all our controller classes 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.129
 we create y 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.859
 hey picnik apple let's go to work on the method 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.590
 of finish lunch in a street where we are going to initialize san mangia 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:48.869
 we will load the user preferences 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.529
 record demos 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.219
 the dictionary that contains 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.119
 the best scores 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:59.119
 we will load all + controllers 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.799
 we'll add more of the mile controller to the stack 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.699
 delirium of an indoor 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:08.699
 and let's go visible 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.399
 This 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:13.059
 is a variable 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.900
 we will close it later for you I buy the score as it comes out during 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.979
 the game 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.729
 here and then 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.059
 let's ask 

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.330

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.539
 the background music 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.059
 At the home screen I remember the first part 

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:37.059
 It is in the 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.710
 eat in sleep 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.129
 cariplo load it 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:46.379
 and then when I loaded the preferences go to check network 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.990
 I verify that if I drink I play music 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.639

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.150
 so in the method of 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.680
 define left-handed 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.860
 what they say 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.620
 if I am eaten 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.069
 play my music silent 

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.849
 I reproduce the fly 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.489
