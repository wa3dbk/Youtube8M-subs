and<00:00:17.240> so<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.810> gonna<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.230> my<00:00:19.260> basic

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and so I'm just gonna do my basic

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.220 
and so I'm just gonna do my basic
modifications<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.880> them<00:00:21.090> they're<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:22.109> of

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
modifications on them they're kind of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.250 
modifications on them they're kind of
old<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.760> some<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> springs<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> little

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
old and some of the springs are a little

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.679 
old and some of the springs are a little
weak<00:00:28.529> on<00:00:28.740> them<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.179> strengthening

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
weak on them so I will be strengthening

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
weak on them so I will be strengthening
up<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> springs<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.439> these<00:00:31.590> today<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.099> I'm

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
up the springs on these today but I'm

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.620 
up the springs on these today but I'm
going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> go<00:00:32.520> over<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.850> basic<00:00:33.270> modifications

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
going to go over my basic modifications

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.160 
going to go over my basic modifications
that<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.320> do<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.590> every<00:00:34.800> trap<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> first<00:00:37.050> thing

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that I do to every trap the first thing

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.420 
that I do to every trap the first thing
I'm<00:00:37.260> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.590> level<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> pan<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
I'm going to do is level the pan as you

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.889 
I'm going to do is level the pan as you
can<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.850> setting<00:00:39.149> high<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.899> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
can see it's setting high the the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.619 
can see it's setting high the the
process<00:00:43.350> for<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:45.239> pretty<00:00:45.539> much

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
process for doing this is pretty much

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.299 
process for doing this is pretty much
the<00:00:45.809> same<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:48.079> Duke<00:00:49.079> or<00:00:49.410> bridge<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:49.890> Victor

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the same on a Duke or bridge or Victor

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
the same on a Duke or bridge or Victor
anything<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.420> dog

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
anything we just got a bit in this dog

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.290 
anything we just got a bit in this dog
post<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> when<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.910> said

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.849 

I'm<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.360> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.780> bended<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.320> until<00:00:58.680> it's

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
I'm just kind of bended in until it's

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
I'm just kind of bended in until it's
level<00:00:59.039> per<00:00:59.670> channel<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.180> course<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.660> bit

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
level per channel of course a little bit

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.310 
level per channel of course a little bit
better<00:01:00.989> than<00:01:01.170> what<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.379> using<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:02.420> and

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.149 

she's<00:01:07.320> sitting<00:01:07.500> pretty<00:01:07.799> level<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
she's sitting pretty level there so that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.890 
she's sitting pretty level there so that
takes<00:01:11.340> care<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> next

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
takes care of that and so then the next

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
takes care of that and so then the next
thing<00:01:16.020> I've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.640> to

hang<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.180> me<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> little<00:01:18.840> bit<00:01:18.990> while

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
hang out with me for a little bit while

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
some of these Lightning Springs oops I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.830 
some of these Lightning Springs oops I
got<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.570> slide<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.930> thing<00:01:31.110> forward<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.860> I

got to slide this thing forward here I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.300 
got to slide this thing forward here I
will<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:34.110> eventually<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.829> getting<00:01:35.100> rid

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
of this just so you know but it's going
to<00:01:40.710> slide<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.250> these<00:01:41.369> Lightning<00:01:41.759> Springs

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to slide one of these Lightning Springs

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.289 
to slide one of these Lightning Springs
you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.479> pick<00:01:42.659> these<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:42.930> at<00:01:43.380> F<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> T<00:01:43.860> or

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
you can pick these up at F and T or

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
you can pick these up at F and T or
pretty<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.540> anybody<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.200> it'll<00:01:46.409> strengthen

up your Springs quite a lot and what
I'll<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.530> I'll<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:49.890> tack<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> right<00:01:50.490> here

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
I'll do is I'll just tack it right here

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.840 
I'll do is I'll just tack it right here
on<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:52.619> ends<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.340> sure<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.610> stays

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
on the ends just to make sure it stays

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:24.970 
on the ends just to make sure it stays
in<00:01:53.880> there<00:01:54.299> where<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> need<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.810> to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.500 

let's<00:02:25.980> flip<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.250> over<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:27.000> quick<00:02:27.240> tack

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
let's flip it over this one quick tack

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.950 
let's flip it over this one quick tack
on<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> other<00:02:27.930> side<00:02:29.630> everything<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:30.840> be

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
on the other side everything will be

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:42.300 
on the other side everything will be
fine<00:02:31.200> there

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.190 

okay

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
okay

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.430 
okay
so

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.950 

now<00:02:49.010> I've<00:02:49.130> got<00:02:49.280> strong<00:02:49.580> Springs<00:02:50.030> I've<00:02:50.780> got<00:02:50.930> a

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
now I've got strong Springs I've got a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.010 
now I've got strong Springs I've got a
little<00:02:51.260> pan<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:53.180> then<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.570> last<00:02:53.750> thing<00:02:53.960> that
