00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.740
 dog 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.260
 as 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:19.590
 Today I'm going to show you a way 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.660
 to make a super beautiful shirt is the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090
 most beautiful shirt I've made in my 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.210
 real life so in love with her and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.309
 in fact attract or cost this shirt 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.899
 I'm wearing it I think I'm going to 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:32.940
 use very often I will be very 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.370
 followed but good today I will share 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.219
 with you how can you create it in your 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.070
 own house in the school a hall of 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.070
 art and that art hall several of the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 students made large murals the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 coral in the women's bathroom was the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.339
 Frida Kahlo and the mural in New York 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.079
 men was from diego rivero when 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.550
 forget the mural of frida kahlo when 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.199
 they were just beginning it was in 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.999
 black and white I searched the internet 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.819
 look for photos 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.010
 Here there are blouses and they sell but not 

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:04.140
 there was no tutorial on how to do it or 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 on YouTube or Google or anywhere 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.690
 I found ways to make this shirt 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.620
 so you will not find any tutorials 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.500
 talk about this 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.780
 I'm going to create my own way and I'm going 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.350
 to patent then this is the video of 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.350
 my creation 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.760
 I hope you enjoy it is super godfather 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.220
 I loved super easy super super easy 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.580
 I could do it that I'm not good at 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.550
 this to draw and paint or those things 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.480
 so believe me you can do it 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 I believe in you 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.870
 and how good I leave you with the video I hope 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.390
 enjoy and feel emotions just like me and 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.370
 in the end I started by making sure that 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.350
 the drawing is the right size for the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.030
 t-shirt so he medicated it on this page 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.340
 blank which is where I'm going to draw the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.320
 design and if it's the size that I wanted 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.210
 I drew this by hand 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.150
 tracing the computer but it is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.000
 much easier if you print it though if 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:09.130
 you do not have a printer as I am like me 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.570
 I did not have it I did it by hand and I did not have 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.550
 no problem 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.070
 We are going to use two pieces of cardboard 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.690
 or any hard paper that you have 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:20.270
 use these holmes bags me 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.760
 and on the first piece of cardboard we're going 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.280
 to paste the image that you're going to believe 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.980
 cold hits 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.470
 now you'll cut around the frame 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.260
 your head you're not going to cut any of the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.190
 face of the factions even that is 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.190
 after 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.319
 the second card will position it 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.390
 in between your shirt between the party 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.980
 in front and the back so that 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.870
 once you start painting do not leave 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.390
 to transfer is very important that it was the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.090
 true sixth 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.319
 and here I am teaching you how I put it 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.900
 in the middle because it's really going to 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.690
 trespass if you do not do it here anything else 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.060
 you are going to trace the head of the character that 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.620
 you are only doing the head 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.100
 because you have not cut any of the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.100
 face 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.360
 so my camera stopped recording when 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.220
 I did the following steps but it is 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.230
 just the same thing that I did in this 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.050
 example that I give you once back of 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.100
 the frida head with the paint 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.490
 suppose the marker is the painting 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.860
 once you step on the head of frida 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.420
 cut everything black from the drawing everything 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.790
 that I wanted him to be black in my 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.460
 t-shirt cut it from the image of frida 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.010
 in this case his hair his lips his 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.780
 nose and your eyes you have to have a lot 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.370
 Be careful with the features I left everything 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.510
 that to make it look more real in your 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.700
 t-shirt 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.790
 once I did this before cutting it 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.770
 completely I left a small mark for 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.110
 know where to center the image when the 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.840
 out to draw on my shirt here I give you 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.960
 an example of the brand that I left 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.120
 It does not matter 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.760
 just to make sure it's centered 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.549
 within the framework 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.409
 once I put this and the following is 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.720
 nothing else fill what you want is black 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.209
 with fabric paint that's how it works 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.769
 called mine and here simply because 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.010
 I'm already filling in what's going black 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.950
 it is very very easy the most difficult thing is 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.019
 cut the features and when you paint 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.819
 so do not get out of line but out 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.009
 that's super super easy 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.150
 so just keep stuffing everything 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.170
 that you wanted black and this 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.000
 personally I think this with a 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.580
 simple makeup eyes and an area 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.280
 the red looks chorizo â€‹â€‹and the accessories 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:36.910
 gold can not sing when 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:40.350
 energy is filling the heart 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.350
 look step 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.210
 alone without this 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.900
 clearly 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 it is not good 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.730
