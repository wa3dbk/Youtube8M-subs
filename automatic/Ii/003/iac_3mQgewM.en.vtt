00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:16.410
 Hello Home Happy Flower is Lee Soo-young 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 We divide our marriage into twelve stages and in the name of married couple 12g law 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.990
 Let's take a look at each one today. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.990
 I'll look at the process of marriage. 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.619
 When a man or a woman reaches a certain age 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:39.190
 If you know love, each partner will have testosterone and estrogen. 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:44.650
 So a man aspires to a woman and a woman aspires to a man. 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.320
 I do not know who it is yet, but I have a machine in front of me that will show up. 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:53.800
 The so-called longing step 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.269
 So a man, like a real lie , also has a woman in front of me 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.180
 It appears. 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:03.590
 My breasts are rude 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:09.710
 Cupid's arrows finally penetrated the two. 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:11.570
 The off rime the concise and in that case of a fan ethyl arm side pa 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.230
 Neurotransmitter 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:20.240
 Thank you for your sense of well-being hwawol two people 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:26.360
 It makes me feel like a kind of drug addiction . 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:29.210
 At this time, I do not get tired even if I stay together all day . 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:35.450
 Change wants to have sex 5 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:38.050
 At this very stage, many people confess their love and do the secretary 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.490
 The pigs raise their wedding 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:48.850
 On the wedding day, the groom is like Brad Pitt himself . 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:52.750
 The bride falls into the illusion that the safety is Angelina Jolie . 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:56.530
 They know that their marriage is just as happy. 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.120
 I know my life will always be the same today. 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:06.790
 I'm addicted to the front steps of the attraction drug status b haetjiman 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.580
 This is a delusion because you experience it in a paralyzed state . 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:16.040
 But why do not you marry me? 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:20.750
 Loosen the 5 I look to hold the case as it gained the whole world is 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.090
 How long do you think this period of identity smells 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.049
 Shortly in a few months 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.900
 How many years is it? 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:37.060
 Why is our love so long I know it is so short 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:41.019
 When the human body is constantly exposed to the same scientific substance 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:46.329
 Since resistance is produced and the secretion of the substance is reduced 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.409
 Rush is gone people will easily doejyo principles of love, so experts 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.819
 The due date 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.819
 I think it's three years. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:01.050
 After a period of passionate love created by craving and attraction 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.110
 A ritual accompanied by pain and conflict awaits. 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:08.190
 Conflicts make the two men constantly struggling 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:13.730
 Finally, Article 5 has not experienced a crisis of this time 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:19.670
 n Plug It's called So-hee asks that gwontaegi formula 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:23.390
 The dictionary meaning of Bok-gi is that if the marriage lasts for a long time, 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.400
 I do not feel inspiration, 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:32.640
 It's a time of humor , 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.300
 It is called the period when it looks like Tae Jin-ah. 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.819
 Those parts of this crisis that are not quite as wide 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:48.709
 If you are married or are married, 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:51.769
 Will be back again this Lets party parakeet couple illustration 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.189
 As a result of sex hormones 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:04:01.189
 I am married with a fantasy that if I am married to my partner, I will live well. 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:06.520
 Not long after the illusion broke 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:12.970
 I feel disillusioned by regretting the marriage and so on. 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:15.580
 So some people give up, but most of them are to recover three people. 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:20.799
 It 's a course in the hospital . 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:26.800
 So let's party is an illustration of a more psychological 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:30.360
 Marriage is all about meeting other men and women on the other side 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:36.450
 It's the result of being a whole being. 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:39.360
 But jeongjak getting up because I'm getting married to each other in their invasion of the border 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.580
 I 'm afraid of it. 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.760
 So in the early days of marriage, I try to avoid conflict by ignoring it. 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.320
 But your opponent is still there 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:56.760
 The spouse is dragging to control and manipulate the clothes 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:05:01.380
 If I try to remodel it, I can not stay still. 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.800
 I'm on vacation . I'll defend and attack. 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:10.110
 That's the couple conflict. 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:14.070
 The longer you get in your marriage , the bigger you get as a snowman. 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:20.040
 Now , what should we do ? Will we be abandoned? 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:23.789
 No. At this time, we have to look back on our marriage. 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:28.710
 And you have to motivate yourself. 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:32.970
 Oh, I will not live this way anymore. 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:40.590
 Studying Reading books about marriage 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:44.039
 These lectures also practice what they learn to listen, and did so out of the first calculation 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.990
 When we lost the first love of which color 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:52.770
 That's the true man. 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:58.669
 You all expect to find three people. 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.669
 The bad is please with zip lectures audit
