00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to do a bit of hacking as well we need

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.000 
to do a bit of hacking as well we need
to<00:01:14.010> cut<00:01:14.250> off<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:16.920> tab

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.969 

yeah<00:01:22.010> that<00:01:22.430> needs<00:01:22.640> cutting<00:01:22.940> off<00:01:23.710> don't<00:01:24.710> need

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
yeah that needs cutting off don't need

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.950 
yeah that needs cutting off don't need
that<00:01:25.310> anymore<00:01:25.850> what<00:01:26.810> you're<00:01:26.900> gonna<00:01:27.020> do<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:29.630> if

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
that anymore what you're gonna do is if

that anymore what you're gonna do is if
you<00:01:30.080> look<00:01:30.110> at<00:01:30.290> this<00:01:30.380> idea<00:01:32.140> you're<00:01:33.140> gonna<00:01:34.869> cut

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
you look at this idea you're gonna cut

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.210 
you look at this idea you're gonna cut
it<00:01:36.110> across<00:01:36.260> here<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:37.460> get<00:01:37.640> rid<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:39.160> so<00:01:40.160> you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
it across here to get rid of that so you

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:50.170 
it across here to get rid of that so you
do<00:01:40.400> first<00:01:40.820> pop<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:47.090> second<00:01:47.570> cut<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:49.970> to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
do first pop the second cut is going to

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.700 
do first pop the second cut is going to
be<00:01:50.330> about<00:01:50.570> halfway<00:01:50.930> down<00:01:53.259> second<00:01:54.259> cuts<00:01:54.500> going

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
be about halfway down second cuts going

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.150 
be about halfway down second cuts going
to<00:01:54.770> come<00:01:54.979> down<00:01:55.190> here<00:01:55.460> off<00:01:56.090> way<00:01:56.590> then<00:01:57.590> off<00:01:57.800> way

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
to come down here off way then off way

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.350 
to come down here off way then off way
down<00:01:58.880> here<00:01:59.750> as<00:02:00.200> well<00:02:00.729> you're<00:02:01.729> gonna<00:02:01.850> cut<00:02:02.180> that

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
down here as well you're gonna cut that

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.770 
down here as well you're gonna cut that
out<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.899> once<00:02:05.899> you've<00:02:06.080> cut<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.590> out<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:07.780> just

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
out so once you've cut that out you just

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.199 
out so once you've cut that out you just
left

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209

must<00:03:41.720> in<00:03:41.930> front<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:42.530> it's<00:03:42.800> flat<00:03:43.129> the<00:03:44.060> front

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
must in front so it's flat the front

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.350 
must in front so it's flat the front
front<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:48.010> get<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.040> punch<00:03:49.400> or<00:03:50.030> something

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
front so I get a punch or something

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.410 
front so I get a punch or something
pointer<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.590> your<00:03:51.940> bar<00:03:52.940> plastic<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.180> end

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
pointer and your bar plastic so you end

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.350 
pointer and your bar plastic so you end
up<00:03:56.480> with<00:03:56.660> that<00:03:58.209> mark<00:03:59.209> on<00:03:59.480> here<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.790> drill<00:04:02.120> bit

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
up with that mark on here you drill bit

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.160 
up with that mark on here you drill bit
drill<00:04:02.660> through<00:04:03.470> that<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.660> what<00:04:05.840> you'll<00:04:06.019> do<00:04:06.140> is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
drill through that so what you'll do is

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.699 
drill through that so what you'll do is
you'll<00:04:06.410> get<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.590> hacksaw<00:04:11.019> I'm<00:04:12.019> gonna<00:04:12.230> hacksaw

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
you'll get a hacksaw I'm gonna hacksaw

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.960 
you'll get a hacksaw I'm gonna hacksaw
and<00:04:12.950> your<00:04:13.280> cut<00:04:14.560> an<00:04:15.560> angle<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:17.750> drilled<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.200> hole

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
and your cut an angle you drilled a hole

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.930 
and your cut an angle you drilled a hole
and<00:04:19.970> then<00:04:20.120> you'll<00:04:20.269> cut<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.660> at<00:04:20.870> an<00:04:20.959> angle<00:04:21.109> so

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.939 

which<00:04:25.940> matches<00:04:27.250> that

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.730 

so<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.310> will<00:04:32.520> actually<00:04:33.289> attach<00:04:34.289> itself

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
so that it will actually attach itself

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:45.980 
so that it will actually attach itself
to<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.099> actual<00:04:36.440> case<00:04:38.210> also<00:04:42.710> this<00:04:43.710> year<00:04:44.990> will

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
to the actual case also this year will

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.670 
to the actual case also this year will
have<00:04:46.080> to<00:04:46.259> be<00:04:46.380> cut<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:49.110> match<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:50.569> hole<00:04:51.569> in<00:04:52.380> the

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
have to be cut to match the hole in the

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.059 
have to be cut to match the hole in the
case<00:04:52.889> there<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.520> whole<00:04:54.229> slot<00:04:55.229> there<00:04:55.620> is

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
case there the whole slot there is

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:02.390 
case there the whole slot there is
actually<00:04:56.430> smaller<00:04:58.490> than<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.669> tab<00:05:00.030> on<00:05:00.660> here<00:05:01.400> so

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
actually smaller than the tab on here so

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.089 
actually smaller than the tab on here so
what<00:05:02.550> you'll<00:05:02.729> do<00:05:02.909> is<00:05:04.370> you'll<00:05:05.370> hack<00:05:06.000> site<00:05:07.099> and

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
what you'll do is you'll hack site and

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:17.110 
what you'll do is you'll hack site and
you'll<00:05:08.280> hack<00:05:08.550> site<00:05:10.009> and<00:05:12.470> your<00:05:13.470> life<00:05:13.650> with<00:05:14.659> bit

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
you'll hack site and your life with bit

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:23.180 
you'll hack site and your life with bit
which<00:05:18.120> will<00:05:18.360> fit<00:05:19.340> into<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.840> slot<00:05:22.139> so<00:05:23.099> you

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
which will fit into that slot so you

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.749 
which will fit into that slot so you
measure<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:23.610> slot<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.949> that's<00:05:26.159> what<00:05:26.610> you

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
measure that slot and that's what you

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.330 
measure that slot and that's what you
want

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
want

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.850 
want
on<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.639> tab<00:05:30.030> so<00:05:30.720> that<00:05:30.900> it<00:05:31.080> will<00:05:31.169> actually<00:05:31.229> fit

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
on this tab so that it will actually fit

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.320 
on this tab so that it will actually fit
in<00:05:32.220> that<00:05:32.430> slot<00:05:33.259> once<00:05:34.259> you've<00:05:34.440> done<00:05:34.590> that<00:05:35.330> you

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
in that slot once you've done that you

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.700 
in that slot once you've done that you
get<00:05:36.509> your<00:05:36.659> mesh<00:05:38.419> in<00:05:39.419> the<00:05:39.599> front<00:05:39.900> you<00:05:40.320> take<00:05:40.560> your

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
get your mesh in the front you take your

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.790 
get your mesh in the front you take your
mesh<00:05:41.030> and<00:05:42.030> your<00:05:42.150> glowy<00:05:42.360> thing<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.409> then<00:05:43.650> you

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
mesh and your glowy thing and then you

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.640 
mesh and your glowy thing and then you
glue<00:05:43.949> your<00:05:44.070> filter<00:05:44.639> on<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.150> front<00:05:45.500> of<00:05:46.500> the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
rack the back of the meshes

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.190 
rack the back of the meshes
and<00:05:49.920> that's<00:05:50.100> it<00:05:50.370> MOG<00:05:51.210> done<00:05:51.920> bye<00:05:52.920> for<00:05:53.160> now
