anyways<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.970> about<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.409> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
anyways that is about it and this is a

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.359 
anyways that is about it and this is a
limited<00:01:44.100> edition<00:01:44.280> dragon<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:46.369> easier

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
limited edition dragon it's more easier

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
limited edition dragon it's more easier
to<00:01:47.430> get<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.820> dragon<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> guess<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.840> guess<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to get this dragon I guess I guess the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.399 
to get this dragon I guess I guess the
rate<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.009> higher<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.640> let<00:01:51.030> use<00:01:51.270> level<00:01:51.750> 20

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
rate is higher if you let use level 20

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.639 
rate is higher if you let use level 20
dragons<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.780> lower<00:01:55.170> level

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
dragons and if you use lower level

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.929 
dragons and if you use lower level
dragon<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.100> still<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> chance<00:01:56.759> at

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
dragon you still have a chance at

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
dragon you still have a chance at
getting<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.360> dragon<00:01:57.869> except<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.890> just

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
getting the dragon except it's just
