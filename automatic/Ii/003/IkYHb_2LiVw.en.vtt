00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.120 
waterproof seal the waterproof seal acts
sort<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> know<00:01:29.610> an<00:01:29.939> extra<00:01:30.360> i<00:01:31.130> don't

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
sort of like you know an extra i don't

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.929 
sort of like you know an extra i don't
know<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.579> call<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:34.729> extra<00:01:35.729> width

know what you would call it extra width

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.039 
know what you would call it extra width
I<00:01:36.210> guess<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.799> glass<00:01:38.070> isn't<00:01:38.310> writing

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
I guess and so the glass isn't writing

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
I guess and so the glass isn't writing
instant<00:01:40.049> camera<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.310> once<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.790> those

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.590 
drill those with these they got a pointy
tip<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.290> screws<00:02:28.160> have<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.400> pointy<00:02:28.670> tip<00:02:28.850> so

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
tip of screws have a pointy tip so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.340 
tip of screws have a pointy tip so
basically<00:02:29.960> I<00:02:30.020> lined<00:02:30.470> it<00:02:30.620> up<00:02:30.860> very<00:02:31.460> straight

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
basically I lined it up very straight

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.400 
basically I lined it up very straight
where<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.830> looked<00:02:34.130> pretty<00:02:34.670> legit<00:02:35.390> what<00:02:36.260> you

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
where it looked pretty legit what you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.580 
where it looked pretty legit what you
have<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:36.890> can<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:37.130> screw<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:38.410> 41<00:02:39.410> out

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
have that you can just screw the 41 out

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.920 
have that you can just screw the 41 out
you<00:02:39.800> would<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:40.100> drilling<00:02:40.520> them<00:02:40.820> if<00:02:41.570> you<00:02:41.780> hear

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
you would be drilling them if you hear

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.030 
you would be drilling them if you hear
cracking<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.100> right<00:02:43.370> you're<00:02:44.270> um<00:02:45.040> you're

buns cover just loosen them just like
quarter<00:04:40.340> of<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.460> turn<00:04:42.070> very<00:04:43.070> good<00:04:43.280> it's<00:04:43.850> easy

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
quarter of a turn very good it's easy

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.550 
quarter of a turn very good it's easy
now<00:04:44.630> okay<00:04:45.440> so<00:04:45.950> i'll<00:04:46.910> show<00:04:47.090> you<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.270> works<00:04:47.570> so

now okay so i'll show you that works so

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.469 
now okay so i'll show you that works so
you<00:04:49.010> believe<00:04:49.130> me<00:04:49.340> and<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.150> doesn't<00:04:50.330> really

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
you believe me and it doesn't really

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.900

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
damage anything and there's your new

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.250 
damage anything and there's your new
zoom<00:04:55.910> works<00:04:56.180> everything<00:04:56.870> works<00:04:58.690> even<00:04:59.690> get<00:05:00.139> the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
zoom works everything works even get the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.090 
zoom works everything works even get the
rounded<00:05:00.710> edges<00:05:01.900> and<00:05:02.900> of<00:05:03.500> course<00:05:03.770> when<00:05:03.919> you<00:05:03.979> go

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
rounded edges and of course when you go

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.510 
rounded edges and of course when you go
digital<00:05:04.400> zoom<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:05.930> lose<00:05:06.200> them<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:07.310> sort

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
digital zoom you lose them and you sort

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.340 
digital zoom you lose them and you sort
of<00:05:07.580> lose<00:05:07.729> clarity<00:05:08.330> but<00:05:08.479> that's<00:05:08.660> any<00:05:08.960> digital
