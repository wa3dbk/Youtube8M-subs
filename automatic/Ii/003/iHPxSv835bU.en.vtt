00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
and on the initial launch of JDeveloper

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.830 
and on the initial launch of JDeveloper
will<00:01:33.109> associate<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.939> different<00:01:35.240> files<00:01:35.450> to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the JDeveloper ide and what we'll do

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.340 
the JDeveloper ide and what we'll do
here<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.649> run<00:01:43.429> the<00:01:43.939> updates<00:01:44.389> in<00:01:44.719> the<00:01:45.079> bottom

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
here is run the updates in the bottom

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.370 
here is run the updates in the bottom
right<00:01:45.529> hand<00:01:45.679> corner<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.779> the<00:01:47.779> more<00:01:48.020> important

right hand corner and the more important
thing<00:01:48.529> of<00:01:48.590> what<00:01:48.740> we'll<00:01:48.889> do<00:01:49.039> is<00:01:49.279> actually

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
thing of what we'll do is actually

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.580 
thing of what we'll do is actually
install<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.990> extensions<00:01:51.619> for<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.939> uh<00:01:52.969> BPM<00:01:53.959> and

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
install the extensions for so uh BPM and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.169 
install the extensions for so uh BPM and
web<00:01:54.799> Center<00:01:55.039> so<00:01:55.340> first<00:01:55.579> we'll<00:01:55.700> start<00:01:55.789> with<00:01:55.939> so

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
web Center so first we'll start with so

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.419 
web Center so first we'll start with so
up<00:01:56.389> I'll<00:01:57.079> just<00:01:57.259> search<00:01:57.409> that<00:01:57.679> and<00:01:57.889> as<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.189> type

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
up I'll just search that and as you type

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.510 
up I'll just search that and as you type
you<00:01:58.999> get<00:01:59.409> the<00:02:00.409> extensions<00:02:00.950> filtered<00:02:01.369> down

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
you get the extensions filtered down

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.399 
you get the extensions filtered down
next<00:02:02.209> we'll<00:02:02.329> do<00:02:02.450> web<00:02:02.630> Center<00:02:02.979> there's<00:02:03.979> two

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
next we'll do web Center there's two

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.029 
next we'll do web Center there's two
components<00:02:06.409> for<00:02:06.529> web<00:02:06.649> Center

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
components for web Center

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.250 
components for web Center
lastly<00:02:08.030> we'll<00:02:08.209> do<00:02:08.360> BPM<00:02:09.759> and<00:02:10.990> when<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.080> click

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
lastly we'll do BPM and when you click

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.440 
lastly we'll do BPM and when you click
Next<00:02:12.560> here<00:02:12.620> these<00:02:13.160> will<00:02:13.370> begin<00:02:13.670> to<00:02:13.880> download

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
Next here these will begin to download

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.040 
Next here these will begin to download
and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.420 
and
which<00:02:15.350> takes<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.710> little<00:02:15.770> bit<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.070> time<00:02:16.250> but

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
which takes a little bit of time but
