perfect is that same camera system and
all<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.650> things<00:02:45.980> we've<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.130> talked<00:02:46.520> about

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
all the things we've just talked about

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.060 
all the things we've just talked about
to<00:02:47.270> take<00:02:47.510> stunning<00:02:48.110> HD<00:02:49.100> video<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:51.010> for<00:02:52.010> the

to take stunning HD video and for the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.260 
to take stunning HD video and for the
first<00:02:52.340> time<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.590> 1080p<00:02:54.590> HD<00:02:55.190> video<00:02:55.310> just

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
first time is now 1080p HD video just

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.400 
first time is now 1080p HD video just
the<00:02:56.450> resolution<00:02:56.959> you<00:02:56.989> are

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.710 

and<00:03:02.280> we<00:03:02.370> use<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.700> powerful<00:03:03.120> image<00:03:03.510> signal

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
and we use that powerful image signal

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.600 
and we use that powerful image signal
processor<00:03:03.870> inside<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> a5<00:03:04.920> chip<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.340> do<00:03:05.460> some

processor inside the a5 chip to do some

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.210 
processor inside the a5 chip to do some
incredible<00:03:05.730> things<00:03:06.320> like<00:03:07.320> real-time<00:03:07.680> video

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
incredible things like real-time video

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.370 
incredible things like real-time video
image<00:03:08.610> stabilization<00:03:09.000> as<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.080> know<00:03:10.170> as<00:03:10.290> you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
image stabilization as you know as you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.840 
image stabilization as you know as you
make<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> video<00:03:10.830> camera<00:03:11.040> smaller<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.550> smaller

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
make a video camera smaller and smaller

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.480 
make a video camera smaller and smaller
it's<00:03:12.420> harder<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.810> hold<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.440> still<00:03:13.890> so

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
it's harder to hold it really still so

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.760 
it's harder to hold it really still so
this<00:03:14.670> helps<00:03:15.000> remove<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.810> lot<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.080> that<00:03:16.200> shaking

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
this helps remove a lot of that shaking

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.190 
this helps remove a lot of that shaking
this<00:03:16.950> you<00:03:17.100> could<00:03:17.250> get<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:18.480> we<00:03:18.570> try<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.780> improve

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
this you could get and we try to improve

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.810 
this you could get and we try to improve
the<00:03:19.380> video<00:03:19.500> quality<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:20.130> real<00:03:20.280> time<00:03:20.490> by<00:03:20.640> doing

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
the video quality in real time by doing

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.700 
the video quality in real time by doing
temporal<00:03:21.150> noise<00:03:21.330> reduction<00:03:21.750> especially

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
temporal noise reduction especially

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.890 
temporal noise reduction especially
helps<00:03:22.950> in<00:03:23.100> low-light<00:03:23.460> scenarios<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.720> that's

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
helps in low-light scenarios so that's

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.590 
helps in low-light scenarios so that's
