00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.210
 in the building behind my back are 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.339
 Many firms have offices and that 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.770
 engaged in recruiting but customers 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.680
 who have been here both claim that 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.460
 forced to look for employers themselves 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.769
 full-time students just take money from any 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.320
 company representatives comments 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.969
 refused 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.929
 in droves here and hurry old and 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.550
 Young Svetlana has long wanted to find 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.769
 work for her daughter recently came across 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.750
 on an enticing newspaper ad 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.500
 without these requirements for job seekers 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.010
 he is promised thirty five thousand rde and 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.580
 more however the reality looks 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.700
 somewhat differently did not just give a list 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.420
 salons flows ii required 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.330
 I can also find Tomi fairs as well 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.180
 the tax authorities in the employment service 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.300
 need to move this skype connection 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.460
 they say completely different 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.150
 in fact and if you read carefully 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.130
 the agency takes the contract from the client 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.890
 one and a half thousand rubles and names for 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.820
 no provision of phones 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.170
 other workers are allegedly required 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.380
 these firms themselves carried them out 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.950
 mentioned agencies do not have 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:57.679
 concepts 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.529
 from where the latter-day personnel officers take 

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:01.239
 employers phones can 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.920
 just guess the real one 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 HR specialists recommend 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.149
 find jobs only through those 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.979
 agencies where else are such requirements for 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:08.800
 job seeker 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.760
 employers 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.020
 employers 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 as a personnel department, we know where the submitters are 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.390
 looking for employees for him 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 the Internet 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.530
 it's a whole bunch of insurance 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.159
 newspaper is our job search and so on and 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.540
 the like 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.240
 legally both forms of personnel assistance are few 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.390
 what is different however in practice they say 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.430
 lawyers office accepting money with 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.340
 people actually selling 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 by air 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.770
 well-known and accessible information 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.390
 I am a fighter to handle 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.630
 but not afraid but according to financial 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.970
 can apply for legal assistance 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.270
 because the amount of the claim is sufficient 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.880
 small court there is enough wiki but 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.490
 do not need to be afraid of yourself 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.640
 go to court 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.090
 because it is there l taken 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.070
 money behind them attention is dangerous on 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.100
 services under the contract such 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.590
 the agency is under no obligation 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.900
 on employment but I want a case if 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.990
 it still goes to get a client 30 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.330
 percent of first salary yield not 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.759
 get the bait of this service 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.049
 simplest 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.109
 lawyers advise to read carefully 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.959
