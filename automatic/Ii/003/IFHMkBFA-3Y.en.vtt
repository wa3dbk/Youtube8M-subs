00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.780
 because one of the most fun parts 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 in all this process of making movies 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.130
 is the casting and as has already been commented 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.110
 I love finding similarities to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.450
 people why I love everything 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.039
 this roll of the ideal casting and with all 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.380
 these projects of superiors that manel 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.970
 is developing day by day it filters 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.590
 on the internet different rumors about 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 actors and actresses who want to form 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.239
 part of the cinematic universe and it's 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.440
 why he decides to make this video hello 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.480
 everyone is Andrew and nobody has 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.870
 exteriors I bring mica ideal for 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.870
 inhuman 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.750
 it will be 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.940
 which would be in my opinion the actors 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.100
 and the actresses that would be perfect 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.140
 to interpret the royal family and 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.909
 sharpen for the role of black gold the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.399
 king of the inhuman I believe that the 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.769
 index is the best and the only option 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.870
 as remembering index already lent him his 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.790
 health voice in guardians of the galaxy 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.200
 but the reality is that this is not a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.909
 inconvenient so that the current one can 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
 interpret black ball in the movie 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.020
 of the inhuman since he only 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.399
 lent his voice to ruth and if you want 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.560
 interpret blackwood he does not 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.479
 I would need your voice that will have to 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.399
 lend your physique to the king of the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.369
 inhuman since as you will remember 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.140
 Blackburn can not speak good if he can 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.840
 but it should not because with a single word 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 could destroy entire cities is for 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 that the index is the best option 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.090
 to play black ball for the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 jellyfish paper I think my case 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.830
 ideal is the actress jessica chastain me 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.110
 I'm a big fan of Jessica Chastain is a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.330
 excellent actress is beautiful and her 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.800
 hair orange red and perfect to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.110
 jellyfish of the inhuman 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.990
 for the glass paper the sister of 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.600
 jellyfish on the stones many after and 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.880
 often you are no longer gwen stacy was gwen 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.710
 Stacy hurts to admit it but Gwen 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 stacy died in the amazing work 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.360
 damaged to forgiveness by the spoilers apart 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.610
 the fact that she was gwen 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.740
 stacy a marvel character does not 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.750
 prevents being another character in the universe 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.430
 cinematographic marvel since as 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.200
 will remember chris evans was the first the 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.180
 yuma author of the fantastic four of 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.550
 fox and then it has appeared as the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.770
 Captain America Marvel Studios and 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.540
 that easily in this could be changed 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.450
 of study and be crystal in the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.220
 inhuman for the role of carnac this 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.280
 inhuman connoisseur all the arts 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.770
 martial my ideal actor is jason 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
 statham is a good actor we have seen 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.310
 in action movies all these 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.830
 movements that were already being said very 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.920
 well with meat for the role of Gordon 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.990
 actor joe manganiello is my actor 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.580
 ideal to interpret it I consider that 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.160
 the actor's physique lends itself very well 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.260
 to bring us a goal you'll count 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.370
 for the role of triton the first actor 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.590
 that came to my mind was the actor 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.090
 alexander skarsgard but then sing 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.680
 that he had also placed a guest 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.950
 ideal of the league of justice as 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.250
 they love and I decided to look for someone else and I 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.410
 I'm going by Jonathan Rhys Meyers this actor 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.360
 has a deep mystical look is the 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.860
 best way to describe it I think that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.290
 the news quite well this 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.290
 mythical aquatic character that is tripton 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.690
 and well finally we have maximus the 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.060
 crazy the brother of black ball who is the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.890
 main villain of the inhuman by 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.110
 what is very likely the basis of the 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.520
 villain in the movie I was thinking 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.920
 first in an actor that had this 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.750
 crazy look loves the deranged but that 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.910
 also had some resemblance to vin 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.130
 diesel but the reality is that that's 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.230
 quite difficult as he explained to them that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.750
 I only came up with the god-free rock 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.440
 let's hope the rock never says the universe 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.020
 cinematographic marvel after 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.970
 think about it a lot I found two 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.000
 actors that could well play 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.310
 maximus crazy web actors you and 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.290
 cillian murphy I think any of 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.079
 these two actors would be perfect 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.569
 the role of maximus the crazy though I 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.579
 I go more for wes bentley in truth I 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.549
 I would love to see him making his life 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.170
 inhuman impossible to wait for 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.739
 someone in marvel gets to see my video and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.150
 take some notes of the movie 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.540
 of the inhuman opens in November 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.060
 of 2018 that was my ideal case for the 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.739
 without hands I will like to know your opinion 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 and the taste ideal habitat did not like 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.470
 than other actors that you who 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.780
 they could look perfect on paper 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.489
 leave debts comments your feet to
