k100 comes in 32 different sections as
you<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:29.510> they're<00:00:30.510> about<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> meter<00:00:31.230> long

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you can see they're about a meter long

the line of a floor drain system and we

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
the line of a floor drain system and we
use<00:01:42.000> these<00:01:42.180> quite<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> bit<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.200> an<00:01:43.320> excellent

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
use these quite a bit it's an excellent

use these quite a bit it's an excellent
system<00:01:44.210> they<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.540> very<00:01:46.200> different<00:01:46.320> types<00:01:46.950> of

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
system they have very different types of

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.880 
system they have very different types of
covers<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> standard<00:01:49.380> cover<00:01:49.590> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
covers this is the standard cover it's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.899 
covers this is the standard cover it's
just<00:01:50.130> basically<00:01:50.549> an<00:01:51.270> aluminum<00:01:52.110> cover<00:01:52.850> they<00:01:53.850> do

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
just basically an aluminum cover they do

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.219 
just basically an aluminum cover they do
have

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
have

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.710 
have

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
cast iron cover as you see here and

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.810 
cast iron cover as you see here and
there's<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.619> variety<00:02:00.920> about<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.340> colors<00:02:01.670> that

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
there's a variety about the colors that

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.000 
there's a variety about the colors that
are<00:02:02.030> covered<00:02:03.020> of<00:02:03.110> colors<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.470> are<00:02:03.710> amenable

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
are covered of colors that are amenable

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.219 
are covered of colors that are amenable
but<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.850> really<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.330> if<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.510> have<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.900> floor

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
but this really is if you have a floor

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.760 
but this really is if you have a floor
