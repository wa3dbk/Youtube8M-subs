00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.530 
we're going to continue our bubble
letter<00:00:03.860> series<00:00:04.400> we're<00:00:05.360> going<00:00:05.480> to<00:00:05.570> do<00:00:05.720> a<00:00:05.750> Q<00:00:07.540> R

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
letter series we're going to do a Q R

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.690 
letter series we're going to do a Q R
and<00:00:10.360> s<00:00:11.360> now<00:00:11.900> good<00:00:12.440> trick<00:00:12.650> for<00:00:12.800> making<00:00:12.920> an<00:00:13.160> S<00:00:13.340> is

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
and s now good trick for making an S is

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.450 
and s now good trick for making an S is
to<00:00:14.030> draw<00:00:14.809> an<00:00:14.960> 8<00:00:15.339> s<00:00:16.339> and<00:00:16.909> a<00:00:17.720> T<00:00:17.990> we're<00:00:18.949> going<00:00:19.220> to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
to draw an 8 s and a T we're going to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:29.600 
to draw an 8 s and a T we're going to
make<00:00:19.970> our<00:00:20.179> s<00:00:20.800> angular

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.560 

and<00:00:30.000> gonna<00:00:30.600> make<00:00:30.690> our<00:00:30.900> cube<00:00:31.310> Bangalore<00:00:32.310> -<00:00:32.570> like

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and gonna make our cube Bangalore - like

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.040 
and gonna make our cube Bangalore - like
we<00:00:33.720> did<00:00:33.900> the<00:00:34.050> O<00:00:34.430> so<00:00:35.430> we'll<00:00:35.940> draw<00:00:36.180> our<00:00:36.510> ovals

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
we did the O so we'll draw our ovals

00:00:37.050 --> 00:01:04.369 
we did the O so we'll draw our ovals
around<00:00:37.460> these<00:00:38.460> shapes<00:00:38.850> here

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.530 

and<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.400> our<00:01:05.519> qrst<00:01:11.030> time<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.210> ink<00:01:12.299> those

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and we have our qrst time to ink those

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.750 
and we have our qrst time to ink those
in

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.060 

and<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.300> left<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.750> inside<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.200> queue<00:01:18.500> open

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
and I left the inside of this queue open

more than the oh so I can get that or
the<00:01:23.450> queue<00:01:23.870> in<00:01:24.050> there<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.590> is<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.950> stick

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
the queue in there that is the stick

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:55.530 
the queue in there that is the stick
that<00:01:25.520> hangs<00:01:25.760> out<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.150> bottom

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
pull that curve and there we go time to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:03:40.900 
pull that curve and there we go time to
get<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.240> eraser

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:50.330 

let's<00:03:42.020> clean<00:03:43.020> that<00:03:43.200> up<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.590> paintbrush<00:03:49.340> go

let's clean that up with a paintbrush go

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:52.500 
let's clean that up with a paintbrush go
in<00:03:50.520> with<00:03:50.700> our<00:03:50.730> detail

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510

alright now let's draw some highlight

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:07.420 
alright now let's draw some highlight
shapes

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.190 

I'm<00:05:07.790> gonna<00:05:07.940> hit<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.180> top<00:05:08.420> of<00:05:08.450> that<00:05:08.690> s<00:05:08.900> right

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
I'm gonna hit the top of that s right

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.230 
I'm gonna hit the top of that s right
there<00:05:09.880> let's<00:05:10.880> see<00:05:11.090> we<00:05:11.270> can<00:05:11.390> also<00:05:12.970> hit<00:05:13.970> on<00:05:14.150> there

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
there let's see we can also hit on there

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.200 
there let's see we can also hit on there
you<00:05:17.240> know<00:05:17.360> if<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.570> want<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:18.050> can<00:05:18.200> even<00:05:18.230> hit

all right there we go now let's see how

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.210 
all right there we go now let's see how
that<00:07:02.850> fits<00:07:03.270> in<00:07:03.509> with<00:07:03.560> the<00:07:04.560> other<00:07:04.680> letters<00:07:05.040> we

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
that fits in with the other letters we

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:15.320 
that fits in with the other letters we
were<00:07:05.340> doing<00:07:09.770> previous<00:07:10.770> set<00:07:14.120> made<00:07:15.120> these<00:07:15.300> a

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
were doing previous set made these a

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.600 
were doing previous set made these a
little<00:07:15.539> larger<00:07:16.280> probably<00:07:17.280> wouldn't<00:07:17.460> happen

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.610 
little larger probably wouldn't happen

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.420 
little larger probably wouldn't happen
if<00:07:17.850> I<00:07:17.940> was<00:07:18.030> doing<00:07:18.210> them<00:07:18.330> all<00:07:18.479> on<00:07:18.570> one<00:07:18.720> sheet<00:07:18.960> but

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
if I was doing them all on one sheet but

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.740 
if I was doing them all on one sheet but
it's<00:07:20.430> okay<00:07:20.699> we<00:07:20.880> can<00:07:21.030> shrink<00:07:21.240> them<00:07:21.389> down<00:07:21.570> a<00:07:21.600> bit

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
it's okay we can shrink them down a bit

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.810 
it's okay we can shrink them down a bit
when<00:07:22.080> we<00:07:22.259> put<00:07:22.979> them<00:07:23.130> all<00:07:23.190> together<00:07:23.370> into<00:07:23.699> a

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:23.820 
when we put them all together into a

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.730 
when we put them all together into a
word<00:07:24.770> so<00:07:25.770> we<00:07:26.009> cut<00:07:26.130> your<00:07:26.280> qrst<00:07:27.030> yeah<00:07:28.020> men<00:07:28.350> OMP
