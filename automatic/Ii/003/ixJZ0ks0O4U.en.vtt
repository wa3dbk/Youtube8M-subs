chains or a snow bass tire okay now when
it<00:00:43.620> comes<00:00:43.740> to<00:00:44.060> drifting<00:00:45.060> what<00:00:45.720> are<00:00:45.810> the<00:00:45.870> steps

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
it comes to drifting what are the steps

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.819 
it comes to drifting what are the steps
how<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.380> do<00:00:46.470> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
how do I do it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.100 
how do I do it
well<00:00:47.160> drifting<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> snow<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
well drifting the snow it's that it's

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.479 
well drifting the snow it's that it's
quite<00:00:49.350> unique<00:00:49.650> it<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.070> depends<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:50.400> what

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
quite unique it really depends on what

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.710 
quite unique it really depends on what
car<00:00:50.760> you're<00:00:50.910> driving<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> four-wheel-drive

car<00:00:52.290> like<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.470> BMW<00:00:52.800> hind<00:00:53.310> us<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.700> slightly

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
car like that BMW hind us a slightly

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.940 
car like that BMW hind us a slightly
different<00:00:54.600> technique<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.380> need<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.710> get<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
different technique you need to get the

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.950 
different technique you need to get the
car<00:00:56.190> turned<00:00:56.760> rotated<00:00:57.450> with<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:57.720> steering

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
car turned rotated with the steering

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.990 
car turned rotated with the steering
when<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> back<00:00:58.860> comes<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.790> power

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
when the back comes out or on the power

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
when the back comes out or on the power
now<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> interesting<00:01:01.230> thing<00:01:01.380> with<00:01:01.470> drifting

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
now the interesting thing with drifting

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.740 
now the interesting thing with drifting
four-wheel<00:01:02.220> drive<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.910> more<00:01:03.090> power<00:01:03.360> a<00:01:03.450> better

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
four-wheel drive the more power a better

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
four-wheel drive the more power a better
it<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.009> we<00:01:05.069> call<00:01:05.189> counter

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it is so we do what we call counter

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.819 
it is so we do what we call counter
steering<00:01:05.789> we<00:01:06.030> turn<00:01:06.299> into<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.569> slide<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:07.560> power

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:07.829 
steering we turn into the slide or power

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:09.260

if you don't know what you're doing
anyone<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.180> come<00:02:06.360> along<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.600> give<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> go

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440

I<00:02:07.470> didn't<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.429> well<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.760> my<00:02:09.000> first<00:02:09.270> slalom

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
I didn't do so well on my first slalom

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.260 
I didn't do so well on my first slalom
run<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.290> after<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> few<00:02:11.130> guys<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.550> was<00:02:11.760> drifting

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
run but after a few guys I was drifting

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.630 
run but after a few guys I was drifting
like<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.540> pro<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.200> miss<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.100> pretty<00:02:14.280> much<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.520> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
like a pro I miss to pretty much all the

like a pro I miss to pretty much all the
cones<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.910> had<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.240> through<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.750> went<00:02:16.350> in

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
cones I had to go through and went in

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.420 
cones I had to go through and went in
straight<00:02:16.709> line<00:02:16.890> which<00:02:17.070> it<00:02:17.160> doesn't<00:02:17.370> do

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
straight line which it doesn't do

anything<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:18.360> I<00:02:18.450> get<00:02:18.630> another<00:02:18.780> guy<00:02:23.000> here<00:02:24.000> we<00:02:24.060> go

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
anything do I get another guy here we go

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.780 
anything do I get another guy here we go
turn<00:02:25.290> number<00:02:25.440> two<00:02:25.770> for<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.670> get

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
turn number two for this if I can get

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.140 

you<00:02:34.110> could<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.410> better<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:34.860> time

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.720 

what<00:02:38.150> about<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.600> ice<00:02:38.720> ice<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:39.740> tough<00:02:40.190> no

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
what about on the ice ice is tough no

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.060 
what about on the ice ice is tough no
one<00:02:40.880> can<00:02:41.060> drive<00:02:41.150> an<00:02:41.390> ice<00:02:41.620> evil<00:02:42.620> hey<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.830> went<00:02:43.010> to

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
one can drive an ice evil hey I went to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.890 
one can drive an ice evil hey I went to
driving<00:02:43.400> tires<00:02:43.610> like<00:02:43.880> these<00:02:44.030> ones<00:02:44.330> ice<00:02:44.600> drive

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
driving tires like these ones ice drive

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.770 
driving tires like these ones ice drive
is<00:02:45.110> extremely<00:02:45.710> difficult<00:02:45.890> in<00:02:46.850> Sweden<00:02:47.540> or

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
is extremely difficult in Sweden or

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.020 
is extremely difficult in Sweden or
Finland<00:02:48.320> they'd<00:02:48.500> use<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.860> spikes<00:02:49.220> fire<00:02:49.580> we<00:02:49.820> have

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
Finland they'd use a spikes fire we have

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.180 
Finland they'd use a spikes fire we have
grip<00:02:50.300> these<00:02:50.990> tires<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.590> ice<00:02:51.710> are<00:02:51.980> very

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
grip these tires and ice are very

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.100 
grip these tires and ice are very
difficult<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:52.790> drive<00:02:53.210> the<00:02:53.420> conditions<00:02:53.870> of<00:02:54.020> its

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
difficult so drive the conditions of its

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.260 
difficult so drive the conditions of its
icy<00:02:54.470> slow<00:02:54.680> right<00:02:55.070> right<00:02:55.370> down<00:02:55.550> okay<00:02:56.060> best

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
icy slow right right down okay best

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.810 
icy slow right right down okay best
drive<00:02:56.540> on<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> ice<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.500> have<00:02:57.620> no<00:02:58.040> idea<00:02:58.520> having

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
drive on the ice I have no idea having

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.230 
drive on the ice I have no idea having
they<00:02:58.910> go<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.540> looks<00:03:00.320> nice<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.590> shiny<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.940> it's

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
they go it looks nice and shiny but it's

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:10.890 
they go it looks nice and shiny but it's
going<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.450> be<00:03:02.540> incredibly<00:03:03.260> slippery

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:23.040 

oh<00:03:12.659> my<00:03:13.659> god

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.440 

when<00:03:23.740> you're<00:03:23.860> driving<00:03:24.010> BMW<00:03:24.730> what<00:03:25.030> difference

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
when you're driving BMW what difference

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.210 
when you're driving BMW what difference
does<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> xDrive<00:03:25.960> make<00:03:26.230> well<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.710> xDrive<00:03:27.010> is

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
does the xDrive make well the xDrive is

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.890 
does the xDrive make well the xDrive is
a<00:03:27.250> great<00:03:27.520> floor<00:03:27.760> drive<00:03:28.120> system<00:03:28.480> we<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.720> put

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
a great floor drive system we can put

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.140 
a great floor drive system we can put
power<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.290> any<00:03:29.500> individual<00:03:30.040> wheel<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.850> if

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
power in any individual wheel so if

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.450 
power in any individual wheel so if
we've<00:03:31.330> got<00:03:31.360> ice<00:03:31.750> or<00:03:32.020> snow<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.800> fourth<00:03:33.160> wheel

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
we've got ice or snow that fourth wheel

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.430 
we've got ice or snow that fourth wheel
will<00:03:33.670> drag<00:03:33.880> this<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.420> situation<00:03:35.020> so

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
will drag this out of the situation so

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.920 
will drag this out of the situation so
it<00:03:35.500> works<00:03:35.680> really<00:03:35.830> really<00:03:36.190> well<00:03:36.550> but<00:03:37.180> you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
it works really really well but you

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.570 
it works really really well but you
can't<00:03:38.200> beat<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.410> laws<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.800> physics<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.370> if

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
can't beat the laws of physics so if

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.850 
can't beat the laws of physics so if
we've<00:03:39.790> got<00:03:39.970> ice<00:03:40.180> maybe<00:03:40.990> a<00:03:41.080> two-ton<00:03:41.530> car

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
we've got ice maybe a two-ton car

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.320 
we've got ice maybe a two-ton car
traveling<00:03:42.310> at<00:03:42.400> say<00:03:42.520> 80<00:03:42.730> kilometers<00:03:43.180> an<00:03:43.270> hour

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
traveling at say 80 kilometers an hour

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.300 
traveling at say 80 kilometers an hour
you<00:03:44.050> know<00:03:44.170> we<00:03:44.320> are<00:03:44.470> just<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.770> passenger

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you know we are just a passenger

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.370 
you know we are just a passenger
so<00:03:45.670> my<00:03:45.850> really<00:03:46.180> big<00:03:46.300> advice<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.960> drive<00:03:47.230> the

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
so my really big advice is to drive the

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.340 
so my really big advice is to drive the
conditions<00:03:47.770> slow<00:03:48.040> it<00:03:48.100> down<00:03:48.190> drive<00:03:48.970> sensibly

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
conditions slow it down drive sensibly

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.810 
conditions slow it down drive sensibly
open<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.470> gaps<00:03:50.680> up<00:03:50.950> between<00:03:51.130> vehicles<00:03:51.460> and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
open the gaps up between vehicles and

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.440 
open the gaps up between vehicles and
just<00:03:52.720> try<00:03:52.960> and<00:03:53.020> get<00:03:53.230> your<00:03:53.440> destination<00:03:53.650> safely

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
just try and get your destination safely

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.850 
just try and get your destination safely
this<00:03:55.450> has<00:03:55.630> been<00:03:55.840> an<00:03:55.990> eye-opening<00:03:56.830> experience

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
this has been an eye-opening experience

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.460 
this has been an eye-opening experience
getting<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:57.850> first-hand<00:03:58.450> understanding<00:03:58.660> of

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
getting that first-hand understanding of

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.440 
getting that first-hand understanding of
just<00:03:59.740> how<00:03:59.800> quickly<00:04:00.190> things<00:04:00.640> can<00:04:00.700> go<00:04:01.000> wrong<00:04:01.030> on

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
just how quickly things can go wrong on

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.260 
just how quickly things can go wrong on
snow<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.840> ice<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:03.100> the<00:04:03.250> BMW<00:04:03.370> X<00:04:03.970> series

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
snow and ice but the BMW X series

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.000 
snow and ice but the BMW X series
vehicles<00:04:04.690> we've<00:04:05.050> been<00:04:05.260> driving<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.830> the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
vehicles we've been driving and the

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.980 
vehicles we've been driving and the
xDrive<00:04:06.400> system<00:04:06.490> are<00:04:07.240> just<00:04:07.900> so<00:04:08.380> intuitive
