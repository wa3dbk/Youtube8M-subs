00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:09.360
 but compare we have a lot of data 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.360
 for you 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:18.110
 but to pay us maybe this is for 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.110
 you 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.870
 hi how are you today 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.790
 today we are going to make a recipe that is very 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.680
 easy free or that everyone alike already know 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.259
 how to do it because we are talking about 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.399
 topic 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.100
 but we are going to add an ingredient 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.149
 that will provide you with many minerals 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.890
 many vitamins many antioxidants and 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.690
 a lot of protein 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.820
 so with this ingredient I mean 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.940
 to the suite 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.100
 Spirulina is a microalgae and is very 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.470
 valued because it has many many 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.570
 important nutrients that people from 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.700
 suddenly he has not taken a feed 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.680
 poor in nutrients that include 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.110
 spirulina to finish and perform the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.250
 body and re nourish it then now what 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.350
 what are we going to do we are going to occupy the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.920
 spirulina as food because the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.320
 Spirulina is an algae the fruit is not not 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.820
 one because many times they see it in capsule 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.610
 and people think it's like a 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.830
 medication then the spirulina one 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.649
 you can consume it in doses of up to 510 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.550
 grams and does not produce effects like 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.830
 secondary as it was a medicine 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.600
 conventional then the ideal is that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.289
 go distributing a little bit because a 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.149
 super powerful food and they go 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.900
 getting used to the flavor and go 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.850
 incorporating in different preparations 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.200
 within this month I think we have 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.110
 been doing different recipes with 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.840
 readings and let's go with the spirou 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.330
 mole then since I have the avocado 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.960
 milled 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.790
 and I'm going to apply it with a lack 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.650
 and I'm going to chop a clove of garlic 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.890
 I wanted to show you how to prick the tooth 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.659
 of garlic why 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.490
 many times garlic is very strong for 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.580
 the joints this is so that it does not produce 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.940
 digestive problems 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.550
 HernÃ¡ndez understand the taste of garlic all 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.010
 the day 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.170
 It's the secret of getting this part 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.659
 green that is here is like tallito 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:30.290
 they take out and that's what but like that 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:30.290
 It softens a bit this 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.319
 and so more basic is then we are going to 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.360
 chop the garlic clove the same way you can 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.360
 do without garlic if they want 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.330
 water has these properties 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.330
 medicinal 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.020
 and antibacterial then help them a lot 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.890
 for refugees in resolving 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.890
 mucus 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.800
 if we want to be a clove of garlic 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.540
 and let's go 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.100
 tomato I will not be all this 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.750
 tomato because I do not like it that much and I 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.700
 let's lay the foundations of the crime 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.210
 it is also important to eat the raw 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.100
 because it gets lost with vitamin c 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.100
 vitamin is lost when this question 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.190
 and be very important for this time 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.739
 where it's colder and we're going to throw him 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.880
 onion and purple that we buy in the 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.790
 ecoferia 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.590
 Y 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.650
 I imagine he has other 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.319
 nutrients apart from the chives themselves already 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.730
 that has that purple color 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.730
 Well now we are going to mix it 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.510
 if you want to write be your coriander 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.730
 looking also 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.690
 super nutritious final two minerals and 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.400
 help 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.860
 eliminate toxins from the body especially 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.800
 heavy metals we are going to take a little 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.790
 of salt 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.790
 that's at ease 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.690
 and we are going to throw 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.569
 our star ingredient so that it 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.110
 call spirit that is 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.110
 is 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.240
 as black stocking 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.240
 and so 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.080
 then we will be a little bit 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.970
 and testing 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.850
 with more than 50 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.560
 by the weight that one of the 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.530
 foods that provide more protein 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.969
 body is ideal for for example for 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.089
 athletes 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:16.679
 to build machines us 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.560
 we need the curtains to build 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:22.120
 tissue for 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.120
 for many things then 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.870
 a food that did not contribute especially 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.280
 importance suddenly for people who 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:34.510
 It gives us so much meat for vegans 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.510
 then and it stays that way 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.290
 the color maybe some does not seem very 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.460
 appetizing to me I looked at it I 've been wanting 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.669
 out because I love the 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.740
 spirulina and of course in the first 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.229
 Once I tried it I did not like the taste 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.900
 in a juice mixed with fruit and I do not 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.460
 liked but a flavor that occurs by 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.960
 national with the super foods that are 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.210
 foods that we have never consumed 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.039
 in our life then when one 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.630
 he just incorporates them they seem strange 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.940
 but with time is not getting used 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.300
 and one is the understanding that the body 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.280
 they accept and they like you so from 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.600
 few numbers from little to little and good 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.620
 stomachs can eat it 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:18.770
 accompanied with quinoa with basmati rice 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.100
 in an organic whole wheat bread 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.100
 hopefully 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.150
 yes 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.159
 good are the recipe today I hope that 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.379
 they liked it and that they dare to 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.849
 try it very well 

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:37.689
 bye 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:42.809
 thanks for joining us

 come back with us 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:51.500
 there are many more things to discover
