welcome to running form friday i'm going
to<00:00:14.709> talk<00:00:14.889> about<00:00:15.070> injury<00:00:16.110> it<00:00:17.110> happens<00:00:17.500> for

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
to talk about injury it happens for

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.700 
to talk about injury it happens for
really<00:00:18.340> one<00:00:18.580> basic<00:00:19.060> reason<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:19.600> the<00:00:20.380> basic

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
really one basic reason and the basic

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.480 
really one basic reason and the basic
reason<00:00:20.859> is<00:00:21.220> too<00:00:21.820> much<00:00:22.000> too<00:00:22.810> fast<00:00:23.280> too<00:00:24.280> soon

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
reason is too much too fast too soon

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.330 
reason is too much too fast too soon
really<00:00:25.420> simple<00:00:25.600> you<00:00:26.560> can<00:00:26.680> adapt<00:00:26.950> to<00:00:27.220> almost

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
really simple you can adapt to almost

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.220 
really simple you can adapt to almost
anything<00:00:27.730> people<00:00:28.240> adapt<00:00:28.510> to<00:00:28.690> climbing<00:00:29.050> Mount

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
anything people adapt to climbing Mount

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.710

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
Everest if you went up tomorrow you

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.510 
Everest if you went up tomorrow you
probably<00:00:32.230> died<00:00:32.500> within<00:00:32.770> about<00:00:32.980> three<00:00:33.309> minutes

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
probably died within about three minutes

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.790 
probably died within about three minutes
but<00:00:33.910> give<00:00:34.329> it<00:00:34.360> enough<00:00:34.660> time<00:00:34.690> a<00:00:35.140> lot<00:00:35.680> of<00:00:35.710> people

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
but give it enough time a lot of people

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.130 
but give it enough time a lot of people
can<00:00:36.129> climb<00:00:36.370> Everest<00:00:36.760> without<00:00:36.879> oxygen<00:00:37.210> same

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
can climb Everest without oxygen same

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
repair fast enough so general injury

falls<00:01:01.899> into<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.140> few<00:01:02.350> categories<00:01:02.620> apart<00:01:03.280> from

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
falls into a few categories apart from

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.819

being<00:01:03.579> too<00:01:04.089> much<00:01:04.269> too<00:01:04.509> fast<00:01:04.540> too<00:01:04.899> soon<00:01:05.110> which

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
being too much too fast too soon which

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.069 
being too much too fast too soon which
is<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.100> rule<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.280> twos<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:07.600> could<00:01:07.899> be

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
is the rule of twos it could be

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.219 
is the rule of twos it could be
repetitive<00:01:08.890> motion<00:01:09.579> with<00:01:09.819> misalignment<00:01:10.569> so

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
repetitive motion with misalignment so

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.629 
repetitive motion with misalignment so
if<00:01:11.319> something<00:01:11.499> starting<00:01:11.859> misaligned<00:01:12.280> say

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.459 
if something starting misaligned say
your<00:01:12.880> knee<00:01:13.090> isn't<00:01:13.240> quite<00:01:13.569> straight<00:01:13.959> straight

your knee isn't quite straight straight

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.120 
your knee isn't quite straight straight

of<00:01:19.689> those<00:01:19.899> things<00:01:20.380> that's<00:01:21.279> going<00:01:21.579> to<00:01:21.670> include

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
of those things that's going to include

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.840 
of those things that's going to include
something<00:01:23.049> like<00:01:23.380> late-stage<00:01:23.979> over<00:01:24.609> pronation

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
something like late-stage over pronation

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.080 
something like late-stage over pronation
and<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:26.380> will<00:01:26.529> cause<00:01:26.770> your<00:01:26.979> foot<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.399> rotate

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and that will cause your foot to rotate

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.809 
and that will cause your foot to rotate
in<00:01:28.240> a<00:01:28.329> little<00:01:28.569> bit<00:01:28.689> too<00:01:28.959> much<00:01:29.399> of<00:01:30.399> course<00:01:30.639> you

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:30.819 
in a little bit too much of course you

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.809 
in a little bit too much of course you
need<00:01:30.999> infil<00:01:31.389> is<00:01:31.509> it<00:01:31.689> hip<00:01:32.289> gets<00:01:32.529> affected<00:01:33.039> lower

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:33.819 
need infil is it hip gets affected lower

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:36.120 
need infil is it hip gets affected lower
back<00:01:34.090> all<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.749> way<00:01:34.869> up<00:01:34.990> your<00:01:35.229> biomechanical

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
back all the way up your biomechanical

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.849 
back all the way up your biomechanical
chain<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.639> over<00:01:37.359> many<00:01:37.599> repetitions<00:01:37.840> if<00:01:38.560> it's

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
chain and over many repetitions if it's

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.399 
chain and over many repetitions if it's
not<00:01:38.920> lined<00:01:39.310> up<00:01:39.490> straight<00:01:39.609> then<00:01:40.389> you<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:41.079> see

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
not lined up straight then you can see

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.399 
not lined up straight then you can see
injury<00:01:42.209> we<00:01:43.209> also<00:01:43.329> have<00:01:43.509> the<00:01:43.899> category<00:01:44.139> of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
injury we also have the category of

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.249 
injury we also have the category of
injury<00:01:45.009> of<00:01:45.249> something<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.270> congenital

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
injury of something that is congenital

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.800 
injury of something that is congenital
meaning<00:01:48.249> if<00:01:48.759> you're<00:01:48.939> born<00:01:49.270> with<00:01:49.419> something

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
meaning if you're born with something

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.690 
meaning if you're born with something
that's<00:01:49.959> not<00:01:50.079> quite<00:01:50.259> straight<00:01:50.679> or<00:01:51.279> it's<00:01:51.459> too

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
that's not quite straight or it's too

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.330 
that's not quite straight or it's too
short<00:01:51.939> or<00:01:52.119> too<00:01:52.179> long<00:01:52.569> or<00:01:52.899> too<00:01:52.929> tight<00:01:53.319> then<00:01:54.039> that

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
short or too long or too tight then that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.239 
short or too long or too tight then that
can<00:01:54.459> also<00:01:54.899> affect<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:56.169> in<00:01:56.469> a<00:01:56.829> negative<00:01:57.039> way

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
can also affect you in a negative way

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.849 
can also affect you in a negative way
ultimately<00:01:58.149> we<00:01:58.749> do<00:01:58.899> it<00:01:59.020> out<00:01:59.169> actually<00:01:59.590> adapt

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
ultimately we do it out actually adapt

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.789 
ultimately we do it out actually adapt
to<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.039> lot<00:02:00.189> of<00:02:00.249> things<00:02:00.599> but<00:02:01.649> outside<00:02:02.649> of<00:02:02.679> that

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
to a lot of things but outside of that

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.220 
to a lot of things but outside of that
application<00:02:03.359> if<00:02:04.359> there<00:02:04.569> is<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.719> bad

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
application if there is a bad

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.220 
application if there is a bad
alignment<00:02:05.680> then<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:07.150> can't<00:02:07.540> really<00:02:07.810> adapt

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.230 
alignment then you can't really adapt

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.900 
alignment then you can't really adapt
full<00:02:08.680> it<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.980> it<00:02:09.100> simply<00:02:09.460> because<00:02:09.760> your

full it to it simply because your

they sleep a lot to repair a lot they

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.539 
they sleep a lot to repair a lot they
