 baier 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.750
 I have to repeat in the game what is the reality 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.429
 Why let him 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:54.490
 love 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.490
 the attacker will call foul 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 the story had to intervene because that 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.200
 little mouth 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.180

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.180

 I want to be integrated and attack properties on payment 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.320
 in the lecture what appears
