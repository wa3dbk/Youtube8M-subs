00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
built for this episode but anyway on to

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.610 
built for this episode but anyway on to
the<00:03:29.610> midfielder's<00:03:30.090> we<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.380> first

in the mid is going to be I think his

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.750

name<00:03:35.850> viv<00:03:36.090> ridden<00:03:36.390> yeah<00:03:36.510> but<00:03:37.470> he's<00:03:37.560> got<00:03:37.760> 92

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760

name viv ridden yeah but he's got 92
pace<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:40.200> fairly<00:03:40.620> decent<00:03:40.920> other<00:03:41.040> status<00:03:41.430> in

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
pace and fairly decent other status in

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.160 
pace and fairly decent other status in
see<00:03:41.820> there<00:03:42.000> he's<00:03:42.120> got<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.510> many<00:03:42.570> sims<00:03:42.810> Shubin

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
see there he's got so many sims Shubin

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.470 
see there he's got so many sims Shubin
suddenly<00:03:43.860> passing<00:03:44.340> 84<00:03:44.790> dribbling<00:03:45.120> as<00:03:45.239> well

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
suddenly passing 84 dribbling as well

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.080 
suddenly passing 84 dribbling as well
now<00:03:46.170> apparently<00:03:46.950> disguise<00:03:47.310> five-star<00:03:47.820> skills

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
now apparently disguise five-star skills

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.820 
now apparently disguise five-star skills
but<00:03:48.390> for<00:03:48.840> some<00:03:48.989> reason<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.350> can't<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
but for some reason I can't do the

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.460 
but for some reason I can't do the
rabona<00:03:50.040> with<00:03:50.310> him<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:51.300> find<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.350> really

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
rabona with him I find it really

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.080 
rabona with him I find it really
stranger<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.100> leave<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.700> know<00:03:53.820> I<00:03:53.850> can't

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
stranger to leave that you know I can't

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.270 
stranger to leave that you know I can't
do<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.239> might<00:03:54.570> be<00:03:54.690> four<00:03:54.900> star<00:03:55.110> skill<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:56.220> I

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
do it might be four star skill but I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.729 
do it might be four star skill but I
picked<00:03:56.550> him<00:03:56.610> up<00:03:56.700> for<00:03:56.940> 5000<00:03:57.540> coins<00:03:57.690> seeing<00:03:58.590> as<00:03:58.709> a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
picked him up for 5000 coins seeing as a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.199 
picked him up for 5000 coins seeing as a
seven-second<00:03:59.280> midcard<00:03:59.550> sentiment<00:04:00.000> card

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
seven-second midcard sentiment card

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.710 
seven-second midcard sentiment card
costs<00:04:01.080> around<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:02.519> think<00:04:03.150> it's<00:04:03.269> around<00:04:03.330> six

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
costs around I think it's around six

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.880 
costs around I think it's around six
care<00:04:03.959> something<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.500> was<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> fairly

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
care something so this was a fairly

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.370 
care something so this was a fairly
decent<00:04:05.040> deal<00:04:05.400> we<00:04:05.910> picked<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.269> here<00:04:06.480> but<00:04:07.260> I

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
decent deal we picked up here but I

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.710 
decent deal we picked up here but I
think<00:04:07.980> yeah<00:04:08.459> second<00:04:08.880> center<00:04:09.060> mid<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.450> going<00:04:09.630> to

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
think yeah second center mid is going to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.900 
think yeah second center mid is going to
be<00:04:09.810> Danny<00:04:10.049> he<00:04:10.739> again<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.220> five-star<00:04:11.670> skill

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
be Danny he again is a five-star skill

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.610 
be Danny he again is a five-star skill
and<00:04:12.060> links<00:04:12.239> up<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.480> left<00:04:12.660> back<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.019> Brunner

Alva's<00:04:14.010> gets<00:04:14.940> nine<00:04:15.120> chem<00:04:15.390> there<00:04:15.600> as<00:04:15.720> well<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
Alva's gets nine chem there as well so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.380 
Alva's gets nine chem there as well so
he<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.340> probably<00:04:17.609> one<00:04:17.910> of<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> stand<00:04:18.299> that

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
he is probably one of the stand that

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.969 
he is probably one of the stand that
Pleasant<00:04:18.840> players<00:04:19.169> in<00:04:19.290> this<00:04:19.380> team<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.769> can

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
Pleasant players in this team you can

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.190 
Pleasant players in this team you can
get<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.220> in-form<00:04:20.549> if<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:21.239> really<00:04:21.630> do<00:04:21.780> want<00:04:21.810> to

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
get the in-form if you really do want to

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.010 
get the in-form if you really do want to
you<00:04:23.100> know<00:04:23.250> everyone<00:04:23.789> knows<00:04:24.000> about<00:04:24.030> Danny<00:04:24.390> he's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
you know everyone knows about Danny he's

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.330 
you know everyone knows about Danny he's
an<00:04:25.169> amazing<00:04:25.350> player

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
an amazing player

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.510 
an amazing player
so<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:28.320> next<00:04:28.530> center<00:04:28.800> mid<00:04:28.949> is<00:04:29.070> going<00:04:29.250> to<00:04:29.370> be<00:04:29.490> a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
so the next center mid is going to be a

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.120 
so the next center mid is going to be a
four-star<00:04:30.270> skiller<00:04:30.570> from<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> Hellers<00:04:31.860> Liga

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
four-star skiller from the Hellers Liga

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.340 
four-star skiller from the Hellers Liga
and<00:04:32.430> his<00:04:32.820> name<00:04:32.970> is<00:04:33.000> Clayton<00:04:33.449> now<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.290> is

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
and his name is Clayton now this is

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.260 
and his name is Clayton now this is
probably<00:04:34.740> one<00:04:34.979> of<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.130> players<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.490> you

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
probably one of the players that you

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.659 
probably one of the players that you
know<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.449> don't<00:04:36.660> really<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:37.340> think<00:04:38.340> would<00:04:38.520> be

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
know you don't really in think would be

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.640 
know you don't really in think would be
very<00:04:38.699> good<00:04:39.120> but<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.990> turns<00:04:40.169> out<00:04:40.290> to<00:04:40.410> be<00:04:40.440> you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
very good but it turns out to be you

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.310 
very good but it turns out to be you
know<00:04:40.680> fairly<00:04:41.100> decent<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.930> know<00:04:43.050> for<00:04:43.229> that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
know fairly decent and you know for that

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.540 
know fairly decent and you know for that
rain<00:04:43.500> you're<00:04:43.710> not<00:04:43.800> really<00:04:43.979> going<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.250> expect

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
rain you're not really going to expect

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.670 
rain you're not really going to expect
much<00:04:44.760> but<00:04:45.090> he<00:04:45.180> really<00:04:45.360> does<00:04:45.600> bring<00:04:46.320> out<00:04:46.470> some

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
much but he really does bring out some

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.379 
much but he really does bring out some
good<00:04:46.830> skill<00:04:47.070> moves<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.850> know<00:04:47.970> parses<00:04:48.360> and

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
good skill moves and you know parses and

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.270 
good skill moves and you know parses and
stuff<00:04:48.600> like<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:48.930> here's<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.830> good<00:04:50.040> player

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
stuff like that so here's a good player

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.610 
stuff like that so here's a good player
picked<00:04:50.880> him<00:04:51.000> up<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.479> 500<00:04:52.110> coins<00:04:52.260> but<00:04:52.470> then<00:04:52.590> a

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
picked him up for 500 coins but then a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.960 
picked him up for 500 coins but then a
part<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.979> center<00:04:53.220> take<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.400> midcard<00:04:53.639> to

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
part of the center take a midcard to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.840 
part of the center take a midcard to
send<00:04:54.120> him<00:04:54.210> a<00:04:54.270> card<00:04:54.479> which<00:04:55.050> costs<00:04:55.320> around<00:04:55.500> 4k<00:04:55.860> or

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
send him a card which costs around 4k or

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.120 
send him a card which costs around 4k or
so<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:57.449> probably<00:04:57.780> around<00:04:57.870> five<00:04:58.500> or<00:04:58.560> 6k<00:04:58.889> for

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
so so probably around five or 6k for

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.909 
so so probably around five or 6k for
that<00:04:59.250> player<00:04:59.690> but<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.870> first<00:05:01.290> left<00:05:01.680> winger

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
that player but the first left winger
