00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
out over and over again but I do think

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.190 
out over and over again but I do think
it<00:01:18.030> also<00:01:18.180> raises<00:01:18.659> an<00:01:18.750> interesting<00:01:18.960> question

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it also raises an interesting question

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.590 
it also raises an interesting question
one<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> reasons<00:01:20.640> why<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> media<00:01:21.240> covers

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
one of the reasons why the media covers

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
one of the reasons why the media covers
these<00:01:21.750> stories<00:01:22.170> over<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.560> over<00:01:22.830> again<00:01:22.950> is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
these stories over and over again is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.850 
these stories over and over again is
because<00:01:23.810> eyeballs<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:24.990> watching<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.710> are

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
because eyeballs are watching you are

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
because eyeballs are watching you are
listening<00:01:26.490> people<00:01:26.759> whether<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
listening people whether they want to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
listening people whether they want to
admit<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.770> or<00:01:28.890> not<00:01:29.070> are<00:01:29.310> paying<00:01:30.000> attention<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
admit it or not are paying attention to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
admit it or not are paying attention to
these<00:01:30.750> stories<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.380> they're<00:01:31.500> consuming<00:01:32.100> them

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
these stories and they're consuming them

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.179 
these stories and they're consuming them
so<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> job<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> media

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
so I know that it's the job of the media

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.550 
so I know that it's the job of the media
to<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.820> good<00:01:36.210> decisions<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.960> terms<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.380> what

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
to make good decisions in terms of what

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 
to make good decisions in terms of what
type<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.799> topics<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.400> cover<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.540> ratings<00:01:40.170> do

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
type of topics they cover but ratings do

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
type of topics they cover but ratings do
matter<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.890> unfortunately<00:01:41.820> stories<00:01:42.329> like

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
matter and unfortunately stories like

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.950 
matter and unfortunately stories like
this<00:01:42.780> lead<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.770> massive<00:01:44.520> ratings<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.450> think

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
this lead to massive ratings I think

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.170 
this lead to massive ratings I think
it's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> feedback<00:01:47.280> loop<00:01:47.700> at<00:01:47.939> this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it's a bit of a feedback loop at this

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.560 
it's a bit of a feedback loop at this
point<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:49.049> know<00:01:49.610> media<00:01:50.610> feeds<00:01:50.909> into<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
point you know media feeds into it the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.889 
point you know media feeds into it the
exposure<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> expect<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
exposure is just you know expect like it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.740 
exposure is just you know expect like it
expands<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.770> way<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.219> mind-numbing<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
expands in a way that is mind-numbing to

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.590 
expands in a way that is mind-numbing to
actually<00:01:58.280> watch<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> absolutely

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
actually watch you're just absolutely

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.679 
actually watch you're just absolutely
bombarded<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.320> by<00:02:02.000> Kardashian<00:02:03.000> trash<00:02:03.270> all<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
bombarded by by Kardashian trash all the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.300 
bombarded by by Kardashian trash all the
time<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.939> know<00:02:06.060> people<00:02:06.299> sort<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
time and then you know people sort of I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
time and then you know people sort of I
think<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.270> audience<00:02:09.660> starts<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
think that then the audience starts to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
think that then the audience starts to
think<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.770> they<00:02:10.890> are<00:02:11.009> supposed<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.550> be

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
think that they are supposed to be

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.920 
think that they are supposed to be
interested<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
interested and that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.750 
interested and that
you<00:02:13.290> know<00:02:13.409> what's<00:02:13.650> trending<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.489> what

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
you know what's trending and that's what

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.160 
you know what's trending and that's what
people<00:02:14.939> are<00:02:15.090> talking<00:02:15.299> about<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:15.959> just

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
people are talking about and it just

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.449 
people are talking about and it just
feeds<00:02:16.829> on<00:02:17.040> itself<00:02:17.189> it's<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.640> vicious<00:02:17.879> downward

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
feeds on itself it's a vicious downward

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.770 
feeds on itself it's a vicious downward
spiral<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:21.120> when<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.359> comes<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.689> these

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
spiral I think when it comes to these

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.530 
spiral I think when it comes to these
kind<00:02:22.079> of<00:02:22.140> news<00:02:22.319> cycles<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.400> say<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.849> someone

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
kind of news cycles I can say is someone

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.740 
kind of news cycles I can say is someone
who<00:02:24.659> works<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.079> news<00:02:25.730> what's<00:02:26.730> difficult<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.510> if

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
eyeballs and the idea is that I think it

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.780 
eyeballs and the idea is that I think it
is<00:03:55.879> sort<00:03:56.879> of<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.569> little<00:03:57.870> bit<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.099> a<00:03:59.099> delicate

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
is sort of a little bit of a delicate

is sort of a little bit of a delicate
dance<00:03:59.879> I've<00:04:00.120> used<00:04:00.269> this<00:04:00.359> term<00:04:00.540> before<00:04:00.870> when<00:04:01.079> it

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
dance I've used this term before when it

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
comes to media I think it applies across

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.969 
comes to media I think it applies across
the<00:04:03.030> board<00:04:03.359> because<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:04.139> want<00:04:04.620> to<00:04:04.680> engage<00:04:04.829> in

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
those issues to maybe get some of those

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.670 
those issues to maybe get some of those
eyeballs<00:04:06.479> so<00:04:06.989> then<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.169> can<00:04:07.290> feed<00:04:07.530> them

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
eyeballs so then you can feed them

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.559 
eyeballs so then you can feed them
something<00:04:07.949> so<00:04:08.280> exactly<00:04:08.849> right<00:04:09.120> okay<00:04:09.509> so
