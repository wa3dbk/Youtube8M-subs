you want to fold it over about two
inches<00:01:26.939> above<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.780> bottom<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> here

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
inches above that little bottom of here

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.710 
inches above that little bottom of here
two<00:01:29.970> inches<00:01:31.250> 37<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> real<00:01:32.490> mosca<00:01:32.939> hold<00:01:33.450> same

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
two inches 37 a real mosca hold same

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.120 
two inches 37 a real mosca hold same
thing<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> other<00:01:34.079> side<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.979> matches

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
thing on the other side so it matches

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.210 
thing on the other side so it matches
this<00:01:35.460> odd<00:01:35.700> same<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:36.869> two<00:01:37.110> inches<00:01:37.439> you

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
this odd same thing about two inches you

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
this odd same thing about two inches you
can<00:01:38.250> experiment<00:01:38.909> with<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.720> I'll<00:01:39.930> see

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
can experiment with it you know I'll see

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.649 
can experiment with it you know I'll see
which<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.530> works<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.000> think<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.420> inches

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
which one works but I think two inches

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.679 
which one works but I think two inches
for<00:01:42.869> us<00:01:43.310> okay<00:01:44.310> once<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.540> look
