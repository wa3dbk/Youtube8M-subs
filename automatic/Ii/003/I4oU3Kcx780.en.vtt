I'm<00:01:21.510> Kansas<00:01:21.990> discovered<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.530> his<00:01:22.650> radio

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio

frequency generator could release the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.080 
frequency generator could release the
oxygen<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.770> hydrogen<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.370> salt<00:01:26.700> water<00:01:26.760> and

and<00:01:50.190> we<00:01:50.790> saw<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.360> up<00:01:51.510> to<00:01:51.660> 1,500<00:01:52.260> degrees

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and we saw it go up to 1,500 degrees

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.620 
and we saw it go up to 1,500 degrees
centigrade<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:54.090> temperature<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:56.630> it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
centigrade the temperature and it's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.290
