00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.120
 the battlefield 4 in multiplayer beta 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.620
 is now finally for all players 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.630
 available and we use that for one 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.389
 actually quite unfair story the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.710
 We compare pc with console graphic 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 namely the current consoles 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.289
 generation is seven years old 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.279
 hardware as looks natural rough 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.590
 and also has a playful 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.789
 important difference on pcs up to 64 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.830
 player in console only up to 24 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.340
 xbox one and ps4 will be later in the game 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.030
 year 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.910
 the pc features implement but currently 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.149
 there is a bit of everything on ps3 yes 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 limited to 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 and you can also clearly feel sad and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 pixeliger yes in any case 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.629
 you can also notice the shadows, for example 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:52.379
 the exposure and here the tree is missing 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.820
 in the ps3 version exactly and at the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.379
 Video recording is pink us too 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.870
 noticed that in the ps3 version 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.570
 above and each pixel is missing 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.180
 that seems plus with 700p in and out 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 not with 27 p and is also one 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.630
 Matter on the pc there is one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.270
 flags point more the map is so 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.680
 piece very small piece bigger and you 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.680
 have more water surface for boats 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.259
 or how do we see details like these 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.649
 animated advertising space or trees this 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.259
 in the ps3 version does not exist that is 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.479
 but clearly the smoke of the lot 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.590
 is more detailed than on the ps3 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.090
 version have something similar to detail 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.250
 but also some environmental objects like 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.630
 this car does not look the same for pc 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.189
 really good but also here is in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.719
 the simple room more going on there is a 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.719
 television in the background of the medi partly 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:47.189
 even more damage to the car alone 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:49.080
 the bullet holes destruction plays in 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.909
 the beta at least not so big 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.679
 Although it is the big skyscraper 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.729
 but can be upset otherwise are very 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.990
 few people really do 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.530
 can destroy and here you can see the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.149
 horny we physics effects have gtx 780 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.099
 built in there you can see the protection 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:10.110
 fly through the area 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:11.400
 that looks great in the ps3 version 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.319
 she's right here now 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.769
 graphic effects first on tapping 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.940
 Yes, it is playful that costs exactly 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.380
 the same, so I can do the same 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.329
 Make holes but here we have 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.829
 detail pop out of hell but was still 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.239
 short, the wrong textures in there 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.750
 and that is such a picture that is going on 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.700
 through the complete ps3 beta comes 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.959
 will determine a bit more 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.850
 improvements until the release of the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.139
 but generally the console 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.480
 whistling on the last hole you notice 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.380
 Here , too , you can see a huge 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.540
 distinguished already alone 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.269
 incidence of light then the collapse of here 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.319
 came lighting makes the pc version 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.319
 really noticeably better 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.980
 and there the car is broken or over 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.720
 This flag point you can see it completely 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.849
 dramatically on the pc, there is simply 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.890
 far more scenery than on the ps3 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.810
 version of Horst looks rather sad 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.980
 well we do not want to sit around here 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.870
 but gamble 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.060
 thank god, the maps are playful 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.140
 actually relatively equal on the pc 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.140
 has plus much prettier
