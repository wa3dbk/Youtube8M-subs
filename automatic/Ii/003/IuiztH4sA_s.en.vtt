00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.809
 You 're over for a second 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.059
 the smiling one had the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.519
 celebrations will be over 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.460
 yes my voice is a bit under it 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.070
 suffered but it was cool of course 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.469
 we celebrated by the way to the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.469
 have to stay hours of the morning guess 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.829
 We also deserve and teamcenter too 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.829
 Report 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 Now, however, full concentration is on 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.040
 the wm 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.510
 You also know the German best 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.050
 there from frankfurt is already such a 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.540
 a little prestige and do you believe that 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.820
 you beat us if now yes I have 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.010
 still the duels in remembrance of the em 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.270
 Quali was that and there I was clear 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.990
 worse but have us 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.440
 advanced 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.390
 I'm curious I think if we 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.430
 have a really good day and all well 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.450
 can then implement until very difficult 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.369
 his pick against us 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.410
 You are here for the first time 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.840
 has qualified a big tournament 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.710
 Denmark in which share passed 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.979
 has the coach 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.280
 yes, a giant so that has completely different 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.009
 Mentality brought in with German 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.740
 almost clearly say his discipline villa 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.840
 my mentality was here 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.979
 really works and with the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 national team have another one 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.240
 made a huge step forward and she 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.800
 also has a lot of big part in it 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.640
 now so wm specially strong 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.340
 group opponents 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.769
 what do you hope for the wm which 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.120
 you have a good goal as a team 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.700
 I think the group phase is 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.100
 extremely hard so the first game in 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.150
 japan if we say eighth-finale is 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.150
 definitely realistic 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.750
 describe how your life in ten years 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.959
 could at best be best 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.530
 It is therefore ten years to get started 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.799
 I think I live in Switzerland very much 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.239
 nice here 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.239
 I would like to work for the police 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:12.120
 one hopes that offspring will come to me 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:14.739
 At some point that is clearly a question 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.540
 which team picks up at the woman's wm 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.489
 in Canada the title and why 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.959
 Of course switzerland no, I'll tell you 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.690
 germany because germany 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.860
 tournament team is and because they are at 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.269
 the last will not be so good 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.380
 have cut off and she is now 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:37.769
 want to prove to the whole world a 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.769
 self portrait beautiful long legs 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.239
 I love your sport then I like you 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.050
 stops 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.050
 nice too 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:03.049
 Anna Picasso write the 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.620
 startup of your team 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.620
 on a sheet of paper
