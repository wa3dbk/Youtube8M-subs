 here I bring you a new tutorial 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.080
 Today I'm going to draw you 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.920
 the subject has liked as you can see here 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.920
 I already have it started 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.710
 here I already have my eyebrows my mouth 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.519
 nose 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.519
 I did it 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.839
 open up many 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.359
 because this in my window but 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:46.229
 would begin to draw the basics for not 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:49.229
 take so long you know the main thing 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.229
 why 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.820
 here I finished drawing this part his 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.360
 eyebrows 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.870
 and what was the outline very well already 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.030
 we have the basics of the face 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.200
 now you have to make it the form of the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.310
 face 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.850
 first we start with 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.850
 part 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.149
 in his chin 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.880
 A) Yes 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.759
 today 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.759
 we have 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.560
 first it was started from the extension 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.560
 except 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.750
 the bug are still making small 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.350
 until you get to this part 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.350
 and also 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.470
 apart there are long 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.250
 A) Yes 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.390
 we do the same 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.720
 here 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.720
 we will start in this 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.590
 and it is still doing what is hair 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.750
 well here I have finished what is 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 The hair 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.530
 and read from his ears 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.040
 okay 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.900
 here you have everything 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:27.870
 so we have to review, we have nose eyes 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.459
 mouth face hair ears 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.810
 now it's going to be the hair part 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.780
 long 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.780
 as from the top only 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.319
 we already know that you have to talk to him 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.800
 now 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.800
 what do I know 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.930
 do the neck 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.300
 then they are marked 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.400
 now it will take to mark what is the mine 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.910
 the neck of the 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.979
 you have what is this 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.750
 in this part we will draw what is 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:40.999
 and I got to the 110 hundred pearls then 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:40.999
 then I finished 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.620
 and you have in this part already finished this you 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.850
 added a droplet 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:54.470
 ok here we do not have to finish 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.080
 draw this part 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.960
 and that is what you have to do 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 I color below, I will show you a 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.930
 image of how 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.639
 are the tones in each part the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.900
 shaded 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:15.630
 the eye tones of the necklace 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.610
 of the suit and the way couples and so on 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.940
 then then I will put the 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.940
 image 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.010
 here before coloring with the color 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.010
 black 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.680
 as well 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:44.670
 from the ine of the edges the drawing for 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.800
 that will be noticed more 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:49.740
 and because in the crisis it is erased very 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.020
 easy and you do not notice much is to give 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.140
 more intensity to the drawing as you can see 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.600
 already noticed more before with him here after 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.840
 you did not notice much but now you can see 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.380
 more the effects 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.820
 now then I'm going to start 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.010
 color it 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.240
 I'm going to do it in parts but I'm going to 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.240
 need faster ok 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.410

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.650

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:27.270
 right now has no effect 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.270

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.009
