00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.150 

she's<00:00:24.300> trying<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> warn<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.320> him<00:00:25.470> but<00:00:26.099> she

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
she's trying to warn with him but she

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.580 
she's trying to warn with him but she
doesn't<00:00:26.430> really<00:00:26.840> know<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.529> she

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
doesn't really know how so she

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.380 
doesn't really know how so she
approached<00:00:29.010> him<00:00:29.160> more<00:00:29.369> like<00:00:29.519> an<00:00:29.640> animal<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
approached him more like an animal and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.080 
approached him more like an animal and
but<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.550> way<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.940> she

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
but I think that the way that she

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.160 
but I think that the way that she
doesn't<00:00:33.210> really<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.570> how<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.780> relate<00:00:34.020> to
