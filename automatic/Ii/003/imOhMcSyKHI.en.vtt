00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.619 
background then i saw a broom run across
the<00:00:40.110> room<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.649> then<00:00:41.520> something<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.300> kind<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
the room and then something that kind of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.209 
the room and then something that kind of
looks<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> page<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.829> harry<00:00:44.129> potter

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
looks like a page out of harry potter

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.369 
looks like a page out of harry potter
but<00:00:44.789> i<00:00:44.820> guess<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.360> just<00:00:45.450> books<00:00:45.870> flying<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
but i guess it's just books flying in

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.130 
but i guess it's just books flying in
the<00:00:46.500> air<00:00:46.530> where<00:00:47.309> anything<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> possible<00:00:48.180> and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the air where anything is possible and

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.830 
the air where anything is possible and
then<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.160> wizard<00:00:50.489> trying<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.600> some

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
then there is a wizard trying to do some

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
then there is a wizard trying to do some
magic<00:00:52.050> i<00:00:52.559> am<00:00:53.219> guessing<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.820> might<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> new

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
magic i am guessing it might be a new

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
magic i am guessing it might be a new
hobby<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.350> eventually<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.190> spell<00:00:56.489> he<00:00:56.699> was

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hobby but eventually the spell he was

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.510 
hobby but eventually the spell he was
doing<00:00:57.239> seem<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.870> failed<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.520> almost

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
guessing it's going to be next to the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.539 
guessing it's going to be next to the
still<00:01:12.600> park<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.159> right-hand

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
still park because on the right-hand

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249

and finally eating it be enchanted with
new<00:01:44.939> hobbies<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.780> i<00:01:45.810> guess<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
new hobbies so i guess we are going to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
new hobbies so i guess we are going to
have<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.250> new<00:01:47.369> hobbies<00:01:47.610> we<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.110> a

have some new hobbies we then see a
witch<00:01:49.530> doing<00:01:49.979> some<00:01:50.189> magic<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.820> i<00:01:50.850> guess<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
witch doing some magic so i guess that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.960 
witch doing some magic so i guess that
is<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> hobbies<00:01:52.970> then

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
is going to be one of the hobbies then

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030 
is going to be one of the hobbies then
we<00:01:54.240> see<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> wizard<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.290> saw<00:01:55.470> before<00:01:55.649> but

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.910 
we see the wizard that we saw before but
I<00:01:56.070> guess<00:01:56.310> he<00:01:56.340> failed<00:01:56.759> his<00:01:57.030> spell<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:57.990> there

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I guess he failed his spell again there

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.590 
I guess he failed his spell again there
might<00:01:59.250> also<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.700> some<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.360> cool
