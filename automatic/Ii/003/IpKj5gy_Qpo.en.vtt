on<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.049> easily<00:01:13.880> what<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.420> see

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
on this one easily what you do is see

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
on this one easily what you do is see
right<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> red<00:01:17.040> wall<00:01:17.310> that's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
right here how this is a red wall that's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.630 
right here how this is a red wall that's
because<00:01:18.439> you<00:01:19.439> want<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.159> as<00:01:20.340> high<00:01:20.610> as

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
because you want this to be as high as

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
because you want this to be as high as
you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:21.950> that's

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you can get it just because that's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
you can get it just because that's
really<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> attack<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> most<00:01:24.060> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
really going to attack the most and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
really going to attack the most and
they're<00:01:24.509> gonna<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:25.049> much<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.350> attack

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they're gonna pretty much just attack

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.120 
they're gonna pretty much just attack
there<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> let's<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.799> give<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
there and I so let's just give you a

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.260 
there and I so let's just give you a
little<00:01:29.189> example<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.439> don't<00:01:31.439> even<00:01:32.270> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
little example here I don't even the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.850 
little example here I don't even the
base<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.930> much<00:01:34.020> empty<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.710> see

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
base is pretty much empty so you can see

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.359 
base is pretty much empty so you can see
this<00:01:34.950> level<00:01:35.689> 18<00:01:39.890> 111<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.990> little<00:01:42.990> too<00:01:43.110> that

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
this level 18 111 a little too that

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.499 
this level 18 111 a little too that
these<00:01:44.369> when<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.180> started<00:01:45.990> attacking<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:47.009> it

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
these when I started attacking with it

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.069 
these when I started attacking with it
or<00:01:48.509> level<00:01:48.930> 5<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.720> up<00:01:51.869> from

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
or level 5 and then I just go up from

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
or level 5 and then I just go up from
there<00:01:53.299> God<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.759> i'll

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
there God that one you know and i'll

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.660 
there God that one you know and i'll
switch<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:59.040> moment

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
switch this one to that in just a moment

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.590 
switch this one to that in just a moment
and<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.409> level<00:02:01.680> nine<00:02:01.890> level<00:02:02.790> nine<00:02:03.000> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and so that is level nine level nine and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.690 
and so that is level nine level nine and
all<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.900> bases<00:02:04.439> are<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:05.009> know<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.490> hero

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
all the bases are you know the hero

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.109 
all the bases are you know the hero
bases<00:02:05.970> are<00:02:06.090> one<00:02:07.039> so<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.640> quick<00:02:08.849> walk

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
bases are one so that's a quick walk

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.330 
bases are one so that's a quick walk
around<00:02:09.149> base<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.259> puny<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> it's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
around base it's a really puny and it's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.059 
around base it's a really puny and it's
quite<00:02:11.520> effective<00:02:12.050> so<00:02:13.050> let's<00:02:13.380> give<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.680> a

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
quite effective so let's give you a

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.350 
quite effective so let's give you a
little<00:02:14.430> example<00:02:14.940> example<00:02:16.819> start<00:02:17.819> er<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:17.940> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
little example example start er up and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.930 
little example example start er up and
just<00:02:19.230> watch<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:20.160> pretty<00:02:20.489> much<00:02:20.550> what's

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
just watch it go so pretty much what's

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.900 
just watch it go so pretty much what's

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
your delicious see easy peasy oh come on

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.170 
your delicious see easy peasy oh come on
dinosaur<00:04:43.720> what<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:44.020> gonna<00:04:44.110> do<00:04:44.380> now<00:04:45.180> sometimes

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
dinosaur what you gonna do now sometimes

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.970 
dinosaur what you gonna do now sometimes
they'll<00:04:46.420> attack<00:04:46.720> straight<00:04:47.050> through<00:04:47.290> here<00:04:47.620> and

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
they'll attack straight through here and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.580 
they'll attack straight through here and
that's<00:04:48.910> because<00:04:49.060> of<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.420> base<00:04:49.810> is<00:04:50.080> slow

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
that's because of the the base is slow

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.830 
that's because of the the base is slow
and<00:04:50.980> you<00:04:51.640> know<00:04:51.730> the<00:04:52.030> walls<00:04:52.240> really<00:04:52.570> aren't

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
and you know the walls really aren't

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.030 
and you know the walls really aren't
that<00:04:52.870> thick<00:04:54.210> but<00:04:55.210> I<00:04:55.380> usually<00:04:56.380> just<00:04:56.410> don't<00:04:56.800> care

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
that thick but I usually just don't care

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.120 
that thick but I usually just don't care
I<00:04:57.070> let<00:04:57.340> them<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.640> through<00:04:57.670> and<00:04:58.710> I'm<00:04:59.710> gonna<00:04:59.890> die

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
I let them go through and I'm gonna die

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.020 
I let them go through and I'm gonna die
to<00:05:00.190> my<00:05:00.400> heroes<00:05:00.790> once<00:05:01.000> they<00:05:01.240> do<00:05:01.300> make<00:05:01.630> it<00:05:01.780> up<00:05:03.030> and

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
to my heroes once they do make it up and

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.560 
to my heroes once they do make it up and
then<00:05:04.180> that's<00:05:04.390> just<00:05:04.510> pretty<00:05:04.960> much<00:05:05.200> how<00:05:05.350> it<00:05:05.410> goes

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
then that's just pretty much how it goes

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.030 
then that's just pretty much how it goes
that's<00:05:07.570> all<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:07.750> do

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.030 

and<00:05:12.580> so<00:05:12.940> it's<00:05:13.060> a<00:05:13.210> pretty<00:05:14.020> easy<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.500> farm<00:05:14.710> shards

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
and so it's a pretty easy to farm shards

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.610 
and so it's a pretty easy to farm shards
on<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.520> just<00:05:15.700> wake<00:05:15.910> up<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.420> roll<00:05:17.410> it<00:05:17.560> over

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
on it so I just wake up and roll it over

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:29.090 
on it so I just wake up and roll it over
watch<00:05:17.920> and<00:05:18.880> Ted<00:05:19.330> Hearts<00:05:19.690> magically<00:05:19.960> done

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.600 

dance<00:05:29.760> or<00:05:30.030> guys<00:05:30.180> cranky<00:05:30.780> killing<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.560> much

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:42.599 

but<00:05:36.889> that<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:38.689> complete

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:42.609 

00:05:42.609 --> 00:05:48.699 

and<00:05:43.609> so<00:05:44.029> far<00:05:44.239> i<00:05:44.269> found<00:05:44.629> that<00:05:46.479> usually<00:05:47.499> nine<00:05:48.499> out

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:48.709 
and so far i found that usually nine out

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.089 
and so far i found that usually nine out
of<00:05:48.739> 10<00:05:49.039> i'll<00:05:49.429> complete<00:05:49.939> maybe<00:05:50.569> one<00:05:51.499> i<00:05:51.799> might

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
of 10 i'll complete maybe one i might

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.559 
of 10 i'll complete maybe one i might
fail<00:05:52.429> but<00:05:52.939> yeah<00:05:53.829> i<00:05:54.829> just<00:05:55.789> click<00:05:56.209> the<00:05:56.329> button

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
fail but yeah i just click the button

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:59.049 
fail but yeah i just click the button
and<00:05:56.689> go<00:05:56.749> again<00:05:57.249> since<00:05:58.249> i<00:05:58.369> sent<00:05:58.759> the<00:05:58.819> soul

00:05:59.049 --> 00:05:59.059 
and go again since i sent the soul

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.909 
and go again since i sent the soul
low-level<00:05:59.929> i<00:06:00.109> don't<00:06:00.499> even<00:06:00.589> care<00:06:00.709> I<00:06:01.569> just<00:06:02.919> there

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
low-level i don't even care I just there

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.099 
low-level i don't even care I just there
you<00:06:04.039> go<00:06:04.219> I<00:06:04.459> just<00:06:04.819> roll<00:06:05.149> with<00:06:05.269> it<00:06:05.299> and<00:06:05.479> then<00:06:05.809> just

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:06.109 
you go I just roll with it and then just

00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.639 
you go I just roll with it and then just
go<00:06:06.349> again<00:06:06.619> go<00:06:06.919> again<00:06:06.949> go<00:06:07.369> again<00:06:07.399> go<00:06:07.879> again<00:06:07.909> and

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:08.649 
go again go again go again go again and

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:13.059 
go again go again go again go again and
it<00:06:09.649> uh<00:06:09.709> lots<00:06:10.609> of<00:06:10.759> shards<00:06:11.349> in<00:06:12.349> a<00:06:12.439> very<00:06:12.619> small

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:13.069 
it uh lots of shards in a very small

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.439 
it uh lots of shards in a very small
amount<00:06:13.399> of<00:06:13.459> time<00:06:14.619> so<00:06:15.619> I<00:06:16.099> think<00:06:16.609> it<00:06:16.729> or<00:06:17.299> what

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
amount of time so I think it or what

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.199 
amount of time so I think it or what
takes<00:06:18.019> two<00:06:18.949> minutes<00:06:19.159> three<00:06:19.339> minutes<00:06:19.519> each

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:20.209 
takes two minutes three minutes each

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:28.449 
takes two minutes three minutes each
time<00:06:20.719> for<00:06:21.049> fall<00:06:21.289> clear<00:06:21.849> and<00:06:23.229> yeah<00:06:26.139> just<00:06:27.399> get<00:06:28.399> a

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:28.459 
time for fall clear and yeah just get a

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:31.839 
time for fall clear and yeah just get a
few<00:06:28.609> of<00:06:28.669> those<00:06:29.199> really<00:06:30.199> really<00:06:30.529> low<00:06:30.679> light<00:06:31.039> and

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
few of those really really low light and

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.469 
few of those really really low light and
what<00:06:32.779> I<00:06:32.809> mean<00:06:32.989> by<00:06:33.049> low<00:06:33.529> might<00:06:33.769> I<00:06:33.979> I'm<00:06:34.969> not<00:06:35.179> army

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
what I mean by low might I I'm not army

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.529 
what I mean by low might I I'm not army
camp<00:06:35.689> is<00:06:35.869> empty<00:06:36.049> always<00:06:37.209> for<00:06:38.209> this<00:06:38.329> reason

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
camp is empty always for this reason

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:43.559 
camp is empty always for this reason
look<00:06:39.169> at<00:06:39.289> that<00:06:39.469> I<00:06:39.879> trained<00:06:40.879> nothing<00:06:41.589> nada<00:06:42.589> I

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
look at that I trained nothing nada I

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.649 
look at that I trained nothing nada I
wasted<00:06:44.769> almost<00:06:45.769> no<00:06:46.129> time<00:06:46.309> on<00:06:46.579> this<00:06:46.729> that's<00:06:47.389> the

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
wasted almost no time on this that's the

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.989 
wasted almost no time on this that's the
point<00:06:48.219> you<00:06:49.219> can<00:06:49.339> have<00:06:49.549> it<00:06:49.669> up<00:06:49.789> and<00:06:49.879> running

00:06:49.989 --> 00:06:49.999 
point you can have it up and running

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.139 
point you can have it up and running
very<00:06:50.659> quickly<00:06:50.860> for<00:06:51.860> minimal<00:06:52.279> effort<00:06:52.429> and<00:06:52.939> you

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:53.149 
very quickly for minimal effort and you

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:58.179 
very quickly for minimal effort and you
can<00:06:53.409> farm<00:06:54.409> those<00:06:54.649> shards<00:06:54.919> with<00:06:55.639> ease<00:06:57.189> just

00:06:58.179 --> 00:06:58.189 
can farm those shards with ease just

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:01.479 
can farm those shards with ease just
dead<00:06:58.429> you<00:06:58.759> know<00:06:59.289> really<00:07:00.289> really<00:07:00.619> low<00:07:00.769> life<00:07:01.009> so

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:01.489 
dead you know really really low life so

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:02.799 
dead you know really really low life so
I<00:07:01.519> just<00:07:01.669> wanted<00:07:01.879> to<00:07:01.939> show<00:07:02.089> you<00:07:02.119> that<00:07:02.239> for<00:07:02.779> those

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:02.809 
I just wanted to show you that for those

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:04.689 
I just wanted to show you that for those
that<00:07:03.169> you<00:07:03.709> know<00:07:03.829> don't<00:07:04.099> want<00:07:04.249> to<00:07:04.309> put<00:07:04.459> much

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
that you know don't want to put much

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.789 
that you know don't want to put much
effort<00:07:04.909> into<00:07:05.179> a<00:07:05.360> shard<00:07:05.599> farmer<00:07:05.989> do<00:07:06.559> it<00:07:06.679> this

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:06.799 
effort into a shard farmer do it this

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:10.449 
effort into a shard farmer do it this
way<00:07:07.059> you<00:07:08.059> don't<00:07:08.089> have<00:07:08.299> to<00:07:08.569> spend<00:07:08.869> almost<00:07:09.459> any

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:10.459 
way you don't have to spend almost any

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:13.689 
way you don't have to spend almost any
time<00:07:10.789> you<00:07:11.719> maybe<00:07:12.319> look<00:07:12.769> at<00:07:12.829> your<00:07:13.039> shard<00:07:13.279> farmer

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:13.699 
time you maybe look at your shard farmer

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:16.029 
time you maybe look at your shard farmer
once<00:07:14.149> a<00:07:14.299> day<00:07:14.449> and<00:07:14.479> you<00:07:14.749> just<00:07:15.079> run<00:07:15.589> a<00:07:15.619> four-time

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 
once a day and you just run a four-time

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.909 
once a day and you just run a four-time
straight<00:07:16.369> in<00:07:16.459> a<00:07:16.519> row<00:07:16.669> and<00:07:16.819> you're<00:07:16.939> done<00:07:17.439> or<00:07:18.439> if

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 
straight in a row and you're done or if

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.849 
straight in a row and you're done or if
you<00:07:19.009> want<00:07:19.159> to<00:07:19.219> you<00:07:19.609> know<00:07:19.729> far<00:07:20.239> more<00:07:20.619> logging<00:07:21.619> it

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:21.859 
you want to you know far more logging it
