00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.559
 hello friends that mark the school channel 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.420
 hi of study and last to show you 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.140
 a problem that happened to us in the 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.779
 hairdresser with a client that is when 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.230
 it applied the solar color that happened is well 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.270
 comes applying color 9 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:35.120
 with 83 then it is color 93 has 100 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:38.000
 decades and it was good to know that 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.940
 he was wrong he was color 9 with 83 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.589
 but the preparation and not fix what 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.360
 there was inside the color put very 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.519
 important that you always notice 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.879
 that was inside the painting because it 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:55.339
 is abused the number 4 was applied 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.489
 imagine that the 4 with the 83 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.890
 your hair was dark as you are going to see 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.320
 now below in the image that 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.090
 I have here up to my side I'm going to 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:12.320
 show big that happened he applied 83 with 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.930
 the 4 with the chestnut that happens because I 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.090
 I tell them that you see and I talk to them a lot with 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.270
 the issue of what is the repaving 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.600
 we do not want to look like a hair what's up 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.970
 If we put a piece of furniture in a 4, the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.970
 head 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.760
 the green pigment and especially you have to 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.250
 see that the paint brand depends on 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.740
 pigment of each marijuana is this 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.130
 pretty green this mark then now 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.930
 like when the head dark greenish and 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.320
 that what I had to do, I had to do 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.700
 a devaluation with water al dente 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.370
 volumes and do it as fast 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.830
 possible and go controlling the empiricists 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.060
 so it's good because these happen 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.580
 things to make so that you can 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.940
 see how to solve a problem that 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.470
 can happen to anyone in the house in 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.900
 the hairdresser can pass and how 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.160
 fix it right away except if yes 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.710
 I would have stung on the laces 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.770
 it would have been more complicated but now 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.860
 I invite you so that as it is in front of 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.840
 disaster that was not happening and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.820
 They will continue to see the steps for a 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.920
 level in final work how can 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.750
 solve this problem I send a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.200
 hug friends forget to subscribe and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.170
 recommend the school is the study 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.599
 What happens when we make a mistake? 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.800
 wrong he arranged a dark color in the 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.020
 blond we are going to show it well 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.120
 Now how do we solve 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.960
 when we are left if the color is so dark 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.600
 the only one is to apply coloring powder 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.570
 or what to do now is to apply powder 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.300
 of dye in the roots with water of 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.880
 20 to try to get that stain 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.520
 dark there is no other way in the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.310
 checker or anything like that for 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.900
 be able to make the color so they 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.730
 I show this for you guys 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.550
 see how to do it the only thing that can be 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.080
 play with water and apply the bleach 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.760
 I'll leave it for a while and we'll see later 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.760
 how is the work 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.860
 Well now we are going to see how it is done 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.510
 if you can see how it goes 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.180
 clarifying quick apply 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.620
 the decolourizer with water of 20 here I have 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.780
 a speck to reveal how it is 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.580
 post can be solved later what 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.850
 they are going to see you 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.850
 in work photos and in this way 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.890
 At least we will solve this 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.709
 inconvenience that can happen to 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.659
 anyone so now when we are 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.269
 I'm going to wash you and you're going 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:51.269
 to see well how I stay more even 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:54.150
 color now we do finish the work of 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.659
 masters with oxygenated water of 20 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.829
 volumes that would be peroxide at 6% and 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:03.750
 we worked on the root to where it was 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.310
 the conjuring part so now they 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.889
 I'm going to show you so you can see how 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.599
 there was a part that is looking for 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.240
 that you can compare and see the 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.870
 color there you can see well 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.479
 the stain of 4 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.570
 and also something very important so that 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.940
 you see how it has been this is a 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.430
 part 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.950
 of color there you can notice the 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.300
 difference that would have happened would have 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:34.240
 the green head is not 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.550
 true and because I would stay with me 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.060
 green head because he always 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.830
 you say if he applied a 4 by 9 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:47.530
 to offer added 9 + 4 is equal to 13 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.849
 divided is a 6 and a half dry and color 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.330
 what I 'm staying is 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:55.939
 a six and a half let's give it the color 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.779
 that I showed you is just a color six and 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:02.719
 medium and I'm greenish, that's why it's very 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:06.080
 important that you do what it is 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:08.899
 the pigmentation that in many videos 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.809
 that I have the youtube channel you 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:13.899
 can see and review then applying 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:17.779
 the technique of rep and mentation 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:19.520
 also applying the technique of what 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:22.189
 it's the mathematics of colorimetry 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.349
 making this sum not going to fail 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.569
 when they have a color and cure 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.179
 also how to solve this problem 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.129
 so that it really fits us well 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:32.509
