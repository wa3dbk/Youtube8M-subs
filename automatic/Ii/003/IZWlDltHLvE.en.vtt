 [Music] 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.840
 the pure master I am in the ballet class 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.030
 there are not certain solid cures that sen 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.330
 press with the monkey but it is of what 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.330
 achievement 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.630
 Wednesday and Wednesday to very mosquitoes 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.210
 cortitos and super singles 23 minutes 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.160
 when a lot with a man that they are going 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.890
 to impact as much as I really 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 when they do it they will impact 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.730
 it turns out that you've been trying something that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.710
 in truth he has the beautiful face without 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.420
 imperfections hydrated but no thanks 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.730
 like I've made some mixtures of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 things and some bought and expensive are and 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.930
 so good have to do please do not 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.760
 it's good of the brand part a lot of time 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.710
 free because the holidays are 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 dubbing the topic today I was going to be 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.780
 three sprays or sprays I do not know how to say 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 forgive for each type of charge no longer 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.789
 discriminate on the face let's see how it is 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.259
 let it be number one we will call it water of 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.259
 said roses one is please 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.610
 and this serves to refresh and untreated 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.980
 any grain in charito deflates it 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.450
 two so I would go to any 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.220
 hospitalization or red part and your face 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 leather for this to work you have to 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.460
 be with constant pond we have to 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.530
 tear off the petals of the rose and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.060
 wash them very well for what you want 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.060
 earth or something like that we take it off 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 and a sensual and with a lot of water and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.159
 I put a little bit of the back leave you for 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.759
 wash the dishes and remove them like all 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.759
 the dirty ones 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.400
 and now we have to put all the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.400
 petals in a pot 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.800
 and now we have to put a little water 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.900
 must cover the petals completely 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.570
 but it does not have to be that much for 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.510
 not be very diluted first stove to 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.869
 slow fire 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.180
 or the pot and lid we have to leave 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.920
 to warm up and evaporate but 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.440
 be careful because this does not have to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.740
 boil when the petals no longer have 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.620
 a lot of color you turn it off 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.810
 [Music] 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.510
 Remove the petals from the water with a lot 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.280
 care and ready we have our water 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.900
 roses the truth is that with the simple 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.879
 fact that you put the little water 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.769
 Roses help a lot I added 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.989
 jojoba oil because it goes incredible 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.239
 but if you do not get that investigates 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.849
 another goes well with your skin type and put it 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.400
 you have to throw two or three drops of 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.200
 oil and rose water 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.819
 if you wear this, it is not necessary that you 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.950
 you eat it you can put it to any 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.510
 time of day what I do is that I 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.060
 I put on evenings and until 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.620
 awake the other day he recorded the face 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.530
 keep it in the fridge so that it is 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.470
 cool and ready 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.810
 cucumber and essential oil of light and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.880
 shore and cucumber tree oil is 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.010
 healing helps us heal 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.569
 machines our face and lemon helps 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.190
 that the skin is much softer since 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.530
 remove little spots that we have left 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.970
 for something that is not very father the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.970
 cucumber fights the bonfires 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.069
 the onion I love we have to serve 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.739
 in an approximately half container 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:27.140
 liter of fresh water we split a cucumber 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.360
 super engraved and with everything and shell and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.840
 put slices in the water except the 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.590
 banks to which they come to rest minimum 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.590
 for an hour 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.890
 Squeeze the juice of half a lemon inside 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.890
 of the water 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.210
 and with three droplets of oil 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.100
 today he wants to do everything very well 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.550
 Y 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.790
 in the atomizer and save it in the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.440
 refrigerator by the lemon flame I'll 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.330
 I recommend that you leave all the 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.640
 night but if you have to leave by the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
 in your face for five minutes rinse it 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.220
 very well 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.430
 ponce sunscreen and you go for the 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.430
 Street 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.800
 3 the chamomile mineral water and 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.750
 almonds we will call it and from 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.320
 Chamomile mineral water and oil 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.389
 almonds 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.799
 we are not so creative and if it helps us 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.810
 heal the face for when we have 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.730
 granites or for when we are changing 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.250
 skin uncles and pass them to me 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.560
 when I get stressed with the sun and the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.540
 climate changes skin face 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.340
 it has happened to us but for that it leaves you 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.470
 perfect the almond oil that 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.050
 moisturizes will and a lot but without you 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.790
 stay as you want first we have to 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.610
 make a chamomile tea with three 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:47.710
 bags and with very very little water this 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.990
 it is so that it is super concentrated in 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.889
 a glass with mineral water throws droplets 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.350
 the oils that are being used and I'll 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.360
 I recommend it on very dry skin 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.210
 I put a few drops of oil 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.160
 alumbres and others of argan oil and 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.340
 when the chamomile tea is already cold 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.260
 throw it into the mineral water 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.480
 all the oil in the councils in the 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.110
 super in health food stores or places 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.110
 of the kind 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.100
 This spray is best used within 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.840
 the first four days to follow 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.470
 having effervescence if there is 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.710
 keep it in a cool place 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:29.170
 [Music] 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.170
 and this already in truth this is all 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.160
 and that's something of this because it's taking 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.260
 a picture and tell me how you are watching 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.080

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:42.069
