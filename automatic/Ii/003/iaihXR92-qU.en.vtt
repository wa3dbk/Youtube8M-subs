00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.240
 What's up, guys, here I bring you a new 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:08.129
 video showing them how they can record 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.959
 with your playstation 4 console via hdmi 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:13.059
 as you know and good for those who 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.369
 they do not know it also to playstation 4 to 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.490
 just like the playstation3 prevents 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:22.210
 record about three games this way 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.880
 of hdmi you already know to avoid that from the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 piracy with the blues raids but good 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.430
 Playstation 3 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.000
 I still could not connect it by means of 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.860
 components and could one record not using 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.410
 a captor like this that has that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.140
 audio and video inputs and outputs are not 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.120
 but station 4 does not have them then 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.000
 one can not only connect via 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.210
 hdmi 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.120
 then well, I'm going to show you 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.550
 how can they connect what is what 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.040
 they need so they can record now 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 playstation announced that it was going to take a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.120
 patch an update so that one could 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.890
 record but they have not said when 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.440
 then for those who are something 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.720
 desperate like me because they can just as 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.810
 get yourself a box like this is the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.360
 that I use the brand of mono price in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.910
 I bought this box in amazon vale 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.320
 around 50 dollars and then 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.100
 practically what it does is that 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.330
 convert the signal from be to hdmi what 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.040
 cut that protection 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.280
 okay 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.500
 Well obviously the cable is going to be 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.770
 hdmi cable that goes to should a single cable 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.600
 that go of h &amp; m already must also handle 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.990
 a digital audio cable 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:45.070
 that is connected to your playstation in the 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.290
 back and to the box that these 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.890
 two send the signal and turn it into 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.549
 hd m on the other end of this this 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.240
 cable is connected to its captor 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.030
 though and the other output of hdmi goes 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.320
 connected to your monitor or television or what 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.520
 that have 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.520
 and well 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.479
 I'm going to show you that it really works 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.540
 as you can see there my monitor does not have 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.840
 signal since it's off I'm not going 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.840
 to light 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.810
 and we are going to wait for him to charge and send 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810
 signal 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.440
 there is how you can see her send the 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.440
 signal 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.079
 and I'm also going to show you that really 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.870
 it works on the computer so that 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:45.049
 can record this is the program that I 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.049
 I use this Friday with the capture 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.000
 what 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 nothing else to load the image 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.390
 as well 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.290
 there is how you can see there already 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:07.710
 can record although it is the capturing 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.710
 that I use is a script and biar 2 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.270
 same comes to connect by means of 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.280
 hdmi to the comparison of the old one that 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.200
 had only could be connected by 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.100
 means of components this is through 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.100
 from hdmi 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.180
 Well, that's all, if they have any 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.340
 doubt leave in the comments and not 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.550
 forget to subscribe and give them like this 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.550
 video
