00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello very good to all of watts 2 and they 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.520
 I bring an interesting video 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.190
 and mysteries works and say it because it 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.590
 it's about the abandoned station of 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.610
 chicago de watch 2 is not located here 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.740
 in the area of pau ni vale has 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.029
 unlocked the whole area is worth so 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 well we are here not already the 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.460
 question the map because it is therefore 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.619
 a station and I was curious to 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.779
 that the road would leave these roads 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.430
 and these tracks, well, come here 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 where there are wagons there that do not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 good move because this the truth 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.500
 has does not have much here we have the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.680
 lair almost at the end of the game is worth it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.629
 you will know why and well this 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.609
 has therefore many things abandoned by 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.890
 that is what the abandoned station is 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.410
 is that the white sox game itself tells you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 why not the why of these 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.750
 such mysterious sinister places 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.379
 as we see here is worth it as there 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 all full shit all dirty and well 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.710
 good the wagons there that do not move 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.150
 there are many things as well as done over 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610
 of wooden wagons 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.040
 and other things and as we see there also 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 we can handle hitman camera as we see 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.800
 in that car that we see here because there 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 things already built by people who 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.010
 comes here because the area of pau ni 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.650
 there are usually very poor people say and not 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.390
 he comes here to hang out so 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.130
 well here we have many things kits to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.380
 the station on our right and we 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.530
 we found several curious things 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.530
 walking around here like for example here 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.229
 we are therefore good chairs a 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 radio a flag of usa and a 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.920
 tuition that belongs to quebec I do not know 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.390
 what will he have to see there but there he is 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.100
 This does not mean that it's good 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.940
 normally visit 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.590
 this people even there is a guitar 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.200
 flamenco and also so good here 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 many little things but the game gives us the 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.100
 because as I said is called 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.050
 city hot spots there are many typical 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.890
 have in many because they are very curious and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.069
 very 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 I do not say anything that has something sinister 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.420
 mysterious and related to murder and 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.980
 curious thing as well as the one that has not 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.959
 found against me two people one 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.300
 photographer that comes to us from a photographer 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.860
 we have to take pictures of you for the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.110
 newspaper the abandoned station of 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.130
 chicago I do not know I do not know what people do here 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.110
 in general so good here as we see 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.080
 the joystick because I was not doing very well like that 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 that we found here the children porn cit 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.790
 that is the good place the cit children 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.580
 does not say a summary about what is going 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.290
 to happen or about what has happened in 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.019
 this place not because it is abandoned 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.970
 because this is not so good let's go to 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.620
 we decided it because we have to come 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.900
 here to unlock it so that we 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.260
 say why because it is is 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.370
 abandoned because this is made shit 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.080
 so what we have to do is 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.140
 go to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.140
 on the mobile unlocking it from the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.990
 same square that comes out on the wall and 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.400
 good what we have to do is 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.690
 information about the place and I'm going to read this 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.280
 incomplete train station was the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.810
 sadly famous scenario of a 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.610
 bloody shooting between the chicago 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.620
 south club and the strength of the order the ts 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.910
 issue 50 and 53 police officers 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.050
 they were brutally riddled the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.790
 platform of the station while 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.280
 five club members escaped unharmed 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.960
 these shootings idealized in such a way that 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.610
 inspired new murders that limited 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.150
 in and around the station like 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.650
 result the works were abandoned 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.620
 that there was a shooting here 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.660
 this station because it seems that it was 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.180
 also motive of many other bands 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.620
 to kill people and as we have here 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.540
 here he found a bearing that has not been 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.600
 meaning they have important but good what 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.790
 I said what I say that I do not know 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.720
 retired there was not a shootout here the people 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.190
 he was inspired by this for the season 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.590
 well that figure is of a damn 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.090
 let's say because I do not know the people who have 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.440
 against the station and why 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.209
 wants to do murder at the station 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 so well here we have the mystery 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.939
 searched on the internet and not 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.489
 has nothing to do with reality is is 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.379
 fiction is invented by the game and 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.150
 well I like these kind of things 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.180
 and that it seems good to me that the game 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.260
 includes curious things so good 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.350
 tell me what did you think about it ? 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.209
 what theories do you have 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.870
 a theory no because it's already here 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.220
 not like gta 5 that the people as had 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.120
 than to look for his own theory but not 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.699
 here we already have a band murdered 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.580
 policemen and others and good as this led 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:36.400
 to abandon the works of this station 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.630
 so I hope you liked it 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.630
 greetings and see you in the next
