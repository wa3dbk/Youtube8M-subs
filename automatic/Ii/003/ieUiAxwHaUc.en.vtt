must be different every time some of the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.950 
must be different every time some of the
experiences<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.860> never<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.580> same<00:01:26.960> and

experiences it can never be the same and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.520 
experiences it can never be the same and
that<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.410> really<00:01:28.800> where<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.039> actors

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.560 

this<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.220> an<00:01:34.310> attraction<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.940> generations

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570
