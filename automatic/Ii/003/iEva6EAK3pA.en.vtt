people i'm not going to get a survey or
it's<00:00:52.350> highly<00:00:52.829> unlikely<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.309> would<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's highly unlikely that I would so

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's highly unlikely that I would so
let's<00:00:54.510> try<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.449> got<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:58.109> code<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:58.829> down

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
let's try so I got get code and now down

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.310 
let's try so I got get code and now down
here<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.489> shows<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> download<00:01:00.090> MSP<00:01:00.690> microsoft

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
here it shows a download MSP microsoft

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
here it shows a download MSP microsoft
points<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.640> now<00:01:02.760> let's<00:01:03.000> test<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.690> if

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
points so now let's test out and see if

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.530 
points so now let's test out and see if
this<00:01:03.899> works<00:01:04.489> I'm<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:06.869> my<00:01:07.020> account<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:08.540> from

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
this works I'm in my account and from

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.980 
this works I'm in my account and from
here<00:01:09.600> let's<00:01:10.530> add<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:10.799> points<00:01:13.220> redeem<00:01:14.220> code

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.920 

now<00:01:17.590> let's<00:01:17.770> open<00:01:17.860> up<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:18.189> document<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
now let's open up this document and

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.460 
now let's open up this document and
here's<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.259> code<00:01:20.439> I<00:01:20.649> got<00:01:20.829> from<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.340> website

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
here's the code I got from the website

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.260 
here's the code I got from the website
let's<00:01:23.470> copy<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.890> code<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.369> paste<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.119> in

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
let's copy that code and paste it in

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.310 
let's copy that code and paste it in
here<00:01:27.630> double<00:01:28.630> check<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.990> that's<00:01:29.140> all

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
here double check that that's all

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.669 
here double check that that's all
correct<00:01:30.539> seems<00:01:31.539> to<00:01:31.659> match<00:01:31.780> up<00:01:32.430> redeem<00:01:33.430> code

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.109 

alright<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.039> 1600<00:01:39.670> microsoft<00:01:39.789> points

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
alright so the 1600 microsoft points

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.700 
alright so the 1600 microsoft points
were<00:01:40.390> successfully<00:01:40.960> added<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.409> means

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
were successfully added so that means

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.779 
were successfully added so that means
that<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:41.920> work<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.820> really<00:01:43.119> cool

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
that that work and that is really cool

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.279 
that that work and that is really cool
sweet<00:01:45.789> so<00:01:46.090> now<00:01:46.210> let's<00:01:46.390> try<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.630> actually<00:01:47.080> for

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
sweet so now let's try this actually for

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.169 
sweet so now let's try this actually for
one<00:01:47.619> other<00:01:47.830> thing<00:01:48.130> or<00:01:48.280> two<00:01:48.460> other<00:01:48.640> things<00:01:48.700> just

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
one other thing or two other things just

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.880 
one other thing or two other things just
to<00:01:49.240> make<00:01:49.360> sure<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.750> this<00:01:49.869> is<00:01:50.110> all<00:01:50.740> working

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
to make sure that this is all working

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.109 
to make sure that this is all working
legitly<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.990> right<00:01:53.619> now<00:01:54.310> let's<00:01:54.880> try

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
legitly all right now let's try

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.800 
legitly all right now let's try
runescape<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.270> let's<00:01:58.420> head<00:01:58.539> over<00:01:58.569> to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
runescape so let's head over to

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.499 
runescape so let's head over to
runescape<00:01:59.020> calm<00:02:00.569> go<00:02:01.569> to<00:02:01.630> be<00:02:01.869> a<00:02:01.899> member<00:02:03.509> I'll

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
runescape calm go to be a member I'll

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:15.860 
runescape calm go to be a member I'll
log<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:05.080> here

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.330 

so<00:02:16.379> now<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.590> I'm<00:02:16.680> here<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.099> can<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
so now that I'm here you can see that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520 
so now that I'm here you can see that
this<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:17.610> extend<00:02:18.000> membership<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> free
