go over them a little bit more detailed
specs<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.220> UI<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.300> things<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> have

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
specs the UI and things like that I have

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.070 
specs the UI and things like that I have
a<00:00:19.470> video<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.400> well<00:00:20.869> so<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> can

a video about that as well so you can

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.509 
a video about that as well so you can
have<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.260> go<00:00:22.410> check<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.890> but<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
have to go check that out but this is

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.170 
have to go check that out but this is
gonna<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.970> traditional<00:00:24.510> speedy<00:00:25.320> video

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
gonna be the traditional speedy video

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.240 
gonna be the traditional speedy video
that<00:00:27.180> could<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.570> fun<00:00:27.779> things<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.439> so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
that could be some fun things to do so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
that could be some fun things to do so
I'm<00:00:29.699> just<00:00:29.849> gonna<00:00:30.170> turn<00:00:31.170> them<00:00:31.320> off<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:34.260> come

to a restart on the on the on the z2 so

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.260 
to a restart on the on the on the z2 so
Kendall<00:00:43.440> sucks

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.600 

okay<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> c2<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.320> quick<00:00:49.559> air<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.010> shall<00:00:50.280> say<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
okay the c2 is quick air I shall say it

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.630 
okay the c2 is quick air I shall say it
I<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> mega<00:00:51.210> wrong<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.640> s5

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
I have the mega wrong here on the s5

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
I have the mega wrong here on the s5
which<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.239> make<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> slower<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.809> faster<00:00:54.989> we

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
which can make it slower or faster we

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.869 
which can make it slower or faster we
don't<00:00:55.770> know

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.940 

because<00:01:04.839> obviously<00:01:05.019> when<00:01:05.439> you<00:01:05.500> sort<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.770> play

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
because obviously when you sort of play

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.030 
because obviously when you sort of play
with<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.280> software<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:08.350> could<00:01:08.740> have<00:01:08.860> some

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
with the software that could have some

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:19.710 
with the software that could have some
effects<00:01:17.369> okay<00:01:18.369> interesting<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.270> galaxy's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
effects okay interesting the galaxy's

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.980 
effects okay interesting the galaxy's
five<00:01:19.960> here<00:01:20.320> definitely<00:01:20.920> is<00:01:20.979> quicker<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:22.810> least

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
five here definitely is quicker at least

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.109 
five here definitely is quicker at least
you<00:01:23.350> know<00:01:23.440> stalling<00:01:24.250> up<00:01:24.369> here<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.820> could<00:01:28.060> be

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
you know stalling up here it could be

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.630 
you know stalling up here it could be
good<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.600> know<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.680> weird<00:01:29.799> thing<00:01:30.039> here<00:01:30.220> yeah

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
good to know the weird thing here yeah

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.690 
good to know the weird thing here yeah
Lisa<00:01:31.649> z2<00:01:32.649> is<00:01:32.680> for<00:01:33.009> to<00:01:33.130> me<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.369> have<00:01:33.460> seen

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
Lisa z2 is for to me to have seen

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.120 
Lisa z2 is for to me to have seen
college<00:01:34.119> side<00:01:34.330> but<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.619> when<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.799> have<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:35.979> lot

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
college side but and when you have a lot

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.130 
college side but and when you have a lot
of<00:01:36.220> phones<00:01:36.490> feels<00:01:37.119> looked<00:01:37.360> weird<00:01:37.600> it<00:01:37.840> would<00:01:37.990> be

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
of phones feels looked weird it would be

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.889 
of phones feels looked weird it would be
a<00:01:38.170> little<00:01:38.259> bit<00:01:38.440> weird<00:01:38.590> actually<00:01:39.009> to<00:01:39.130> put<00:01:39.280> in

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
a little bit weird actually to put in

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.840 
a little bit weird actually to put in
one<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:40.929> those<00:01:41.200> also<00:01:42.130> pretty<00:01:42.369> funny<00:01:42.460> here<00:01:42.759> of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
one of those also pretty funny here of

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.880 
one of those also pretty funny here of
course<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.420> both<00:01:43.569> these<00:01:43.750> two<00:01:44.140> phones<00:01:44.560> are

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
course is that both these two phones are

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.850 
course is that both these two phones are
pretty<00:01:45.130> good<00:01:45.700> in<00:01:45.940> water<00:01:46.330> assistance<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.200> they

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
pretty good in water assistance so they

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
pretty good in water assistance so they
always<00:01:48.039> like<00:01:48.340> warning<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:51.520> that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
always like warning you about that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.740 
always like warning you about that
little<00:01:52.090> thing<00:01:52.500> here<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.830> sides<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
little thing here on the sides and it

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.499 
little thing here on the sides and it
seems<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:57.490> one<00:01:57.729> probably<00:01:57.970> is<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.210> little

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
seems like this one probably is a little

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.120 
seems like this one probably is a little
bit<00:01:58.600> sharper<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.350> terms<00:01:59.619> of<00:01:59.770> water<00:01:59.950> resistance

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
bit sharper in terms of water resistance

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.050 
bit sharper in terms of water resistance
because<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:01.420> can't<00:02:01.720> take<00:02:02.080> off<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.679> back<00:02:03.060> but

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
because you can't take off the back but

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.649 
because you can't take off the back but
you<00:02:04.179> can<00:02:04.209> do<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.869> on<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.819> galaxy<00:02:06.819> s5<00:02:07.209> which

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
you can do that on the galaxy s5 which

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.030 
you can do that on the galaxy s5 which
course<00:02:08.440> definitely<00:02:09.009> could<00:02:09.310> be<00:02:09.340> a<00:02:09.610> risk<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:11.040> mean

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
course definitely could be a risk I mean

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.420 
course definitely could be a risk I mean
look<00:02:12.670> at<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.930> protected<00:02:17.920> area

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
look at this this is the protected area

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.900 
look at this this is the protected area
and<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:20.470> mean<00:02:20.620> yes<00:02:20.859> if<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.160> get<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> hole<00:02:21.640> in<00:02:21.670> one

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
and I mean yes if you get a hole in one

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.539 
and I mean yes if you get a hole in one
of<00:02:22.060> these<00:02:22.410> they<00:02:23.410> can<00:02:23.470> probably<00:02:23.829> make<00:02:24.130> things

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
of these they can probably make things

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.199 
of these they can probably make things
limiters<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:30.340> they<00:02:30.459> all<00:02:30.549> run<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.910> latest

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
limiters but they all run in the latest

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.360 
limiters but they all run in the latest
software<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.840> gets<00:02:32.049> their<00:02:32.230> new<00:02:32.410> phone<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.010> both

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
software it gets their new phone so both
