00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 because 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.810
 the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.810
 it remains the impression that he means that 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.489
 Here I also had his self-written texts against each other 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:35.800
 nudity to notice the text on youthfulness the gačd best 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.850
 grow if it has been described that are not the 7 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 this will be 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.200
 ready for the crisis like that 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.200
 And yet it was time for the big Swiss 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.910
 Mood 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.910
 that was all open 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.810
 filed in court 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.030
 Sorry 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.860
 with it stopped 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.530
 it was taken a blood sample Euro 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.530
 still today hans-uli Thierer 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.980
 because there is 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.050
 yes after that was the equivalent 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.440
 was completed 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.220
 to forgive the attitude 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.510
 It is important that the self as devout and set off so that is 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.790
 it 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.780
 is the mood too 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.270
 but these ladies 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.000
 3 percent top Sloterdijk and more contracting works best 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.190
 homeland 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.190
 m graded for everyone here and there 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.549
 not first and 8 francs 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.249
 why he's beating on grass is being taken so seriously and the jury 

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.860
 is already there 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.350
 manipulated by who first exhausting and it is not synonymous 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.370
 Professional theory that any people and space can be so serious 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.449
 take it is not synonymous 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.419
 that was the speech 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.129
 the bandwidth texts 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.510
 those of political 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.489
 the comedic points seriously 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.099
 under the table 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.079
 to complete Seeds revelation that is not everything 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.319
 so the 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.569
 the multitude of slammers present the variety of topics 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:29.890
 unfortunately, they seem 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.220
 I am against it he went on he is the storage space 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.239
 Some of us are about to cry, I think I'll be more beautiful 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.239
 11 Arnstadt 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 Phil 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:55.189
 an RTL 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.579
 Capital 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.409
 14 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.409
 Of course there 

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:04.839
 4 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.839
 Ha 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.719
 Life goes on but that's true, but that means life too 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:19.269
 Over there one must as in Upper Bavaria Ballesteros lost Dr da 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.759
 and also the results and we have to and we want to race 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.120
 I have no right 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.309
 I am 

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:34.799
 in Duisburg 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.149
 the entertainment and Mohr definitely needed 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.149
 Every public wants to be entertained 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:47.029
 but what if garbage diebearers want to hear all the bandwidth 

00:03:47.029 --> 00:03:50.949
 So I think that will be Vienna's only funny lyrics 2 if only 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.499
 become serious 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.679
 even if bored she fulfills such honor and humility 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.440
 Test has appeared because 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.149
 in it are so far 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.819
 4 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.039
 the great variety of different copywriters of different projects that 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:08.169
 Doing the thing exciting and entertaining the audience I believe the tournament 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.399
 4 this is especially true 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.239
 I had to correct the winner 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.949
 in percentage terms 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.340
 St 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.750
 so it is in Bahrain to say where he stated fact is that it is not first 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.000
 reported to have been together 20-30 percent were 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:32.800
 You should 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.599
 who owns something like that 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.599
 each for short-term use si 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.659
 1 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.759
 set the eps estimates 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.569
 and by insured but that it looks like the charm 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.729
 In the beginning, applause Vienna had to be distributed 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.220
 a coupe arrives at the public in the limelight or 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.719
 perfect someone no, finally, around 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.240
 the bags on 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.479
 there is so on from oh and the marketing as intense as now 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.610
 just for driving around side 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.979
 had one year there 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.979
 Dancing is fun under the motto 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.360
 all this was taken to the euro 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.809
 we have to go too 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:23.960
 now there 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.210
 GR 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.770
 a naked skin 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.629
 we are many 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.629
 constantly too 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.969
 and not all people Haiti 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.900
 he'll be the problem 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.279
 either one 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:50.279
 but 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.349
 and the jubilation welcomes the volunteers 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.819
 but only when the masses see but only four years and changed nothing 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.400
 in 20 years, percent will no longer vote in 20 years 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.270
 over 100 percent 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.030
 they protest against Thorsten's voice on stage or be it 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.379
 in the audience 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:23.759
 and then the best slammer becomes chancellor for a year 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.069
 and then the world will be a lot nicer if it is now 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:32.529
 Next 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.229
 Munich 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:03.389
 it was expected to go out 

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.599
 becomes critical
