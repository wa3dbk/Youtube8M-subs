00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.660
 good friends of youtube my name is 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.700
 for you 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:11.170
 Diego is here and today I am going to teach you 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.300
 how to download transformers the game one 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.480
 of the best games that there are up to 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.510
 moment of little requirements 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.890
 for that we go to the next link 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.890
 I leave a description of the video 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.110
 we copy the link 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.160
 and they go to their browser 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.190
 i 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.310
 and we believe it 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.310
 [Music] 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.800
 and we wait for the fault to load 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.060
 once you once experienced a 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.740
 page 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.740
 we give you where it says download 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.210
 [Music] 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.390
 and we wait for the 20 seconds that we 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390
 He says 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.229
 [Music] 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.880
 how 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.959
 [Music] 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.590
 well once we've expected the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.590
 seconds we give you tell me download 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.670
 and we wait 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 all right 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.880
 and wait until it is unloaded 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.470
 Transformers from some country to the werder 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.470
 of 206 megabytes 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.930
 you download them completely and once 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 downloaded will be left of this 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.860
 I do not externalize because I already have it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.860
 [Music] 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.079
 good once you have downloaded 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.040
 they will be left this way 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.450
 once you have had this and have 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.360
 finished downloading it so they do not 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.740
 it means 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.740
 interest or brothers 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.349
 and they executed as ministers 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.230
 good one time 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.230
 here is how well they want to have it 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.299
 but for this we have a folder 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.069
 so we give it right click 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.790
 new 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.790
 calpe 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.280
 we look here in this because it is a we 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.280
 never work where the blog says 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.550
 and he says brown 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.590
 I like it in the folder that just 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.819
 create for example I have it in the 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:57.549
 desk and today ok 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.549
 once done this curses it extract 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:08.610
 and the process will begin 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.610
 me for being the video to teach them 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.150
 good as it can be work area 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.150
 all 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.350
 with a little bit 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.689
 and this one 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.750
 and we get to where Klaus Franz says err 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:40.820
 and once a folder that is here 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.820
 well from the archives now we saw 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.360
 we open the transformers 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.980
 again 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.420
 and we look for the one that says 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.920
 safe 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.920
 we give it right click run against 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.370
 we give him yes 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.630
 and then we give 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:28.770
 in a moment and then this will open 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.770
 a strong file 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:35.070
 and it may end all immediately 

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:37.620
 it gets up 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.920
 I do not follow another, it ceases not because I already 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.920
 I have 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.940
 and good we need 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.630
 and I'm going to make a video later 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.420
 of the game 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.860
 how it works 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.660
 and enjoy them since mega plus 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.449
 hill so we have to take advantage in 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.439
 the flights good 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.439
 even projects
