00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.889
 hello good your team enemy has classes 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.160
 these sound tutorial to configure a sladic system to use it for the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.339
 performance 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.720
 lake in the confluence in 3d a game selection jo 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.460
 in the program to customize 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.980
 first of all we go to the tropical filtered leamos controlled by the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.970
 application 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 I recommend that after the game you use the mobile and newell s 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.370
 Insureds of history filtration 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 in high performance 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.070
 then isotope optimization disabled 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.790
 the criminal optimization also deactivates 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.410
 now we go to the spokesperson 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.290
 the performance mode the ecta ​​that put it the recommended by envy 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 that will put it in force rendering of travolta is native 2 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 I say this because not only is someone is less 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.280
 what happens is that 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 to the recommended then it comes out 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.950
 then the vertical synchronization 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.410
 I have it put in using the confluence of wealth in 3d and within 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.910
 of the game removed 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.980
 the soloist of lines 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.390
 there is a way of esla he 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.240
 what is special for advance we put the vote is free eight per 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.750
 since it is the one that less loads i 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.210
 and optimized 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.170
 John will make them on June 3 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.620
 evelyn of 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.890
 produce more 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.050
 no more fluid but more continuous 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.120
 if they are used 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.470
 this low line we have to select to improve the configuration of the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.190
 application 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.690
 then limp 2 on 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.310
 of the exlíder game 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.670
 and will convert it to is the poplar 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 will go more fluid i télam - maybe 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 the use of that activist tropical paradise turned off 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.979
 just make sure that we have in the activated slade 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.649
 make sure we have in the directive or 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:23.979
 and disable the gp2 physics since the game does not use it overload type 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:28.729
 well I hope it helps
