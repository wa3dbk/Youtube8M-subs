00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
but of course things went wrong except

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.670 
but of course things went wrong except
it<00:06:39.000> was<00:06:39.270> not<00:06:39.510> their<00:06:39.690> fault<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.229> was

become which she has but she's become
very<00:06:49.740> good<00:06:49.979> at<00:06:50.039> it<00:06:50.280> so<00:06:51.000> the<00:06:51.120> base<00:06:51.300> turned<00:06:51.600> into

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
very good at it so the base turned into

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.670 
very good at it so the base turned into
a<00:06:51.870> zombie<00:06:52.139> fest

moon<00:07:13.259> wielding<00:07:13.800> these<00:07:13.919> weapons<00:07:14.370> but<00:07:14.789> there

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:14.910 
moon wielding these weapons but there

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.520 
moon wielding these weapons but there
was<00:07:15.030> no<00:07:15.240> hope<00:07:15.479> for<00:07:15.690> them<00:07:15.780> since<00:07:15.990> there<00:07:16.229> were<00:07:16.320> so

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:16.530 
was no hope for them since there were so

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.740 
was no hope for them since there were so
many<00:07:16.710> and<00:07:17.009> Sam<00:07:17.460> manipulated<00:07:18.060> some<00:07:18.270> to<00:07:18.419> appear

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
many and Sam manipulated some to appear

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.270 
many and Sam manipulated some to appear
as<00:07:18.900> them<00:07:19.139> but<00:07:19.470> in<00:07:19.560> reality<00:07:19.590> it<00:07:20.160> was<00:07:20.250> a

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
as them but in reality it was a

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.100 
as them but in reality it was a
dangerous<00:07:20.520> zombie<00:07:21.090> what<00:07:21.539> we<00:07:21.690> know<00:07:21.870> as<00:07:22.080> a

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110 
dangerous zombie what we know as a

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.230 
dangerous zombie what we know as a
spaceman<00:07:22.710> so<00:07:23.310> the<00:07:23.400> whole<00:07:23.550> moon<00:07:23.759> base<00:07:24.000> was

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 
spaceman so the whole moon base was

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.909 
spaceman so the whole moon base was
overrun<00:07:24.599> and<00:07:24.780> the<00:07:24.840> US<00:07:25.110> government<00:07:25.560> left<00:07:25.740> in

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 
overrun and the US government left in

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:27.860 
overrun and the US government left in
another<00:07:26.039> slump<00:07:26.550> but<00:07:27.030> even<00:07:27.270> worse<00:07:27.449> came<00:07:27.750> in

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
another slump but even worse came in

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.659 
another slump but even worse came in
their<00:07:27.990> way<00:07:28.110> when<00:07:28.259> doctor<00:07:28.590> rift<00:07:28.770> often<00:07:29.460> came<00:07:29.639> to

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:29.669 
their way when doctor rift often came to

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.430 
their way when doctor rift often came to
complete<00:07:30.120> his<00:07:30.210> scheme<00:07:30.509> but<00:07:30.960> I'll<00:07:31.110> get<00:07:31.289> into
