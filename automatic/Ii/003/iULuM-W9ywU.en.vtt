00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
Naxos rockets well they've got enough

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.650 
Naxos rockets well they've got enough

is<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.080> Ian's<00:00:07.710> missions<00:00:08.189> where<00:00:08.400> you

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
is that Ian's missions where you

actually get to deploy your own units
it's<00:00:11.070> probably<00:00:11.519> not<00:00:11.730> best<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.150> waste<00:00:12.809> your

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it's probably not best to waste your

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.410 
it's probably not best to waste your
money<00:00:13.200> on<00:00:13.349> them<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.740> max<00:00:14.059> there's<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.210> save

it<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.750> medium<00:00:16.049> tanks<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.590> life<00:00:17.359> and<00:00:18.359> here

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it for medium tanks in the life and here

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.759 
it for medium tanks in the life and here
we<00:00:19.199> go<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:21.029> very<00:00:21.810> obvious<00:00:21.990> property<00:00:22.650> that

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we go in this very obvious property that

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
we go in this very obvious property that
was<00:00:22.890> close<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.430> your<00:00:23.519> headquarters<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.810> find

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
was close to your headquarters you find

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.439 
was close to your headquarters you find
a<00:00:25.380> map<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:27.500> this<00:00:28.500> system<00:00:29.310> appears<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
a map now this system appears in the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.939 
a map now this system appears in the
campaign<00:00:30.900> mode<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.260> all<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.529> countries

basically<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.390> certain<00:00:33.899> mission<00:00:34.079> there

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
basically in a certain mission there

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.950 
basically in a certain mission there
will<00:00:35.040> be<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.460> map<00:00:35.940> hidden<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:37.380> neutral<00:00:38.160> city

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
will be a map hidden in one neutral city

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.900 
will be a map hidden in one neutral city
once<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.110> capture<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.649> city<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.250> unlocks

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
once you capture that city that unlocks

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.860 
once you capture that city that unlocks
the<00:00:42.440> secret<00:00:43.440> lab<00:00:43.710> mission<00:00:44.100> for<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.340> country

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
in most cases in fact in all cases

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
in most cases in fact in all cases
there'll<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.050> subtle<00:00:52.620> hint<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:53.250> which

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
there'll be a subtle hint to which

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
there'll be a subtle hint to which
mission<00:00:53.699> has<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.210> lab<00:00:54.600> map<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.579> pre

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.070 
battle conversation and if the enemy
manages<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> recapture<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.870> property

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
manages to recapture that your property

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
manages to recapture that your property
you'll<00:01:04.439> still<00:01:04.710> get<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> loud<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.309> and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
you'll still get the loud now and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.140 
you'll still get the loud now and
unfortunately<00:01:08.100> there's<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.430> nothing<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
unfortunately there's really nothing you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:17.130 
unfortunately there's really nothing you
can<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> stop<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.869> happening

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.830 

but<00:01:18.430> thankfully<00:01:19.430> flat<00:01:19.940> zoo<00:01:20.240> power<00:01:20.510> is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
but thankfully flat zoo power is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.980 
but thankfully flat zoo power is
basically<00:01:21.440> just<00:01:22.509> exaggerating<00:01:23.509> his<00:01:23.659> normal

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
basically just exaggerating his normal

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.200 
basically just exaggerating his normal
strengths<00:01:24.380> basically<00:01:24.920> he<00:01:25.490> has<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.640> chance<00:01:26.030> of

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
strengths basically he has a chance of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.450 
strengths basically he has a chance of
doing<00:01:26.299> even<00:01:26.810> more<00:01:27.049> damage<00:01:27.470> but<00:01:27.770> also<00:01:27.979> even

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
doing even more damage but also even

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.340 
doing even more damage but also even
less<00:01:28.790> damage<00:01:31.659> of<00:01:32.659> course<00:01:32.720> doesn't<00:01:33.140> really

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
less damage of course doesn't really

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.510 
less damage of course doesn't really
matter<00:01:33.560> when<00:01:33.800> you're<00:01:33.950> attacking<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:36.520> rocket

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
matter when you're attacking a rocket

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.289 
matter when you're attacking a rocket
units<00:01:37.880> being<00:01:38.290> no<00:01:39.290> defense<00:01:39.680> cover<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.369> with<00:01:41.270> a

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
units being no defense cover and with a

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.539 
units being no defense cover and with a
follower<00:01:41.860> yeah<00:01:42.860> nothing's<00:01:43.190> going<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.399> die

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
follower yeah nothing's going to die

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.639 
follower yeah nothing's going to die
anyway<00:01:43.850> but<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:47.390> bomber<00:01:47.750> is<00:01:48.080> pretty<00:01:48.500> much

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
anyway but that bomber is pretty much

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.720 
anyway but that bomber is pretty much
dead<00:01:48.890> now

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.790 

first<00:01:53.390> finish<00:01:53.630> off<00:01:53.870> is<00:01:54.020> annoying<00:01:54.320> one<00:01:54.650> HP

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
first finish off is annoying one HP

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.610 
first finish off is annoying one HP
fighter<00:01:55.630> yeah<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.660> think<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.990> survived<00:01:57.350> that

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
fighter yeah I think you survived that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.240 
fighter yeah I think you survived that
last<00:01:57.860> turn<00:01:58.070> did<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:59.080> good<00:02:00.080> bye

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
last turn did you good bye

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:14.930 
last turn did you good bye
Oh<00:02:03.410> almost<00:02:04.820> almost<00:02:05.820> there

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.309 

still<00:02:15.940> manages<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.390> do<00:02:16.569> quite<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> bit<00:02:17.020> even

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
still manages to do quite a bit even

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.850 
still manages to do quite a bit even
when<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.860> being<00:02:18.340> seriously<00:02:18.819> crippled

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
when it's being seriously crippled

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.860 
when it's being seriously crippled
bombers<00:02:21.760> are<00:02:21.880> always<00:02:22.120> pulling<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.870> that

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
bombers are always pulling like that

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.820 
bombers are always pulling like that
it's<00:02:25.870> hard<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.230> take<00:02:26.380> them<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.710> without

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
it's hard to take them out without

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's hard to take them out without
suffering<00:02:27.400> damage<00:02:27.700> yourself<00:02:28.120> unless<00:02:28.360> you're

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
suffering damage yourself unless you're

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.200 
suffering damage yourself unless you're
using<00:02:29.340> missiles

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.430 

speaking<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.270> missiles<00:02:34.660> they<00:02:34.870> are<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.020> really

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
speaking of missiles they are a really

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.250 
speaking of missiles they are a really
good<00:02:35.620> defensive<00:02:36.100> policy<00:02:36.370> against<00:02:37.120> air<00:02:37.840> unit

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
good defensive policy against air unit

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.670 
good defensive policy against air unit
heavy<00:02:38.620> armies<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.820> they're<00:02:40.570> not<00:02:41.320> very<00:02:41.590> good

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
heavy armies but they're not very good

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.560 
heavy armies but they're not very good
at<00:02:41.860> much<00:02:42.280> but<00:02:42.310> they<00:02:42.790> can't<00:02:43.060> do<00:02:43.210> anything<00:02:43.390> else

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
at much but they can't do anything else

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.770 
at much but they can't do anything else
so<00:02:44.200> they're<00:02:45.130> pretty<00:02:45.340> inflexible

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.250 

and<00:02:50.780> I've<00:02:51.710> basically<00:02:51.920> won<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:53.020> because<00:02:54.020> that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
and I've basically won now because that

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.320 
and I've basically won now because that
in<00:02:54.440> country<00:02:54.770> will<00:02:54.890> die<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.520> anti<00:02:55.820> air<00:02:56.000> unit

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
in country will die to the anti air unit

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.830 
in country will die to the anti air unit
and<00:02:56.690> these<00:02:57.080> tank<00:02:57.410> will<00:02:57.590> die<00:02:57.740> the<00:02:57.800> moment

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.900 

so<00:03:05.840> anyway<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.450> basically

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
so anyway this is basically

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.780 
so anyway this is basically
that's<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.780> second<00:03:11.110> mission<00:03:11.410> and<00:03:11.790> pretty

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
that's the second mission and pretty

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.270 
that's the second mission and pretty
much<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:12.910> tutorial<00:03:13.390> on<00:03:13.720> just<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.290> units<00:03:14.860> and<00:03:15.040> Co

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
much a tutorial on just a units and Co

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:32.390 
much a tutorial on just a units and Co
powers

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.399 

now<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.640> thought<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.060> lost<00:03:34.420> quite<00:03:34.720> a<00:03:34.870> few<00:03:34.930> units

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
now I thought I lost quite a few units

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.259 
now I thought I lost quite a few units
there<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:35.950> interestingly<00:03:36.340> I<00:03:36.790> still<00:03:37.120> got<00:03:37.239> a

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
there but interestingly I still got a

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.979 
there but interestingly I still got a
perfect<00:03:37.480> score<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:37.900> technique<00:03:39.599> how<00:03:40.599> the<00:03:40.870> way

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
perfect score for technique how the way

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.729 
perfect score for technique how the way
techniques<00:03:41.530> works<00:03:41.799> is<00:03:42.189> that<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:44.019> can't<00:03:44.349> lose

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
techniques works is that you can't lose

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.319 
techniques works is that you can't lose
more<00:03:45.340> than<00:03:45.930> 20%<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.200> your<00:03:47.349> total<00:03:47.680> units<00:03:48.329> that's

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
more than 20% of your total units that's

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.399 
more than 20% of your total units that's
enough<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:49.870> an<00:03:49.959> s-rank<00:03:51.599> suggest<00:03:52.599> you'll

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
enough for an s-rank suggest you'll

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.099 
enough for an s-rank suggest you'll
often<00:03:53.620> need<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:53.980> check<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.670> Intel<00:03:55.480> screen<00:03:55.840> but

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
often need to check the Intel screen but

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.550 
often need to check the Intel screen but
keep<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.069> number<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.120> units<00:03:58.150> lost<00:03:58.780> less<00:03:59.260> than

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
keep that number of units lost less than

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.369 
keep that number of units lost less than
20%<00:04:00.010> of<00:04:00.549> your<00:04:00.760> total<00:04:01.060> units<00:04:01.569> and<00:04:01.810> you'll<00:04:02.290> be

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
20% of your total units and you'll be

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.710 
20% of your total units and you'll be
fine<00:04:05.069> later<00:04:06.069> on<00:04:06.340> I'll<00:04:06.579> show<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.819> certain<00:04:07.180> tactic

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
fine later on I'll show a certain tactic

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:18.479 
fine later on I'll show a certain tactic
that<00:04:07.750> helps<00:04:08.139> about

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.430 

and<00:04:19.489> this<00:04:20.419> Queen<00:04:20.660> here<00:04:20.959> is<00:04:21.049> basically<00:04:21.350> just

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
and this Queen here is basically just

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.860 
and this Queen here is basically just
totaling<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.190> your<00:04:22.340> points<00:04:22.759> which<00:04:23.389> basically

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
totaling up your points which basically

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.439 
totaling up your points which basically
become<00:04:24.320> money<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:25.009> spend<00:04:25.370> on<00:04:25.580> unlocking<00:04:26.150> new

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
become money and spend on unlocking new

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.430 
become money and spend on unlocking new
