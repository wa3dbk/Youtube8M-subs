this tool will allow you to do is
download<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.770> file<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> server<00:00:24.080> externally

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
download a file to the server externally

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.859 
download a file to the server externally
and<00:00:25.199> execute<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.859> all<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.359> really<00:00:27.599> need<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and execute it all you really need is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.110 
and execute it all you really need is
access<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:30.650> ftp<00:00:31.650> server<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.880> server

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
access to the ftp server of the server

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
access to the ftp server of the server
so<00:00:34.640> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> more<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.090> server<00:00:36.329> owners<00:00:36.870> are

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so this is more for server owners are

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.930 
so this is more for server owners are
people<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> go<00:00:38.489> out<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.640> buy<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
people that's going to go out and buy a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
people that's going to go out and buy a
server<00:00:39.270> i<00:00:39.450> mean<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:39.899> by<00:00:40.140> ax<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:41.040> i

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
server i mean you can go by ax so i

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.970 
server i mean you can go by ax so i
guess<00:00:41.610> three<00:00:41.879> slot<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.329> two<00:00:42.510> slot<00:00:42.809> server<00:00:43.350> 33

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
guess three slot or two slot server 33

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.560 
guess three slot or two slot server 33
tick<00:00:44.219> for<00:00:44.370> really<00:00:44.640> cheap<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.059> two<00:00:45.239> dollars

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
tick for really cheap like two dollars

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.139 
tick for really cheap like two dollars
three<00:00:45.809> dollars<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> use<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.940> course

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
three dollars just to use this of course

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
three dollars just to use this of course
it's<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.840> process<00:00:49.350> that's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it's just going to be the process that's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's just going to be the process that's
slow<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.090> made<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.719> run

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
slow because it's made that way to run

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
slow because it's made that way to run
that<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.070> system<00:00:53.579> still<00:00:53.820> gonna<00:00:54.059> be

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
that way but the system still gonna be

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.740 
that way but the system still gonna be
really<00:00:54.390> powerful<00:00:55.789> the<00:00:56.789> common<00:00:57.149> uses<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
really powerful the common uses for this

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.189 
really powerful the common uses for this
would<00:00:57.960> be<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.289> install<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> botnet<00:00:59.760> onto<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
would be to install a botnet onto the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.830 
would be to install a botnet onto the
server<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.329> useful<00:01:03.449> because

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
server if i can be very useful because

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
server if i can be very useful because
these<00:01:04.140> machines<00:01:04.530> are<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:04.860> powerful<00:01:05.070> they

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
these machines are very powerful they

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.810 
these machines are very powerful they
have<00:01:05.790> really<00:01:05.939> good<00:01:06.060> bandwidth<00:01:06.659> um<00:01:07.670> some<00:01:08.670> other

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
have really good bandwidth um some other

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.750 
have really good bandwidth um some other
uses<00:01:09.330> would<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> host<00:01:10.590> your<00:01:10.860> own<00:01:10.920> dedicated

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
uses would be to host your own dedicated

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.460 
uses would be to host your own dedicated
servers<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.810> mean<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.170> could<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.380> even

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
servers on here I mean it could be even

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.920 
servers on here I mean it could be even
trailer<00:01:13.830> servers<00:01:14.280> teamspeak<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.720> host

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
trailer servers teamspeak you can host

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.820 
trailer servers teamspeak you can host
your<00:01:15.990> own<00:01:16.110> websites<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.830> here<00:01:17.159> um<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:19.560> know<00:01:19.590> um

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
your own websites on here um you know um

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.080 
your own websites on here um you know um
source<00:01:20.430> dedicated<00:01:21.060> servers<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.540> wanted<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
source dedicated servers you wanted to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.520 
source dedicated servers you wanted to
garys<00:01:24.090> monsters<00:01:24.570> what<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> wanted<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> you

garys monsters what if you wanted to you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
garys monsters what if you wanted to you
can<00:01:25.619> host<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.479> still<00:01:27.689> access<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
can host on here you can still access to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
can host on here you can still access to
the<00:01:28.409> server<00:01:29.720> just<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.140> many<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.829> I
