00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
so we had a little modification along

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.650 
so we had a little modification along
the<00:05:29.630> way<00:05:30.070> didn't<00:05:31.070> exactly<00:05:31.310> make<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:32.150> General

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
the combination of the one packet and

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.670 
the combination of the one packet and
the<00:05:39.520> bottle<00:05:40.520> of<00:05:40.610> sauce<00:05:40.880> was<00:05:41.750> plenty<00:05:42.170> of<00:05:42.320> sauce

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
the bottle of sauce was plenty of sauce

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.850 
the bottle of sauce was plenty of sauce
and<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.910> flavor<00:05:44.240> was<00:05:44.540> great<00:05:45.140> I<00:05:45.410> mean<00:05:45.590> it

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
and the flavor was great I mean it

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.840 
and the flavor was great I mean it
really<00:05:46.460> had<00:05:46.760> a<00:05:47.120> good<00:05:47.830> strong<00:05:48.830> general<00:05:49.370> tso's

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
really had a good strong general tso's

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.060 
really had a good strong general tso's
flavor<00:05:50.240> to<00:05:50.480> it<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:51.590> only<00:05:51.740> thing<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:51.950> would

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
flavor to it the only thing I would

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.830 
flavor to it the only thing I would
change<00:05:52.100> is<00:05:52.400> probably<00:05:52.760> put<00:05:53.570> some<00:05:53.690> more

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
change is probably put some more

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.360 
change is probably put some more
vegetables<00:05:54.380> in<00:05:54.500> there<00:05:54.650> with<00:05:54.800> it<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.040> was<00:05:55.160> kind

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
vegetables in there with it it was kind

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.870 
vegetables in there with it it was kind
of<00:05:55.520> just<00:05:56.420> chicken<00:05:57.380> and<00:05:57.680> you<00:05:58.520> know<00:05:58.640> we<00:05:58.760> added

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
of just chicken and you know we added

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.830 
of just chicken and you know we added
that<00:05:59.150> little<00:05:59.390> can<00:06:00.080> of<00:06:00.220> vegetable<00:06:01.220> but<00:06:01.700> I<00:06:02.210> think

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
that little can of vegetable but I think

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.690 
that little can of vegetable but I think
maybe<00:06:02.960> some<00:06:03.200> fresh<00:06:03.410> broccoli<00:06:03.980> or<00:06:04.400> something

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
maybe some fresh broccoli or something

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.320 
maybe some fresh broccoli or something
would<00:06:04.820> be<00:06:04.910> good

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
would be good

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.380
