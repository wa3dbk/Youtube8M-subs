00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
strikes the map gets really really dark

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.070 
strikes the map gets really really dark
as<00:00:25.920> i<00:00:26.039> call<00:00:26.220> them<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.550> i<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.960> in

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
as i call them in i think like all in

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.900 
as i call them in i think like all in
one<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.619> know<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.920> map<00:00:29.130> changes<00:00:29.609> everything

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
one you know the map changes everything

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.999 
one you know the map changes everything
i<00:00:30.150> call<00:00:30.359> another<00:00:30.720> later<00:00:31.019> on<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.890> gets

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
i call another later on and it gets

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.590 
i call another later on and it gets
extremely<00:00:32.279> dark<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.239> extremely

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
extremely dark so it was extremely

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.450 
extremely dark so it was extremely
challenging<00:00:34.290> game<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.710> yet<00:00:34.829> i<00:00:35.010> still<00:00:35.040> pull

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the the second part the second I think

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.840 
the the second part the second I think
this<00:01:33.720> would<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> second<00:01:34.680> cam<00:01:34.829> we're<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.430> 55

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.850 
this would be the second cam we're at 55
kills<00:01:36.119> ready<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> mean<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.229> I'd<00:01:37.320> say<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
kills ready so I mean be I'd say it was

this<00:04:25.820> pot<00:04:26.060> match<00:04:26.330> I<00:04:26.600> got<00:04:27.110> five<00:04:27.320> bots<00:04:27.590> on<00:04:28.130> my

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
this pot match I got five bots on my

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.250 
this pot match I got five bots on my
team<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.880> apparently<00:04:29.240> I'm<00:04:29.300> facing<00:04:29.510> six<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.230> I

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
team and apparently I'm facing six and I

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.660 
team and apparently I'm facing six and I
couldn't<00:04:30.440> find<00:04:30.710> anybody<00:04:31.010> during<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.520> match

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
couldn't find anybody during the match

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.830 
couldn't find anybody during the match
so<00:04:31.820> I<00:04:31.850> gotta<00:04:32.000> say<00:04:32.150> I<00:04:32.180> think<00:04:32.240> this<00:04:32.600> gameplay

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
so I gotta say I think this gameplay

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.930 
so I gotta say I think this gameplay
might<00:04:33.230> have<00:04:33.350> been<00:04:33.440> only<00:04:33.560> like<00:04:33.800> 150<00:04:34.310> kills<00:04:34.700> like

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
might have been only like 150 kills like

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.030 
might have been only like 150 kills like
it<00:04:35.090> was<00:04:35.180> not<00:04:35.810> really<00:04:36.020> that<00:04:36.140> much<00:04:36.350> puts<00:04:36.710> up<00:04:36.890> yeah

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
it was not really that much puts up yeah

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.500 
it was not really that much puts up yeah
so<00:04:37.220> anyways<00:04:37.460> think<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.090> got<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.360> much

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510
