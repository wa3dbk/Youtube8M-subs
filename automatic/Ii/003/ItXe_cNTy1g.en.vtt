00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 ok i am nina and my urban craft is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.500
 draw the snow and draw it 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.630
 use everything comes to me all materials 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.630
 five papers all I find 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.029
 I especially like big tesque things 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.619
 things I find ugly, I think 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.529
 actually a pretty one more than one 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.130
 figure also usually as a country 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.130
 tensions 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.760
 my cap and a failure of the people 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.050
 trackback to make is aimed at 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.400
 quote from a book 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.910
 Dear ones are almost coming closer 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.980
 the summer is coming down anyway 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.930
 only for the patient 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.840
 they live like eternity for them 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.460
 lies so carefree still and far I learn 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.080
 that every day at the expense of pain and pain 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.470
 for which I am grateful 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.780
 patience is all that I have ever taken to 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.540
 killed him so everything is actually made 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.310
 now he was a bit rushed 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.229
 a man that he must after that and that we 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.900
 I realize that 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.510
 step I could have then we come in one 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.640
 figure standing still and all the rest 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.400
 wild and actually pushing me forward 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.150
 think we have to do everything and that 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.150
 pulling and 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.619
 i went to watch ellen bath and as one 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.670
 little dark blue grayish 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.229
 background 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.390
 then I also thought a dark background 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.210
 as nice with the Flemish primitives as 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.579
 line is eight years lighter colors 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.170
 or does that also stand out that way 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.149
 really just a last name 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.960
 and not such a white one 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.960
 founder de 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.299
 my line they always want to come that way 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.399
 greasy 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.849
 prices and greasy style how what you do 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.849
 pressure how do I know if I like it 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.570
 someone else see that it is much better 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.030
 style then 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.100
 than you know yourself is so funds 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.080
 your world you and you wouldn't actually 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.470
 busy telling 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.480
 the hassle bluntly 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.640
 really does stop a few time but 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.860
 then pint won a tooth from it 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.320
 previous drawing 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.150
 since Friday can be better this way 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.250
 nice to stop further otherwise is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.070
 would never stop working longer 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.070
 signs of being done with it
