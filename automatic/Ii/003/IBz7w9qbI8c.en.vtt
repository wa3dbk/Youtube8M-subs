00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.020
 between January and March the science and technology that we tried to 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.320
 maintain because without science and technology the product has no future 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.249
 that we always say here 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.999
 we are now with Julio Chávez and the president of the Peruvian society of 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:15.799
 hyperbaric medicine 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.249
 sending genomic heroin in this specialty 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.849
 has a detox zinc detoxification project 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.679
 transit Peru due to chronic carbon monoxide poisoning and 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.220
 toxic gases 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.720
 I will be so so also work in the manufacture of hyperbaric chambers 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.899
 anyway 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.200
 ip a will be in contact with the nasa to export lemon models of 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.910
 hyperbaric chambers an extraordinary thing 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.760
 all right 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.040
 July like goodnight so much to the downside 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 very grateful for the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.800
 invitation 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.359
 no thanks to you come 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.709
 how is what hyperbaric thing of unemployment is because they explain to our 

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:54.350
 public miss and mister ovarian 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.730
 it also involves the part of medicine your easter 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.090
 they intervene a lot 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.900
 fields of human activity 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.690
 starting with the warlike part for example submarine diving demolition 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.250
 Summary and Niger and Bianchi well 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.830
 however he fears the pressure a bit for a barometer very bad price and what 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.049
 that there goes the thing not 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.039
 piper lot mud Price 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.270
 it gives us a lot of pressure 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.670
 intervenes 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.990
 every time the human being breathes 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.689
 no respiratory god 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.180
 hoa and pignol 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.360
 at higher pressure than sea level 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.930
 mines 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.420
 efe inspect oil fields 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.750
 in the dedicated part in an underwater attack of a city museum 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.550
 war 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.960
 amphibian engineering exploration of sea beds 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.780
 in the sporting part 45 million sports cars in the world 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 is Cuba 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.270
 they all fall under 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.390
 the care let's say that argentina because percent and it will be as if this 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.440
 relationship with NASA to eventually cut off hyperbaric chambers 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.640
 the reality 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.359
 many of the medical technologies 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.439
 they have started with the war 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:17.380
 in most things or not as now photographers fired people 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.459
 these solar radios were all used but for war and after 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.219
 percent avoid deaths 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.659
 to help Algeria 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.729
 actually 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.769
 when we talk about nasa we talk 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.169
 Tibet trip 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.390
 in the space race of yuri gagarín 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.390
 from there it went to space because it was a hyperbaric bed 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:40.739
 personal 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.400
 that astronaut suit this point exactly if he had not been able to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.339
 give us arial is clear lyrics 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.199
 in the nasa he was investigating 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.079
 a lot of time 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.169
 all the related problems 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.429
 from prisons 2 to go to the tas 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.609
 that medical specialty that in Peru 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.109
 countries 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:08.039
 maybe that America that has the university specialty 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.489
 through something is not done and done and recognized by the medical school 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:14.399
 including with your doctor 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.199
 has taken a lot 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.799
 in the development 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.799
 at the beginning of the design development 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.369
 created a legislative technology 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:26.070
 already before 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.349
 Simit the boat 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.559
 what island oxygen therapy to prison 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:33.979
 because the oxygen tattoo option to the human being 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.779
 becomes a drug 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.729
 a drug that has more than 70 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:43.529
 in co-ownership of the cern some of them of those individuals reinvented the peru 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:44.819
 vs no 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.079
 nothing more this 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.329
 in the modern era of medicine that began as in the time of reaching 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.799
 freedom without cesc 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.389
 many researchers in the world 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.959
 by the way the guy more know the successes in the treatment and cameras 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.809
 hyperbaric well 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.809
 many diseases 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:07.669
 why 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.989
 as I say oxygen under pressure 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 is a drug the fruit region contains properties 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:14.989
 wonderful 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.259
 when we talk 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.139
 fox station 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.819
 toxic monster 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.080
 are people that the cnt are knowing 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.030
 here in Peru 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.419
 research 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.180
 is the reading a neighbor of height be 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.240
 We are exporting 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.020
 so much science in new york in london has already been published our works 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.020
 about that his height resignation is already sacrificed 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.669
 logically by a group of professionals that we have 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.349
 very small but we know much effort these last 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.270
 initially 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.909
 to take to Peru 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.309
 to a state really 

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:57.360
 I could tell you leadership in Latin America from the recording is very little 

00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:00.499
 support that he really imagined are aerobic jobs to 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.349
 I congratulate you again 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.499
 believes that as a manager they will suddenly export cameras to the United States and 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:07.479
 europe her 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:08.699
 why 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.289
 n have our jobs 2 we have strategic partners the former timely 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.960
 the giants of new york 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.110
 they are advisers to the adviser nasa de la fedea they were the ones who 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.849
 They exaggerated the technician who was exposed to burger king rye 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.629
 party in this field many years ago 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.300
 and have had the peru have seen our work we are not believer chong a lot 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.610
 very friends 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.909
 It is very collaborative 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.909
 and they have chosen us to develop together 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:44.050
 the activist his mind doctors work that will be discussed in the 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.319
 camera 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.490
 we are 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.360
 providing new technology for oxygen savings 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:53.099
 artana 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:55.599
 almost greater security 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.110
 taking advantage of the development of the Peruvian metallica metal industry that is 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.349
 very good 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:04.249
 with the technological contribution of them 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:08.509
 we will be able to in the future the Peruvian mechanical reel that is very good and that 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.749
 developed a lot lately based on mining development 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:13.530
 you have to remember it for you 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.860
 kimura altars of mining growth and it is not stimulated 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.990
 but before leaving strong by the two poles of development foreseen in the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.080
 cited plan that was planned asia term and xenophobia and also for 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.349
 eventually the sugar mills also 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:32.319
 well there were we have the mind of mathematician thank you very much and 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.430
 congratulations really strong extraordinary work in Peru too 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.240
 we have incredible things 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.319
 Kennedy as always extraordinary contributions or Romania and the crisis and 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.419
 technology 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:43.879
 you the opposite 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:47.330
 the following is the Peruvian society of piper ovarian medicine 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:48.710
 because as we say 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.860
 we always repeat once again in science and technology cross does not have 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.689
 future 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:54.019
 let's go a pause region
