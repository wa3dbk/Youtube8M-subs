00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.840
 in this video we are going to know the 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.850
 recording tests with the lumia 520 the 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.770
 low-end Nokia smartphone that 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.600
 arrived in Mexico recently and that 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.300
 we publish the analysis here in passion 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.000
 mobile the first video that we're going to see 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.640
 is inside is approximately your 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.440
 recorded at 5 o'clock in the afternoon as they can 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.560
 see has really some serious 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.380
 problems to compensate for the lack of light 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.360
 although in photographs and software 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.910
 aftercare that brings lumia 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.950
 does a very good job as you can see in 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.840
 the video really has too much noise 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.020
 of image I suppose you are using a 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.330
 floor of 200 or more and they really do not have 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.120
 good quality although it is even 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.680
 winnowing light of forgiveness does not support 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.630
 has lights does not have does not have the 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.059
 of support however really the 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.920
 quality does not give to record in this 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.470
 type but outside the situation 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.450
 change a lot as you can see this video 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.229
 it was recorded in the suburbs the city of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.180
 mexico has really see ya clouds what 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.650
 that was quite start the day without 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.149
 However, you can measure variations in 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.460
 compensation made by the phone 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.460
 automatically and in pretty quality 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.010
 1500 is hd video to 623 and really 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.620
 you can see good colors a good 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.650
 fit there that does it's way 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.070
 automatic we know the panning of a 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.660
 object close to a complete stage and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.940
 really how can you see the body of 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.410
 water the waves look very good without 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.290
 However, they are going to see a 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.350
 recorded video 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.870
 at night where it really looks already fatal 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.610
 the image and it really is not so dark 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.500
 as you can in other test videos 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.480
 of recording that we have published that 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.630

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.970
 I record but the 1,520 do not really do 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.040
