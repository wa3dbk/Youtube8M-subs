these<00:00:00.750> are<00:00:00.900> some<00:00:01.079> foods<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.439> do<00:00:01.680> not<00:00:01.829> have

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
these are some foods that do not have

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.980 
these are some foods that do not have
any<00:00:02.129> medium<00:00:02.669> chain<00:00:02.909> triglycerides<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.870> these

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
any medium chain triglycerides and these

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.630 
any medium chain triglycerides and these
are<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.259> most<00:00:04.410> common<00:00:04.799> oils<00:00:05.100> that<00:00:05.250> are<00:00:05.310> found

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
are the most common oils that are found

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.660 
are the most common oils that are found
in<00:00:05.910> our<00:00:06.569> typical<00:00:06.839> American<00:00:07.470> diet<00:00:07.500> so<00:00:08.309> even

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
in our typical American diet so even

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.549 
in our typical American diet so even
olive<00:00:09.030> oil<00:00:09.240> does<00:00:09.420> not<00:00:09.599> have<00:00:09.809> any<00:00:09.960> medium<00:00:10.320> chain

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
olive oil does not have any medium chain

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.499 
olive oil does not have any medium chain
triglyceride<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.639> fish<00:00:11.790> oil<00:00:12.030> doesn't

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
triglyceride in it and fish oil doesn't

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.650 
triglyceride in it and fish oil doesn't
if<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:13.500> if<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.830> take<00:00:14.370> coconut<00:00:14.820> oil<00:00:15.030> basically

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
if but if you take coconut oil basically

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.330 
if but if you take coconut oil basically
the<00:00:15.780> only<00:00:15.900> fat<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.650> missing<00:00:17.100> that<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the only fat that it's missing that you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.019 
the only fat that it's missing that you
need<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.880> omega-3<00:00:18.359> fatty<00:00:18.779> acids<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:20.340> it's<00:00:20.789> very

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
need is omega-3 fatty acids so it's very

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.830 
need is omega-3 fatty acids so it's very
important<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.630> take<00:00:22.199> fish<00:00:22.470> oil<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:23.449> eat<00:00:24.449> fish

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
important to take fish oil or eat fish

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.609 
important to take fish oil or eat fish
you<00:00:25.170> know<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.710> from<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.699> diet<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
you know to get that from the diet and

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.960 
you know to get that from the diet and
these<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.769> some<00:00:28.949> foods<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.640> medium

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
these are some foods that do have medium

these are some foods that do have medium
chain<00:00:30.240> fatty<00:00:30.510> acids<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.619> coconut<00:00:32.070> oils

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
number one on the list while MCT oil is

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.080 
medium chain it's deliberately made that
way<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.790> used<00:00:38.820> by

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
way and it's actually used by

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.690 
way and it's actually used by

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
time to increase lean body mass so you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.400 
time to increase lean body mass so you
can<00:00:45.030> find<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.629> health<00:00:45.840> food<00:00:46.050> stores

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
town as well as coconut oil but it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.360 
town as well as coconut oil but it's
also<00:00:59.910> found<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> milk<00:01:01.020> fat<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.649> mammals

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
also found in the milk fat of mammals

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.780 
also found in the milk fat of mammals
and<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.730> includes<00:01:03.120> humans<00:01:03.629> goats<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> cows

and that includes humans goats and cows
so<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.540> know<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> things<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.939> has

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so you know one of the things that has

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.380 
so you know one of the things that has
been<00:01:09.360> stressed<00:01:10.460> over<00:01:11.460> recent<00:01:11.909> years<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.360> that

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
been stressed over recent years is that

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.120 
been stressed over recent years is that
we<00:01:12.630> should<00:01:12.810> drink<00:01:12.990> low-fat<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.560> fat-free<00:01:13.590> milk

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
we should drink low-fat or fat-free milk

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.890 
we should drink low-fat or fat-free milk
well<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.299> you're<00:01:15.600> not<00:01:15.750> getting

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
well if you do that you're not getting

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
well if you do that you're not getting
any<00:01:16.170> medium<00:01:16.530> chain<00:01:16.799> triglycerides<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.640> your

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
any medium chain triglycerides in your

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.480 
any medium chain triglycerides in your
diet<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.020> probably<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.830> absorbing<00:01:20.280> calcium

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
diet and probably not absorbing calcium

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.289 
diet and probably not absorbing calcium
very<00:01:20.939> well<00:01:21.180> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.509> milk<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.140> know<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
very well from the milk you know so and

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.140 
very well from the milk you know so and
goat<00:01:24.840> milk<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.439> has<00:01:26.040> much<00:01:26.549> more<00:01:26.850> than

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
goat milk actually has much more than

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.109 
goat milk actually has much more than
cow<00:01:27.540> milk<00:01:27.570> does<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> when<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:29.970> talk

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
cow milk does in it and when they talk

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
cow milk does in it and when they talk
about<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> Mediterranean<00:01:31.020> diet<00:01:31.259> one<00:01:31.650> thing

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
about the Mediterranean diet one thing

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.440 
about the Mediterranean diet one thing
they<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.159> mention<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.790> country<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
they don't mention in this country is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
they don't mention in this country is
that<00:01:33.479> people<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.079> those<00:01:34.200> areas<00:01:34.590> during<00:01:34.740> goat

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that people in those areas during goat

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.660 
that people in those areas during goat
milk<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.430> lot<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.670> people<00:01:35.909> drink<00:01:36.060> goat<00:01:36.299> milk<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
milk a lot of people drink goat milk and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.330 
milk a lot of people drink goat milk and
maybe<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.439> thing<00:01:40.439> that's<00:01:41.009> part<00:01:41.310> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
maybe that's one thing that's part of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
maybe that's one thing that's part of
the<00:01:41.430> Mediterranean<00:01:42.000> diet<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.659> there

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the Mediterranean diet you know there

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.030 
the Mediterranean diet you know there
are<00:01:42.869> other<00:01:42.960> many<00:01:43.229> other<00:01:43.320> things<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
are other many other things in it you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.429 
are other many other things in it you
know<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.549> very<00:01:44.579> healthy<00:01:45.060> too<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
know that are very healthy too but that

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.889 
know that are very healthy too but that
might<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.710> one<00:01:46.920> one<00:01:47.759> important<00:01:48.600> thing<00:01:48.780> about

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
might be one one important thing about

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.929 
might be one one important thing about
it<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:49.920> should<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.700> as<00:01:53.700> far

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
it that we should think about so as far

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.030 
it that we should think about so as far
as<00:01:54.000> coconut<00:01:54.869> oil<00:01:56.000> any<00:01:57.000> part<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> coconut

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
as coconut oil any part of the coconut

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.109 
as coconut oil any part of the coconut
except<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> water<00:01:59.549> doesn't<00:01:59.880> really

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
except that the water doesn't really

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.709 
except that the water doesn't really
have<00:02:00.329> much<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.259> oil<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.369> any<00:02:02.820> but

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
have much of the oil in it if any but

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.609 
have much of the oil in it if any but
these<00:02:04.409> are<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.860> other<00:02:05.780> coconut<00:02:06.780> things

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
these are just some other coconut things

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
these are just some other coconut things
that<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.369> get<00:02:08.520> oil<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.420> know<00:02:09.509> from

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that you can do to get oil you know from

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
that you can do to get oil you know from
a<00:02:09.840> coconut<00:02:10.259> milk<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> loaded<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:11.039> coconut

a coconut milk is loaded with coconut
oil<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.410> get<00:02:13.500> medium

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

chain
sites<00:02:14.610> with<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.239> actually<00:02:15.540> very

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
sites with that and it's actually very

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.449 
sites with that and it's actually very
good<00:02:15.989> people<00:02:16.620> ask<00:02:16.799> me<00:02:16.920> about<00:02:16.950> coconut

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
good people ask me about coconut

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.460 
good people ask me about coconut
capsules<00:02:18.000> all<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.239> time<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.720> figured<00:02:19.349> that

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
capsules all the time I figured that

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.630 
capsules all the time I figured that
will<00:02:19.590> probably<00:02:19.829> be<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.129> questions<00:02:20.489> so

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
will probably be one of the questions so

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.009 
will probably be one of the questions so
I'll<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.970> go<00:02:21.120> ahead<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.510> address<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.989> now

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
I'll just go ahead and address it now

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.030 
I'll just go ahead and address it now
but<00:02:23.299> each<00:02:24.299> capsule<00:02:24.659> has<00:02:24.959> only<00:02:25.110> one<00:02:25.379> gram<00:02:25.709> and

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but each capsule has only one gram and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.660 
but each capsule has only one gram and
there's<00:02:26.189> 14<00:02:27.530> grams<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.829> a<00:02:28.920> tablespoon<00:02:29.340> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
there's 14 grams in a tablespoon of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.369 
there's 14 grams in a tablespoon of
coconut<00:02:29.879> oil<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.420> you'd<00:02:30.510> have<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.689> take<00:02:30.900> 14

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
coconut oil so you'd have to take 14

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.990 
coconut oil so you'd have to take 14
capsules<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.159> one<00:02:32.370> tablespoon<00:02:32.939> of

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
capsules to get one tablespoon of

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.030 
capsules to get one tablespoon of
coconut<00:02:33.269> oil<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:33.989> very<00:02:34.200> expensive<00:02:34.859> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
coconut oil so that's very expensive and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.319 
coconut oil so that's very expensive and
very<00:02:35.280> hard<00:02:35.609> thing<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.540> swallow<00:02:36.810> literally

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
very hard thing to swallow literally

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.410 
very hard thing to swallow literally
Steve<00:02:39.930> we<00:02:40.620> increased<00:02:41.189> him<00:02:41.489> over<00:02:41.819> time<00:02:42.060> you

Steve we increased him over time you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
Steve we increased him over time you
know<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.349> that<00:02:43.500> he<00:02:43.650> was<00:02:43.769> getting<00:02:44.069> it<00:02:44.220> at<00:02:44.760> least

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
know so that he was getting it at least

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.879 
know so that he was getting it at least
three<00:02:45.299> times<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.689> day<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.959> finally<00:02:46.200> four<00:02:46.620> times

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
three times a day and finally four times

three times a day and finally four times
a<00:02:47.069> day<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.599> he<00:02:48.599> we<00:02:48.810> measured<00:02:49.139> dr.<00:02:49.530> Veatch

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
a day and he we measured dr. Veatch

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.589 
a day and he we measured dr. Veatch
measured<00:02:50.370> his<00:02:50.579> ketone<00:02:50.970> levels<00:02:51.000> after<00:02:51.420> he

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
measured his ketone levels after he

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.039 
measured his ketone levels after he
coconut<00:02:52.319> oil<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> MCT<00:02:53.129> oil<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:53.629> with<00:02:54.629> coconut

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
coconut oil and MCT oil and with coconut

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.170 
coconut oil and MCT oil and with coconut
oil<00:02:55.079> his<00:02:55.739> level<00:02:56.129> of<00:02:56.190> ketones<00:02:56.549> peaked<00:02:56.819> at<00:02:56.970> about

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
oil his level of ketones peaked at about

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.030 
oil his level of ketones peaked at about
three<00:02:57.450> hours<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.079> they<00:02:58.470> were<00:02:58.560> still<00:02:58.739> hanging

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
three hours and they were still hanging

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.890 
three hours and they were still hanging
around<00:02:59.099> like<00:02:59.670> seven<00:03:00.000> or<00:03:00.090> eight<00:03:00.209> hours<00:03:00.569> later

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
around like seven or eight hours later

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.679 
around like seven or eight hours later
with<00:03:01.470> MCT<00:03:02.010> oil<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.639> ketone<00:03:03.060> level<00:03:03.359> was<00:03:03.450> higher

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
with MCT oil the ketone level was higher

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.440 
with MCT oil the ketone level was higher
but<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.200> peaked<00:03:04.439> at<00:03:04.650> 90<00:03:05.159> minutes<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.790> they

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
but it peaked at 90 minutes and they

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.410 
but it peaked at 90 minutes and they
were<00:03:06.510> gone<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:07.019> 3<00:03:07.290> hours<00:03:07.609> so<00:03:08.609> like<00:03:09.120> say<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
the rest of the day so we started adding

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.710 
the rest of the day so we started adding
it<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:20.040> his<00:03:20.160> diet<00:03:20.400> for<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:20.910> other<00:03:21.060> meals<00:03:21.359> to

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
try to keep ketones available to us

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.479 
try to keep ketones available to us
brain<00:03:23.579> 24/7<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:25.319> that's<00:03:25.500> why<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:25.859> do<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
brain 24/7 so that's why we do that and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.789 
brain 24/7 so that's why we do that and
then<00:03:26.639> you<00:03:27.629> know<00:03:27.720> coconut<00:03:28.139> oil<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.530> lauric

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
then you know coconut oil the lauric

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.140 
then you know coconut oil the lauric
acid<00:03:28.949> and<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.519> one<00:03:29.669> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.819> medium<00:03:30.120> chain

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
acid and it one of the medium chain

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.659 
acid and it one of the medium chain
triglycerides<00:03:31.019> has<00:03:31.230> antimicrobial

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
triglycerides has antimicrobial

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.250 
triglycerides has antimicrobial
antibacterial<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.930> type<00:03:34.109> of

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
antibacterial you know type of

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.589 
antibacterial you know type of
properties<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.190> and<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.299> there<00:03:36.449> are<00:03:36.510> other

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
properties to it and so there are other

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.300 
properties to it and so there are other
good<00:03:37.049> things<00:03:37.260> about<00:03:37.409> coconut<00:03:37.829> oil<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.129> that's

good things about coconut oil and that's
what<00:03:38.489> he<00:03:38.609> improved<00:03:38.970> with<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.480> first<00:03:39.659> place

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
what he improved with in the first place

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.199 
what he improved with in the first place
so<00:03:40.260> I've<00:03:40.680> always<00:03:40.889> been<00:03:41.129> leery<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.459> taking<00:03:42.090> that

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
so I've always been leery of taking that

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.030 
so I've always been leery of taking that
out<00:03:42.449> of<00:03:42.569> his<00:03:42.690> diet<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.079> substituting<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.859> with

out of his diet and substituting it with

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.719 
out of his diet and substituting it with
just<00:03:44.250> MCT<00:03:44.819> oil<00:03:46.159> so<00:03:47.159> this<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.639> a

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
just MCT oil so this is just a

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.610 
just MCT oil so this is just a
recommendation<00:03:47.909> for<00:03:48.599> how<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.780> start<00:03:49.169> you<00:03:49.470> know
