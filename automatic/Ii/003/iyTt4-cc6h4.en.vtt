00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.720
 how about friends how are they very good 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.620
 nights let's continue with the third 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.599
 video 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 of the lobster skin change 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.440
 Australian what I am showing you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.209
 right now 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.209
 is the exoskeleton 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.439
 the skin or the shell 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.340
 that left the lobster in this case is the 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.300
 carapace of the male lobster and how 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.809
 I told them 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.000
 the males usually have the pincers 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.690
 the edge of the tongs and we can 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.790
 give an account is red while 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.920
 the females are all blue 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.140
 Anyone could say I'm going, Jose Luis 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.650
 or those who do not know can you 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.790
 do it you're lying to us this is the 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.790
 dead lobster 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.360
 I'm going to show you where the lobster is 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.900
 so that we realize 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:11.010
 look at it is the male if realize 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.960
 they got even more robust their pincers 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.940
 and at this time it remains 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.980
 hidden precisely because its 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.860
 shell is very slow the female is 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.409
 I found look at the female and this one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.249
 It's the female 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.730
 and it is the shell that the male left 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:32.240
 let's realize that practically 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:35.330
 it is another lobster that leaves here 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.150
 we can appreciate that even let them 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.550
 mustaches that are what you use to 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.480
 detect if there is any predator or 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.940
 food nearby 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.940
 with these long whiskers see the 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.240
 is able to detect 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.240
 everything at your fingertips 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.330
 the legs leaves absolutely everything is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.610
 incredible to see this the only thing that not that 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.780
 the lobster is taken, obviously 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.009
 are the eyes that are the little black dots 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.450
 let's make the comparison with the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 female and there we can see the eyes 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 bright of the female 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.760
 is the only thing that practically takes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.730
 obviously all the internal apparatus of the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.830
 what is recorded but 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.800
 everything external because practically what 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.560
 leave intact 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.780
 and all that so we can 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.430
 distinguish what is this part 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.580
 obviously has no movement does not have 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.610
 lifetime 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.620
 and the eyes either does not count either 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.980
 with the eyes is something truly 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.349
 amazing 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.379
 for those who did not know about this 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.120
 theme is something wonderful that is 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.900
 makes with these sections skeletons that 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.209
 they are in the nature the lobsters are 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.500
 they eat them because it helps them is in 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.360
 actually all this is calcium is 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.239
 formed on the basis of calcium and 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.549
 lobsters help them if they eat it 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.950
 harden faster 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.250
 the skeleton that they have formed so they 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.730
 in a few moments more I will return this 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.709
 skeleton to the fish tank so to make it 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.000
 consumed by locusts both the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.660
 female as the male 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.790
 just to expand a little bit more the 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.360
 keeping these animals as 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.430
 I'm going to show you what the food 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.340
 This is a very economical food but 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.540
 very good I usually give it to lobsters 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.810
 it's a background food that like 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.239
 I commented directly 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.160
 goes to the bottom because the 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.950
 lobsters can dispose of it in the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.000
 moment here who want to see the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.240
 they are and are directly 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.740
 a few small portions what I'm going to 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.380
 to do is enter it in the fish tank to see 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.250
 if we can appreciate like the male 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.380
 I do not know if I'm going to consume it 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.080
 because the male in these moments like 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.440
 just changed skin now he is the 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.440
 weak 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.470
 and you might not dare to eat or 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:12.370
 if you have if you are really hungry 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.020
 Well, he will do it regularly in 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.070
 when they finish the meal they have a 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:20.130
 impressive sense of smell 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.680
 let's see there there this is coming 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.110
 the aroma to see if it is encouraged to consume the 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.610
 food and we can see then the male 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.410
 I hope we can make the comparison of 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.370
 videos and the male grown up 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.930
 considerably 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.949
 in this skin change 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.949
 see it see it 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.630
 is trying first to move away 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.550
 to the predators to which they are 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.550
 consuming the food 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.540
 good and surely in a while more 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.990
 and will return to consume the food by 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.910
 soon it remains in expectation 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.640
 surely the light 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.330
 of the video made that our 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.349
 Locust 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.449
 and there goes 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:08.180
 I'm not going to try very carefully 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:11.330
 move a lot to see if you manage to go by the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.630
 food is not going to stay in your 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.630
 place 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.289
 hidden 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.960
 and then we will not be able to see it 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:26.360
 consume the food right now what 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.360
 he is most concerned about being a refugee 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.730
 that feed not precisely because 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.280
 is now the weak individual of the 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.290
 fish tank since it has just been its change of 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.050
 skin and right now you have a skin 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.419
 very soft being the the get to touch 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.729
 I would be very careful and it is very 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.069
 sensitive right now at any stroke or 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.500
 Strong contact for what you prefer 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.990
 stay hidden subsequently 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.970
 I'm going to empty it, I'm going to throw it in that 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.060
 those areas its shell so that what 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.370
 consume and you can harden the one 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.699
 has but then practically this with 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.289
 this video I wanted to show you 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.289
 especially this image 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.280
 of the lobster let's go to flip 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.129
 the little bit to investigate a little bit 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.569
 how is it made 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.830
 you have to handle it very carefully 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.309
 I'm going to handle it very carefully 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.309
 not to 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.689
 so as not to destroy I observed 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.460
 only the skeleton what is left no longer 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.460
 it has nothing inside 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.820
 It is a true wonder 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.039
 hollow 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.039
 incredibly hollow 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.800
 and good for those who did not know this 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.620
 part of the lobsters and all those 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.039
 organisms that consist of this 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.039
 exoskeleton 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.440
 Well, I show you this marvel 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.960
 remember that lobster crabs 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.960
 prawns 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.050
 perform this activity 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:24.819
 and they do it periodically 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.279
 approximately as I told you in 

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:30.280
 previous videos as it is once a month 

00:07:27.279 --> 00:07:34.380
 or according to the size of the 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:37.140
 of the animal as it varies 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.700
 of this activity but it is incredible 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.640
 I the first time I saw a change of 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:46.360
 these already good already were 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:48.699
 some years I was very surprised 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.210
 I thought that my lobster already 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:51.210
 I had died 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:57.240
 but when we realize when we start 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.580
 investigate and study this issue because the 

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.650
 truth is that it is something wonderful good 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.660
 for now that's all they 

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:06.050
 I send a cordial greeting 

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.889
 my name is jose luis 

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.889
 see you later
