capabilities or capacities of the filler
needed<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:09.980> had<00:02:10.130> a<00:02:10.160> filling<00:02:10.490> speed

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
needed to be so we had a filling speed

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.790 
needed to be so we had a filling speed
we<00:02:11.090> had<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.210> fill<00:02:11.480> level<00:02:11.630> fill<00:02:12.020> accuracy<00:02:12.590> and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
we had a fill level fill accuracy and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.670 
we had a fill level fill accuracy and
from<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.820> point<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:14.900> decided<00:02:15.290> on<00:02:15.560> an

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
from that point we decided on an

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.550 
from that point we decided on an
automation<00:02:16.070> platform<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:16.959> Ross<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.320> had

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
automation platform and Ross and I had

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.860 
automation platform and Ross and I had
both<00:02:18.770> agreed<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.430> Rockwell<00:02:20.240> would<00:02:20.630> be<00:02:20.750> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
both agreed that Rockwell would be the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.580 
both agreed that Rockwell would be the
automation<00:02:21.320> platform<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.950> choice<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:24.410> this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
automation platform of choice in this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.620 
automation platform of choice in this
case<00:02:24.860> we<00:02:25.130> had<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.370> come<00:02:25.580> up<00:02:25.610> with<00:02:25.760> something

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
case we had to come up with something

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.410 
case we had to come up with something
that<00:02:26.840> would<00:02:27.770> take<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.220> technology<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.090> they

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
that would take the technology that they

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.630 
that would take the technology that they
had<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.750> their<00:02:29.900> big<00:02:30.110> fellers<00:02:30.530> scale<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.610> down

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
had and their big fellers scale it down
