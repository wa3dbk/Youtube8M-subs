my<00:00:10.940> large<00:00:11.940> like<00:00:12.809> Allosaurus<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.240> in

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
my large like Allosaurus I think it's in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.300 
my large like Allosaurus I think it's in
there<00:00:16.080> like<00:00:17.210> Soros<00:00:18.210> range<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.890> that's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
there like Soros range I think that's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.670 
there like Soros range I think that's
what<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.609> called<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:21.150> um<00:00:21.949> yeah<00:00:24.199> so<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
what it's called it um yeah so here it

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.570 
what it's called it um yeah so here it
is<00:00:26.720> but<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.930> some<00:00:28.109> reason<00:00:28.500> mine<00:00:29.099> doesn't<00:00:29.460> have

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
is but for some reason mine doesn't have

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.520 
is but for some reason mine doesn't have
the<00:00:29.849> articulated<00:00:30.779> jaw<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> other<00:00:32.579> kind

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
the articulated jaw is the other kind

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.680 
the articulated jaw is the other kind
which<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> sort<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.040> weird<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.579> i<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:36.149> i<00:00:36.300> still

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
which is sort of weird but i can i still

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.900 
which is sort of weird but i can i still
like<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.980> here's<00:00:39.410> um<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.670> guy

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
like this so here's um this little guy

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.340 
like this so here's um this little guy
right<00:00:41.940> here<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.489> i<00:00:44.670> said<00:00:44.910> he<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:46.020> big

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
right here and i said he is pretty big

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.959 
right here and i said he is pretty big
um<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:48.350> think<00:00:49.350> he's<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:51.920> mmm<00:00:52.920> i'd<00:00:53.219> say<00:00:53.550> 12

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
um I think he's about mmm i'd say 12

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.650 
um I think he's about mmm i'd say 12
inches<00:00:54.420> 13<00:00:55.140> inches<00:00:55.500> long<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.449> haven't<00:00:57.449> measured

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
inches 13 inches long I haven't measured

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
inches 13 inches long I haven't measured
him<00:00:58.020> yet<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.289> um<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.699> needs<00:01:00.180> about

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
him yet but um I think it needs about

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.469 
him yet but um I think it needs about
that<00:01:00.570> long<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:02.480> his<00:01:03.480> tail<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.700> really<00:01:05.700> long<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that long so his tail is really long and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.710 
that long so his tail is really long and
you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.560> definitely<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> detail<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
you can definitely see the detail on the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.649 
you can definitely see the detail on the
scales<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.670> muscles<00:01:12.210> I'm<00:01:13.200> led<00:01:14.659> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
scales and the muscles I'm led the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890 
scales and the muscles I'm led the
ridges<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.590> eyes<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.869> alter<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
ridges over the eyes and alter the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.850 
ridges over the eyes and alter the
scales<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.900> there's<00:01:21.900> no<00:01:22.080> parts<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
scales there and there's no parts of

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.420 
scales there and there's no parts of
this<00:01:22.920> goal<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.650> right

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
this goal that you can see that right

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.090 
this goal that you can see that right
here<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.100> eye<00:01:29.329> their<00:01:30.329> teeth<00:01:30.750> are

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
here and here on the eye their teeth are

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.690 
here and here on the eye their teeth are
done<00:01:32.509> particularly<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> they<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.869> stand<00:01:37.380> out

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
done particularly so they like stand out

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.870 
done particularly so they like stand out
and<00:01:38.869> they're<00:01:39.869> each<00:01:40.140> done<00:01:40.619> individually<00:01:41.009> each

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and they're each done individually each

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.120 
and they're each done individually each
single<00:01:42.750> tooth<00:01:44.899> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.079> see<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> veins<00:01:46.710> in

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
single tooth you can see the veins in

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.370 
single tooth you can see the veins in
the<00:01:47.340> neck<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:49.009> feet<00:01:50.009> are<00:01:50.310> done<00:01:50.490> really<00:01:50.939> well

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380
