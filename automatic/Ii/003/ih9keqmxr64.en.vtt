convinced<00:01:37.330> us<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.810> strain<00:01:38.080> that's<00:01:38.260> wrong<00:01:38.500> and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
convinced us the strain that's wrong and

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.610 
convinced us the strain that's wrong and
like<00:01:39.430> I<00:01:39.550> said<00:01:39.610> previously<00:01:39.940> the<00:01:40.900> broccoli

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
like I said previously the broccoli

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.810 
like I said previously the broccoli
we're<00:01:41.770> gonna<00:01:41.920> go<00:01:42.040> to<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.190> different<00:01:42.400> strain

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
we're gonna go to a different strain

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.140 
we're gonna go to a different strain
also<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:44.290> as<00:01:44.410> far<00:01:44.620> as<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:45.010> pole<00:01:45.460> beans<00:01:45.730> look

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
also but as far as the pole beans look

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.000 
also but as far as the pole beans look
at<00:01:46.270> this

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
at this

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.360 
at this
slow<00:01:48.010> slow<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.610> start<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.300> now<00:01:50.110> they<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
slow slow to start and now they the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.920 
slow slow to start and now they the
plants<00:01:51.729> have<00:01:51.820> just<00:01:51.970> gone<00:01:52.090> crazy<00:01:52.330> like<00:01:52.720> it's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
plants have just gone crazy like it's

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.640

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
right and their tenders could be really

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
crops in a year I guess it's time for a

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.770 
crops in a year I guess it's time for a
flop<00:04:21.600> but<00:04:22.200> thank<00:04:22.800> God<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.580> froze<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.180> lot<00:04:24.510> last

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.350 
flop but thank God I froze a lot last
year<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.200> over<00:04:25.560> killed<00:04:25.830> on<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.180> freezing<00:04:27.180> last

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
year we over killed on the freezing last

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.170 
year we over killed on the freezing last
year<00:04:27.690> so<00:04:27.900> if<00:04:28.590> we<00:04:28.740> get<00:04:28.890> a<00:04:28.919> really<00:04:29.280> bad<00:04:29.730> crop

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180
