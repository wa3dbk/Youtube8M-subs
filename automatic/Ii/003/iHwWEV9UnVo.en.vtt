00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you know the digital flasher where it

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.400 
you know the digital flasher where it
really<00:00:28.710> came<00:00:28.980> from<00:00:29.189> was<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> LCD<00:00:30.750> cameras

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
really came from was for the LCD cameras

really came from was for the LCD cameras
you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.579> are<00:00:32.700> already<00:00:33.059> displaying<00:00:33.630> an

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
you know we are already displaying an

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
image on on that screen so the idea came

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.229 
image on on that screen so the idea came
about<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.530> why<00:00:37.710> can't<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> same<00:00:38.820> thing

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
about is why can't you do the same thing

about is why can't you do the same thing
you're<00:00:39.360> doing<00:00:39.390> with<00:00:39.780> your<00:00:39.809> mechanical

flashers<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.649> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> hit<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> law<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.149> far

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
flashers we kind of hit it a law as far

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.060 
flashers we kind of hit it a law as far
as<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:48.780> could<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.350> know<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.710> display

add this feature you can add this
feature<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:54.960> took<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:56.280> where<00:00:56.789> we

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
feature and we took that or where we

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.599 
feature and we took that or where we
felt<00:00:57.239> was<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.809> far<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.109> we<00:00:58.289> could<00:00:58.410> go

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
felt was about as far as we could go

that's when the digital series kind of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
that's when the digital series kind of
came<00:01:02.520> out<00:01:02.640> when<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.120> digital<00:01:03.629> platform

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
came out when the digital platform

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
came out when the digital platform
products<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> showdowns<00:01:05.760> came<00:01:06.060> out

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
products like the showdowns came out

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
away just because of where we could go

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.100 
away just because of where we could go
with<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> possibilities<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.479> existed
