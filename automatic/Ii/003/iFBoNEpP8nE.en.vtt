00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
steering nozzle here's what we normally

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.610 
steering nozzle here's what we normally
see<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.970> reverse<00:02:38.239> gate<00:02:38.510> attached<00:02:38.989> to<00:02:39.350> the

a<00:02:42.470> little<00:02:42.620> bit<00:02:42.770> differently<00:02:43.100> let's<00:02:43.459> take<00:02:43.610> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
a little bit differently let's take a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.130 
a little bit differently let's take a
look<00:02:43.880> here<00:02:44.300> we<00:02:44.420> have<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.720> engine<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
look here we have the engine in the

out<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.450> nozzle<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:47.930> we<00:02:48.020> steer<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.410> nozzle

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
out the nozzle and we steer the nozzle

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.070 
out the nozzle and we steer the nozzle
as<00:02:48.920> normal<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:49.670> when<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.300> shift<00:02:50.540> into<00:02:50.750> the
