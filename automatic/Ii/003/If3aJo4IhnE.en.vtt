flash<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.820> if<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.390> open<00:02:00.630> here<00:02:03.560> we<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
flash and if we open here we get to the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.710 
flash and if we open here we get to the
battery<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.509> 2000<00:02:06.509> milliamps

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.510 

which<00:02:09.810> should<00:02:10.290> stay<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:10.830> nine<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.460> a<00:02:11.490> half

days in standby motors according to cats
so<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.170> close<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:18.030> make<00:02:18.330> sure<00:02:18.660> that

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
so if you close it really make sure that

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.060 
so if you close it really make sure that
it's<00:02:19.560> well<00:02:20.280> closed<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.480> completely<00:02:22.070> shut

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
it's well closed so it's completely shut

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.340 
it's well closed so it's completely shut

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.880 

further<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.530> still<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.980> then<00:02:32.190> these<00:02:33.890> easy

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
further we still have then these easy
