grille<00:00:27.300> on<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:28.170> four<00:00:28.470> models<00:00:28.880> this<00:00:29.880> is

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
grille on all four models this is

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.310 
grille on all four models this is
actually<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.449> sport<00:00:30.750> model<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.170> I've

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
actually a sport model that I've

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
actually a sport model that I've
selected<00:00:31.500> here<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.910> would<00:00:33.059> be

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
selected here so that would be

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.750 
selected here so that would be
technically<00:00:33.630> top-of-the-line

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
technically top-of-the-line

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it pretty much competes with the exclaim

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.350 
it pretty much competes with the exclaim
there's<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.250> few<00:00:38.430> separate<00:00:39.000> options

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360

an upgraded suspension system so it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.389 
an upgraded suspension system so it
handles<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.289> little<00:01:01.410> better<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> springs<00:01:02.250> are
