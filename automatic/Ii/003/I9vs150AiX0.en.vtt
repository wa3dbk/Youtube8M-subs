off<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.439> if

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
off that but actually you can because if

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.740 
off that but actually you can because if
you<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.189> Signet<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.570> get

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
you have the Signet up on you get

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.980 
you have the Signet up on you get
crystals<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.619> what's<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.729> very<00:01:45.030> good<00:01:45.270> let's

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
crystals and what's all very good let's

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.870 
crystals and what's all very good let's
check<00:01:46.229> some<00:01:46.439> crystal<00:01:47.189> price<00:01:47.310> real<00:01:47.520> quick<00:01:47.700> so

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
check some crystal price real quick so

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.899 
check some crystal price real quick so
you'd<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.149> getting<00:01:48.299> wind<00:01:48.689> crystals<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:50.130> those

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you'd be getting wind crystals and those

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389 
you'd be getting wind crystals and those
you're<00:01:51.090> selling<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.659> three<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.590> five<00:01:53.070> K

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
gold each and that can probably go up to

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.800 
gold each and that can probably go up to
like<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.139> hundred<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.620> buy<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.830> ton<00:05:06.070> of<00:05:06.099> them

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
like a hundred and you buy a ton of them

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.510 
like a hundred and you buy a ton of them
because<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.470> more<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.740> buy<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.919> higher<00:05:09.340> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
because the more you buy the higher the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.610 
because the more you buy the higher the
price<00:05:09.699> goes<00:05:09.970> but<00:05:10.210> still<00:05:10.570> um<00:05:11.110> let's<00:05:11.440> say<00:05:11.590> I

bought you're gonna need what is it it's

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.230 
bought you're gonna need what is it it's
12<00:05:16.750> times<00:05:17.970> 4

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
12 times 4

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.050 
12 times 4
you're<00:05:20.199> gonna<00:05:20.349> need<00:05:20.440> like<00:05:20.650> 48<00:05:21.130> that<00:05:21.580> my<00:05:21.880> maths

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
you're gonna need like 48 that my maths

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.649 
you're gonna need like 48 that my maths
correct<00:05:22.860> 48<00:05:23.860> copper<00:05:24.190> or<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.610> that's<00:05:25.389> less

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
correct 48 copper or and that's less

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.110 
correct 48 copper or and that's less
than<00:05:25.690> like<00:05:26.080> it's<00:05:26.650> less<00:05:26.830> than<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:27.039> thousand<00:05:27.460> gold

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
than like it's less than a thousand gold

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.570 
than like it's less than a thousand gold
for<00:05:28.720> those<00:05:29.470> 48<00:05:29.979> so<00:05:31.889> let's<00:05:32.889> do<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.130> math<00:05:33.190> let's

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
for those 48 so let's do the math let's

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.430 
for those 48 so let's do the math let's
say<00:05:33.789> we<00:05:33.940> bought<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.330> fire<00:05:34.630> crystal<00:05:34.780> say<00:05:35.139> it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
say we bought the fire crystal say it

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.990 
say we bought the fire crystal say it
was<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.650> highest<00:05:36.039> price<00:05:36.280> in<00:05:36.310> that<00:05:36.520> market<00:05:36.909> it
