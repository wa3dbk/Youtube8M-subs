00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.940
 a man of 25 years was arrested in the 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.799
 Brussels airport to be transported 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.589
 over 4 kilos of cocaine however not 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:16.349
 you wait what is going to happen this 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.750
 person who had already been arrested and who 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.699
 he was being imputed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 charges for the crime he had committed 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.570
 that would surely happen as 20 or 25 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.519
 years in prison was released 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.330
 spontaneously because there was no 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.160
 no translator to tell you which 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.880
 they were their sorrows in their language 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 this person could not understand what he 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.630
 they were saying spoke a variety of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.480
 Portuguese called Brazilian Portuguese a 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.150
 language the truth that they did not dominate in 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 that area so that as they could not 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.910
 tell him the charges of his crime then 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.830
 they had to release him according to the law 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 as you can see is a legal vacuum 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.830
 important this person just be 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.370
 released after being accused 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.560
 to steal four kilos of drugs 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.770
 The first thing he did was to take the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.450
 airport and return to your home country as well 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:20.000
 that they can not do anything to you anymore 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.490
 you know throughout history and to day 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.890
 Today, especially, there is a 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.320
 pile of legal empty legal vacuums 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.810
 that allow people to do what 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.670
 they feel like what many say 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.310
 it happened to this man he simply 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.640
 it's a stroke of luck but what 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.730
 truth is I do not understand how 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.150
 can free a person who knows 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.800
 who has four kilos of drug 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.280
 simply because there is no other person 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.230
 that is able to communicate to you that it will go 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.170
 to jail in your language 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.450
 I do not know, I do not know how the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.690
 laws in brussels but if I can tell you 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.090
 that are not well done and if they are not 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.730
 well done in brussels imagine how 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.100
 will be in other places because there 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.200
 countries in the world in which 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.590
 sincerely the drug circulates as 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.900
 wants 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.900
 there are lots of drug gangs 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.000
 who are making money without anyone 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.709
 prevent it 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.370
 incredible but true a person who 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.160
 was released despite knowing that 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.160
 I was carrying 4 kilograms of cocaine 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.160
 transported
