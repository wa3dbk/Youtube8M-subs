that I want to say is that these things

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.880 
that I want to say is that these things
are<00:00:17.310> taking<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> while<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.480> I'm<00:00:19.289> trying<00:00:19.740> to

get them up in myself but it's just so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
get them up in myself but it's just so
difficult<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.730> rarity<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.480> much

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
difficult because the rarity is much

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.660 
difficult because the rarity is much
more<00:00:24.990> rare<00:00:25.289> as<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.529> can<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.859> I've<00:00:26.130> been<00:00:26.369> using

more rare as you can see I've been using

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.029 
more rare as you can see I've been using
a<00:00:27.199> combination<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.680> couldn't

like I kept going getting checks

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.080 
like I kept going getting checks
thermally<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.600> just<00:01:03.600> couldn't<00:01:03.899> get<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
breeding or Talent Search timer I think

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.340 
breeding or Talent Search timer I think
is<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> 11<00:01:11.189> hours<00:01:11.520> 59<00:01:12.420> minutes<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.049> 59

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
is that 11 hours 59 minutes and 59

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.200 
is that 11 hours 59 minutes and 59
seconds<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.490> haven't<00:01:14.700> been<00:01:14.909> getting

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.539 
seconds but I just haven't been getting
that<00:01:15.540> timer<00:01:16.500> I've<00:01:16.799> been<00:01:17.009> getting<00:01:17.280> some<00:01:17.430> other

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that timer I've been getting some other

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
that timer I've been getting some other
timer<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
timer but you know we know the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.749 
timer but you know we know the
combination

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
combination

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
combination
you<00:01:21.060> know<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> combinations<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.259> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you know the combinations because you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.429 
you know the combinations because you
just<00:01:22.530> solved<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.920> combination<00:01:23.670> oh<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
just solved the combination oh there it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:25.820 
just solved the combination oh there it
is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

I<00:01:32.250> wasn't<00:01:33.180> planning<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.950> is

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
I wasn't planning that so this is

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.480 
I wasn't planning that so this is
extremely<00:01:35.700> lucky<00:01:36.530> I'm<00:01:37.530> pretty<00:01:37.829> sure<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.310> is
