Bissonette strain to Willoughby I'll
start<00:00:46.859> by<00:00:46.949> playing<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.339> for<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:56.179> seems<00:00:57.179> kind

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
start by playing it for you seems kind

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.639 
start by playing it for you seems kind
of<00:00:57.449> confusing<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.050> there's<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.379> going

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
of confusing because there's a lot going

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.899 
of confusing because there's a lot going
on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.979> sticks<00:00:59.219> are<00:00:59.339> moving<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.640> over<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
on the sticks are moving all over the

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:00.469 
on the sticks are moving all over the
toms

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
toms

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.450 
toms
but<00:01:00.780> these<00:01:00.960> Tom<00:01:01.289> grooves<00:01:01.679> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.159> actually

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
but these Tom grooves you can actually

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.579 
but these Tom grooves you can actually
break<00:01:02.639> down<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.210> most<00:01:03.389> foundational

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
break down into the most foundational

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.350 
break down into the most foundational
pattern<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.739> really<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.640> take<00:01:06.150> away

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pattern and really if I just take away

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
pattern and really if I just take away
all<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.020> Tom's<00:01:07.440> and<00:01:07.740> play<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
all of the Tom's and play it like a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.950 
all of the Tom's and play it like a
regular<00:01:08.310> drumbeat<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> right<00:01:09.299> stick<00:01:09.540> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
regular drumbeat with my right stick on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.539 
regular drumbeat with my right stick on
the<00:01:10.079> hi-hat<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.469> left<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> snare<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.430> get

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the hi-hat and left on the snare you get

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:30.139 
the hi-hat and left on the snare you get
this<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.219> sticking<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.789> is<00:01:29.939> right

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
this so the sticking of that is right

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.609 
this so the sticking of that is right
left<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.689> left<00:01:30.899> left<00:01:31.289> right<00:01:31.469> left

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.080 

now<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.830> create<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.280> beat<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.790> move<00:01:55.939> the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
now to create this beat you move the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.969 
now to create this beat you move the
right<00:01:56.240> stick<00:01:56.299> from<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.930> hi-hat<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.530> we'll

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
right stick from the hi-hat and we'll

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.490 
right stick from the hi-hat and we'll
put<00:01:58.159> it<00:01:58.280> on<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.670> low<00:01:59.330> Tom<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.930> I'll<00:02:00.200> play<00:02:00.380> it

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.529 

and<00:02:05.540> then<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.530> next<00:02:06.770> step<00:02:06.950> is<00:02:07.159> after<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.300> two

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and then the next step is after the two

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.740 
and then the next step is after the two
with<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.170> left<00:02:09.380> stick<00:02:09.590> I'm<00:02:10.100> gonna<00:02:10.280> play<00:02:10.750> your
