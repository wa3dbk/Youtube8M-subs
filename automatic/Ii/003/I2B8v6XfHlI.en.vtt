just going to do this while I watch TV
you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.840> if<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.170> zoom<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:44.399> coriander

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
you can see if you zoom in the coriander

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.200 
you can see if you zoom in the coriander
seeds<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> what<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:47.340> just<00:00:47.370> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.700> do<00:00:47.940> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
seeds so what I'm just going to do is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.369 
seeds so what I'm just going to do is
pull<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:50.329> I'm<00:00:51.329> sure<00:00:51.690> there's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.050> better

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
pull these off I'm sure there's a better

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.040 
pull these off I'm sure there's a better
way<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.250> than<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.090> manually<00:00:54.570> but

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
way to do it than to do it manually but

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.700 
way to do it than to do it manually but
you<00:00:55.469> know<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:56.460> time<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.440> that's<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.620> I'm

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

you know I have time so that's what I'm
going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.780> then<00:01:00.780> i<00:01:01.260> think<00:01:01.620> i'm<00:01:01.770> going

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
going to do and then i think i'm going

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.240 
going to do and then i think i'm going
to<00:01:01.949> take<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:03.059> guy<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.010> replant<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:06.049> had

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
to take this guy and replant it I had

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.730 
to take this guy and replant it I had
another<00:01:08.250> container<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:11.330> cilantro<00:01:12.500> started<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
another container of cilantro started a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.460 
another container of cilantro started a
month<00:01:14.430> ago<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.090> some<00:01:15.420> creature<00:01:15.869> ate

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
month ago but some creature ate

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.399 
month ago but some creature ate
everything<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> I'm<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.720> try<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.020> start

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
everything so I'm going to try to start

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.060 
everything so I'm going to try to start
another<00:01:19.619> container<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:21.560> i<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.860> show<00:01:23.040> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
another container and i want to show you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.030 
another container and i want to show you
quickly<00:01:23.460> what<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:28.040> coriander

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
quickly what I do with the coriander

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.480 
quickly what I do with the coriander
seeds<00:01:29.549> before<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.060> plant<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
seeds before I plant it so this is the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.640 
seeds before I plant it so this is the
intact<00:01:37.700> cilantro<00:01:38.700> seed<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.360> coriander<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.500> if

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
intact cilantro seed or coriander and if

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.389 
intact cilantro seed or coriander and if
you<00:01:40.770> crack<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:43.340> these<00:01:44.340> are

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you crack it you can see these are

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
you crack it you can see these are
hollow<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.299> let's<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.840> find<00:01:46.320> if

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
hollow but let's see if I can find if

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.530 
hollow but let's see if I can find if
you<00:01:47.369> crack<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.030> you'll<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:48.329> something

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you crack it up and you'll see something

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.600 
you crack it up and you'll see something
like<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:49.020> there's<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:50.329> membrane<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:52.710> top

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
like this there's like a membrane on top

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.690 
like this there's like a membrane on top
and<00:01:53.790> under<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.049> seeds<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and under here is the seeds and if you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.590 
and under here is the seeds and if you
crack<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.210> even<00:01:57.780> more<00:01:58.430> you'll<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.000> seeds

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
crack it even more you'll get the seeds

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.880 
crack it even more you'll get the seeds
which<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.759> here's<00:02:02.759> cilantro<00:02:03.570> seeds<00:02:03.890> now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
which I think here's cilantro seeds now

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.010 
which I think here's cilantro seeds now
I<00:02:04.920> don't<00:02:05.130> think<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.549> need<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> crack<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.540> quite

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I don't think you need to crack it quite

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.430 
I don't think you need to crack it quite
that<00:02:07.049> much<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:09.140> split<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.760> coriander

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that much but if you split the coriander

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.640 
that much but if you split the coriander
in<00:02:14.190> 22<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.710> plant<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:18.690> germination<00:02:19.230> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
in 22 and plant that the germination is

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.320 
in 22 and plant that the germination is
supposed<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> be<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.790> bit<00:02:21.030> better

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
supposed to be a little bit better

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.440 
supposed to be a little bit better
because<00:02:21.720> basically<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.800> seeds<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:24.630> little

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
because basically the seeds the little

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.290 
because basically the seeds the little
cilantro<00:02:27.450> plant<00:02:28.080> needs<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.860> crack<00:02:29.310> out<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
cilantro plant needs to crack out of the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.720 
cilantro plant needs to crack out of the
shell<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.960> if<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> cracking<00:02:32.100> for<00:02:32.580> it

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
shell so if you do the cracking for it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.900 
shell so if you do the cracking for it
before<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.180> plant<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.470> does<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:34.950> little<00:02:35.640> bit

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
before you plant it it does a little bit

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.770 
before you plant it it does a little bit
better<00:02:36.320> so<00:02:37.320> what<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.530> usually<00:02:37.800> do<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.750> get<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
better so what I usually do is get a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.980 
better so what I usually do is get a
whole<00:02:40.110> bunch<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.710> these<00:02:41.100> coriander<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.330> i

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
whole bunch of these coriander and i

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.400 
whole bunch of these coriander and i
crack<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:44.040> two<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.550> I<00:02:45.090> put<00:02:45.600> a<00:02:45.840> couple<00:02:46.170> of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
crack it into two and I put a couple of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.080 
crack it into two and I put a couple of
those<00:02:46.620> halves<00:02:47.070> into<00:02:47.490> each<00:02:48.260> hole<00:02:49.370> when<00:02:50.370> i<00:02:50.400> plant

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
those halves into each hole when i plant

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.820 
those halves into each hole when i plant
the<00:02:51.770> coriander<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:54.510> took<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:54.900> little<00:02:55.410> bit<00:02:55.770> of

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the coriander it took a little bit of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
the coriander it took a little bit of
time<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.730> got<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> good<00:02:58.430> amount<00:02:59.430> of

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
time but I got a good amount of
