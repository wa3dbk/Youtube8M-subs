00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.000
 Restart the PC to apply 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.670
 correctly the topics that we are going to 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.950
 install as the first subject he 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.020
 I'm just going to show you how to install 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.290
 one 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.480
 and basically we are web are very good 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.240
 all the topics and the topic that most 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.240
 liked is this the razer red ok 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.890
 brings you an application that is called 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:57.660
 vindicable we are going to extract it ok this 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.060
 application is not 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.690
 the application not what it does is 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.940
 deactivate the bars here 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.450
 as you can see in windows 8 it brings you 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.970
 by default and then on this topic 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.460
 it looks white and it's a dark theme 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.280
 black and therefore it looks a bit ugly and 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.490
 that's why it brings this application that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.040
 call rave a dissimulation ok let's go 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.380
 execute any of them for example 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.240
 I already have activated and if I want to go back 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.470
 to activate it only active in en able 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:34.140
 redmon export ok and if you have 64 bits 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.990
 activate this approach and it is only for this 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.860
 for this topic ok is nothing of the other 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.450
 world is not going to break any kind of 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.750
 file this one 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.110
 this application ok you can reverse it 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.110
 again if you do not like it ok done this 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.050
 We are going to leave 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.020
 or are we going to copy these folders ok let's go 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.060
 to select the root folder 8 and 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:04.940
 we are also going to select the file 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:08.620
 root r8 ok let's copy 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.210
 copy and let's go to the local disk of 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.980
 windows 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.609
 the resort 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.160
 times and in this folder I can as 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.049
 see I already have the theme installed but I'm going 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.180
 to do it again do not worry ok 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.190
 let's do right click or 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.530
 control well and paste 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210
 ok will you ask me to replace all the 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.760
 destination files I'm going to say that if a 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.610
 you are not going to ask for anything 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.650
 replace and will ask me to provide 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.820
 planned administrative we are going to 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.650
 tell him yes 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.260
 and do everything for all the elements 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.740
 current and we can continue and we will 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.300
 start copying and I've done this to 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.529
 we already have basically 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:57.159
 installed the theme is worth 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.159
 it's that simple easy ok 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.530
 the installation of simple for all the 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.780
 of passion also comes with his patch is 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.100
 the same as the other because we're going to leave 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.260
 For example, it is included here with 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.300
 font not as you can find 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.730
 they have a font they apply to the 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.460
 font font apart we're also going to 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.910
 go to copy the time obviously we 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.060
 it has to be the passion file that is 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.270
 a point time file and its folder 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.300
 passion or your folder where your 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.030
 files with the shorts because it's like that 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:40.410
 simple installation of the themes all 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.890
 they are the same, it's worth a difference 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.330
 but nothing of the other world some 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.450
 applications that we must copy by 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.700
 example this is to copy the explorer 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.210
 frame of it but I recommend that what 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.910
 copy 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.419
 ok could corrupt the files ok 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.150
 so let's apply a theme we're going to 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:04.330
 go to customize and as you can see 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.979
 Here are the themes installed the themes 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.590
 predetermined ok this are the themes 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.599
 installed and we are going to apply the 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.430
 issue that we just installed that would be 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.430
 the root the rest 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:29.990
 or that I think often scare me 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:34.160
 to the area 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:37.210
 along with seriously it almost gives me a tone 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.210
 people like that 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.430
 I hope I have not scared them 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.760
 nothing at all 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:51.230
 we apply the theme and as you can see us 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.080
 has absolutely modified all of them 

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.710
 the archives and as you may notice they come 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:00.320
 with sounds included ok as you can see 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:04.300
 to change our buttons 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.300
 to close and those 12 buttons 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.170
 apart from that we can also notice 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.620
 let's lower the volume of this blowjob 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:14.230
 because I do not want to have a heart attack 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.400
 OK 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.400
 I hope not 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.389
 to get to know the folder and how can 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.000
