00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello and welcome people too 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.059
 a new video on our channel and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.070
 Although it is a review today 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.070
 gaming headset is that triton 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.970
 you can use it on your ps3 ps 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:27.689
 vita but of course also here thanks to the 3 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.849
 5 millimeter jack to yours 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.540
 connect mobile phone and thus, of course 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.390
 We also call first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 short to the packaging 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 Here you see, I already have it 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.379
 everything unpacked you can open and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.870
 Here is the headset then stowed well 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.789
 as well as all the cables you for the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 we need installation 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.289
 next time for the processing of the 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.300
 Headsets and I think for the price 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.699
 the amazon at the moment at 50 euro 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.620
 is surprisingly good 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.110
 because you can only hear it for a moment 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.320
 I'll shake it for a moment 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:11.430
 the merck really that rattle and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.010
 rattles a bit but that is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.080
 nothing compared to the beats that yes 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 actually should be high quality was the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 cost to the 200 euro 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.830
 Now you can hear here how it works 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.320
 The quality for me is really good 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.850
 it is also extremely well padded here 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 the upholstery on the ear are 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.630
 really nice and soft 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 it's also movable so you can do it 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.990
 turn in all directions and of course 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:42.119
 also on the head size adjust so 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.820
 much to process now we come to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.390
 sound I think that for 1 50 euro 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.420
 headset not perfect but good 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.530
 I think it is relatively good sound 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.259
 it's a small one, of course 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.290
 background noise available but what 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.530
 not heard in the game is the sound 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.659
 Sounds full but with music well it works 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.130
 but of course it's a gaming headset 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.770
 and I'm only the beats won 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.730
 Of course that is something completely different 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.370
 Well, now we come to the microphone 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.330
 Of course, this is also included 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.390
 Truphone you can then just here 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.209
 push it into the headset and then ever 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.209
 after how it just wanted to have it 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.209
 adjust 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.400
 The microphone is similar to the sound of 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.170
 headset in chat you heard noise but 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.610
 the sound is really for 50 euro 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.799
 would have been perfectly okay yes we will 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.599
 Also to connect how to do the part 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.970
 join again your own video 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.730
 but I can give you a quick 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.260
 show the little bit what is included 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.670
 becomes 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.379
 Here is a brief description of how to 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.709
 simply connect the two cinch 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.230
 Plug plug into the TV 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.170
 push connect with usb and that 's it 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.090
 already it is really simply the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.409
 to join 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.659
 I guess I might even 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.190
 Today or tomorrow the video for 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.409
 connect after upload 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.829
