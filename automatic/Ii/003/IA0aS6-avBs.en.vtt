00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.440
 asceticism we wanted to start this new 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.809
 column in which we chat a little 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.510

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.059
 It happens 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.880
 what we think of it and seeing that we are 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.500
 gourmet hungry tenacity to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.680
 what shall we say in this reason day 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.159
 ramsey a bee set aside a team 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 from the network 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.350
 then the first product we go to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.540
 Review this is the mushroom row 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 porcini which is new this year 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.869
 it was time not just released I believe 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.210
 I found it at the supermarket 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.250
 this summer they bought it, let's stop it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.960
 and eager curious that they found in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.720
 somehow the pointed grease in the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.420
 boy really a gem and let's do it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.250
 a name however show great idea 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 here micro I would like to make it tasted the 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.850
 countess and therefore says dairy 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.369
 spreads based on pasteurized milk 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.930
 and milk cream with preparation of 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.000
 porcini mushrooms and that means 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.549
 parsley thickener correctors of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.860
 acidity on lemon co roma to jesus 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.710
 I do n't like kadima but the juice of 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.690
 squeezed lemon 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:02.540
 so cool to see her at home I don't 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.090
 like it is not green second green 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.040
 mushrooms not only to follow know 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.690
 charlie philadelphia are not in a row 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.690
 then take yes 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:37.019
 so can not say as I like the plan 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.019
 zuccoli a little fast I hear of mushrooms 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.959
 between mass one day alone 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.360
 better accompanied really black then 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:58.630
 100 euro no one is there for water 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.340
 shit what I certainly saw right there 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.470
 generosity to mario 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.810
 philadelphia for me is a kind of 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.890
 but this cheese soon tires 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.180
 normal final prediction you can 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:19.780
 match lots of things in more than 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:22.540
 person from 1 to 5 to 5 I give not two 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.680
 because honestly the taste and aftertaste 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.440
 which leaves in the mouth 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.380
 I don't like it ready if you enjoy them 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.180
 perfect ability and feed well well yes 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.190
 goes well with bread for now alone 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.730
 I think it's a bit acid like the kind of 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.350
 family 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 I think it is a little product he will not have 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.639
 very long life my vote is a 3 e 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.430
 half because anyway like this I don't 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.489
 always sorry but then said to 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.170
 something else the decisive word of 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.170
 this product is all 8 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.940
