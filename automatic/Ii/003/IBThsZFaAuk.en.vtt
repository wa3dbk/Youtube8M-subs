00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
some point all or nothing seems to be

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.910 
some point all or nothing seems to be
the<00:03:39.090> strategy<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.660> really<00:03:39.989> admire<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.739> I'm

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
the strategy and I really admire it I'm

the strategy and I really admire it I'm
not<00:03:41.160> sure<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.519> could<00:03:41.700> do<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:41.850> myself<00:03:41.970> but

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
not sure if I could do it myself but

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.699 
not sure if I could do it myself but
it's<00:03:42.720> definitely<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.049> lot<00:03:43.140> of<00:03:43.170> fun<00:03:43.350> but<00:03:43.470> if<00:03:43.590> you

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
it's definitely a lot of fun but if you

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.140 
it's definitely a lot of fun but if you
get<00:03:43.890> back<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.459> big<00:03:44.610> money<00:03:44.760> right<00:03:45.030> now
