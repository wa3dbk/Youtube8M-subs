00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
areas you can move and still act if you

move into the orange areas it's a sprint

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.210 
move into the orange areas it's a sprint
counts<00:03:29.940> as<00:03:30.030> both<00:03:30.209> actions<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.410> cannot<00:03:31.889> act

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
counts as both actions you cannot act

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.490 
counts as both actions you cannot act
and<00:03:32.459> then<00:03:32.579> move<00:03:32.849> so<00:03:33.329> very<00:03:33.900> similar<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.409> games

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
and then move so very similar to games

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.280 
and then move so very similar to games
like<00:03:34.799> XCOM<00:03:38.659> this<00:03:39.659> guy<00:03:39.810> right<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:39.989> has<00:03:40.230> a

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
like XCOM this guy right here has a

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.259 
like XCOM this guy right here has a
special<00:03:40.680> ability<00:03:40.769> lets<00:03:41.159> him<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.519> extra<00:03:42.120> damage

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
special ability lets him do extra damage

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.140 
special ability lets him do extra damage
but<00:03:42.720> at<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.900> cost<00:03:43.109> of<00:03:43.430> attack<00:03:44.430> chance<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.030> he

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
but at the cost of attack chance so he

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.199 
but at the cost of attack chance so he
might<00:03:45.359> hit<00:03:45.900> harder<00:03:46.260> but<00:03:46.349> less<00:03:46.530> often<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:47.220> think

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
might hit harder but less often I think

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.819 
might hit harder but less often I think
I'm<00:03:48.299> actually<00:03:48.389> gonna<00:03:48.659> sprint<00:03:49.260> into<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.560> better

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
I'm actually gonna sprint into a better
