this<00:00:00.810> is<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> block<00:00:01.290> of<00:00:01.319> trees<00:00:01.680> one<00:00:01.979> of<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.250> one

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
this is a block of trees one of the one

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.420 
this is a block of trees one of the one
of<00:00:02.790> the<00:00:02.879> box<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.360> trees<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.629> Victor<00:00:04.430> budded

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
of the box of trees that Victor budded

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.400 
of the box of trees that Victor budded
when<00:00:05.609> he<00:00:05.759> was<00:00:05.910> here<00:00:06.120> back<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.600> August<00:00:07.140> last

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
when he was here back in August last

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.629 
when he was here back in August last
year<00:00:07.919> and<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.179> just<00:00:09.450> stopped<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:10.250> to<00:00:11.250> check<00:00:11.429> on

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
year and I just stopped to to check on

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.530 
year and I just stopped to to check on
the<00:00:11.759> buds<00:00:12.530> see<00:00:13.530> how<00:00:13.710> they<00:00:13.889> look<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.429> I'll<00:00:15.240> show

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
the buds see how they look and I'll show

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.580 
the buds see how they look and I'll show
it<00:00:15.570> to<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.619> recall<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.490> were<00:00:18.590> slipped

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
it to you if you recall you were slipped

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.700 
it to you if you recall you were slipped
slicing<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.220> bark<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.760> he<00:00:21.720> cut<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.170> bud<00:00:22.470> off

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
slicing the bark and he cut that bud off

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.120 
slicing the bark and he cut that bud off
of<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.330> chute<00:00:24.330> just<00:00:24.990> sliced<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> bud<00:00:25.619> off<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
of a chute just sliced the bud off and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.939 
of a chute just sliced the bud off and
slip<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.490> under<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.789> bark<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.449> cut<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
slip it under the bark and cut up and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.950 
slip it under the bark and cut up and
then<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> cross<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.760> across<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> top<00:00:30.750> and

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
then you cross that across the top and

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.840 
then you cross that across the top and
it<00:00:31.050> looks<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.500> letter<00:00:31.679> T<00:00:32.570> so<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:35.670> way<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it looks like the letter T so the way I

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.869 
it looks like the letter T so the way I
rock<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.719> opened<00:00:37.489> certainly<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> hold<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
rock that I opened certainly I hold the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.110 
rock that I opened certainly I hold the
blade<00:00:39.090> open<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:40.140> there<00:00:40.350> those<00:00:40.800> flaps<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.579> little

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
blade open up there those flaps a little

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.930 
blade open up there those flaps a little
bit<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:44.120> allows<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:46.399> bud<00:00:47.399> slip<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
bit and that allows for that bud slip in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.500 
bit and that allows for that bud slip in
here<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.329> gonna<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.809> slowly<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:51.300> get

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
here and I'm gonna do this slowly we get

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.270 
here and I'm gonna do this slowly we get
pretty<00:00:51.750> quick<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.770> order<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.039> show

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
pretty quick at it but in order to show

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.939 
pretty quick at it but in order to show
you<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> buds<00:00:54.719> inserted<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.739> that's

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you the buds inserted and then that's

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
you the buds inserted and then that's
tied<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.660> budding<00:00:57.660> strip<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.199> rubber

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
tied with a budding strip a rubber

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.420 
tied with a budding strip a rubber
budding<00:00:59.340> strip<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.129> take<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
budding strip and then we take the

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810 
budding strip and then we take the
budding<00:01:02.730> strip<00:01:03.710> start<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> top<00:01:05.070> if<00:01:05.339> start<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
budding strip start the top if start the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.330 
budding strip start the top if start the
bottom<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:07.020> sometimes<00:01:07.350> cause<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.159> bud

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
bottom you can sometimes cause that bud

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.940 
bottom you can sometimes cause that bud
to<00:01:08.520> skid<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> slot<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:09.990> start<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
to skid out for the slot so start the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.570 
to skid out for the slot so start the
top<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.640> lock<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.270> band<00:01:12.510> down<00:01:12.799> one<00:01:13.799> two

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
top and lock that band down one two

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.899 
top and lock that band down one two
three<00:01:15.479> four<00:01:16.790> five<00:01:17.790> six<00:01:18.680> seven<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.189> then<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
three four five six seven and then the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
three four five six seven and then the
tie<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.540> want<00:01:21.750> three<00:01:22.710> wraps<00:01:22.950> below<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
tie off I want three wraps below and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.690 
tie off I want three wraps below and
four<00:01:23.790> above<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.750> will<00:01:25.049> hold<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.100> bark<00:01:26.460> out

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
four above that will hold that bark out

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.899 
four above that will hold that bark out
tightly<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.600> keep<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.990> bud<00:01:28.140> from<00:01:28.320> drying<00:01:28.590> out

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
tightly and keep the bud from drying out

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.679 
tightly and keep the bud from drying out
while<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.090> heals<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.950> heals<00:01:31.950> itself<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
while it heals in heals itself to the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.200 
while it heals in heals itself to the
tree<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:35.340> course<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> budding<00:01:36.000> strip

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
tree and of course the budding strip

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.910 
tree and of course the budding strip
over<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> course<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> winter<00:01:37.170> loses<00:01:37.740> its

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
over the course of the winter loses its

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.219 
over the course of the winter loses its
elasticity<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.000> falls<00:01:39.299> off<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> does

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
elasticity and it falls off so it does

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.260 
elasticity and it falls off so it does
not<00:01:40.380> girdle<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.040> tree<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.649> bud<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.579> is

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
not girdle the tree then the bud this is

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.870 
not girdle the tree then the bud this is
healed<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.500> nicely<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.280> called<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> bud

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
healed in nicely that's called the bud

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
healed in nicely that's called the bud
shield<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.780> little<00:01:49.020> eye<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> bud<00:01:49.590> sits

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
shield that that little eye the bud sits

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.789 
shield that that little eye the bud sits
on<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:51.090> healed<00:01:51.329> into<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> tree<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
on and that's healed into the tree and I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.190 
on and that's healed into the tree and I
can<00:01:53.009> tell<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> bud

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
can tell that because the way the bud

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.429 
can tell that because the way the bud
swelling<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.460> if<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.180> didn't<00:01:57.509> take<00:01:58.079> or

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
swelling it's a if it didn't take or

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
swelling it's a if it didn't take or
didn't<00:01:58.710> stick<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.430> dry<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.360> fall

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
didn't stick it would dry up and fall

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.370 
didn't stick it would dry up and fall
out<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:02.579> look<00:02:02.759> good<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.540> I'm<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
out so they look good and I'm about to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.960 
out so they look good and I'm about to
call<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> grower

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
call the grower

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.770 
call the grower
and<00:02:06.510> have<00:02:06.780> him<00:02:07.080> come<00:02:07.440> by<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:08.210> cut<00:02:09.210> this<00:02:09.420> tree

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and have him come by and cut this tree

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420 
and have him come by and cut this tree
off<00:02:09.960> right<00:02:10.380> above<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.860> bud

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
off right above that bud

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.000 
off right above that bud
we<00:02:12.330> need<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.630> signal<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> tree<00:02:13.590> into<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
we need to signal to the tree into the

we need to signal to the tree into the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
that way it'll start throwing all the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
this tree starts glowing in the spring

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.960 
this tree starts glowing in the spring
it'll<00:02:37.410> start<00:02:37.710> sprouting<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.550> on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> top

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
it'll start sprouting up here on the top

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.920 
it'll start sprouting up here on the top
and<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.020> buzz<00:02:40.200> will<00:02:40.430> push<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.660> later<00:02:42.660> as

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and and the buzz will push out later as

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.320 
and and the buzz will push out later as
they<00:02:43.140> go<00:02:43.320> lower<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.860> we<00:02:44.550> want<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> signal<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.240> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
they go lower so we want a signal to the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.420 
they go lower so we want a signal to the
tree<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.570> that's<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> terminal<00:02:46.530> bud<00:02:46.710> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
tree that that's the terminal bud and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.620 
tree that that's the terminal bud and
that'll<00:02:47.730> shoot<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.910> there's<00:02:51.150> another<00:02:51.480> one

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
that'll shoot and there's another one

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.510 
that'll shoot and there's another one
looks<00:02:51.990> good<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.470> one<00:02:55.680> grew<00:02:55.950> a<00:02:56.190> little

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
looks good and that one grew a little

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.550 
looks good and that one grew a little
bit<00:02:56.990> last<00:02:57.990> fall<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.810> that's<00:03:00.900> fine<00:03:01.230> there'll

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
bit last fall and that's fine there'll

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.300 
bit last fall and that's fine there'll
be<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:01.680> new<00:03:01.860> bud<00:03:02.100> come<00:03:02.430> off<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:04.310> these

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
be a new bud come off of that and these

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.770 
be a new bud come off of that and these
were<00:03:05.580> by<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:05.940> end<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.210> this<00:03:06.360> growing<00:03:06.720> season

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
were by the end of this growing season

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.360 
were by the end of this growing season
they<00:03:09.780> will<00:03:09.959> look<00:03:10.110> about<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.739> these<00:03:10.950> trees

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
they will look about like these trees

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.030 
they will look about like these trees
only<00:03:11.730> they<00:03:12.000> will<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.780> correct<00:03:13.140> variety

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
only they will be the correct variety

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.750 
only they will be the correct variety
he<00:03:14.489> wasn't<00:03:14.910> unable<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.540> get<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.930> variety<00:03:16.760> that

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
he wasn't unable to get the variety that

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.060 
he wasn't unable to get the variety that
he<00:03:17.880> needed<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.870> he<00:03:19.020> just<00:03:19.200> bought<00:03:19.500> these<00:03:19.770> trees

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
he needed so he just bought these trees

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.290 
he needed so he just bought these trees
from<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.340> nursery<00:03:20.730> whatever<00:03:21.120> they<00:03:21.270> were

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
from the nursery whatever they were

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.740 
from the nursery whatever they were
doesn't<00:03:21.930> matter<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:23.370> put<00:03:23.580> on<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.880> flavor

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
doesn't matter and we put on the flavor

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.500 
doesn't matter and we put on the flavor
for<00:03:25.170> him<00:03:25.350> whatever<00:03:25.880> whatever<00:03:26.880> they<00:03:27.270> want

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
for him whatever whatever they want

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.890 
for him whatever whatever they want
that's<00:03:27.780> what<00:03:27.989> we<00:03:28.170> put<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:33.480> sucked<00:03:33.780> my

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
that's what we put on I just sucked my

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.370 
that's what we put on I just sucked my
thumb<00:03:33.930> into<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.890> it's<00:03:35.580> green<00:03:35.970> inside<00:03:36.450> so

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
thumb into that and it's green inside so

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.350 
thumb into that and it's green inside so
I<00:03:37.440> know<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.340> know<00:03:39.090> it<00:03:39.330> took<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.239> the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
I know it I know it took and I think the

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.110 
I know it I know it took and I think the
percentage<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:43.170> take<00:03:43.440> is<00:03:43.769> very<00:03:44.220> very<00:03:44.730> high<00:03:44.940> out

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
percentage of take is very very high out

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.580 
percentage of take is very very high out
here<00:03:45.390> usually<00:03:45.780> we<00:03:45.900> get<00:03:46.050> high<00:03:46.230> 90s<00:03:47.600> but<00:03:48.600> if

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
here usually we get high 90s but if

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.960 
here usually we get high 90s but if
there's<00:03:49.830> anything<00:03:50.040> out<00:03:50.220> here<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> does<00:03:50.790> not

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
there's anything out here that does not

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.660 
there's anything out here that does not
take<00:03:51.810> does<00:03:52.410> not<00:03:52.680> make<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:52.890> tree<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.190> will<00:03:53.489> come

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
take does not make a tree I will come

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.110 
take does not make a tree I will come
back<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.620> fix<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:57.600> that's<00:03:57.810> how<00:03:58.019> you

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
back and fix it and that's how you

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.850 
back and fix it and that's how you
that's<00:04:00.120> how<00:04:00.330> you<00:04:00.390> stay<00:04:00.630> in<00:04:00.660> business<00:04:00.840> for<00:04:01.320> 35

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
that's how you stay in business for 35

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.060 
that's how you stay in business for 35
years<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.400> just<00:04:02.670> come<00:04:02.880> back<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.269> fix<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.070> and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
years you just come back and fix it and

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.160 
years you just come back and fix it and
you<00:04:05.580> make<00:04:06.000> sure<00:04:06.030> that<00:04:06.450> the<00:04:06.570> guy<00:04:06.750> will<00:04:06.930> find

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
you make sure that the guy will find

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.990 
you make sure that the guy will find
that<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.739> go<00:04:07.890> find<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.310> guy<00:04:08.459> if<00:04:08.730> there's<00:04:08.910> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
that you go find the guy if there's a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.550 
that you go find the guy if there's a
problem<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.780> don't<00:04:09.989> have<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.200> go<00:04:10.320> looking

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
problem so you don't have to go looking

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.500 
problem so you don't have to go looking
for<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.489> that's<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.970> deal<00:04:12.120> I'll<00:04:12.360> go

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
for you you know that's the deal I'll go

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.570 
for you you know that's the deal I'll go
find<00:04:12.810> them<00:04:13.050> for<00:04:13.440> something<00:04:13.830> going<00:04:14.040> on<00:04:14.130> they

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
find them for something going on they

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.670 
find them for something going on they
need<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.819> know<00:04:14.940> about<00:04:15.169> they<00:04:16.169> don't<00:04:16.289> have<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> go

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
need to know about they don't have to go

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.440 
need to know about they don't have to go
chasing<00:04:17.039> after<00:04:17.280> me<00:04:18.830> so<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:20.220> guess<00:04:21.150> that's<00:04:21.299> how

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
chasing after me so I guess that's how

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.270 
chasing after me so I guess that's how
you<00:04:21.570> stay<00:04:21.840> in<00:04:21.870> business<00:04:22.080> 35<00:04:22.590> years<00:04:23.039> that's

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you stay in business 35 years that's

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.580 
you stay in business 35 years that's
what<00:04:23.490> I've<00:04:23.610> been<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.320> sometimes<00:04:25.320> it's<00:04:25.530> a
