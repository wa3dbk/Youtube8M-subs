there's<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.779> traditional<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.380> over<00:00:19.590> there<00:00:19.680> but

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
there's a traditional one over there but

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.560 
there's a traditional one over there but
this<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.760> make<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.300> will<00:00:21.420> keep

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
this is how to make one that will keep

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.019 
this is how to make one that will keep
it<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.810> there<00:00:22.020> using<00:00:22.769> some<00:00:23.010> redstone<00:00:23.369> tricks

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it in there using some redstone tricks

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.790 
it in there using some redstone tricks
so<00:00:24.300> here's<00:00:24.869> all<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> materials<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.650> going

so here's all the materials you're going
to<00:00:25.859> need<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.760> don't<00:00:26.910> necessarily<00:00:27.000> need<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
to need for you don't necessarily need a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.080 
to need for you don't necessarily need a
stack<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> everything<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:29.250> just<00:00:29.789> happen<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
stack of everything I just happen to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.450 
stack of everything I just happen to
have<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.300> stack<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.570> everything<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.460> that's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
have a stack of everything so that's

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.370 
have a stack of everything so that's
what<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.850> using<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
what I'm going to be using for this the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.260 
what I'm going to be using for this the
basic<00:00:34.860> template<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> be

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
basic template for it is going to be

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
basic template for it is going to be
three<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.050> mean<00:00:37.410> two<00:00:37.649> blocks<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.219> left<00:00:38.280> two

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
three I mean two blocks to the left two

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
three I mean two blocks to the left two
blocks<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> two<00:00:39.719> blocks<00:00:39.989> there

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
blocks to the right and two blocks there

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.400 
blocks to the right and two blocks there
with<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> pressure<00:00:40.890> pads<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.570> front<00:00:42.870> with

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
with the pressure pads on the front with

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.729 
with the pressure pads on the front with
fence<00:00:44.129> gates<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:45.350> space<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.530> two

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
fence gates in the first space of two

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.410 
fence gates in the first space of two
they<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> cover<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.780> carpet

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
they are going to cover that with carpet

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.670 
they are going to cover that with carpet
yep<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.600> carpet<00:00:51.899> squares<00:00:52.020> their<00:00:52.289> cover<00:00:52.500> up

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
yep the carpet squares their cover up

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610 
yep the carpet squares their cover up
all<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.270> fence<00:00:54.270> gates<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.289> redstone

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
all the fence gates then one redstone

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.729 
all the fence gates then one redstone
piece<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> go<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.690> closest<00:00:58.320> spot

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
piece is going to go in the closest spot

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.130 
piece is going to go in the closest spot
to<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.399> carpet<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.449> you're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> build

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to the carpet then you're going to build

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
to the carpet then you're going to build
put<00:01:01.890> wood<00:01:02.100> planks<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.940> either<00:01:03.750> side

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
put wood planks here on either side

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.830 
put wood planks here on either side
outside<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.700> spaces<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.659> have

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
outside of the spaces that you have

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.880 
outside of the spaces that you have
already<00:01:07.170> dug<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> ground<00:01:09.590> then<00:01:10.590> on

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
already dug into the ground then on

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
already dug into the ground then on
those<00:01:11.340> you're<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> sticky

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
those you're going to put a sticky

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.730 
those you're going to put a sticky
piston<00:01:13.909> facing<00:01:14.909> downward<00:01:15.720> down<00:01:16.200> towards<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
piston facing downward down towards the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.840 
piston facing downward down towards the
ground<00:01:16.830> you're<00:01:17.189> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> put<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> sticky

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
ground you're going to put a sticky

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.109 
ground you're going to put a sticky
piston<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.619> then<00:01:19.619> under<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> sticky<00:01:20.759> piston

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
piston and then under the sticky piston

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
piston and then under the sticky piston
you<00:01:21.330> were<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.320> redstone<00:01:22.680> block

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you were going to put a redstone block

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.270 
you were going to put a redstone block
so<00:01:23.909> here's<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.810> sticky<00:01:25.110> piston<00:01:25.439> goes<00:01:26.040> in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so here's the sticky piston goes in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.359 
so here's the sticky piston goes in
right<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.530> see<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.950> facing

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
right there and you can see it's facing

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.580 
right there and you can see it's facing
towards<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.729> towards<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.780> ground<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.500> do

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
towards the towards the ground and to do

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200 
towards the towards the ground and to do
that<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.130> under<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.670> then

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
that you have to get under it and then

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.910 
that you have to get under it and then
you<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.750> put<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.200> redstone<00:01:34.680> block

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you want to put the redstone block

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.069 
you want to put the redstone block
attached<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> sticky<00:01:36.030> piston<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.930> you're

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
attached to the sticky piston so you're

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.390 
attached to the sticky piston so you're
going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.320> under<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> put<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.040> there<00:01:38.159> so

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
going to go under it to put it there so

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.100 
going to go under it to put it there so
here<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.729> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.090> side<00:01:39.210> sticky

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
here it is on the other side sticky

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.710 
here it is on the other side sticky
piston<00:01:40.439> goes<00:01:40.560> down<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.100> then<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.909> block<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
piston goes down and then the block of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.810 
piston goes down and then the block of
redstone<00:01:43.020> goes<00:01:43.320> down<00:01:43.530> under<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
redstone goes down under that one so

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.520 
redstone goes down under that one so
there's<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.509> two<00:01:45.659> sides<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.200> should<00:01:46.409> look

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
there's the two sides they should look

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.590 
there's the two sides they should look
identical<00:01:46.710> both<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.430> these<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:48.119> everything

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
identical both of these is everything

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.609 
identical both of these is everything
that<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.049> side<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.590> on

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that you do one side is going to go on

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.249 
that you do one side is going to go on
the<00:01:49.799> other<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:51.000> after<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.110> can

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
the other so just after that you can

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.219 
the other so just after that you can
build<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.560> framework<00:01:52.890> around<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:54.079> and<00:01:55.079> that

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
build a framework around it and that

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.560 
build a framework around it and that
framework<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.180> just<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
framework is going to be just like is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.170 
framework is going to be just like is
shown<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.680> going<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:58.950> three<00:01:59.820> all

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
shown here it is going to be three all

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.139 
shown here it is going to be three all
the<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.420> across<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.290> it'll<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.790> third<00:02:03.000> one

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the way across but it'll the third one

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.580 
the way across but it'll the third one
in<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.299> back<00:02:03.479> will<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.780> shut<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> little

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
in the back will just shut out a little

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.399 
in the back will just shut out a little
bit<00:02:05.149> that's<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.390> purely<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:07.020> design

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
bit that's just purely for design

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.680 
bit that's just purely for design
features<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.550> know<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.759> just<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.390> want

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
features you know you just you just want

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.150 
features you know you just you just want
to<00:02:09.750> make<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.899> look<00:02:10.140> good<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.800> redstone

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
to make it look good the redstone

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.860 
to make it look good the redstone
functionality<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.790> already<00:02:12.060> all<00:02:12.180> done<00:02:12.510> you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
functionality is already all done you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.250 
functionality is already all done you
did

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
did

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.339 
did
before<00:02:13.709> when<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.879> did<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> red<00:02:16.019> stone<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.319> the

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
before when you did the red stone on the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.990 
before when you did the red stone on the
redstone<00:02:16.739> block<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.129> sticky<00:02:17.459> piston<00:02:17.640> so

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
redstone block with a sticky piston so

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.429 
redstone block with a sticky piston so
that's<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.360> done<00:02:18.569> then<00:02:18.989> you're<00:02:19.079> going<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> put

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
that's all done then you're going to put

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.710 
that's all done then you're going to put
two<00:02:19.650> step<00:02:19.920> pieces<00:02:20.519> across<00:02:21.239> from<00:02:21.510> each<00:02:21.569> other

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
two step pieces across from each other

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.839 
two step pieces across from each other
covering<00:02:22.230> up<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.409> piston<00:02:22.739> then<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.670> put

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
covering up the piston then going to put

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.910 
covering up the piston then going to put
wood<00:02:24.090> plank<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.629> top<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.349> piston<00:02:25.530> on

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
wood plank on top of the piston on

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
wood plank on top of the piston on
either<00:02:26.220> side<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.819> then<00:02:27.629> from<00:02:27.810> there<00:02:27.870> you're

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
either side and then from there you're

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.259 
either side and then from there you're
going<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.680> take<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> trip<00:02:29.310> wire<00:02:29.519> hook<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.060> put

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
going to take a trip wire hook and put

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.500 
going to take a trip wire hook and put
them<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.540> both<00:02:30.930> wood<00:02:31.409> plank<00:02:31.799> blocks<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.329> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
them on both wood plank blocks now it is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.390 
them on both wood plank blocks now it is
important<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.170> put<00:02:34.530> two<00:02:34.739> pieces<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.040> string<00:02:35.129> on

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
important to put two pieces of string on

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.589 
important to put two pieces of string on
there<00:02:35.579> or<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:36.180> won't<00:02:36.540> work<00:02:36.629> so<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.159> see

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
there or it won't work so as you can see

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.509 
there or it won't work so as you can see
the<00:02:39.599> trip<00:02:39.780> wire<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.019> stretching<00:02:40.859> across<00:02:40.950> both

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
the trip wire is stretching across both

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.960 
the trip wire is stretching across both
blocks<00:02:42.299> just<00:02:42.900> fine<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:44.159> is<00:02:44.370> exactly<00:02:44.400> how

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
blocks just fine and that is exactly how

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.780 
blocks just fine and that is exactly how
you<00:02:45.030> would<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.659> would<00:02:45.810> want<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.200> do<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.790> now

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you would you would want to do it now

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.009 
you would you would want to do it now
we're<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.180> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.510> put<00:02:48.720> some<00:02:48.900> more

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
we're just going to put some more

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.080 
we're just going to put some more
structure<00:02:49.470> structure<00:02:50.340> detail<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:50.879> we're

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
structure structure detail on it we're

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.520 
structure structure detail on it we're
going<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.299> cover<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:51.810> trip<00:02:52.019> wire<00:02:52.200> by

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
going to cover up the trip wire by

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
going to cover up the trip wire by
putting<00:02:53.519> planks<00:02:53.940> around<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.480> then<00:02:54.629> we're

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
putting planks around it and then we're

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.599 
putting planks around it and then we're
gonna<00:02:54.780> make<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.440> little<00:02:55.620> roof<00:02:55.950> with<00:02:56.220> some<00:02:56.400> wood

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
gonna make a little roof with some wood

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.300 
gonna make a little roof with some wood
slabs<00:02:57.000> there<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.950> know<00:02:58.980> make<00:02:59.159> it

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
slabs there just to you know make it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.890 
slabs there just to you know make it
look<00:02:59.459> good<00:02:59.579> so<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.970> way<00:03:00.090> it's<00:03:00.239> not<00:03:00.389> just<00:03:00.659> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
look good so that way it's not just a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.530 
look good so that way it's not just a
plain<00:03:01.530> old<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:02.670> know<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.970> two<00:03:03.150> things<00:03:03.359> on

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
plain old you know just two things on

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.599 
plain old you know just two things on
either<00:03:03.659> side<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.590> also<00:03:04.709> going<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.159> step

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
either side we're also going to put step

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:08.119 
either side we're also going to put step
pieces<00:03:06.120> around<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.810> back<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.409> it<00:03:07.530> so<00:03:07.889> the

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
pieces around the back of it so the

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.910 
pieces around the back of it so the
horse<00:03:08.370> cannot<00:03:08.940> get<00:03:09.150> out<00:03:09.590> that's<00:03:10.590> important

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
horse cannot get out that's important

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.050 
horse cannot get out that's important
because<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.129> don't<00:03:11.280> want<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.489> horse<00:03:11.670> you

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
because you don't want the horse you

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.149 
because you don't want the horse you
know<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:13.079> horse<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.349> gonna<00:03:13.440> stay<00:03:13.769> in<00:03:13.799> there

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
know the horse is gonna stay in there

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.470 
know the horse is gonna stay in there
there's<00:03:14.579> not<00:03:14.700> going<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.849> be<00:03:14.909> a<00:03:14.970> door<00:03:15.239> but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
there's not going to be a door but

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.119 
there's not going to be a door but
there's<00:03:15.599> going<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.810> fence<00:03:16.500> pieces<00:03:16.769> along

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
there's going to be fence pieces along

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.920 
there's going to be fence pieces along
the<00:03:17.310> back<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:18.060> keeps<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.569> horse<00:03:18.750> from

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the back that keeps the horse from

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.349 
the back that keeps the horse from
getting<00:03:19.139> out<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.530> here's<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.949> defense<00:03:20.699> be<00:03:20.910> not

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
getting out so here's the defense be not

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.150 
getting out so here's the defense be not
the<00:03:21.510> fence<00:03:21.690> pieces<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.169> step<00:03:22.440> piece<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.829> going

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
the fence pieces the step piece is going

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.129 
the fence pieces the step piece is going
down<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:24.180> way<00:03:24.329> when<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.629> move<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:24.959> horse

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
down that way when you move your horse

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.059 
down that way when you move your horse
in<00:03:25.319> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.489> when<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.940> um<00:03:27.180> hit<00:03:27.629> shift<00:03:27.989> to<00:03:28.919> get

mess with it past that point right now
you're<00:03:53.819> just<00:03:53.849> trying<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.269> make<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.419> look<00:03:54.660> good

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
you're just trying to make it look good

you're just trying to make it look good
you<00:03:55.919> know<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.099> could<00:03:56.310> get<00:03:56.430> creative<00:03:56.730> with<00:03:56.819> it

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
you know you could get creative with it

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.550 
you know you could get creative with it
and<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.389> can<00:03:57.540> try<00:03:57.659> to<00:03:57.720> find<00:03:57.959> another<00:03:58.169> way<00:03:58.409> to

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
and you can try to find another way to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.960 
and you can try to find another way to
do<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.889> you<00:03:59.129> know<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.489> don't<00:03:59.639> have<00:03:59.819> to

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
do this you know you don't have to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.909 
do this you know you don't have to
necessarily<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.629> exactly<00:04:00.780> like<00:04:01.199> my<00:04:01.530> design

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
necessarily do it exactly like my design

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.479 
necessarily do it exactly like my design
but<00:04:03.500> this<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.680> one<00:04:04.859> way<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.069> know<00:04:05.310> it's<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
but this is one way you know it's a

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.839 
but this is one way you know it's a
pretty<00:04:05.669> easy<00:04:05.909> way<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.209> do<00:04:06.449> this<00:04:06.799> if<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:08.310> feel

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
pretty easy way to do this if you feel

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.460 
pretty easy way to do this if you feel
that<00:04:08.909> you<00:04:09.209> could<00:04:09.419> you<00:04:09.599> know<00:04:09.720> take<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.290> same

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
that you could you know take the same

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.050 
that you could you know take the same
concept<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.220> apply<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.639> something<00:04:11.729> else

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
concept and apply it to something else

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.059 
concept and apply it to something else
you<00:04:12.299> know<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.479> very<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:13.109> very<00:04:13.319> well<00:04:13.500> could<00:04:13.739> so

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
you know you very you very well could so

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.670 
you know you very you very well could so
yeah<00:04:14.879> here's<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.209> here's<00:04:15.659> an<00:04:15.840> overall<00:04:16.320> view<00:04:16.349> of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
yeah here's a here's an overall view of

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.129 
yeah here's a here's an overall view of
what<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.099> looks<00:04:17.280> like<00:04:17.430> at<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.760> end<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:18.150> design

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
what it looks like at the end the design

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.279 
what it looks like at the end the design
of<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.849> yeah<00:04:20.849> I'm<00:04:21.510> gonna<00:04:21.659> take<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.870> horse<00:04:22.109> now

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
of it yeah I'm gonna take a horse now

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.870 
of it yeah I'm gonna take a horse now
and<00:04:22.440> show<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.620> what<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.830> looks<00:04:22.979> like<00:04:23.280> so<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
and show you what that looks like so you

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.850 
and show you what that looks like so you
put<00:04:24.539> him<00:04:24.659> in<00:04:24.810> he<00:04:25.080> activates<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.650> pressure

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
put him in he activates the pressure

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.840 
put him in he activates the pressure
plate<00:04:26.039> and<00:04:26.310> then<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.580> hit

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
plate and then you hit

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.970 
plate and then you hit
shift<00:04:27.090> or<00:04:27.390> whatever<00:04:28.110> your<00:04:28.260> sneak<00:04:28.500> button<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
shift or whatever your sneak button is

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.010 
shift or whatever your sneak button is
and<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.640> will<00:04:29.820> jump<00:04:30.090> out<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.300> back<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.720> that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and you will jump out the back and that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.680 
and you will jump out the back and that
prevents<00:04:31.470> your<00:04:32.070> horse<00:04:32.430> from<00:04:32.670> getting<00:04:32.970> out<00:04:33.090> now

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
prevents your horse from getting out now

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.180 
prevents your horse from getting out now
the<00:04:33.780> way<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.110> works<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.560> there's<00:04:34.830> fence

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
the way this works is there's fence

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.750 
the way this works is there's fence
gates<00:04:35.490> those<00:04:35.880> fence<00:04:36.180> gates<00:04:36.420> nothing<00:04:36.930> can<00:04:37.110> pass

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
gates those fence gates nothing can pass

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.150 
gates those fence gates nothing can pass
above<00:04:38.760> them<00:04:39.060> so<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.380> can<00:04:40.530> even<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:40.890> with

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
above them so you can even do this with

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.250 
above them so you can even do this with
an<00:04:41.850> invisible<00:04:42.120> door<00:04:42.540> in<00:04:42.690> your<00:04:42.810> house<00:04:42.960> if<00:04:43.170> you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
an invisible door in your house if you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.170 
an invisible door in your house if you
want<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.680> same<00:04:43.860> concept<00:04:44.430> because<00:04:44.790> nothing

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
want to the same concept because nothing

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.000 
want to the same concept because nothing
can<00:04:45.360> not<00:04:45.780> even<00:04:45.900> your<00:04:46.230> codes<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.800> walk

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
can not even your codes you can walk

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.130 
can not even your codes you can walk
over<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.310> front<00:04:47.520> shape<00:04:47.730> so<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.570> showed<00:04:48.930> there

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
over the front shape so I showed there

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.360 
over the front shape so I showed there
you<00:04:49.350> couldn't<00:04:49.650> even<00:04:49.770> pull<00:04:50.040> them<00:04:50.160> out<00:04:50.190> with<00:04:50.340> a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
you couldn't even pull them out with a

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.280 
you couldn't even pull them out with a
lead<00:04:50.640> but<00:04:51.030> if<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.360> went<00:04:52.020> up<00:04:52.110> there<00:04:52.260> and
