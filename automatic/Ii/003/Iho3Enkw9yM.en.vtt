00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
I guess it will be like an app or

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.450 
I guess it will be like an app or
something<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.780> will<00:01:07.960> almost<00:01:08.230> kind<00:01:08.950> of<00:01:08.980> open

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
something that will almost kind of open

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.100 
something that will almost kind of open
up<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.880> mac<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.330> I'll<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.630> able<00:01:10.690> to<00:01:10.810> view<00:01:10.990> my

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
up the mac and I'll be able to view my

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.150 
up the mac and I'll be able to view my
files<00:01:11.500> um<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:13.390> says<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:14.200> Mac<00:01:14.380> authenticates

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
files um it says the Mac authenticates

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.960 
files um it says the Mac authenticates
with<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.400> iphone<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.150> then<00:01:16.510> it<00:01:16.930> shares

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
with the iphone and then it shares

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.610 
with the iphone and then it shares
bookmarks<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.090> passwords<00:01:19.690> and<00:01:20.050> stuff<00:01:20.410> like

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
bookmarks and passwords and stuff like

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.830 
bookmarks and passwords and stuff like
that<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.490> I'm<00:01:21.820> assuming<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:22.450> if<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.690> have<00:01:22.780> a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
that so I'm assuming that if you have a

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.500 
that so I'm assuming that if you have a
bookmark<00:01:23.260> in<00:01:23.440> Safari<00:01:23.940> you'll<00:01:24.940> show<00:01:25.240> up<00:01:25.330> that

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
bookmark in Safari you'll show up that

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.940 
bookmark in Safari you'll show up that
bookmark<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:26.020> your<00:01:26.140> iPhone<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.680> I'll<00:01:26.800> just

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
bookmark on your iPhone and I'll just

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.760 
bookmark on your iPhone and I'll just
kind<00:01:27.010> of<00:01:27.190> link<00:01:27.430> straight<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.770> there'll

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
kind of link straight to that there'll

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.130 
kind of link straight to that there'll
be<00:01:30.030> documents<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.180> project<00:01:31.540> files<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:32.050> will

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
be documents and project files that will

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.020 
be documents and project files that will
be<00:01:32.290> stored<00:01:32.650> directly<00:01:32.980> on<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> iphone<00:01:33.730> and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
be stored directly on the iphone and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.110 
be stored directly on the iphone and
then<00:01:34.750> some<00:01:35.020> stuff<00:01:35.260> could<00:01:35.470> be<00:01:35.500> like<00:01:36.040> on<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.340> cloud

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
then some stuff could be like on a cloud

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.360 
then some stuff could be like on a cloud
that<00:01:37.660> will<00:01:38.170> just<00:01:38.350> like<00:01:38.530> kind<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:38.860> cloud<00:01:39.160> around

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
that will just like kind of cloud around

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.970 
that will just like kind of cloud around
