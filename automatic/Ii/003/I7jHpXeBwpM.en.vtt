 I'm putting this fast camera is 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.290
 as it is installed the three are threatened 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 white if it's in a round then the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.070
 external recoat or and wait for it to load 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.570
 yes that was treated a little bit and 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.360
 touch the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.800
 and well let's see let's see what 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.200
 changes to implement the developer 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.480
 which are the following 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.000
 good the changelog what the 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.420
 changes they have made are they have cleaned 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.540
 with point but have fixed 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.830
 completely the one to share and 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.220
 understand the usb usb etc have fixed 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.470
 luther or to share have done 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 big changes in what would be the 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:22.229
 memory such vic have fixed the d button 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.150
 suffer the shine that they have implemented a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.170
 new kernel and they have always 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:31.409
 implemented more ram memory have put 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.880
 a new new usb system 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.720
 the man is already returned through 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.580
 overclock and anaya has added the bnl that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.980
 is for a small led notifications 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.640
 and good as long as this has been installed 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.150
 Well let's see more or less the review 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 of rice 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.790
 well let's see the review of the rom 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.740
 end 2 as we can see here is what 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.080
 showing the now we can lower the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.210
 Bravery is because it's Andrew 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.520
 totally native we can see there in the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.680
 screen as you can see how it is 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.110
 moves little to the sides 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.750
 here we have the unlock button and the 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.120
 button of violence and then this would be more 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.190
 or less the launcher putxet interface 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 which is the one that brings this version we are going to 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.940
 see the settings 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.269
 and this version of android 4.0 point 4 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.150
 extreme sandwich we can we will see the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:29.780
 animation is not totally in the end not 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.540
 is no cheating or anything like that 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.940
 it's totally native we can see here 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.349
 the applications that llorÃ­s brings is 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.799
 given several since I've been using 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:42.590
 the occasion and a half and good we have here 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.989
 the calculator as we can see it works 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.090
 correctly here we can see what 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.440
 it would be the calendar that is something new 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.569
 that they have implemented since the previous 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.980
 version seems to me or I do not know if it is this 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.260
 it's a new calendar that brings 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.489
 defect the google that the truth is 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.200
 pretty pretty 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.160
 and here what everyone was waiting for 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.810
 that the camera already records 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.100
 from the previous one to the end one records already 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.230
 take the photos in a more fluid way 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.160
 as we can see there there is no no 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.300
 nothing we can focus the photo makes a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.770
 small sound but like I have 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.650
 silence or terminal because you do not hear 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.360
 obvious and for example we can put the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.330
 flash so they see that if it works already 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.190
 is working 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.780
 well here we already have several 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.910
 configurations let's touch this button 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.310
 what is to take the photo and how to put 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.150
 of taking rather quickly something that does not 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.460
 I liked it a lot 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.200
 configurations 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.490
 something that I did not like about this branch 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.160
 is that as the button is like 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.840
 squished or even amorphous and looks medium 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.360
 Ugly the truth I hope that I will do this in 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.280
 future versions here we can see what 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.150
 that would be the picture that the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.760
 gallery and the video already recorded in the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.680
 Camera application and record very fluid 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.870
 how can we give and it works we go active 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.420
 does not have flash option but has this 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.040
 function that says effects this there was no 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.170
 seen before it's new that they have 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.600
 implemented and how can we can 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.380
 take the video and it will not be 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.320
 absolutely for nothing 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.360
 we can see it we can stop it but very 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.170
 well here ready video will 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.170
 reproduce it 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.259
 and already working perfectly 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.330
 what else have increased so good 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.389
 they have made several changes as well 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.100
 we saw the configurations we had the 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.870
 mail the downloads the study of 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.199
 movies that is an application that 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.510
 the photo gallery comes by default 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.360
 that works without problems we can see 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.050
 there a screenshot 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:52.710
 a computer that works pretty well 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.750
 the truth change photos I can not 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.689
 having those photos is the good thing about the 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.090
 Official google quality is no longer 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:02.159
 nothing official google 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.780
 well here we have the tool is 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:06.199
 say that it is not working for me that 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.550
 weird but it should be working 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:15.509
 we have here the messages that work 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.750
 in perfection the browser in said 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.580
 time the launcher that is installed 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.849
 The music I play is by default 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.590
 reader the many applications what 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:28.169
 have implemented is the super su that is 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.569
 new one is a new project as 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:33.000
 abandons the previous superuser and 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.529
 have put this this does not change anything 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.060
 still have the permissions routes 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.220
 corresponding so it comes with the 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.230
 mother swims 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.940
 and he starts talking to me the phone that 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:45.840
 it works also correctly 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.700
 the twitter and others and as we can see 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.010
 is totally fluid we can give the 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.270
 widgets is working correctly and 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:58.620
 also nothing looks quite fluid 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:02.440
 add this time again repeated and 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.400
 without problems and well that would be all 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.139
 review of the rom have not served that 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.880
 and well first let's try the 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.110
 browser that as they can not I do not have 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.330
 connect the wifi but it works 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.919
 correctly, younger children have not 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.270
 liked this review leave the team 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.270
 favorites and goodbye
