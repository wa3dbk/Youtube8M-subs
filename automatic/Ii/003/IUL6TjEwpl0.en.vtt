00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 in other elections the debates between 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.460
 candidates for the presidency have 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.950
 significantly modified the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.210
 vote trend in 2012 the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.240
 effects of the first of these encounters 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.009
 they are still an unknown that happens in 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.700
 Mexico tells us our correspondent 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.700
 now simon 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.560
 immediately after the debate between 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.330
 the presidential candidates started the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.790
 post debate in the media 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.180
 communication in political circles and 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.480
 in the streets they say they want to do 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.080
 but they do not say the like and that's very wrong 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.690
 because we Mexicans really want 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.150
 let someone who governs and tell us 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.350
 what will he do and how will he do it and 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.920
 what will he do? 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.660
 I found it lacking in proposals 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.149
 fund proposals I feel they are lacking 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.070
 say how they are going to face all the 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.760
 problematic that there is in this country 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.890
 for me it was bread with the same question 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.870
 is it helped or not the citizens 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.500
 better know who they are looking for 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.130
 govern Mexico for the next six years 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.040
 a good debate that is supposed to be about that 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.650
 it's about clarifying ideas that the 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.590
 undecided decide that we have 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.250
 a conviction we make it firmer and not 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.990
 was achieved is you can not know them anymore the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.640
 this Sunday there does not seem to be 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.740
 clearly inclined the balance in favor 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.130
 of any of the contenders as in 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.570
 past discussions explains this expert a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.730
 debate moves preferences when there 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.810
 serious errors 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.630
 or impressive hits 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.430
 serious errors that cause it to collapse 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.259
 the supporters of that candidate or 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.970
 impressive achievements that make 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.460
 supporters of other candidates what 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.740
 they turn to see and although they all declare 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.210
 winners says the one that won in principle 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.509
 he was the citizen who followed with attention 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.679
 the meeting is the only opportune thing to see 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.939
 to the candidates on equal terms 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.250

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.289
