00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.160
 that is the vivaro the new one 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.230
 small truck from opel to 600.000 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.570
 sold vehicles are already 10 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.099
 percent of all small trucks in europe 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.410
 opel vivaro 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.109
 the new one should be the market share in this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.670
 growing segment still increase around the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.740
 to achieve ambitious goals 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 opel works closely during development 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.580
 with renault nissan together 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.789
 the manufacturers are trying hard the cost 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.320
 for the customers we keep low 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.510
 we said raise the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.239
 Inspection intervals so far we had 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.910
 one year and 20,000 now we have two 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.489
 years and 40,000 kilometers that's one 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.110
 very important point about the cost too 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.850
 reduce because the car just less 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.920
 it still stands in the institution 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.890
 certainly what engines to use 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.649
 we have here in the new 1.6 liters 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.020
 aggregate inside are turbo aggregate what 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 We even designed as twin turbo 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.640
 have something in the economy altogether 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.739
 has made significant progress and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
 if you do that with the previous level 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.309
 comparison then you can do so over the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.760
 being thumb that was about 100 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.689
 kilometer 1.5 liters less fuel 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.490
 consume this 1.6 liter turbocharged engine 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.299
 Here in the how was and is really 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.250
 nice sparkling revving and doing it 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.780
 still economical 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.600
 behind the tailgate hides the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.290
 cargo space at the new was with two 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.430
 meters 53 10 inches longer than 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.990
 at the predecessor 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 There is a lot of room for example 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.620
 a kitchenette or a wing 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.450
 perhaps 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.420
 that I can not play that well or 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.310
 not so funny but practically three 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.540
 europallets go side by side here 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.790
 clean and you have the possibility 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.430
 if you open this flap there in front 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.590
 very long items such as roof slats 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.440
 or pipes under the passenger seat 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.270
 into the footwell to load another 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.580
 practical feature has opel itself 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.140
 come up with the life of the 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.640
 to make it easier for drivers to do so 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.560
 I go now range times briefly right 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:11.440
 that is not possible during the ride that is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.800
 this middle seat here is the man 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.280
 can fold and we can share this 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.290
 also still record and has here one 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.720
 clipboard can also convince 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.820
 the crisp circuit as well as the direct 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.290
 steering the vivaro that's more of 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.470
 a transporter not necessarily 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.470
 used 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.260
 and of course the vivaro is not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.300
 luxury car that one expects but also 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.819
 it is not just a craftsman car 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.800
 and for craftsmen is especially important 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.290
 The hold of it now ten 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.720
 centimeters longer and offers so much 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.310
 more practical use 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 the smart ideas here in the 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.750
 Passenger compartment and also what this 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.330
 extension of the cargo space concerns that 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.970
 is quite a plus point and I think 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.569
 there the vivaro can be against his 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.280
 Competitor point a tough competition 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.769
 for the vivaro are in germany before 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.870
 all the vw transporter t5 the ford 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.030
 transit as well as mercedes vito and citroÃ«n 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.090
 jumpy in germany you have to go for the 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.170
 new as why at least 28,000 72 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.000
 invest euro 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.530
 a competitive price for one 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.380
 competitive vehicle 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.569
 it will be the vivaro as a kombiversion for 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.569
 up to nine people enter the 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.569
 germany will cost 30,000 327 euro
