00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
what it feels like anyways nice bit of

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.710 
what it feels like anyways nice bit of
coverage<00:03:44.099> overhead<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.239> your<00:03:45.390> bits<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
coverage overhead so all your bits and

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.120 
coverage overhead so all your bits and
bobs<00:03:45.870> down<00:03:46.110> here<00:03:46.379> aren't<00:03:46.890> going<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.069> be

prolly<00:03:49.709> I'm<00:03:50.010> used<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.430> product<00:03:50.670> for<00:03:50.880> years<00:03:51.120> but

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
prolly I'm used a product for years but

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.660 
prolly I'm used a product for years but
I<00:03:51.599> can<00:03:51.750> see<00:03:51.959> why<00:03:52.290> they're<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.860> effective<00:03:53.280> at

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
I can see why they're so effective at

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.400 
I can see why they're so effective at
you<00:03:53.819> know<00:03:53.940> moving<00:03:54.299> when<00:03:54.750> you<00:03:54.840> need<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.110> move

you know moving when you need to move

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.559 
you know moving when you need to move
quickly<00:03:55.829> there's<00:03:56.579> no<00:03:56.700> doubt<00:03:56.940> about<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.209> this

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
quickly there's no doubt about it this

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.509 
quickly there's no doubt about it this
guy's<00:03:57.810> up<00:03:58.019> quicker<00:03:58.260> than<00:03:58.470> any<00:03:58.680> bivvy<00:03:59.069> system

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
guy's up quicker than any bivvy system

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.420 
guy's up quicker than any bivvy system
so<00:04:00.150> i'm<00:04:01.140> actually<00:04:01.349> tempted<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.160> get<00:04:02.250> one

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
so i'm actually tempted to get one

so i'm actually tempted to get one
myself<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.970> know<00:04:03.030> what<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:04.410> know<00:04:04.530> where<00:04:04.739> that

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
myself you know what you know where that

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.740 
myself you know what you know where that
car<00:04:05.069> is<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.579> you<00:04:05.819> know<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.180> screams<00:04:06.540> quality

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
car is that you know it screams quality

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.780 
car is that you know it screams quality
all<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.470> stuff<00:04:07.799> has<00:04:08.069> been<00:04:08.220> made<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.760> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
all of that stuff has been made to the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.569 
all of that stuff has been made to the
highest<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.360> standards<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.220> it's<00:04:11.220> built<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
highest of standards and it's built to

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.400 
highest of standards and it's built to
last<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.120> even<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.750> might<00:04:13.019> cost<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.380> a

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
last so even that might cost you a

last so even that might cost you a
little<00:04:13.590> bit<00:04:13.680> more<00:04:13.829> than<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.220> I'm<00:04:14.280> going<00:04:14.400> to

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
little bit more than so I'm going to

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.310 
little bit more than so I'm going to
cheap<00:04:14.640> stuff<00:04:14.940> it's<00:04:15.480> well<00:04:15.720> worth<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.169> in<00:04:16.290> the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
cheap stuff it's well worth it in the

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.560 
cheap stuff it's well worth it in the
long<00:04:16.410> run
