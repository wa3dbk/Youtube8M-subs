 Received timely itself 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.020
 topical through the new formation 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.630
 see here until the end 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.750
 the first thing always begins 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.370
 dance schools 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.130
 little big no matter what that is 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.560
 the place where you train that is 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:03.360
 this is the hall 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 and you have to very very smooth about clear 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.450
 correctly understand the sense of cr what type 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.490
 your cola 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.340
 percent 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.200
 whether you give a class whether you renn 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.930
 arrange as m 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.270
 just school more 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.480
 teachers are very dependent on this 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.360
 project 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.420
 hall rental type which will be 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.110
 most profitable for you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.130
 this is the most basic first stone 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.580
 without which the cool will not work 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.660
 undressed by good profitability then 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.700
 there is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969
 we must first think 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.110
 where will be located 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.790
 who will not leave 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.840
 what kind of rent are you willing to pay then 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.690
 There is this very important But all will begin with 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.700
 the first 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.690
 the second role is brick 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.290
 here is this advertisement 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.049
 people are your students they 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.060
 and which one you will have or already have 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.000
 they don't come from the air they don't 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.329
 appear in a fairy tale 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.130
 finger and a little reminded sorry no 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.700
 this is a conscious job advertising this 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.680
 the one you have to do 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.260
 and because of how well you have identified 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.630
 your client's titt how good you are 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.930
 raise did advertise it too 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.770
 it is very important nobody can happen 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.820
 at all 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.080
 it happens specifically for specific people 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.550
 for a specific group you want 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.680
 close under specific 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.140
 directs to give back then and there is 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.010
 many subtleties which yahoo future 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.299
 will tell 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.489
 advertising is the second foundation and there is 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.750
 one chip which 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.640
 they all understand ohh here especially those who 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.630
 datka from school legs first open 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.359
 the school 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.049
 and then night run ads 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.599
 fundamentally wrong let decommissioned first can 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.229
 run ads even when you haven't 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.920
 you know that the stone hall is 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.469
 and it will be yes 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.669
 it is very important that you have already appeared 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.619
 people who would like to practice then a 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:50.420
 at your 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.280
 gn dance studio development 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.349
 yours will be much faster much 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.459
 more intense and bring you more and 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.209
 pleasure and results 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.269
 next next third 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.779
 the bolsheviks are teaching 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.989
 teaching is important not only because you 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.779
 want your students there 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:09.620
 good won that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.710
 teaching is also a way 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.749
 canvas run pupils that is 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.079
 when do you invest in 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.109
 invest your advertising in your money 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:18.819
 its time 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.929
 here and you have people in the hall and here 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.129
 from the way you teach on that in 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.789
 focus attention depends then 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:26.819
 how long will not pampuha children 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.480
 whether you will be turnover you will 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.060
 constantly either in the empty hall or 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.430
 invest a lot of money but to 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.659
 attract their third people to yourself 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:37.379
 so how do you teach 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.269
 and what chips do you use 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.309
 but in order for these people to stay with 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.660
 it depends on you 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.489
 thomas cook you will have 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.540
 full room again eventually 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.439
 do you have students go to the festival 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 will there be many of them and will you be with this 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.069
 something to have 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.429
 three whales 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:55.879
 necessarily thoroughly 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.819
 think over the hall 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.569
 location rent so on 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:00.639
 second advertising 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.029
 and advertising can run before 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.860
 how slaves will open school 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.810
 that is, you know about where and when 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.599
 ipod will happen the same cook advertising 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.239
 ii and third and third is unconditional 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.799
 your teaching system she 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.559
 there must be a system in such a way that 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:17.879
 and you 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:18.989
 percent 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.169
 maximum kept people 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.710
 then you will be successful 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.710
