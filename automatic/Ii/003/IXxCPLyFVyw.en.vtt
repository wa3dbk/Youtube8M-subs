00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 a friend from youtube is giving him dj 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 berserk from part of big rebel live this 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.530
 it's a YouTube channel where we're going to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 start up a lot more since 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.809
 we just acquired this new 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 controller of dj sv good this is 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.360
 totally digital and the one that I had 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.330
 before I worked with was 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.400
 uy with what it would be like the same 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.000
 price but a little smaller then 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.820
 this is used with 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.790
 serratos of intro that the previous one 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.620
 used with virtual day and so the one that 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.440
 criticizes you a lot because then it is not so 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.510
 professional as a treatment used by the days 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.670
 big and cute and we'll use in this 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.949
 channel so good let's proceed to 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.530
 see it this had a boxing totally in 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.360
 Spanish so well the same as they are going to 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.610
 seeing you is the same thing that I'm going to see myself 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.790
 because I have not seen it either since 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.460
 it arrived so good already previously 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.250
 there would be here to open it with 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.620
 ease in addition I have a hand 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.000
 then here 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.200
 we open here 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.560
 because we can see her the turntable of 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.289
 from your back upside down then since 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 we open here it seems that we have to 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.950
 the dea 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.140
 and there he is then to see let's see 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.820
 here comes this beauty 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.170
 as you can see the same thing 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.570
 you just see it is the same 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 it's the same as what I just saw because 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 the truth 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.280
 just acquired just comes with a 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.320
 disk to do all intros for 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.320
 can install it the drivers 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.330
 in the instructions all here as 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.430
 can see has a post a manual and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.890
 all of us that nobody sees part of 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.630
 of page here is what all 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.880
 we want to see it and it's the dj on youtube if 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.650
 this is what they wanted to see this 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.020
 it was simply trimmed to be able 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.330
 can take them out and everything and good that 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.430
 we can see here different from the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.390
 controllers of this same price that 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.940
 it would be around $ 300 and about 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.800
 220 euros good to start they just 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.709
 include the partner these wonderful 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.080
 filters that when we work with wind 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.500
 we have to mess with the mouse you had 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.330
 to put them in another kind of way 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.010
 so you could hear a filter that 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.930
 maybe it did not sound the same and so 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.540
 I put the manual to one side towards 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.050
 the other and that only allows us there 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.630
 something that differentiates this page 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.090
 you can see from the others that are 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.290
 bigger than this and this one 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 we have a little 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.609
 the 6 with this allows us to have 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.859
 playback to the song here 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.329
 we reproduce we give you here drying 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.250
 automatically with a filter is to have 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.109
 than doing it manually the two things without 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.030
 have to do anything manual then 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.970
 this allows us to change from one side 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.150
 towards the other much easier and good 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:20.120
 this kind of joey discs the bran and 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.530
 attached to this to this turntable are 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.290
 too professional since you want 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.450
 the covenant that used the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.380
 larger turntables and this kind of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.380
 discs you can see in the sx that is the 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.690
 older sister and good that would be all 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.970
 friends do not forget to subscribe 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.959

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.959
