The Samsung Avant 
is what we would call an entry level phone
or perhaps the baby brother of the Samsung

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.040
Galaxy Series.
The specs of the device are exactly that,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.579
a mere spec in comparison to the new galaxy
s5 but it’s quite a decent choice in terms

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.190
of value for what it has to offer.
The screen is a low resolution 4.5 inch display

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.190
with a 5 megapixel camera. Running on android
4.4 with 1.2 GHz quad core processor inside.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.430
The phone looks similar to a typical Samsung
phone, with rounded corners and a black face

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.170
in the front and back. A silver colored rim
encircles around the edges and home button

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.149
of the device.
The feel of the phone has that leathery feeling

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.360
making it really comfortable to hold and does
an excellent job in deterring smudges.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.420
With a 4.5 inch screen, the Avant fits well
in your hands and pockets. It’s also very

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.289
easy to use with one hand. The density of
the phone is 245 PPI which in turn makes the

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.539
display a bit grainy and soft. The biggest
difference is that Samsung took away the AMOLED

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:25.869
technology and instead used a TFT LCD display.
The phone is difficult to see even when maxed

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.090
out in high levels of brightness, outdoors
makes it really hard to use. The device works

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.549
a lot better visually inside as the colors,
images, videos all look dull outside.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.529
The Avant weighs 4.8 ounces, much lighter
than many of the larger phones in the market.

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:43.049
The power/lock buttons are located on the
right hand side, volume is on the left, the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.369
headset jack is on the top and micro USB charging
port is at the bottom.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.149
The phone comes with a .3 megapixel front
facing camera and a 5 megapixel camera lens

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.149
with flash on the backside. The phone has
the capacity of expanding to a 64 GB micro

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.919
SD card.
The Avant also has NFC and Bluetooth 4.0 built

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:10.789
in giving you the ability to share content
with ease.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.220
The phone comes with My magazine newsfeed
built right in along with other extras. Some

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.220
of these features are screen mirroring, private
mode, easy interface user interface along

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.780
with power saving mode.
The Avant comes with a panorama, beauty face

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.780
and night mode features. The 720 HD video
is decent but faces issues such as clarity

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.780
and color reproduction.
Overall the phone is a perfect fit for anyone

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.700
looking for a budget android phone that can
do the basics and not cost an arm and a leg.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.469
It’s currently available for sale at T-Mobile
for and MetroPCS

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.469
