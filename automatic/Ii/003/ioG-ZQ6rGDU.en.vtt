AIDS and how important it is I got the
question<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:17.039> thought

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
question to do this and I just thought

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.670 
question to do this and I just thought
you<00:00:17.910> know<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.359> stupid<00:00:18.750> not<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.960> it's<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.500> great

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you know be stupid not to it's a great

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.470 
you know be stupid not to it's a great
campaign<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.400> for<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.609> good<00:00:20.699> cause<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
campaign it's for a good cause and I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
campaign it's for a good cause and I
think<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:21.900> actually<00:00:22.289> reaching<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> people

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
think it's actually reaching the people

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.660 
think it's actually reaching the people
that<00:00:23.789> need<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.630> information<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.410> most

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
that need this information the most

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.419 
that need this information the most
because<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:28.019> numbers<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.920> know<00:00:29.039> people

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
because the the numbers you know people

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.849 
because the the numbers you know people
getting<00:00:29.670> infected<00:00:29.820> are<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.650> getting<00:00:31.650> bigger

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
getting infected are just getting bigger

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.139 
getting infected are just getting bigger
and<00:00:32.009> bigger<00:00:32.130> every<00:00:32.250> year<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.669> thought<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
and bigger every year I thought it was a

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.670 
and bigger every year I thought it was a
really<00:00:33.360> good<00:00:33.600> thing<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.110> involved<00:00:34.380> in

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
materialistic and it really is about

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.170 
materialistic and it really is about
what's<00:02:33.800> on<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.040> outside<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.400> counts<00:02:34.790> but

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.210 
really it's about what's on the inside
and<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.120> all<00:02:38.300> know<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.630> so<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.650> decided<00:02:40.040> to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
and we all know that so I decided to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.800 
and we all know that so I decided to
take<00:02:40.370> my<00:02:40.640> insides<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.269> put<00:02:41.480> them<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
outside it's a bit confusing but I think

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.330 
outside it's a bit confusing but I think
people<00:02:44.360> understand<00:02:45.019> if<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.830> had<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.040> catch<00:02:46.190> me
