00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.550 
and song it so on the stack for 520 530
and<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:43.079> don't<00:01:43.200> even<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.380> how<00:01:43.470> much

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560

profit<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
profit that is but it's really really a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.999

how many people are doing it so if you
don't<00:01:59.640> want<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> because<00:02:00.750> everyone

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
don't want to do it because everyone

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.260 
don't want to do it because everyone
else<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.649> doing<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:03.090> other

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
else is doing it then my other

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.139 
else is doing it then my other
suggestion<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.320> buying<00:02:04.619> random<00:02:05.579> items

buying them as much because there's like

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.940 
buying them as much because there's like
the<00:02:30.700> incredible<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.480> they're<00:02:31.629> good<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.959> carol

skulls of goodness and all that crap but

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.809 
skulls of goodness and all that crap but
it's<00:02:35.200> still<00:02:35.440> sellable<00:02:36.010> people<00:02:36.430> still<00:02:36.670> buy

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.780 
them it's just I think the price is
going<00:02:40.480> down<00:02:40.569> so<00:02:41.049> whenever<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.190> see<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.549> parts

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
going down so whenever I see the parts

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.449 
going down so whenever I see the parts
going<00:02:43.000> down<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.450> i<00:02:43.780> buy<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.590> less<00:02:44.620> even<00:02:45.220> less

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
going down I i buy for less even less

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.190 
going down I i buy for less even less
than<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.940> already<00:02:46.120> used<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.540> buy<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:46.750> and
