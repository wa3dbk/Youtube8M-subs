the first thing you want to look at is

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.279 
the first thing you want to look at is
the<00:00:20.609> amount<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.910> kills<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.570> which<00:00:22.260> is

the amount of kills I have which is
approximately<00:00:23.060> 80,000<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.240> divide<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.320> by

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
approximately 80,000 and divide that by

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.519 
approximately 80,000 and divide that by
the<00:00:25.769> downs<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.849> which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.810> 110

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
the downs I have which is about 110

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.799 
the downs I have which is about 110
which<00:00:29.369> will<00:00:29.580> give<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.119> 75<00:00:32.120> 750<00:00:33.120> kills

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

for every down which is you know that is
a<00:00:37.170> good<00:00:37.469> kill<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.460> down<00:00:38.610> ratio<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
a good kill two down ratio and that is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.010 
a good kill two down ratio and that is
what<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.739> need<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.910> rank<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> don't
