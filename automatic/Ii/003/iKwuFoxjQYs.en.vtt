00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.750
 first we'll understand the water 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.689
 as a chemical substance substance and 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.150
 therefore a substance composed of what 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.019
 because it is formed by two elements 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 hydrogen and oxygen chemicals 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:36.180
 the water molecule has two atoms of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.800
 hydrogen and an oxygen atom h2o2 is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.930
 called a compound substance because it is 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.820
 formed by the two chemical elements 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.559
 It is important that we understand the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.010
 water molecule first 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.600
 the difference between these two elements 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.699
 hydrogen and oxygen they have a 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.320
 large difference in electronegativity 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.570
 electronegativity is the tendency of a 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.469
 atom attract electrons 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.030
 in this way the oxygen has high 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.090
 electronegativity attract many 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.340
 electrons the hydrogen has low 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 electronegativity ie it does not attract 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.590
 the electrons with so much force 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.979
 and what this generates generates a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.530
 very strong popularity pole reminds 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.880
 The aunt has a positive pole and a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.920
 negative pole 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 The water molecule also has a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 positive pole actually two poles 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.030
 positive than a negative pole 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.400
 reminds me that I said that oxygen attracts 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.640
 electrons very easily have 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.470
 high electronegativity so it ends 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.840
 attracting them by attracting the electrons to 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.759
 near him and the hydrogens 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.350
 getting away electrons 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.360
 the electron has negative charge and therefore 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.240
 oxygen gets a popularity 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 negative while the hydrogens are 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.250
 with positive popularity 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.280
 This is interesting, it only generates this 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.090
 polarity due to this angle 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.719
 formed does not even remember that water is a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.149
 molecule and this angle is that 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.360
 allows this polarity are strong 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.660
 and what this polarity will generate 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.750
 Look here 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.840
 the attraction between the poles the positive pole 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.300
 of a molecule of water attracts the pole 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 of another molecule of water and 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.590
 this has a very important name is the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.470
 the hydrogen bond of 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.640
 a molecule binds with oxygen from 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.610
 another molecule 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.850
 this causes the water molecules and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.340
 generating interact strongly with each other 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 two very important things 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.850
 first a surface tension 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.800
 Note that some mosquitoes can 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.230
 walk over love apple over a 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.270
 water surface because because the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.950
 water molecules will draw from a 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.310
 so strong way 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.500
 through this hydrogen bond that 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.960
 creates this surface tension 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.900
 something quite interesting is the 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:11.040
 next as the molecules are being 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.350
 attracted very strongly to 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.470
 separating them makes it more difficult 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.800
 means to separate them from the state 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.350
 liquid to the gaseous state 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.910
 now if it is not easy to move to the 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.920
 liquid state for the 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.930
 gaseous state it is necessary that the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.770
 temperature is high 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.410
 in this way the boiling temperature 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.709
 of the water or of the passage of the liquid 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.700
 for the gaseous is high around 100 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.190
 degrees Celsius 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.780
 that way we can 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.970
 chemically explain some 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.090
 physical properties of water 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.980
 good staff another property 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.180
 of water is the fact that it is a 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.640
 good 'regulatory term ie 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.800
 presents a property that allows 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.400
 than the medium where there is a large amount 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.190
 is a regulated intermediate 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.380
 thermal energy suit 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.390
 temperature very well 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.340
 something that has a lot of 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.830
 water is the human body 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.609
 looks only due to the large amount of 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.790
 water in the human body is possible 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.190
 homeostasis or the balance of 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.620
 the only one in your body with both 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.350
 on substances entering and leaving the 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.090
 water can solubilize these 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.820
 substances with large amounts of water 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.880
 cells in your blood in your 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.560
 permits tissue to hold a quantity 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.030
 of vitamins an amount of 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.460
 amino acids an amount of 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.980
 substances in the construction and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.400
 regulation of your body and also with 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.320
 relation to personal body temperature 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.770
 the human body needs to stay in a 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.690
 temperature of about 36 36.5 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.240
 degrees celsius if it were not for the large 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.340
 amount of water would be impossible to 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.220
 regular people at temperature because 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.500
 because the temperature outside would be 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.050
 variable in relation to our organism 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.330
 to be determinant in the temperature of the 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.640
 our body in another place where you 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.560
 also has water as an important 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.410
 regulatory task is in the forest 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.020
 in the Amazon rainforest there is a 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.870
 large amount of water vapor that 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.950
 water vapor that is vaporized from lakes 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.850
 rivers rises and when it reaches the 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.490
 trees 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.070
 this water condenses generating that we 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.410
 we call convection rains in 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.130
 certain points of the Amazon rainforest 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.600
 this causes that there organism forest 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.890
 Amazonian organism 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.230
 the Amazon forest biome it is 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.550
 regulated by the water at temperature is 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.990
 regulated by water 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.690
 so there you will not have a big 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.430
 thermal amplitude you have a low 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.470
 thermal amplitude, ie the 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.800
 temperatures in the Amazon remain 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.690
 always high is approximately 30 between 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.490
 25 and 30 degrees celsius will not have a 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.360
 large thermal amplitude as per 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.070
 example the deserts that at night are 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.560
 extremely cold and extremely day 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.910
 because the amount of 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.670
 water is small there 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.000
 and what is the physical property of 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.580
 water that allows this thermoregulation to 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.450
 heat specific personal value 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:27.060
 specific water one calorie per gram 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.820
 degrees celsius or to increase 1 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:32.060
 of the skies of a gram of water is 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.010
 needed a calorie 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.520
 what does this mean compared to 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:40.180
 metals that exhibit a greater variation 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.130
 thermal specific value of water is higher 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:45.200
 that is when the increase in heat 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.360
 specific substance 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:50.810
 has more specific heat it goes 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.810
 hold more heat or will have a 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:56.900
 lower thermal amplitude less variation 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:00.320
 temperature and water therefore due to 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:02.660
 this property allows the regulation of the 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:06.520
 your body and regulation for example 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.520
 of certain regions of the Amazon forest
