00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.330
 hello my name is light mireya I am from vineyard 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.270
 of the sea chile and today I'm going to 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.580
 teach how to make some flowers to say hello 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.670
 to mom's day but before passing 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.580
 this video I want in a special way 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.940
 say hello to my mom who is in talca ya 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.430
 who is over 80 and I want 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.010
 tell you first that I love her so much 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.469
 she for me is very important despite 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:36.219
 from the distance and I want her now 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:39.399
 see me like I do a little flower 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.050
 and that's why at the end of this video 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.399
 I'm going to see my blog, I'm not going to see the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.219
 principles as I do it in form 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:48.460
 usual now that I'm going to show you my 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.679
 days you will use the paper cones 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.620
 hygienic and the cones that we could 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.989
 have either of all of it 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.680
 or light in this case I here I have 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.830
 one of the light 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.800
 and those of paper and people are also going to 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:06.290
 need scissors color paints and 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.520
 here I have acrylic paintings too 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.490
 They can be nail polish skewers of 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.140
 brushes is basically then for 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.920
 to be able to make our flower because I am 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.140
 looking for an alusa cone because it's more 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.530
 in diameter is smaller than that of 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.640
 toilet paper already then here that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.110
 we make short 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.310
 a bit already about can 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:39.520
 be a little less than one centimeter and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.700
 Toilet paper also behave 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 of the same width and we put the edges 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.670
 important of what was done as a couple 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.240
 A) Yes 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.790
 now on this basis we can work on 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.560
 six aircraft that we have polished 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.840
 now to cut the fingers the hygienic 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.299
 to make it easier we are going to mark it 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.810
 to one side the other side we try not to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.380
 break the then we will go cutting 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.410
 what our petals are going to do 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.660
 right there 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.170
 and so 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.700
 Now I always say all things 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.030
 that people want to do in 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.460
 Amounts compare mind is better to dye 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.690
 the with aniline of clothes 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.830
 once this 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.250
 it's up to everyone if they want to do 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.250
 wholesale 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.600
 and so now for example that 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.780
 usually a cone was only 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.080
 cutting one by one 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.000
 but I usually take out six petals of 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.340
 I color each color first in half 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.100
 and is to vacate the divide into three parts 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.050
 day was doing it one by one 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 then once we already have these to the 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.870
 that we are going to go painting because not me in 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.930
 this case I will paint in pink already in 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 the centric part we are applying the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.069
 painting 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.930
 As I tell you, it's easier to dye it for 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.379
 the people who want to work it for 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.730
 selling it in quantities is easier 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:31.760
 take the whole choir and dye it and once 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.490
 dyeing is manipulated and once 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.780
 we have it painted we let it dry 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.580
 already 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.760
 I have good here that I have painted 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.250
 previously with this same tone and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.330
 then we will go painting also each 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.490
 one of the petals 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.090
 of what is going to be a petal of our 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.170
 flower once we have all many 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.700
 painted petals 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.800
 let's cut an extra one also for 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.349
 make our flower then let's go 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.840
 placing the part that is marked on 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.660
 we are going to leave it out and 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.389
 the part that goes inward which no 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.260
 we have marked it break we will go 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.260
 hitting here 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.080
 Now we can see us 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.740
 Now we can do is go as 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.740
 presenting the flower the petals so that 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.250
 we will not have one more inside 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.250
 outside 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.009
 and so we are going to see how we are going to be 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.760
 our flower so that we do not go to 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.250
 so 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.650
 let's apply the silicone and in this 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.170
 case I'm doing it with silicone the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.330
 children if they want to do it to the mother 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.380
 the best have also with the cold or 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.600
 white glue can do it from a 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.100
 day for another and let it rest 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.580
 silicone in with contact glue 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.070
 fast but the cold tail must be given 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.780
 his time and I advise children 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.320
 because this is a very appropriate craft 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.320
 for children 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.349
 they do it with white glue and so 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.009
 they do it with a few days of 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:24.169
 anticipation and that is also firm and 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:27.289
 now here then 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.069
 we take a skewer we put there 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.080
 first I'm going to put you here between two 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:36.139
 you two petals we are going to place a 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.599
 little bit of silicone and the skewer a 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.819
 little bit of silicone here on the tip 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.120
 just a little bit then we're going to 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:46.150
 enter here 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.700
 the skewer there and we 're going to keep it 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:52.030
 While pressed and while drying 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.330
 and we are going to put a 23 silicone 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:58.420
 between each petal 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:01.200
 this gives our flower firmness 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.200
 A) Yes 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.900
 there we are giving firmness we are going 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.729
 speaking union 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.930
 A) Yes 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:15.500
 then once we have our 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:20.320
 Armed flower we are going to place 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.320
 we have also painted a little circle 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:28.240
 now the sheet should be a little bit more 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.430
 narrow 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:36.060
 so they do not go too far in the stem 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.060
 of our 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:43.310
 the cutting of the 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:43.310
 paperboard 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.490
 ah 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:54.030
 there is now this flower pattern I hope 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.280
 would like to be a kindergarten assistant 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.680
 educators because also this kind of 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.530
 sina flower on the skewer can be occupied 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.970
 to make mobile for baby and here 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.950
 we are withdrawing all these surpluses 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.470
 of the remaining threads of the silicone 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.810
 and they realize how easy it is to be able to 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.180
 make a little flower to say hello 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.970
 so now I remind you of my blog that
