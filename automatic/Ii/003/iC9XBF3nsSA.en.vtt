once that section is nice and smooth you

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.180 
once that section is nice and smooth you
are<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:16.630> going<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.930> pull<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.290> directly<00:03:17.560> up<00:03:18.040> to

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
are just going to pull it directly up to

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.580 
are just going to pull it directly up to
the<00:03:18.220> center<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.850> cross<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.870> over<00:03:19.990> where<00:03:20.410> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
the center and cross it over where you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.140 
the center and cross it over where you
would<00:03:20.740> cross<00:03:21.010> those<00:03:21.280> bobby<00:03:21.490> pins<00:03:21.790> from<00:03:22.000> this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
would cross those bobby pins from this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.930 
would cross those bobby pins from this
front<00:03:22.510> section<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.310> actually<00:03:24.640> going<00:03:24.760> to

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
front section so it is actually going to

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.880 
front section so it is actually going to
go<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.360> other<00:03:25.540> side<00:03:26.080> and<00:03:26.440> then<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:26.740> can

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
go to the other side and then you can

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.300 
go to the other side and then you can
just<00:03:27.160> use<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> pin<00:03:27.850> to<00:03:28.500> tuck<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.650> under<00:03:30.010> those

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
just use a pin to tuck it under those

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.280 
just use a pin to tuck it under those
other<00:03:30.610> pins<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.210> that<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.630> pin<00:03:31.930> will<00:03:32.050> not<00:03:32.170> be

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
other pins so that the pin will not be

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.470 
other pins so that the pin will not be
visible<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:32.860> will<00:03:33.040> hold<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.370> place

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
visible but it will hold it in place

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.540 
visible but it will hold it in place
securely<00:03:40.890> now<00:03:41.890> I'm<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.160> repeating<00:03:42.400> that

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
securely now I'm just repeating that

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.850 
securely now I'm just repeating that
process<00:03:43.060> on<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.360> other<00:03:43.390> side<00:03:43.870> taking<00:03:44.560> it<00:03:44.740> from

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
process on the other side taking it from

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.800 
process on the other side taking it from
the<00:03:44.980> back<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.370> year<00:03:45.490> forward<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.150> then

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
the back of the year forward and then

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.290 
the back of the year forward and then
I'm<00:03:46.930> going<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.410> tease<00:03:47.950> it<00:03:48.190> spray<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.090> get

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
I'm going to tease it spray it and get

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.250 
I'm going to tease it spray it and get
it<00:03:49.420> nice<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.900> smooth<00:03:50.500> with<00:03:50.530> spray<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.260> then

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.360 
it nice and smooth with spray and then
we<00:03:53.380> are<00:03:53.500> going<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.740> repeat<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.190> process

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
we are going to repeat that process

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.520 
we are going to repeat that process
where<00:03:54.820> we're<00:03:54.910> gonna<00:03:54.970> pull<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.420> up<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.870> have<00:03:56.500> it

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
where we're gonna pull it up and have it

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.830 
where we're gonna pull it up and have it
cross<00:03:56.920> over<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.640> center<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.300> crisscross

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
cross over the center and crisscross

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.420 
cross over the center and crisscross
with<00:03:59.170> where<00:03:59.380> we<00:03:59.500> had<00:03:59.590> pulled<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.950> other<00:04:00.100> side

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
with where we had pulled the other side

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.010 
with where we had pulled the other side
and<00:04:00.730> then<00:04:01.180> you're<00:04:01.300> just<00:04:01.390> going<00:04:01.570> to<00:04:01.720> tuck<00:04:01.900> that

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020
