00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
this has been happening since the game

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.060 
this has been happening since the game
since<00:02:29.640> I<00:02:29.760> got<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> game<00:02:30.720> before<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.200> updates

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
since I got the game before the updates

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.180 
since I got the game before the updates
and<00:02:32.250> stuff<00:02:32.370> happened<00:02:33.920> sometimes<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> game

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and stuff happened sometimes the game

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.500 
and stuff happened sometimes the game
just<00:02:35.340> randomly<00:02:35.670> dashboards<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.450> know

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
just randomly dashboards you know

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.100

probably<00:02:37.500> happened<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.980> me<00:02:38.100> like<00:02:38.570> six<00:02:39.570> maybe

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
probably happened to me like six maybe

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.500 
probably happened to me like six maybe
six<00:02:40.440> times<00:02:40.710> in<00:02:40.920> total<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.910> sometimes<00:02:42.150> it's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
six times in total so sometimes it's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.030 
six times in total so sometimes it's
right<00:02:42.930> when<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.080> game<00:02:43.230> starting<00:02:43.650> sometimes

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
right when the game starting sometimes

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.010 
right when the game starting sometimes
in<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> middle<00:02:44.570> this<00:02:45.570> happened<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.930> other

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
in the middle this happened the other

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.860 
in the middle this happened the other
day<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.320> headshot<00:02:46.980> someone<00:02:48.080> like<00:02:49.080> saw<00:02:49.410> his<00:02:49.650> head

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
day I headshot someone like saw his head

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.660 
day I headshot someone like saw his head
like<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.020> shot<00:02:52.290> him<00:02:52.350> in<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.500> head<00:02:52.670> obviously

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
like I shot him in the head obviously

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.010 
like I shot him in the head obviously
headshot<00:02:53.970> there's<00:02:54.150> blood<00:02:54.480> coming<00:02:54.510> out<00:02:54.870> or

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.140 
headshot there's blood coming out or
something<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.400> dashboards<00:02:57.000> me

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
something and then it just dashboards me

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.770 
something and then it just dashboards me
so<00:02:57.390> that's<00:02:57.540> pretty<00:02:57.720> frustrating<00:02:58.320> because<00:02:58.470> I

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
so that's pretty frustrating because I

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.030 
so that's pretty frustrating because I
don't<00:03:00.780> know<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.900> was<00:03:01.170> like<00:03:01.440> it's<00:03:01.620> not<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
don't know I was like it's not like the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.590 
don't know I was like it's not like the
game<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.370> started<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.940> wasn't<00:03:03.210> literally

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
game just started and I wasn't literally

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.650 
game just started and I wasn't literally
in<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> middle<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.890> game<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:06.300> random

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
in the middle of the game so that random

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.930 
in the middle of the game so that random
dashboarding<00:03:07.170> got<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.560> fix<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.280> think

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
dashboarding got to fix that I think

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.270 
dashboarding got to fix that I think
some<00:03:09.090> other<00:03:09.150> people<00:03:09.270> with<00:03:09.570> an<00:03:09.660> experienced

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
some other people with an experienced

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.920 
some other people with an experienced
experiencing<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.430> also<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.450> think<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.780> game

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
experiencing that also I think this game

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.710 
experiencing that also I think this game
has<00:03:13.080> dedicated<00:03:13.260> servers<00:03:13.770> but<00:03:14.570> yesterday<00:03:15.570> has

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
has dedicated servers but yesterday has

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.720 
has dedicated servers but yesterday has
seen<00:03:15.960> people<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.380> lag<00:03:16.590> switches<00:03:17.130> or<00:03:17.370> something

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
seen people at lag switches or something

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.540 
seen people at lag switches or something
because<00:03:18.170> there<00:03:19.170> was<00:03:19.260> only<00:03:19.380> one<00:03:19.680> one<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.280> two

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
because there was only one one or two

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.950 
because there was only one one or two
people<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> whole<00:03:21.120> Lobby<00:03:21.510> with<00:03:21.780> good

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
people in the whole Lobby with good

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.630 
people in the whole Lobby with good
connections<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.680> they're<00:03:23.220> having<00:03:23.370> amazing

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
connections and they're having amazing

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.870 
connections and they're having amazing
scores<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.430> everyone<00:03:26.430> else<00:03:26.640> was<00:03:26.730> doing

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
scores so everyone else was doing

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.910 
scores so everyone else was doing
terribly<00:03:27.420> nobody<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:27.960> get<00:03:28.140> any<00:03:28.320> kills<00:03:28.530> sir

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
terribly nobody can get any kills sir

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.150 
terribly nobody can get any kills sir
you<00:03:29.910> just<00:03:30.090> died<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.330> lot<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:31.020> I<00:03:31.260> think<00:03:31.800> of<00:03:32.040> only

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
you just died a lot so I think of only

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.590 
you just died a lot so I think of only
like<00:03:32.400> one<00:03:32.580> or<00:03:32.610> two<00:03:32.730> kids<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.210> a<00:03:33.240> good

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
like one or two kids have a good

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.730 
like one or two kids have a good
connection<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.230> wanted<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.530> doing

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
connection and I wanted to doing

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.040 
connection and I wanted to doing
terrible<00:03:35.100> except<00:03:35.340> for<00:03:35.490> them<00:03:35.750> usually<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.780> think

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
terrible except for them usually I think

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.710 
terrible except for them usually I think
it's<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.230> lag<00:03:37.440> switch<00:03:37.470> or<00:03:38.480> just<00:03:39.480> something

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
it's a lag switch or just something

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.590 
it's a lag switch or just something
whatever<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.800> it<00:03:40.950> shouldn't<00:03:41.190> be<00:03:41.250> happening

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
whatever it is it shouldn't be happening

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.570 
whatever it is it shouldn't be happening
so<00:03:44.240> hopefully<00:03:45.240> they'll<00:03:45.420> fix<00:03:45.780> that

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
so hopefully they'll fix that

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.120 
so hopefully they'll fix that
now<00:03:48.540> get<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> dedicated<00:03:49.230> servers<00:03:49.590> back<00:03:49.740> up<00:03:49.950> or

other<00:06:31.550> games<00:06:31.789> do<00:06:31.970> this<00:06:32.150> but<00:06:32.449> you<00:06:32.690> download<00:06:33.349> the

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
other games do this but you download the

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.980 
other games do this but you download the
trial<00:06:33.710> it's<00:06:33.949> 60<00:06:34.310> minutes<00:06:34.639> but<00:06:35.389> um<00:06:35.570> it's<00:06:35.840> the

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
trial it's 60 minutes but um it's the

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.450 
trial it's 60 minutes but um it's the
same<00:06:36.199> exact<00:06:36.500> thing<00:06:36.650> as<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.889> full<00:06:37.070> game<00:06:37.220> and

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
same exact thing as the full game and

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.129 
same exact thing as the full game and
pretty<00:06:37.610> sure<00:06:37.789> his<00:06:38.539> I'm<00:06:38.690> where<00:06:38.840> I<00:06:38.900> had<00:06:39.050> the

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
pretty sure his I'm where I had the

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.810 
pretty sure his I'm where I had the
trial<00:06:39.470> and<00:06:39.740> I<00:06:39.800> was<00:06:39.919> playing<00:06:40.160> with<00:06:40.250> people<00:06:40.580> with

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
trial and I was playing with people with

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.500 
trial and I was playing with people with
the<00:06:40.940> full<00:06:41.150> game<00:06:41.710> so<00:06:42.910> then<00:06:43.910> your<00:06:44.090> friends<00:06:44.270> have

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510 
the full game so then your friends have

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.760 
the full game so then your friends have
it<00:06:44.660> you<00:06:44.750> can<00:06:44.780> play<00:06:45.080> with<00:06:45.199> them<00:06:45.380> without<00:06:45.590> having

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
it you can play with them without having

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.129 
it you can play with them without having
to<00:06:46.130> have<00:06:46.250> a<00:06:46.280> full<00:06:46.580> game<00:06:46.729> and<00:06:47.060> it's<00:06:47.510> 60<00:06:47.900> minutes

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
to have a full game and it's 60 minutes

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.770 
to have a full game and it's 60 minutes
of<00:06:48.260> game<00:06:48.440> time<00:06:48.470> so<00:06:49.130> being<00:06:50.030> the<00:06:50.120> lobbies<00:06:50.539> don't

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
of game time so being the lobbies don't

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.350 
of game time so being the lobbies don't
waste<00:06:50.930> that<00:06:51.020> time<00:06:51.430> so<00:06:52.430> 60<00:06:52.849> minutes<00:06:53.090> of<00:06:53.150> game

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
waste that time so 60 minutes of game

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.640 
waste that time so 60 minutes of game
time<00:06:53.389> that's<00:06:53.870> like<00:06:54.050> I<00:06:55.240> could<00:06:56.240> be<00:06:56.389> like<00:06:56.650> it's

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
time that's like I could be like it's

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.060 
time that's like I could be like it's
about<00:06:57.710> five<00:06:58.130> minutes<00:06:58.370> again<00:06:58.729> maybe<00:06:58.970> so<00:07:00.070> that's

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
about five minutes again maybe so that's

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.129 
about five minutes again maybe so that's
a<00:07:01.159> pretty<00:07:01.310> good<00:07:01.490> amount<00:07:01.639> of<00:07:01.789> games<00:07:05.020> so<00:07:06.020> I'd

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
a pretty good amount of games so I'd

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.029 
a pretty good amount of games so I'd
recommend<00:07:07.030> getting<00:07:08.030> this<00:07:08.270> trial<00:07:08.690> or<00:07:09.110> just

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 
recommend getting this trial or just

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.969 
recommend getting this trial or just
checking<00:07:10.310> out<00:07:10.400> some<00:07:10.520> videos<00:07:10.880> on<00:07:10.909> this<00:07:11.330> and<00:07:11.570> the

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
checking out some videos on this and the

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.439 
checking out some videos on this and the
montages<00:07:12.979> on<00:07:13.220> this<00:07:13.340> game<00:07:13.520> they're<00:07:13.789> not<00:07:13.940> that

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:14.449 
montages on this game they're not that

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.570 
montages on this game they're not that
great<00:07:14.720> so<00:07:15.080> hopefully<00:07:16.039> when<00:07:16.159> I<00:07:16.250> start<00:07:16.490> making

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
great so hopefully when I start making

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.839 
great so hopefully when I start making
my<00:07:16.699> montages<00:07:17.360> get<00:07:18.169> some<00:07:18.320> good<00:07:18.470> feedback<00:07:18.849> I've

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:19.849
