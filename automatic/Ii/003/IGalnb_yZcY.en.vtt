never had halo 3 and the first game I
got<00:00:16.680> 4x12<00:00:17.130> was<00:00:17.310> coal<00:00:17.520> Duty<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.180> always

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
got 4x12 was coal Duty so I was always

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.870 
got 4x12 was coal Duty so I was always
really<00:00:19.439> cold<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> oriented<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.640> still

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
really cold you the oriented I still

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.189 
really cold you the oriented I still
don't<00:00:21.029> really<00:00:21.240> understand<00:00:21.660> halo<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.020> much

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
don't really understand halo that much

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.019 
don't really understand halo that much
this<00:00:22.380> day<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.430> still<00:00:23.730> think<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.000> pretty

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
this day but I still think it's pretty

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.170 
this day but I still think it's pretty
fun<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.960> anyway<00:00:25.519> let's<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.670> started<00:00:27.029> with

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
fun but anyway let's get started with

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.660 
fun but anyway let's get started with
this<00:00:27.330> so<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.890> first<00:00:29.189> thing<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.400> want<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.580> do

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this so the first thing you want to do

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.250 
this so the first thing you want to do
is<00:00:29.789> go<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> your<00:00:30.090> daily<00:00:30.300> challenges<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
is go to your daily challenges and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.200 
is go to your daily challenges and
preferably<00:00:31.920> find<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> has<00:00:33.030> something

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
preferably find one that has something

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.479 
preferably find one that has something
to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.420> kills<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.950> one<00:00:35.160> could

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
to do with kills and so this one could

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
to do with kills and so this one could
kill<00:00:35.730> 100<00:00:36.120> enemies<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.630> any<00:00:36.809> game<00:00:37.050> mode<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
kill 100 enemies in any game mode and

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.040 
kill 100 enemies in any game mode and
reach<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.610> got<00:00:38.910> 99<00:00:39.329> kills<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
reach you can see I got 99 kills and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.240 
reach you can see I got 99 kills and
this<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> want<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.829> also<00:00:41.070> you

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this is what you want to do also you

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.190 
this is what you want to do also you
want<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.969> kill<00:00:42.239> less<00:00:42.629> than<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
want to get one kill less than what it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.279 
want to get one kill less than what it's
asking<00:00:43.350> because<00:00:43.890> sometimes<00:00:44.250> they'll<00:00:44.460> ask<00:00:44.610> for

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
asking because sometimes they'll ask for

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.430 
asking because sometimes they'll ask for
150<00:00:46.309> different<00:00:47.309> amounts<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.170> fairies<00:00:49.170> every

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
150 different amounts of fairies every

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
150 different amounts of fairies every
once<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.739> while<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.370> anyway<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.030> want<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
once in a while but anyway you want to

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180

get<00:00:51.449> one<00:00:51.870> less<00:00:52.110> kill<00:00:52.530> than<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:52.980> they're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
get one less kill than what they're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.060 
get one less kill than what they're
asking<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> I'll<00:00:55.559> explain<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.949> reason

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
asking for and I'll explain the reason

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.549 
asking for and I'll explain the reason
for<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.430> later<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.079> other<00:00:58.289> thing<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
for that later but the other thing I

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.279 
for that later but the other thing I
want<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> mention<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.309> credit<00:00:59.579> glitch<00:01:00.289> it

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
want to mention is this credit glitch it

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.560 
want to mention is this credit glitch it
works<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:01.739> any<00:01:01.949> challenge<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.090> want<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> do

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
works for any challenge you want to do

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.420 
works for any challenge you want to do
but<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.229> easiest<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.220> ones

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
but it's easiest to do with these ones

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.910 
but it's easiest to do with these ones
that<00:01:05.670> involve<00:01:05.939> kills<00:01:06.560> because<00:01:07.560> they're<00:01:07.770> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that involve kills because they're the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.760 
that involve kills because they're the
easiest<00:01:08.100> thing<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.700> versus<00:01:09.210> like<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
easiest thing to do versus like a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.050 
easiest thing to do versus like a
challenge<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.040> assassinate<00:01:11.850> three

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
challenge we have to assassinate three

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.620 
challenge we have to assassinate three
people<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.570> game<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.810> becomes<00:01:13.380> hard<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
people in one game that becomes hard to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.130 
people in one game that becomes hard to
do<00:01:15.630> over<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.960> over<00:01:16.080> again<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> main

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
do over and over again but the main

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
do over and over again but the main
premise<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> glitch<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.549> you're

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
premise of this glitch is that you're

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.969 
premise of this glitch is that you're
getting<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.600> challenge<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:22.860> you're

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
getting the challenge and then you're

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.310 
getting the challenge and then you're
disconnecting<00:01:23.549> from<00:01:23.580> Xbox<00:01:24.030> Live<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:24.990> still

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
disconnecting from Xbox Live which still

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
disconnecting from Xbox Live which still
gives<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.770> points<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.580> game<00:01:26.939> for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
gives you the points for that game for

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
gives you the points for that game for
the<00:01:27.479> challenges<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> reconnect<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the challenges but when you reconnect it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.319 
the challenges but when you reconnect it
tells<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.460> haven't<00:01:29.700> completed<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
tells you you haven't completed the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.700 
tells you you haven't completed the
challenge<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.229> keep<00:01:31.380> doing

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
challenge so you can just keep doing

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
challenge so you can just keep doing
that<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.070> that's<00:01:32.909> one<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> reasons<00:01:33.450> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that and that's one of the reasons you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.010 
that and that's one of the reasons you
just<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:34.100> 99<00:01:35.100> kills<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.270> see<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just get 99 kills so you can see here I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.210 
just get 99 kills so you can see here I
get<00:01:37.380> my<00:01:37.530> one<00:01:37.829> kill<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.689> old<00:01:40.530> Xbox

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
get my one kill and on the old Xbox

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.580 
get my one kill and on the old Xbox
that's<00:01:41.430> white<00:01:41.670> with<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.200> wireless<00:01:43.200> adapter

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that's white with the wireless adapter

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.080 
that's white with the wireless adapter
in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> back<00:01:43.920> or<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> Ethernet<00:01:44.640> cable<00:01:44.970> this

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
in the back or the Ethernet cable this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.219 
in the back or the Ethernet cable this
is<00:01:45.149> easiest<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
is easiest because you have to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.649 
is easiest because you have to
disconnect<00:01:46.740> yourself<00:01:46.860> from<00:01:47.159> live<00:01:47.460> via<00:01:48.450> your

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
disconnect yourself from live via your

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.719 
disconnect yourself from live via your
hardware<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.590> that's<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:50.159> pulling<00:01:50.579> your

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
hardware so that's like pulling your

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
hardware so that's like pulling your
Ethernet<00:01:51.060> cable<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.600> pulling<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> wireless

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
Ethernet cable or pulling the wireless

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.100 
Ethernet cable or pulling the wireless
adapter<00:01:52.740> out<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.240> easy<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> old

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
adapter out which is easy on the old

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
adapter out which is easy on the old
Xbox<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> only<00:01:56.250> problem<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> newer

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
Xbox but the only problem on the newer

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.149 
Xbox but the only problem on the newer
Xbox<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.930> know<00:01:58.170> most<00:01:58.530> people<00:01:58.619> probably<00:01:59.070> use

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
Xbox is I know most people probably use

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.260 
Xbox is I know most people probably use
Wi-Fi<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.200> there's<00:02:01.200> no<00:02:01.649> way<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.250> open<00:02:02.969> up

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
Wi-Fi and there's no way to like open up

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.190 
Wi-Fi and there's no way to like open up
your<00:02:03.450> Xbox<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.930> take<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> Wi-Fi<00:02:04.740> out<00:02:05.299> so<00:02:06.299> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
your Xbox and take the Wi-Fi out so to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.589 
your Xbox and take the Wi-Fi out so to
do<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.799> new<00:02:08.009> slim<00:02:08.520> Xbox<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.239> would<00:02:09.420> say

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
do it on the new slim Xbox I would say

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.669 
do it on the new slim Xbox I would say
you<00:02:09.660> probably<00:02:09.750> have<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.229> use<00:02:10.259> an<00:02:10.530> Ethernet

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
you probably have to use an Ethernet

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.170 
you probably have to use an Ethernet
cable<00:02:11.160> which

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
cable which

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.000 
cable which
a<00:02:12.209> couple<00:02:13.019> people<00:02:13.230> may<00:02:13.349> be<00:02:13.409> able<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.830> but

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
a couple people may be able to do but

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.570 
a couple people may be able to do but
most<00:02:14.220> people<00:02:14.580> probably<00:02:15.239> have<00:02:15.480> their<00:02:15.599> Xbox<00:02:16.580> not

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
most people probably have their Xbox not

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.330 
most people probably have their Xbox not
close<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:17.909> where<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.450> router<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:19.129> so<00:02:20.129> that

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
close to where the router is so that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.830 
close to where the router is so that
might<00:02:20.489> be<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.640> problem<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.060> new<00:02:21.180> Xbox<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:21.690> not

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
might be a problem the new Xbox I'm not

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.509 
might be a problem the new Xbox I'm not
positive<00:02:22.080> how<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.830> would<00:02:23.040> do<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> there's

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
positive how you would do it there's

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.970 
positive how you would do it there's
probably<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.849> way<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.840> not<00:02:24.959> sure<00:02:25.230> but

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
probably a way but I'm not sure but

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.039 
probably a way but I'm not sure but
anyway<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.459> see<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:27.150> disconnect<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.019> from

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
anyway you can see I disconnect it from

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.020 
anyway you can see I disconnect it from
live<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.620> quit<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.159> they<00:02:29.340> still<00:02:29.730> gave<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
live and quit and they still gave me the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.460 
live and quit and they still gave me the
credits<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.329> reason<00:02:33.840> for<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
credits and the reason for that is the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.479 
credits and the reason for that is the
one<00:02:34.560> thing<00:02:34.739> that's<00:02:34.920> cool<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.099> Halo<00:02:35.459> Reach

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
one thing that's cool about Halo Reach

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.880 
one thing that's cool about Halo Reach
is<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.909> can<00:02:36.060> still<00:02:36.239> gain<00:02:36.690> credits<00:02:37.230> offline

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
is you can still gain credits offline

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.339 
is you can still gain credits offline
from<00:02:38.819> my<00:02:39.000> campaign<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.659> stuff<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.110> even

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
from my campaign and stuff so even

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.990 
from my campaign and stuff so even
though<00:02:41.010> I'm<00:02:41.129> not<00:02:41.250> connected<00:02:41.670> they'll<00:02:41.819> still

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
though I'm not connected they'll still

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.030 
though I'm not connected they'll still
give<00:02:42.120> me<00:02:42.239> credits<00:02:42.629> but<00:02:43.140> as<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.620> when

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
give me credits but as you can see when

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.849 
give me credits but as you can see when
I<00:02:44.420> reconnect<00:02:45.420> alive<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:46.140> challenge<00:02:46.590> isn't

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
I reconnect alive the challenge isn't

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.869 
I reconnect alive the challenge isn't
complete<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.670> that's<00:02:48.569> what<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.900> want<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.349> so

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
complete and that's what you want and so

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.520 
complete and that's what you want and so
now<00:02:50.879> I'll<00:02:51.060> get<00:02:51.209> into<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.510> reason<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.900> get<00:02:52.049> 99

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
now I'll get into the reason you get 99

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.610 
now I'll get into the reason you get 99
kills<00:02:52.829> and<00:02:54.379> say<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:57.930> can<00:02:58.109> see<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
kills and say so you can see the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.530 
kills and say so you can see the
challenge<00:02:58.980> didn't<00:02:59.280> count<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.730> say<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.090> played

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
challenge didn't count so say I played

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.140 
challenge didn't count so say I played
firefight<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.470> all<00:03:01.680> all<00:03:01.950> 100<00:03:02.549> kills<00:03:02.819> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
firefight I got all all 100 kills and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.140 
firefight I got all all 100 kills and
then<00:03:03.900> disconnected<00:03:04.500> from<00:03:04.590> life<00:03:04.760> not<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:06.030> of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
then disconnected from life not one of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.180 
then disconnected from life not one of
those<00:03:06.269> hundred<00:03:06.510> kills<00:03:06.870> would<00:03:07.079> count<00:03:07.349> so<00:03:08.040> when

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
those hundred kills would count so when

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.099 
those hundred kills would count so when
I<00:03:08.220> reconnected<00:03:08.909> in<00:03:09.180> order<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.690> do<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.930> glitch

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
I reconnected in order to do the glitch

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.839 
I reconnected in order to do the glitch
again<00:03:10.290> I'll<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.859> play<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.459> all<00:03:11.670> 100

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
again I'll have to play and get all 100

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.229 
again I'll have to play and get all 100
kills<00:03:12.239> again<00:03:12.829> versus<00:03:13.829> me<00:03:14.010> getting<00:03:14.459> 99<00:03:14.940> kills

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
kills again versus me getting 99 kills

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.360 
kills again versus me getting 99 kills
and<00:03:15.510> backing<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:15.989> where<00:03:16.290> it<00:03:16.410> saves<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.950> 99

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
and backing out where it saves the 99

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.650 
and backing out where it saves the 99
kills<00:03:17.639> I<00:03:17.930> can<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.200> lose<00:03:19.530> one<00:03:19.980> kill<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.180> what

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
kills I can just lose one kill so what

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.360 
kills I can just lose one kill so what
I'm<00:03:21.750> saying<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.260> say<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:24.500> got<00:03:25.500> all<00:03:25.739> 100<00:03:26.130> kills

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
I'm saying is say you got all 100 kills

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.819 
I'm saying is say you got all 100 kills
and<00:03:26.549> disconnected<00:03:27.060> from<00:03:27.150> live<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:27.870> did<00:03:28.590> this

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
and disconnected from live and did this

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.759 
and disconnected from live and did this
it<00:03:29.250> would<00:03:29.549> not<00:03:30.419> recognize<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.290> got<00:03:31.500> any

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
it would not recognize that you got any

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.190 
it would not recognize that you got any
