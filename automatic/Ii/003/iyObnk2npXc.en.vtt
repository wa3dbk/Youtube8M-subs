00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:15.019
 this is where the off-road vehicles belong in 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.490
 the mountains of austria in germany 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.980
 you actually had the modern suv 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.170
 No long life predicted 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.870
 big to hard sighs too much 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.700
 but they are there since the first m 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.040
 class through the film Jurassic Park drove 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.510
 and now she almost belongs herself 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.190
 to the dinosaurs 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.900
 after all , the m is already missing in the 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.989
 third generation in front of mercedes m class 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.250
 has one in all generations 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.900
 characteristic design says at least 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.560
 mercedes as i get the first pictures 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.570
 have seen 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.070
 from the new m-class I had short 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 my doubt I thought oh my 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.950
 God please not a suv with 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.600
 Asian taillights 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.399
 even if the Mercedes drove up 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.040
 looked at it because many were afraid 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.780
 all sang young-like tail I can 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.550
 calm him down when you're in front of it live 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.710
 then this car really looks after 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.719
 mercedes from only large robust looks 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.159
 luxurious and he has a few lucky ones 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.930
 corners and edges is not quite that round 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.229
 sucked like the competition in this 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.250
 class outwardly new and still with 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.409
 recognition value 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.450
 similarly it looks like under the hood 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.670
 the m class new but mercedes already 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.280
 known from the daimler shelf comes the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.860
 2 2 liter four cylinder diesel as new 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
 basic version the spar miracle weapon 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.900
 replaces the three-liter six-cylinder of the 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.030
 the predecessor has our test car 204 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.700
 ps and manages to sprint to 100 in 9 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.070
 seconds peak 210 on the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.760
 datasheet the most exciting is but the 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.500
 consumption 6.0 liters according to eu cycle 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.090
 we're talking about a car over here 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.400
 Two tons of empty weight on the scales 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.080
 brings 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.759
 when you with this little four-cylinder 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.470
 diesel in the m class is on the way 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.210
 then you are actually surprised how 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.790
 good this engine with that very much 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.170
 big and heavy car clearly comes with 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 normal traffic is noticeable 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.390
 not that such a small diesel 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.340
 inside is if you then overtake if you 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.840
 times on gas occurs then it gets louder 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.240
 then the engine also acts strained 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 as a six-cylinder but basically 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 the fitzel in the perfect enough 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.099
 especially if you have the consumption 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 take note because mercedes gives those 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.459
 six liters in the eu cycle 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.250
 We all know that in everyday life hardly 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.510
 but we are now almost 180 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.730
 kilometer already on the way with this 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.390
 car and we are still at 6.8 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 liters 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.970
 that is just as little as on the 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.040
 Street has to be the m-class off the beaten track 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.110
 hide the paved terrors 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.819
 Mercedes has the designer off-road vehicle 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 quite serious hope 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.470
 properties with on the way given 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.790
 most owners of a class 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.690
 will probably never be in the field 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.120
 be on the move 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.460
 but the psychological moment counts 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.030
 this i could feel if i wanted 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.040
 that is have installed as standard 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.670
 As standard, a new departure was the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.140
 very easy by pressing a button tell the times 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.430
 mountain in a certain small 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.260
 speed range defense at very 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.500
 steep passages or lanes 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.810
 they set a 23 km h they go from 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.910
 brake pedal and he leads her over that 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.600
 Feed over the boulders effortlessly there 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.700
 wherever you want 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.980
 or think an offroad package 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.740
 we offer the customer a program 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.690
 based on the air spring that six 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.420
 driving programs has trailer operation 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.040
 sports farm small terrain large 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.590
 terrain and the customer really has for 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.790
 all things are always life's 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.820
 right program without it easy too 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.100
 Just use but yes please with the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.320
 luxury needed mercedes for 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.760
 the interior made after being in 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.470
 the past years more often 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.170
 they had to take criticism 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.970
 the m class visibly increased 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.989
 comfortable and noble the living room 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.720
 feeling is back 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.730
 a living room of luxury and modern 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.680
 now even with internet access 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.120
 otherwise, of course, all can be 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.300
 order extras to the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.290
 Traffic sign recognition spacers 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.170
 Lane assistant and what else 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.370
 to be found in the price list 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.550
 mercedes wants to return with the m-class 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.230
 where you have been before at place 1 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:14.000
 the sv list 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.010
 the new m-class is probably the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.990
 comfortable the suv on the market too 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.370
 thanks to the air suspension meanwhile 

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.380
 but also belongs to the sportier ones 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.720
 suv he has a roll compensation of the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.550
 lateral tilt prevents and there is one 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.360
 adaptive suspension what to sport 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.220
 can switch 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.960
 for this, the engines have more power than 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.310
 at the predecessor with lower consumption 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.840
 especially of course 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.820
 four-cylinder diesel here under the 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.260
 Hood is that means this car is with 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.510
 every generation really better 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.300
 have become and now very close 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.660
 at perfection if so if the price 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.660
 would not be 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.260
 the base costs just under 55,000 euros 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.090
 saying that are over 100000 mark can 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.980
 we probably save ourselves because actually was 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.270
 in the classic always expensive in the 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.190
 Compared to the predecessor, she has 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.050
 In any case, only a few euros increased 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.419
 at that time still with six instead 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.010
 but you will miss four cylinders 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.260
 the two lost pots probably more 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.270
 not the new m class has everything 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.889
 she needs success and us 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.389
 we are sure it will not be the last 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.389
 have been generation
