00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.520
 Eh: Come here, Donghae-ah. Rw: Yes. Sit there. 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.760
 Dh: Is not it here? Eh: The cameras are there. 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.240
 Eh: How long have you done live broadcasts? (sarcasm) 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.460
 Rw: So, who would you like to play with, Eunhyuk or Donghae? 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.820
 Fan: With Eunhyuk oppa. Rw: Great! 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.980
 Dh: That means I can take off my headphones, right? 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.200
 Eh: And you can take off all your clothes, too. 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.240
 Rw: What? Fan: Pfft. 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.400
 Mc: It seems that these two like each other. Eh: That's true. 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.660
 I was watching the broadcast before I got here and they were doing a lot of skinship. 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.880
 Rw: Donghae ... Eunhyuk ... what did you say a while ago? 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:14.820
 I do not know if I should say this, but those two could be misinterpreted. A lot of love and a lot of skinship. 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 Mc: Are they like this all the time? Rw: Yes, they are. 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.900
 Mc: Do you happen to like each other? RW: Apparently yes. 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.980
 All our members (super junior) like to skinship. American style. 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.420
 Fan says: "Donghae looks so tired, Eunhyuk, please hit him to wake him up." Dh: Nooooo. I'm not. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.100
 Dh: Then your mission is to hit me, right? 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.080
 Rw: What are you two doing? Is it a mission?
