00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 welcome all viewers of the channel whether 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.090
 crazy motion i actually a little bit he 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.660
 recovered here flu viruses which 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.800
 massively hit our country and decided 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.020
 back to the reviews means now i'm 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.310
 finished shooting a cartoon about sports 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.340
 as you saw in the trailer I shot pro 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.179
 fencing and I decided to show and the scene from 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.070
 of this cartoon and make a review on 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.980
 homemade on the stadium which I have 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.020
 starred means I generally do not really like 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.980
 do homemade extremely rarely do it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:44.250
 well and decided to show what stadium me 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 turned out then let's look at 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 I attached the scene to the scene itself 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 scotch to the table so that the scene did not go 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.070
 during filming in general from all 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.049
 if masking tape stick that time 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.600
 filming the scene is not twitching and it seems like 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.200
 masking tape comes off easily and not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.960
 spoils not a chair not lego so not a shield we are from 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 let's first take a look at 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.240
 viewers on this side means the podium 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.610
 I had one in a cartoon like 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.189
 as if there are 2 of them, but in fact I am this one 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.880
 tribune just moving like this 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 Initially, the camera is removed as 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.689
 like a podium on one side then 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.689
 the camera moves smoothly and I'm unnoticed 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.689
 I rearrange 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.299
 and the tribune seems to be there to this 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.579
 a figurine flew and a tribune 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.329
 turns on the other hand so 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.049
 tribune is actually one 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:54.959
 So on viewers along with the tribune 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.859
 I got the audience not really 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:05.219
 start shooting but got me such 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:08.310
 here is a poster of Russia ahead yes you see means 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.500
 it turned out the part that cheers for 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.349
 Russian fencer for the Russian 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.860
 athlete but at the same time same 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.120
 the poster if we turn it over 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.629
 german goal and 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
 and as you guessed it means that 2 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:29.970
 athlete rival of ours 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:32.069
 he was from germany themselves correct 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.680
 viewers you see joyful now stand 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.060
 throwing up his hands 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.430
 apparently something happened a good moment 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.709
 filming I do not remember what time it was 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.970
 or them then just to the shot than 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.280
 the viewer here are different figures I wanted 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.019
 I have several tribunes of such kind 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.150
 just details on the stands themselves are not 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.109
 enough because the parts left 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.940
 left here almost a monolith here with 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.669
 small protrusions on practically 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.130
 monolith I made all the tribune and because 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.680
 this much detail has been spent 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.700
 does this mean the first stand of the audience 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.419
 which is quite simple now myself 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.120
 stadium 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:17.569
 from the second stand means at the stadium 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:21.150
 we have a video camera tower 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.459
 further from reporters we have a photographer 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.880
 who photographed all that 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.880
 happens 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.230
 There is a videographer who shot 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.610
 sporting events and there are generally 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.790
 separate 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.630
 the rack is such a large video camcorder with 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.760
 backlighting it all from the pro movie kit by 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.580
 in general, they were filming 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.940
 sports competition further us well 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.560
 cheerleaders 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.840
 they are just like that several times a frame 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.780
 fell further you see a score of 3 2 but this 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.280
 It turned out a spoiler and I think below 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.930
 that so guessed that the Russian 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.140
 athlete won now you know with 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:14.750
 what account means my participation in 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:18.049
 filming 3 figures about two of them I tore out 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.140
 joints one generally crippled in order 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.310
 so that the hand takes the correct posture for 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.920
 swordsman retreated to the side and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.520
 the swordsman could keep straight his sword or 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.710
 rapier had to turn out and 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.130
 this figure even has a little there 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.320
 break off the brush because in his 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.850
 original form 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:46.400
 Oleg figurines very difficult to remove 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.950
 fencing physically figurine just isn't 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.880
 allows you to make those movements that 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:54.160
 need swordsman 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.030
 that is, so the sword that figure stood 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.080
 sides and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.460
 the sword so introduced up and down 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.430
 This Lego is of course never 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.800
 It turns out well, more precisely, but when 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.990
 the presence of scissors 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:15.860
 and plasticine that I actually did 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:18.409
 as it is in the fencers called i don't 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.470
 in the course may be the podium may not 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:25.099
 podium but shorter here it is on this 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.960
 parts of the competition went here they are with me 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.759
 and fought 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.099
 green and red light bulbs which 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:34.280
 caught fire at the moment when someone wore 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:37.909
 a shot from the board 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:42.590
 remove is 2 tribunes in my opinion 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:47.210
 no tribune right here left flags 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:51.919
 Michel H spoon remove from the left and figures 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:54.620
 each sits on a stool about 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:57.129
 the central tribune can be said that her 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:01.490
 did the same method 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:03.830
 completely monolithic structure on 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.659
 over the entire length here everything is crammed 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.650
 dice, therefore, also a large number 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:12.289
 items was spent different color not 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.150
 learned how to build more to save 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:17.870
 parts due to the supporting parts 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:21.949
 bridges of some kind and on this central 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.319
 view of the tribune is the VIP-bed of vepa 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:28.630
 us here the door opens up the stairs 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:30.979
 We can climb the back wall is removed and 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.830
 figures can be put removes here 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:38.750
 for some reason, Santa Claus with two houses in 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.349
 companies and their closing there in general is 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.500
 such here 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:45.039
 VIP box and one girl for some reason 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.930
 the match stood on the steps 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.120
 probably all about this homemade 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.060
 I will now disassemble it because 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.860
 that the shooting ended 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.139
 cartoon from filmed now I do the installation and 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.930
 Soon he will appear 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:01.169
 a certain pilot project of sports 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.749
 cartoon if 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:06.900
 interest will then do next 

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:09.990
 ideas about boxing take off about athletics 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.050
 but then how will it go in parallel 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.840
 now by the way for those who are waiting for the third 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:19.229
 a series of the walking dead will say that the work 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.860
 already underway the script started I'm kinda like 

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.990
 and scrambled and began to build scenery under 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.330
 shooting 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.610
 so but here on the review of this homemade 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.550
 I probably completed it with me 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.499
 trial short reviewer to after 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.139
 disease check more 

00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:39.449
 voices as far as I can 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:42.599
 today it means everyone congratulations to all 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:44.759
 end of the work week friday hooray 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:47.249
 so now quickly mount 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:49.620
 obzorchik and I will shoot walking 

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:53.029
 dead all so everyone see you 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.029
 see you happy bye
