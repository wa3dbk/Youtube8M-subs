00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.040
 in today's video I'm going to do a review 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.550
 for all the books of the 1.5 including 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.830
 both visual and network tort I'm going to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.620
 put also a well-known trick 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.400
 or two and well these muscles have gone 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.710
 finding therefore playing and nothing 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.790
 truth is that this version is full 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.700
 of books and a lousy performance and for 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.530
 that I've decided to make the video and it's already 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.260
 taking advantage of that I did not have any video 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.300
 so special for the 100 subscribers 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.400
 Well, this is going to be the special 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.900
 subscribers and nothing guys I hope that you 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.900
 like and we are going to ban 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.960
 how will you know from 1.5 the performance 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.190
 of minecraft has come down a lot this is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.440
 must because they have changed the engine 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.659
 graphic and good can be solved of 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.150
 a very easy way that would be changing 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.100
 that file by installing a mod like 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.750
 it could be active to it good what 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.050
 you will have to that the description or in the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.050
 video 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.870
 since version 1.5 most of 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.450
 users has this bug and schwank that 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.210
 renders and makes the lines of 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.610
 the blocks and good as you can see 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.890
 they are only visible in some types of 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.460
 blocks for example in wood not what 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.080
 is and also the torches and other kind of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.080
 blocks that are three-dimensional 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.910
 this bus as MollÃ  said and according to the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.880
 Last snapshot will be solved and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.680
 solved in the last prison that will be 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.680
 the 1.5 point 1 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.630
 well this trick is well known 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.210
 but I wanted to put it in the video and 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.430
 good is that building this 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.070
 mechanism we will be able to see the ground 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.030
 as if we had a mold x-ray the 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.040
 truth is that I like in itself 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.670
 build and does not have a very resources 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.670
 elevated 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.910
 with this trick we will be able to transport 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.800
 items in a very cheap way and one 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.900
 pretty simple and simple way of 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.480
 understand good this have all been 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.730
 many visual tricks and now we're going to 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.280
 go to the redstone books in the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.180
 that I will not explain any with voice in 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.010
 off and if I explain some will be some 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.019
 I have to explain why it's more 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.019
 complex so nothing let's see them 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.490
 many reston tricks and tutorials have 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.949
 stopped working like this one this 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.630
 video this tutorial I uploaded to the channel 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.180
 a long time ago but as you can see it has stopped 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.889
 work and when I blink I do not know which one is 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.669
 the application 10 but that is solved 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.669
 in the next versions 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.449
 and nothing guys this has been the video of 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.579
 today the truth is that they have taken me 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.979
 enough time to do it because I had to 

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:33.509
 go looking for a soap and good all those 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.549
 things that we have to record my voice on 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.549
 off and maybe you have noticed that there is a 

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:39.989
 little cold constipated and nothing 

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:43.499
 also thank you because we are 

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:45.209

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:47.279
 I know why the account does not take it 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:49.619
 exactly to the day I do not know when I'm going to 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:53.579

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:55.889
