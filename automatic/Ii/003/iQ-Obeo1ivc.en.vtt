just<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> cannon<00:01:59.090> I'm<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> add<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.719> or

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
just the cannon I'm going to add on or

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.639 
just the cannon I'm going to add on or
I'm<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.939> spawn<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.390> march<00:02:03.750> 33<00:02:04.259> atomic

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
I'm going to spawn in a march 33 atomic

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.000 
I'm going to spawn in a march 33 atomic
and<00:02:04.909> a<00:02:05.909> mark<00:02:06.060> 33<00:02:06.450> propellant

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
and a mark 33 propellant

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.180 
and a mark 33 propellant
and<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.760> will<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.350> move<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.500> around<00:02:10.650> here<00:02:10.980> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
and I will just move this around here I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.040 
and I will just move this around here I
didn't<00:02:11.820> actually<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.390> last<00:02:12.630> time<00:02:12.780> but<00:02:12.990> I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
didn't actually do this last time but I

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.440 
didn't actually do this last time but I
figured<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.890> out<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.310> after<00:02:14.520> doing<00:02:15.240> that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
figured it out like after doing that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.930 
figured it out like after doing that
video<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:16.050> could<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:16.980> weld<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.520> propellant

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
video I could just weld the propellant

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.650 
video I could just weld the propellant
onto<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:19.400> onto<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.490> back<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> shell<00:02:21.480> so

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
onto the onto the back of the shell so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.010 
onto the onto the back of the shell so
I'm<00:02:21.720> going<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:24.740> read<00:02:25.740> yep<00:02:27.020> so

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
I'm going to do just that I read yep so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.320 
I'm going to do just that I read yep so
now<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.590> shout<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:29.880> like

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
loaded up and ready to go um let's see I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.810 
loaded up and ready to go um let's see I
will<00:02:34.680> try<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:34.920> be<00:02:35.010> incredibly<00:02:35.250> careful<00:02:35.610> with

will try and be incredibly careful with

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.520 
will try and be incredibly careful with
this<00:02:38.360> first<00:02:39.360> off<00:02:39.540> I'm<00:02:39.690> going<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.930> activate

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
this first off I'm going to activate

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.390 
this first off I'm going to activate
this<00:02:40.830> by<00:02:41.040> pressing<00:02:41.310> E<00:02:42.980> okay<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
this by pressing E okay so that's it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120 
this by pressing E okay so that's it
armed<00:02:44.730> and<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:46.260> swear<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> God<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.710> this<00:02:46.950> blows

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
armed and I swear to God if this blows

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.560 
armed and I swear to God if this blows
up<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.460> I'm<00:02:47.580> trying<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.910> put<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.210> into<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
up when I'm trying to put it into the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.660 
up when I'm trying to put it into the
cannon<00:02:48.900> Oh<00:02:49.850> looks<00:02:50.850> like<00:02:50.910> it<00:02:51.120> might<00:02:52.400> go<00:02:53.400> got<00:02:53.610> to

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
cannon Oh looks like it might go got to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.910 
cannon Oh looks like it might go got to
be<00:02:53.730> incredibly<00:02:53.880> careful<00:02:54.270> with<00:02:54.540> how<00:02:54.690> I<00:02:54.830> put<00:02:55.830> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
be incredibly careful with how I put the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.700 
be incredibly careful with how I put the
shell<00:02:56.130> into<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.550> cannon<00:02:58.640> hey<00:02:59.640> there<00:03:00.210> we<00:03:00.270> go<00:03:00.710> so

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
shell into the cannon hey there we go so

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.790 
shell into the cannon hey there we go so
that's<00:03:01.920> all<00:03:02.250> oh<00:03:03.500> um

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800

okay<00:03:12.740> Wow<00:03:13.430> okay<00:03:20.470> didn't<00:03:21.470> make<00:03:21.680> any<00:03:21.860> effects

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
okay Wow okay didn't make any effects

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:31.750 
okay Wow okay didn't make any effects
for<00:03:22.280> some<00:03:22.340> reason<00:03:22.730> um<00:03:25.630> huh<00:03:28.480> right<00:03:30.580> let's<00:03:31.580> try

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
for some reason um huh right let's try

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.840 
for some reason um huh right let's try
that<00:03:31.880> again

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
that again

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.280 
that again
it<00:03:34.850> killed<00:03:35.180> all<00:03:35.360> three<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.600> them<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:35.750> there<00:03:36.170> so

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
it killed all three of them so there so

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.490 
it killed all three of them so there so
that's<00:03:36.500> a<00:03:36.560> conclusive<00:03:36.890> result<00:03:37.340> right<00:03:37.430> there

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
that's a conclusive result right there

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.540 
that's a conclusive result right there
it<00:03:39.500> should<00:03:39.710> it<00:03:39.830> should<00:03:40.010> have<00:03:40.220> made<00:03:40.340> like<00:03:40.520> a

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
it should it should have made like a

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.310 
it should it should have made like a
really<00:03:40.820> cool<00:03:41.030> mushroom<00:03:41.990> cloud<00:03:42.200> and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
really cool mushroom cloud and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.340 
really cool mushroom cloud and
everything<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:44.450> what<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.630> wanted<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:44.990> do<00:03:45.140> was

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
everything so what I wanted to do was

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.080 
everything so what I wanted to do was
unfree<00:03:45.740> to<00:03:45.890> that<00:03:46.040> I<00:03:46.570> think<00:03:47.570> no<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:48.200> will

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
unfree to that I think no I will

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.300 
unfree to that I think no I will
no<00:03:50.090> we'll<00:03:50.330> take<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:51.020> propellant<00:03:51.740> and<00:03:51.860> weld<00:03:52.190> it

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
no we'll take the propellant and weld it

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.780 
no we'll take the propellant and weld it
on<00:03:53.020> rather<00:03:54.020> than<00:03:54.260> risk<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.590> any<00:03:54.740> color<00:03:55.490> blue

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
on rather than risk in any color blue

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.530 
on rather than risk in any color blue
there<00:03:56.060> there<00:03:56.570> we<00:03:56.660> go<00:03:57.970> okay<00:03:58.970> I'm<00:03:59.300> just<00:03:59.450> gonna

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
there there we go okay I'm just gonna

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.960 
there there we go okay I'm just gonna
clip<00:04:00.230> into<00:04:00.470> here<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:02.260> arm<00:04:03.260> them<00:04:03.500> as<00:04:03.590> well

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
clip into here and arm them as well

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.230 
clip into here and arm them as well
there<00:04:04.970> we<00:04:05.090> go

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
there we go

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.650 
there we go
right<00:04:06.200> I'm<00:04:08.440> gonna<00:04:09.440> try<00:04:09.710> this<00:04:09.770> again<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.450> we're

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
right I'm gonna try this again so we're

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.230 
right I'm gonna try this again so we're
going<00:04:11.750> to<00:04:11.810> go<00:04:11.960> over<00:04:11.990> to<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.320> wire<00:04:12.440> tab<00:04:12.680> and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
going to go over to the wire tab and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.070 
going to go over to the wire tab and
like<00:04:14.240> last<00:04:14.420> time<00:04:14.570> we're<00:04:14.720> going<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.900> make<00:04:14.990> a

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
like last time we're going to make a

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.060 
like last time we're going to make a
Leever<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:16.450> minimum<00:04:17.450> value<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.989> zero<00:04:18.350> maximum

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
Leever a minimum value is zero maximum

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.250 
Leever a minimum value is zero maximum
value<00:04:19.430> no<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:20.210> max<00:04:20.630> wait<00:04:20.930> what

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
value no it max wait what

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.450 
value no it max wait what
all<00:04:22.100> right<00:04:22.430> I<00:04:22.460> put<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:22.820> like<00:04:22.850> back<00:04:23.090> to<00:04:23.210> run<00:04:23.450> ah

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
all right I put it like back to run ah

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.890 
all right I put it like back to run ah
let's<00:04:25.460> see<00:04:25.610> here<00:04:27.580> let's<00:04:28.580> see<00:04:28.790> maximum<00:04:29.630> value

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
let's see here let's see maximum value

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.980 
let's see here let's see maximum value
one<00:04:30.020> point<00:04:30.260> zero<00:04:30.350> minimum<00:04:31.160> value<00:04:31.600> zero<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.990> no

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
one point zero minimum value zero so no

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.750 
one point zero minimum value zero so no
that<00:04:36.350> should<00:04:36.560> work<00:04:37.040> like<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:39.190> yep<00:04:40.220> so<00:04:40.580> that's

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
that should work like that yep so that's

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.750 
that should work like that yep so that's
one<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.300> then<00:04:41.690> that's<00:04:42.260> zero<00:04:43.180> roughly<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.920> we

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
one and then that's zero roughly so we

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.310 
one and then that's zero roughly so we
can<00:04:46.910> just<00:04:47.090> put<00:04:47.420> that<00:04:47.450> back<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.020> neutral

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
can just put that back to the neutral

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.550 
can just put that back to the neutral
position<00:04:48.440> for<00:04:48.830> that<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:51.140> what<00:04:51.290> I'm<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.500> to

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
position for that and what I'm going to

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.310 
position for that and what I'm going to
do<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.860> I'm<00:04:52.430> going<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.670> take<00:04:52.970> yeah<00:04:53.360> we<00:04:53.480> go<00:04:53.720> back

do is I'm going to take yeah we go back

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.370 
do is I'm going to take yeah we go back
to<00:04:54.440> wire<00:04:54.560> and<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.520> wire<00:04:56.420> advant<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.170> have<00:04:57.260> the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
to wire and the wire advant you have the

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.600 
to wire and the wire advant you have the
advanced<00:04:57.650> wiring<00:04:58.070> -<00:04:58.190> aw<00:04:58.220> that's<00:04:58.400> what<00:04:58.550> I'm

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
me the special effects this time put

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.160 
me the special effects this time put
over<00:05:19.200> that<00:05:19.230> way<00:05:19.500> it's<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:20.130> zero<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.240> then<00:05:21.480> if<00:05:22.080> I

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.170 
over that way it's a zero and then if I

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:42.430 
over that way it's a zero and then if I
do<00:05:22.320> this<00:05:24.800> right<00:05:25.800> let's<00:05:26.130> see<00:05:26.250> what<00:05:26.400> happens
