00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi how about friends of coll gamer them 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.589
 Andy talks and we continue with dragon ball 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.059
 z to battle z we have that we have a 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.610
 demo remember that you can download it 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.710
 for playstation network or xbox live 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.210
 for those with connection or 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.430
 hit subscription 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.010
 As you will remember, we have been playing 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.120
 this demo and we go for mission 3a and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.450
 let's see what the mission brings us 4 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.630
 this is a pretty interesting game 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.539
 we'll see 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.539
 what can we achieve as it pulls out the menu 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.539
 principal 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.879
 and we have already 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.789
 a new cooperative player battle that 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.800
 we have already unlocked it and already in a 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.010
 next video we'll see what it's about 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.839
 to play a player and let's see what 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.000
 we can do in mission 4 that says 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.219
 victory condition of this and all 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.040
 the enemies and the terrible is named 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.750
 sayayin let's see I think it will be the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.250
 confrontation against one to choose 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.250
 here the different players 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.030
 goku piccolo 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.799
 so that it does not give us life of many and 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.799
 creel and that definitely will not work 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.730
 it's okay let's equip goku with 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.470
 some good letters we have already done 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.430
 previously in a video that the truth 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.490
 went wrong and we add this letter here 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.020
 and this training that will tell us 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.710
 that increases the experience gained by 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.960
 overcome each mission we will give you the 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.690
 battle we are going to say yes and 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.400
 start mission very well says beware 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.110
 the acid of these silverman if you touch 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.790
 you will suffer continued damage 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.790
 I imagine that then it is a damage ok 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 will be Canada and weakening not the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.020
 radio technique in dying stupid 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.260
 prove my god what good translation the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.450
 terrible sayayin 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.890
 let's try to do it the best 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.800
 possible way 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.050
 we already know that it is a good element already 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.880
 we had done this mission but 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.230
 as he commented the video has not come out 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.000
 very good then 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.630
 let's try to make it the best 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.240
 way to see if we can obviate it 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.220
 three breakthrough parts unlock and 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.560
 we see that we have to face to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.750
 nothing for our doing it of trying 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.550
 do it in the best way 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.210
 and if I want it to be fun we are going to 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.210
 talk to him at the same time 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.750
 has happened to us 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.550
 the combos 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.480
 they do not let us do it 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.330
 slowly in napa 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.010
 grace about to defeat 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.019
 then we go there 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:20.579
 something very similar to ma jin wook 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:24.389
 only one tap was missing 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.610
 this special plus 50 thousand external mission 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.729
 completed well we have completed the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.729
 mission 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.669
 let's see what he will give us this mission 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.099
 but without first we have to give something of 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.699
 energy request energy and we 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:41.699
 we prepare for 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.539
 very quickly 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.420
 and you know you could not give a 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.110
 personal energy 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.940
 in 35 states 45 is not bad 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.950
 but we did not make any combined attacks 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.280
 so that our energy bar 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.800
 they would grow double rank and we did with 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:14.200
 it is clear is earlier with a total of 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.200
 382 1900 let's see 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.380
 very good player's rank has gone up 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.380
 quite 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.759
 the competence range of the 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.180
 artificial intelligence has also 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.800
 uploaded 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.259
 next and they have given us another letter of 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.319
 go a letter to upload here and a letter 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.789
 hit hit me melee 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.789
 it will also increase strength 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.499
 thanks for playing available in 2014 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:48.420
 as he said he will be available for the 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:51.040
 first quarter of 2014 and good friends 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.690
 I will fix the video until here has been a 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.340
 pretty short video for the mission 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.190
 neither has it demerited much time 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:02.230
 in later videos we will try to 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.340
 look at a mode or the other modes that already 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.979
 we have seen you and it seems pretty 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.419
 interesting but then issues of 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.240
 router configuration and connection 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.620
 towards debut light has not allowed 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.229
 develop it well so I do not know what 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.389
 lose keep connected with us 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.960
 remember that we are pool gamer if you do not 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.889
 you have subscribed what are you waiting to do and 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.600
 remember that we will be attentive to 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.520
 Any comment any 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.110
 suggestion to know if we are 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.850
 doing well although we can change 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.330
 thank you very much we all see each other 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.330
 the next 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.460
 all
