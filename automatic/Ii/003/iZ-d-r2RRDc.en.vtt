00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello my name is Anton I read in 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
 school I want to know the lessons of history studied 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.540
 in the MU named after Lomonosov Faculty 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.049
 Political Science at the Department of State 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.719
 politicians 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.910
 pedagogical experience I have trike 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.230
 It turns out let's say this because I 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.060
 university at its core 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.830
 I study this specialty 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 legal practice dispensing passage 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 plus students because let's go 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 school and still now two pupils mind and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.960
 plus my cinema accounting 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 specialist in the military department me too 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.920
 will have to read a lesson I actually 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.809
 all the time was a very severe school 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.570
 vitoria because i took olympiads 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.940
 He has added its own part very well here 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.039
 wrote not very well on 78 points 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.210
 my here but there was a reason for me 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.949
 It was for this ghalib of stories that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.469
 were given 100 points when joining 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.940
 floor and in general I think that very com need 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.440
 participate olympiad even if 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.780
 they start learning history the first year 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.300
 here of course you start in September 1 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.309
 probably learn that 's just the same 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.649
 qualifying round but if you take 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.269
 parts olympiads then firstly you 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.940
 there is an experience of writing stress 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.770
 situations of something and secondly just 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.530
 helpful suddenly get some place 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.850
 it will be easier to play this game 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 worry less because after 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.310
 one hundred and five hundred such things passed and the whole 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.240
 desheli don't start coming up that on 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.250
 Lake Chuds 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.850
 the Mongol Tatars came with tank 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 Wehrmacht divisions 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.010
 than good busy school what 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.800
 firstly there is a collective because if 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.020
 you practice alone sometimes appears 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.710
 such a temptation and especially the beginning of the year more 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.960
 I will be in time 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.760
 here usually then such people say well 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.560
 three more days before the exam and have time 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.240
 then in the middle of the night everyone learns to publish on 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.210
 threes and fours rejoices to retake 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.710
 so it is not necessary to do and secondly than 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.170
 good lesson skin does not discipline 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.090
 what you need to get ready to come home 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.619
 the task to perform will scold and scold 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.060
 will be in front of the group and the task to perform 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.100
 homework you scold no 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.430
 for sure that swearing is not something that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.750
 swear sight that's actually what 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.000
 okay school, what is there any 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 boards because in history actually 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.100
 when something is written on the board it is easier but 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 and I like to draw that's not really 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.269
 school is cool groups are small because 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.769
 that school in class 20 people sitting at 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.180
 yourself there is no such chance for me to ask 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.200
 I will not be asked especially if I have learned 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.580
 generally not guaranteed to ask straight 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.400
 when here's a small group after all then 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.650
 no one doing this and somebody else 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.230
 questions ask a question about which not even 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.519
 thought about you so sitting and thinking 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.519
 how would i answer it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.639
 actually just a model teacher 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.639
 contact is easier to build 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.920
 that is, well , firstly than good days 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.629
 when they themselves started flying 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.040
 have gone through all this and can somehow find 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.650
 contacts 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.139
 what jokes again choose such 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.150
 I will come back who will actually help 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.859
 something fill for example jokes about 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.049
 seals fast they also have 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.019
 applications because such a small 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.730
 detail again the fact that Alexis Mikhailovich 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.980
 portrait in his lifetime very little 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.459
 and actually very wide circulation 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.750
 europe portugal portraits his cat 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.370
 that's why yes in the history too 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.370
 seals and seals it visor 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.260
 I do not really try to help 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.150
 im on on the game because i understand that 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.950
 history is such a thing where important 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.200
 acceleration ability to solve tests 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.030
 but I do not write well because 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.620
 usually guys who rent history don't 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.370
 I can give not such a specialty to study 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.060
 they still need it 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.070
 university besides i prefer 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.810
 giving material is extremely low textbooks 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.150
 here that is, let's say with mathematics physics 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.350
 and here it will not work out that way 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.240
 since the stories we have are pretty 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.650
 such item 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.660
 debating in society and still this 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.470
 question very important questions of history for 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.390
 of our society 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.299
 you want to highlight the problem as much as possible 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.980
 more versatile so unusual 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.630
 the lesson consists of the material itself 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.489
 which needs to be running around some 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.010
 jokes so the guys remember better 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.960
 Here it turns out that he was boo boo boo 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.550
 boo boo boo boo alexander nevsky boo boo 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.120
 boo boo when you tell a funny movie 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.010
 Tochik stories are better remembered and to that 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.840
 some materials just 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.850
 commonplace people wakes up interest in 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.230
 stories but what good does it give 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.710
 additionally stimulating something 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.810
 teach 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.370
 thats but the value happens in number 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.780
 makes very yes you give us this not 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.490
 quite right to navigate 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.230
 in history and understand the logic of development 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.240
 events because despite the fact that 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.270
 the whole story seems to be some sort of set 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.850
 random factors to from event names to 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.850
 in fact, the logic is very, very necessary 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.830
 the Jedi admonition is actually this 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.260
 cool joke because their students 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.780
 I call filed here is the transom of this nothing 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.780
 don't hand out how they finish the course but 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.450
 May the force come with you first 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:27.920
 continue the topic of star wars in the second 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:32.900
 instructions probably worry in moderation 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:35.480
 before your future try in the process 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.810
 preparation is put or not preparation 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.450
 fucked the subject because 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.340
 you study not and r write you receive it 

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:46.040
 knowledge of which life will be useful to you yes 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.990
 whether it is trite communication with his 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.720
 fellow students or with any other 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.030
 people here but the prostate develops brains 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.430
 I feel this is useful because when 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.800
 you know your specific stuff 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.600
 then as in these other and in this life 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.720
 will be successful if you just aim 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.620
 on the result and coaching the world where here 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.320
 on those 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.810
 how to fill out forms correctly but it is not 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.419
 the most important important knowledge is the inability to 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.580
 them to understand more importantly even a few 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.550
 the knowledge itself how much the ability to know where their 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.990
 see if you forgot know how 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.169
 remember if you forgot 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.960
 wire and the ability to own the material 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:27.560
 because the most important skills are 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.419
 the number and skill of acquiring knowledge here 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.070
 so of course there is little time left 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.680
 move this year let's write one 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:37.450
 from the first story from but nevertheless for 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.450
 two months can I have time
