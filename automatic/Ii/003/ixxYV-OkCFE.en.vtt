00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.279
 very good ruminants here I bring you the 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.140
 Analysis of the salmon wings pro a las 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.080
 that the French brand has come around 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.439
 of nut regarding its predecessor to the 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.810
 x the wings now with a more design 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.060
 Complete care and thought to run 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.640
 protected on mountain surfaces 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.559
 where the difficulty of the terrain does not 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.690
 suppose a limitation for any 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.570
 runner especially for those who 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.970
 need an extra in all salmon the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.010
 places within the range trails whose 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.860
 main characteristics are the 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.530
 Protection stability and adjustment 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.110
 for technical terrain that stood out from 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.269
 suape the first sensations are of a 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.530
 Very tight fit is to say that it wraps 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.110
 very well the foot as a whole and the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.610
 security that shows in turns 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.790
 unexpected thanks especially to the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.920
 Sense and fit system is a sensation of 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:13.130
 that you wear your foot very well protected 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.130
 yes 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.210
 a really interesting sneaker for 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.310
 medium-high weight runners who like 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.930
 of a protected model to move in 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.140
 very varied surfaces but 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.000
 especially in those stronger in 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.430
 those that the foot and the ankle need 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.950
 firmness and feeling of being well adjusted 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.060
 is a very complete model inspired by 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.060
 the design of the s 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 for all kinds of terrains as we have 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 said the tongue has a pocket 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.820
 for laces has a mesh that prevents 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.979
 the step of pebbles is very 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.409
 important the tied system squeeze 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.409
 quite tight and do not get loose 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.409
 m 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.700
 but 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.150
 the grip is precise in all kinds of 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 surfaces and conditions the feeling 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.560
 with the land when running with them is not 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.450
 very high however you notice 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.220
 especially protected when you step on 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:43.160
 decomposed stone grounds of 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 Gravel branches to consider 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.730
 Try the carving very well as it will be 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.460
 a very protected and rounded model in 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.880
 your toe cap and with a tight pear can 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.080
 well, it's good for you to take an average 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.080
 size too much
