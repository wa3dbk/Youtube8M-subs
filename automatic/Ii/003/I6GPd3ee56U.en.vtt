00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.960
 I do with 1 paka 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.980
 It looks like this 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:04.960
 Once Why do Kana with me why you bought this 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:10.050
 In fact, I used this too much to cause a loss in horse racing 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:16.720
 I was worried about thinking that I could buy an ashtray anymore 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:19.500
 This is the top brother I will introduce you to my brother 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.500
 This is Shin-chan 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.659
 Just like 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.810
 I just wasn't half my way along the mile 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:32.950
 As we do not go to Meiji from this 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 Close to the Chinese version of Crayon Shin-chan 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.020
 It feels like 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.960

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.260
 This is a picture a 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.340
 Oh, it's pretty close this 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.290
 From early to early ten 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.730
 Well it is a picture

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.030
 that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.540
 Recently I say recently 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.540
 However 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.120
 I have felt it 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.970
 What does it mean ? 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.550
 I want you to see 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.550

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:48.050
 Mermaid stakes elements Marcellina Ups Bali listen

 I'm writing this Yasuda Memorial Labor Song 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.640
 Derby expected bonds 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.540
 I was tired 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.540
 I mean 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.200
 I can not guess 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.770
 I have a title 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.890
 Horse 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.970
 I'm crazy 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.940
 That's great, isn't it 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.590
 village 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.770
 It is possible to connect 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.220
 There is 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.769
 By 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.799
 It is more money in terms of what to do 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.850
 Yuri is now 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.120
 Oh dear 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.440
 It is such a graph 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.520
 I was anxious about it, but when it became gentle from here 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.390
 I'd look to the two horses axis fact recorded in a place called Mishima axis 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.960
 The place where it takes quite a lot 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.080
 It and Oyama 15 and 4 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.400
 What is that kind of thing 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.400
 It is so in the Masha generation 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.750
 I am 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.950
 In it becomes the eyes 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.730
 Oh dear 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.730
 I'll make it 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.270
 If it is set to the people who say this 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.230
 This view of the range is 40,000 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.630
 Atari up to this range Why 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.260
 It's a fairly hard race 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.820
 I have only beckoning in a row 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.820
 I expected a little bit 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:20.080
 What is your intention? 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.610
 I will live 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.610
 Sound beer 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.790
 I 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:34.880
 I want to go around here 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.750
 So it's my partner, but I think it would be good if you could serve in the top popularity of Mishima Aoi 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.820
 But not 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:44.760
 But still I Innovation little in place to say a little pinching Do smoothly and that Hine 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:48.620
 Consent to the sound 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.620
 4th and best warrior 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.129
 Nori No. 15 Berry to do in you 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.660

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:01.060
 To do 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.060
 Hope but summary water 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.860
 Chaly 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.289
 play 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.590
 By the way 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.030
 I think it will be Kurita 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.810
 The top two 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.930
 Mr. and come it is not and I'd think there Gachotto Coquelles and 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.900
 I think it is interesting 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.289
 8 and that 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.220
 It is Hakodate but 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:30.110
 Hakodate hey 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:35.150
 It is good in the form seen 3 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.960
 Well, such a graph is pierced like this It is said that about 3 million of soymilk is also contained 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.879
 Nde such a place 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.680
 I will live and decide 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:48.560
 It is the place called Dream Valentino 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:50.710
 In to the fine that has been teased if time game of the range 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.249
 Forever mark 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.670
 It's tits and father's day 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:07:00.600
 Because there is a betting ticket that comes from Nura National College of Technology 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:03.790
 12 and the first 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.310
 The other party main line is number 5 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:12.650
 Well too public 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.650
 And I think to Fu that I want to in between if such a place at'm likely determined by the higher 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:20.689
