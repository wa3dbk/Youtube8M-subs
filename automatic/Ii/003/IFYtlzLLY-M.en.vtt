00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
how do I pick the equipment that I'm

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.869 
how do I pick the equipment that I'm
going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.210> use<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:04.520> want<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.580> pick<00:00:05.759> the

pick equipment that's relatively easy to
play<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.450> course<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.859> need<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.340> little

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
play of course you need a little

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.080 
play of course you need a little
resistance<00:00:18.560> but<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.430> resistance

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
resistance but to have a so resistance

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.050 
resistance but to have a so resistance
that<00:00:21.270> you're<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.869> using<00:00:22.199> every<00:00:22.590> physical

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
that you're just using every physical

your<00:00:25.439> instrument<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.039> can't<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.490> about

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
your instrument you can't think about

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.370 
your instrument you can't think about
the<00:00:26.910> music<00:00:27.269> you're<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.840> thinking<00:00:27.990> about<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the music you're just thinking about the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.800 
the music you're just thinking about the
physics<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.150> physical<00:00:30.599> reality

of<00:00:31.650> playing<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.070> instrument<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.020> I'm<00:00:34.020> trying

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
of playing this instrument so I'm trying

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.660 
of playing this instrument so I'm trying
to<00:00:34.500> get<00:00:34.680> something<00:00:35.040> that's<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
to get something that's not that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
to get something that's not that
difficult<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.660> play<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.140> has<00:00:37.350> some

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
difficult to play but has some

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.569 
difficult to play but has some
resistance

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
resistance

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.420

now<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> reed<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.980> find<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.809> slightly<00:00:42.809> too

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
now if the reed you find is slightly too

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.410 
now if the reed you find is slightly too
stiff<00:00:44.430> then<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:47.640> mouthpiece<00:00:47.850> you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
stiff then you can on the mouthpiece you

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.400 
stiff then you can on the mouthpiece you
can<00:00:49.140> take<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.280> down<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> tip<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:52.230> in

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
can take it down from the tip going in

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.150 
can take it down from the tip going in
this<00:00:52.710> direction<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.750> way<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
this direction like this this way in and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.000 
this direction like this this way in and
make<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:58.469> tip

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
make it so you can actually see some tip

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.450 
make it so you can actually see some tip

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the top of the reed now if I feel like

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.250 
the top of the reed now if I feel like
the<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.600> reed<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.200> too<00:01:08.330> soft<00:01:09.330> then<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the the reed is too soft then I go the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.060 
the the reed is too soft then I go the
opposite<00:01:10.680> direction<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.220> going<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:15.409> I<00:01:16.409> go

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
say well you know great players they use

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
in this reach strength you you use is so

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.020 
in this reach strength you you use is so
dependent<00:01:36.180> on<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:41.220> facing<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
dependent on the the the facing that you

dependent on the the the facing that you
have<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.509> your<00:01:42.630> mouthpiece<00:01:42.920> so<00:01:43.920> if<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
have on your mouthpiece so if I have a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.300 
have on your mouthpiece so if I have a
long<00:01:44.700> facing<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.509> need<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> stiff<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.740> Reed<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
long facing I need a stiff for Reed if I

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.609 
long facing I need a stiff for Reed if I
have<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> short<00:01:47.909> facing<00:01:48.450> even<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.350> small

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
have a short facing even if it's a small

have a short facing even if it's a small
tip<00:01:49.860> roping<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.490> need<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.270> softer<00:01:51.840> Reed<00:01:52.280> so

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479

Behrman because every mouthpiece is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.119 
Behrman because every mouthpiece is
different<00:02:16.340> sometimes<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.239> want<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.540> read<00:02:17.750> up

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
different sometimes you want to read up

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.030 
different sometimes you want to read up
like<00:02:19.129> this<00:02:19.459> far<00:02:19.819> up<00:02:20.090> where<00:02:20.659> it's<00:02:20.780> actually

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
like this far up where it's actually

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.780 
like this far up where it's actually
beyond<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.620> where<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.769> Bach<00:02:24.980> leaves<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.549> the

the cane and then sometimes if the

the cane and then sometimes if the
facing<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.000> kind<00:02:32.299> of<00:02:32.360> on<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.629> short<00:02:32.900> side<00:02:33.400> you

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
facing is kind of on the short side you

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.309 
facing is kind of on the short side you
can<00:02:34.610> bring<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:34.849> that<00:02:35.239> ligature<00:02:35.780> all<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.170> way

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
can bring that that ligature all the way

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.780 
can bring that that ligature all the way
to<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.709> end<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.129> mouthpiece<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
to the end of the mouthpiece and the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.259 
to the end of the mouthpiece and the
plays<00:02:38.030> better<00:02:38.329> I'll<00:02:39.079> bring<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.030> way

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
plays better I'll bring it all the way

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.580 
plays better I'll bring it all the way
back<00:02:41.569> here<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.950> way<00:02:43.190> so<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.840> all<00:02:45.110> depends

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
back here this way so that all depends

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.380 
back here this way so that all depends
on<00:02:45.650> your<00:02:45.799> individual<00:02:46.400> mouthpiece<00:02:46.879> on<00:02:47.120> your

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
on your individual mouthpiece on your

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.660 
on your individual mouthpiece on your
embouchure<00:02:48.109> on<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.470> way<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.680> play<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.489> the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
embouchure on the way you play and the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.729 
embouchure on the way you play and the
what<00:02:49.849> you're<00:02:50.090> hearing<00:02:50.420> when<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.410> bring<00:02:51.590> it

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
what you're hearing when you bring it

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.229 
what you're hearing when you bring it
down<00:02:51.769> this<00:02:52.160> way<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.549> makes<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:52.879> little<00:02:53.120> bit

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
down this way it makes you a little bit

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.330 
down this way it makes you a little bit
more<00:02:53.390> legato<00:02:53.720> when<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.650> bring<00:02:54.829> it<00:02:54.980> up<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
more legato when you bring it up and you

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.949 
more legato when you bring it up and you
have<00:02:55.489> a<00:02:55.519> shorter<00:02:55.940> facing<00:02:56.359> or<00:02:56.510> bring<00:02:56.750> it<00:02:56.870> up

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
have a shorter facing or bring it up

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.309 
have a shorter facing or bring it up
this<00:02:57.140> way<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:58.340> makes<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.970> more<00:02:59.659> staccato<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
this way it makes it more staccato and

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.619 
this way it makes it more staccato and
easier<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.099> play<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.549> way<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.239> makes<00:03:02.510> it

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
easier to play that way it makes it

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.400 
easier to play that way it makes it
faster<00:03:02.870> tonguing<00:03:03.440> sometimes<00:03:03.890> too<00:03:04.099> fast
