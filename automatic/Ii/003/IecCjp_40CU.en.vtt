00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.899 
falling back on your own personal habits
that's<00:01:02.760> why<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.420> good<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.870> not

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
that's why I think it's very good to not

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.810 
that's why I think it's very good to not
overly<00:01:05.909> absorb<00:01:07.130> popular<00:01:08.130> trends<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.610> film

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
overly absorb popular trends in film

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.760 
overly absorb popular trends in film
music<00:01:09.150> today<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.409> might<00:01:10.619> be

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
music today because then that might be

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
music today because then that might be
what<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.040> fall<00:01:11.250> back<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:11.670> as<00:01:12.479> opposed<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
what you fall back on as opposed to

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.690 
what you fall back on as opposed to
responding<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> something<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:14.520> brain

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
responding to something your brain

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.490 
responding to something your brain
immediately<00:01:14.970> goes<00:01:15.390> somewhere<00:01:15.720> else<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.290> goes

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
immediately goes somewhere else it goes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
immediately goes somewhere else it goes
to<00:01:16.650> something<00:01:16.860> outside<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> film<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to something outside of the film that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
to something outside of the film that
you're<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.840> happen<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.259> working<00:01:19.409> with

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
you're you happen to be working with

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100 
you're you happen to be working with
that's<00:01:20.400> also<00:01:20.729> why<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.330> would<00:01:21.570> be<00:01:21.659> careful<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that's also why I would be careful of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.469 
that's also why I would be careful of
temp<00:01:22.500> music<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.040> generally<00:01:23.549> listen<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
temp music I generally listen to the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.760 
temp music I generally listen to the

temp score on the first viewing I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
temp score on the first viewing I
generally<00:01:28.770> ask<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> director<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.729> one

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
generally ask the director for one

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.550 
generally ask the director for one
version<00:01:30.600> with<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> temp<00:01:31.020> score<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.470> is

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
version with the temp score if there is

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
version with the temp score if there is
one<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.799> them<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.070> version<00:01:32.369> without<00:01:32.460> without

effects whatever happens to be there I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.560 
effects whatever happens to be there I
usually<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.950> watch<00:01:38.240> through<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> temp

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
usually will watch through with the temp

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.420 
usually will watch through with the temp
score<00:01:39.720> once<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.619> never<00:01:40.950> listen<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
score once and then I never listen to it

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
score once and then I never listen to it
again<00:01:41.520> until<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.000> finished<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.439> then<00:01:43.710> I

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
again until I finished it and then I

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.319 
again until I finished it and then I
watch<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> temp<00:01:44.700> score<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> make

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
watch with the temp score just to make

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
watch with the temp score just to make
sure<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.540> didn't<00:01:45.840> miss<00:01:45.990> any<00:01:46.290> emotional<00:01:47.009> arches

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
sure I didn't miss any emotional arches

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.730 
sure I didn't miss any emotional arches
that<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.909> director<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.600> wanted<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that the director would have wanted and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.200 
that the director would have wanted and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it would have been clear that director

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
it would have been clear that director
wanted<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.049> temp<00:01:52.380> score<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.250> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
wanted it from the temp score so it's a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
wanted it from the temp score so it's a
very<00:01:53.610> good<00:01:53.759> idea<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> sit<00:01:54.479> down<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.079> possible

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
very good idea to sit down if possible

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
very good idea to sit down if possible
with<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> director<00:01:56.759> personally<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.570> sit<00:01:58.140> in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
with the director personally and sit in

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.840 
with the director personally and sit in
a<00:01:58.259> room<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> watch<00:01:59.009> through<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> score

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
a room and watch through the score

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.539 
a room and watch through the score
without<00:02:00.149> any<00:02:00.540> music<00:02:00.990> just<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
without any music just and this is the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
without any music just and this is the
spotting<00:02:03.000> session<00:02:03.420> basically<00:02:03.780> where<00:02:04.049> you're

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
spotting session basically where you're

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.270 
spotting session basically where you're
sitting<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:04.500> taking<00:02:04.619> notes<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
sitting there taking notes and the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
sitting there taking notes and the
directors<00:02:05.610> saying<00:02:05.790> all<00:02:05.909> right<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:07.079> sure

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
directors saying all right here for sure

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.109 
directors saying all right here for sure
I<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.099> sort<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.429> thing<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:09.090> I

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
I want this sort of thing for here I

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
I want this sort of thing for here I
want<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> want<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
want this for here I want this

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010 
want this for here I want this
if<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.580> director<00:02:11.670> trusts<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.630> and<00:02:12.780> knows<00:02:12.900> you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
if the director trusts you and knows you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.700 
if the director trusts you and knows you
very<00:02:13.050> well

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
very well

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.910 
very well
you'll<00:02:13.920> probably<00:02:14.190> get<00:02:14.460> fewer<00:02:14.970> spotting

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
you'll probably get fewer spotting

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.040 
you'll probably get fewer spotting
suggestions<00:02:16.920> or<00:02:17.220> demands<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.570> general

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
suggestions or demands but in general

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.020 
suggestions or demands but in general
directors<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.100> an<00:02:20.190> idea<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:20.820> they're

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
directors have an idea of what they're

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.940 
directors have an idea of what they're
looking<00:02:21.360> for<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.900> that's<00:02:22.020> again<00:02:22.620> why<00:02:22.800> they

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
looking for and that's again why they

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
looking for and that's again why they
hired<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.670> particular<00:02:23.960> because<00:02:24.960> they

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
hired you in particular because they

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.370 
hired you in particular because they
want<00:02:25.230> your<00:02:25.350> sound<00:02:25.770> or<00:02:26.580> they<00:02:26.790> want<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.380> take

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380

want your sound or they want your take
on<00:02:28.680> things<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:29.580> be<00:02:29.670> surprised<00:02:30.030> if

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240
