00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.260
 failed to join the pendao server 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.850

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.810
 fly 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 that's just because there was 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 a change of version we went from 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.679
 the 5 points 0.5 to 54.2 so suddenly 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 that's why you can not 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.329

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 especially so yes so basically you 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.149
 you have to go to the pendao site 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.059

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.920
 forum so me I did not have I did not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.229
 took the time to translate because I 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.689
 know him enough parker force then 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.580
 you just have to do it 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.790
 For example, it's here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 actually it'll give you software 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.180
 precisely in a file here pendao 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.509
 is simply the file that there is 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.950
 in 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.280
 so I would like the file that there is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.650
 in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:40.049
 so when that wants so the file 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:45.560
 budweiser bud's criticism good since that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.390
 roof that such a shit 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.380

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.120
 wf and basically you put in a 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.110
 new folder you feared again 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.270
 folder you put in 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.850
 and as you know launched during at 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.180
 do you make a load of a pretty 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.810
 5 long 10 minutes and after you 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.610
 will be able to play pendao quietly and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.870
 serenely as we say so is it 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.220
 very simple for those who did not arrive 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.640
