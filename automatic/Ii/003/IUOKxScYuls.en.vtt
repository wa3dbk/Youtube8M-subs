00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.900 
itself large 3d blog and fly plane I say
3d<00:00:12.540> you're<00:00:13.380> see<00:00:13.559> from<00:00:13.769> Dean's<00:00:14.219> flight<00:00:14.519> footage

monster everything else because of the
format<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.920> probably<00:00:23.189> important<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> point

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
format it's probably important to point

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
format it's probably important to point
out<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.359> also<00:00:24.570> makes<00:00:25.289> its<00:00:25.439> gonna<00:00:25.590> make

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
out that it also makes its gonna make

for<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> great<00:00:26.220> sport<00:00:26.609> flyer<00:00:26.880> general

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
for a great sport flyer general

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
for a great sport flyer general
all-round<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> first<00:00:28.920> thing<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.160> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
all-round because the first thing is a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.020 
all-round because the first thing is a
good<00:00:29.369> size<00:00:29.640> 1500<00:00:30.510> millimeter<00:00:30.779> span<00:00:31.820> now<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
good size 1500 millimeter span now it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.299 
good size 1500 millimeter span now it
comes<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.649> everything<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.890> basically

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
comes with everything in it basically

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
comes with everything in it basically
it's<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.850> really<00:00:36.480> simple<00:00:36.840> very<00:00:37.110> very<00:00:37.530> fast<00:00:37.829> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's a really simple very very fast to

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's a really simple very very fast to
put<00:00:38.040> together<00:00:38.219> which<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> another<00:00:39.090> thing<00:00:39.300> if

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
put together which is another thing if

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.229 
put together which is another thing if
you<00:00:39.690> maybe<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.500> foamies<00:00:40.829> or<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> saw

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you maybe use the foamies or just a saw

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.400 
you maybe use the foamies or just a saw
a<00:00:42.270> person<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.719> can't<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> bothered

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
a person that can't really be bothered

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.049 
a person that can't really be bothered
building<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.700> you

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
building this is for you

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
building this is for you
seriously<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.020> could<00:00:46.110> probably<00:00:46.530> do<00:00:46.739> this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
seriously I could probably do this

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
seriously I could probably do this
myself<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> fuss<00:00:48.030> build<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
myself and I'm a bit of a fuss build I

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.340 
myself and I'm a bit of a fuss build I
could<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:48.660> do<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.020> an<00:00:49.110> evening

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could probably do this in an evening

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.139 
could probably do this in an evening
it's<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.610> simple

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
it's really that simple

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.380 
it's really that simple
so<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> run<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.289> through<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.680> um<00:00:53.219> there<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> a

the control rods are three millimeter

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
the control rods are three millimeter
that<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.240> ball<00:01:15.509> wings<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.530> nice

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that it's ball wings so it's all nice

stuff<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> end<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> day<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.770> plug<00:01:19.770> in

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
stuff at the end of the day and plug in

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.730 
stuff at the end of the day and plug in
wing<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> CF<00:01:21.119> tube<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:22.080> you'll<00:01:22.229> notice<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
wing on a CF tube and you'll notice that

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.130 
wing on a CF tube and you'll notice that
the<00:01:22.860> undercarriage<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.729> also<00:01:24.420> carbon<00:01:24.750> fiber

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the undercarriage is also carbon fiber

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.980 
the undercarriage is also carbon fiber
and<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> model<00:01:27.180> comes<00:01:27.360> literally

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and the way the model comes literally

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.810 
and the way the model comes literally
the<00:01:28.439> two<00:01:28.619> wing<00:01:28.860> halves<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.280> off<00:01:29.400> they're<00:01:29.640> just

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the two wing halves are off they're just

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.120 
the two wing halves are off they're just
standard<00:01:30.119> plug-in<00:01:30.450> wings<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.439> only<00:01:31.950> thing

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
standard plug-in wings the only thing

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
standard plug-in wings the only thing
you<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.460> glue<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.200> horizontal

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
you have to glue in is the horizontal

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370 
you have to glue in is the horizontal
stabilizer<00:01:35.900> same<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> rudder

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
stabilizer same with the rudder

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.679 
stabilizer same with the rudder
obviously<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.340> bit<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.689> hinging

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
obviously which is a bit of hinging

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.980 
obviously which is a bit of hinging
nothing<00:01:40.680> all<00:01:41.070> pre-done<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:42.210> simple<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.780> us

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
nothing all pre-done very simple for us

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
nothing all pre-done very simple for us
to<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:44.250> after<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.610> you're

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to do and then after that you're

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.149 
to do and then after that you're
actually<00:01:45.060> literally<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:46.040> put<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
actually literally just put the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.090 
actually literally just put the
undercarriage<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.270> big<00:01:48.630> 15<00:01:49.350> by<00:01:49.560> 8<00:01:49.590> prop

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
undercarriage on this big 15 by 8 prop

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100 
undercarriage on this big 15 by 8 prop
so<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> more<00:01:51.479> or<00:01:51.600> less<00:01:51.630> screwed

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
so it's all kind of more or less screwed

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.950 
so it's all kind of more or less screwed
together<00:01:52.640> patrol<00:01:53.640> says<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.810> like
