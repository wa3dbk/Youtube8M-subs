 Speak there guys I used boy, I 'm 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.420
 making a new minecraft video on 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.070
 that I'm going to teach you to do a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.539
 tree house 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.920
 here I have a tree style 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.010
 This one is the same as the rules here. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.859
 I used 47 lins so it's from here it's very 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
 good to make a house up I'm not going 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.830
 to make a house in one 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.430
 out of here if you want I'll use this 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.469
 From here to do the house will not do 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:51.750
 place several but the summer so okay 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:58.170
 then the name will be a size 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.440
 so cool that size that okay okay 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:21.450
 okay if they see everything here is on torch 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:23.159
 so I created it then if you have not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.030
 good level I will wait only grow 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.939
 apply the level at all here 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.189
 A few seconds later I got it. 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.630
 apply here every good level then 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.630
 You 'll make it stop. 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.799
 sure if you want you can use the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:54.240
 scissors and get it from here and fix it 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:02:05.009
 the holes leave conca smacked in the middle of the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:06.240
 year it was necessary to apply the mark 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:17.300
 imperfections 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:17.300
 This is a pretty cool fault. 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.019
 A very cool future right now from Bahia 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.459
 feel very natural 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.459
 not overhead 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.370
 here you can either pick up the wood 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.030
 on here 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.709
 or maybe you can put up at 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.140
 growing is one option is to make the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.620
 Same way here you could have done there 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620
 down 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:12.840
 the conclusion is good if you want 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:20.090
 can use this type of tree do as 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:24.540
 What remains is that we will apply my 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.010
 We came back here and already applied o'neill 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.350
 took a while for some I had to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.519
 build would not work 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.549
 but this is the way home if you want 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:40.440
 You can make an entry so do 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:50.790

00:03:40.440 --> 00:04:01.760

00:03:50.790 --> 00:04:01.760
