00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 and 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.930
 very good I will not explain now 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 explained in other videos but good 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.440
 to see everything you have to see several 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.780
 videos so I gathered everything in this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.700
 video and so everything is very clear let's go 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.830
 to see how to test guitars by recording the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.109
 clean signal but hearing the with 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.510
 distortion and without latency we can record 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
 the guitar listening to a clapperboard or if we 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.949
 we work it more we make a battery 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.580
 in video as it is and we recorded over 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.500
 that battery to keep the rhythm 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.570
 then to see the guitar first thing 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.780
 is to create a track we make it mono 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.160
 because guitars is the mono signal and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.630
 what we have to do to see the 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.450
 guitar is to press the button on the 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.210
 right of the monitor and then we hear what 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.500
 that enters the track in this case is 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.850
 the guitar that I have connected to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.379
 computer that I'm playing right now 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.660
 and then I can hear how it sounds but 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.820
 it sounds clean if we want it to sound 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.440
 distortion having to put plugins and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.970
 now how do you see the entry level that 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.379
 I see there is quite high and is 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.690
 saturating then what we have to 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.010
 do is this already depends on each card 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.840
 Sound search options 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.520
 recording select the properties 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.979
 of the microphone or line as we are 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.479
 recording and here for example I'm going to remove 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.950
 the most 10 decibels I had and 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.799
 then it will enter with a signal a 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.750
 bit looser and now as you see though 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.130
 is playing hard the signal does not reach 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.259
 saturate therefore I'm going to leave it like that 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.750
 so now I put the monitor and 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.090
 I check that by touching 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.950
 fails to saturate but as you can see are the 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.600
 clean then to add distortion 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.370
 then you put any blog in which 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.979
 have I use these that are 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.479
 free freeware looks great now 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.640
 It has a lot of background noise but I already know 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.530
 I will remove the plows and now I will 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.000
 put the impulse that I use guitar 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.760
 I'm going to put one created by me that is 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.390
 upson and that I use in my saxon band 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.340
 and so it sounds 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.140
 now it's sounding a bit serious 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.030
 too serious but because we are 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.310
 rising the distortion while the 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.170
 clean or clean sound is doing the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.350
 psoe well a little ball but good da 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.350
 same 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.730
 and now what I 'm going to do to not hear 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.729
 the noise is the background all the time is 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.610
 add a noise air that I have 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.560
 one of web is good x is not that I'm going 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.620
 pulling out the plugin plus more more problems 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.930
 I want more than in addition and here the noise 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.330
 monkey I put you read without touching the guitar 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.550
 so that it captures the noise spectrum 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.810
 I already give him there and then 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.220
 adjusted the parameters so that there is no 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.850
 reverse of the bottom and as you can see I'm not the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.380
 background noise then now I play and 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.270
 Now it's all seen but I say it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.120
 with latency I touch and at half a second 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.800
 sounds to avoid latency and power 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.420
 record well because recording like this is a 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.370
 madness we have to press this button 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.840
 here and then what happens is that we 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.160
 disable all the plugins that give us 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.860
 latency 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.110
 and now if we still have 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.960
 latency we have to go to devices device 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.340
 setup and there we select the device 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.530
 that we are using audio in this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.850
 case I'm using the action for all and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.160
 this already depending on what you are 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.780
 using will be different you go to the control 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.900
 panel and we select the samples of 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.580
 input and output device 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.740
 audio me here as you see I have it 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.300
 10,000 seconds that is a latency 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.430
 quite acceptable you can record but 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.560
 more than 10 milliseconds you would already go with 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.840
 echo a little crazy and you would have the 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.520
 time to record and once we have put 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.410
 the distortion that we want and we have already 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.740
 removed the latency we can record what 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.740
 that we want 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.830
 As you can see, this is the most complex king 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.390
 of the world is super cursed is a 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.260
 piece of song that is improvising 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.260
 right now I do not know how 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.300
 and now you will see what has been recorded 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.709
 it really does not have distortion the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.950
 distortion sounds because it has been put 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.260
 and the track 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.810
 so now I remove the monitor button 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.800
 of the artist of the guitar channel and 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.800
 this is what I have recorded 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.460
 Now I'm going to the guitar track 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.000
 deactivated the plugins and as you can see 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.000
 sound clean 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.170
 how 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.710
 so that's how you can record a 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 Clean guitar recording clean signal 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.190
 of guitar but hearing the with 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.709
 distortion to know exactly what 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.180
 we are touching and if we want to export 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.240
 that we put alone on the track of 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.330
 guitar and we're going to file export 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.650
 mix audio and so on and so good town 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.900
 I hope you have been useful and as 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.710
 we will not see eggs anymore 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.840
 i 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.840
 mom mom mom mom
