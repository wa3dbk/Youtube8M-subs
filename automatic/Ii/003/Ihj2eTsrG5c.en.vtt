00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.290
 What's up, good kids, you 've heard it 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.599
 already for the title of the video I'm going to do 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.110
 a new project will be 240 liters 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.610
 Marine I hope you like it and I do 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 just for us because I already have a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.109
 little sailor but I want you to see the 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 process from the beginning since 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.849
 start buying the living rock where 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 I buy the living rock the skimmer the 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.349
 macroalgae plantation that I'm going to put 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.939
 down the special LEDs that the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.210
 marine aquarium need the lights 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 special how to buy the gloves that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.900
 it is a species similar to anemones 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.730
 how am I going to buy the two clown fish 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.740
 I already have two but I want the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 guys since they are small as they go 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.640
 growing and the different diet 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.900
 what you have and I hope you like the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.300
 project is a very nice project 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:52.140
 because I already tell you that few people have 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.610
 clown fish in your house and it's going to be a 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.450
 pretty big aquarium what's going to 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.310
 suppose quite 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.890
 enough economic investment not 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:02.410
 believe that marine water aquariums 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.710
 they are like those of sweet that those of sweet 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.140
 themselves are four hard but evil if 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.580
 they are expensive of cojones for example already 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.060
 simply the living rock is going to put you 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.690
 10% of the aquarium volume 250 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.450
 240 liters can go approximately 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.280
 about 200 euros 300 euros in live rock 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 that for those who do not know what it is that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.180
 We are introducing what we call 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.170
 directly brought from the sea that has 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.360
 small small corals as little bugs 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.299
 that are already there and it is necessary for the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.220
 aquarium so I hope you like the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.619
 new project is going to be very interesting 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.149
 because I already tell you I already have them I have a 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 Cesc clown couple who are already 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.860
 big boys still never taught them that 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.310
 have us in another room in nothing 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.899
 I do not like to teach and this one if this one is going to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.189
 be the project from scratch or be the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.979
 I'm going to buy fish with a 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.319
 centimeter two are going to see how I'm going to 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.270
 feeding them how they are growing as 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.689
 the largest one will be transformed into the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.849
 female and who knows at best what 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.500
 best and beloved of the clown fish and 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.750
 we'll see later, so I hope 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.060
 that you like the project and nothing else in 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.440
 an aquarium will be very present in 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.540
 the channel 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.760
 so any suggestion any 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 thing you tell me and so finally 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.590
 you can see how a sailor becomes 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.590
 zero and you're welcome guys
