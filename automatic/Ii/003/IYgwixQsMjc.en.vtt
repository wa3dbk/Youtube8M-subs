00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 on youtube according to this day that 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.839
 I bring what is a new video for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.059
 to be able to show them how you can jump 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.710
 what is the record of ios see in this 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.349
 case many people can skip it 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.420
 in having the iCloud record so 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.130
 say it if they do not have how to register the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 lead from icloud and probably who 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.020
 will skip the record let's teach them 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.939
 here this video is an alternative to 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.230
 another video that I had already done because 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.939
 not everyone works for them 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.140
 previous video this video I'm going to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.090
 do to most 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
 people work this is almost 100% 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.530
 they will work ok we all 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 to give once home button 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.500
 and we have called ss 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.200
 once on call sbs let's give it 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.110
 three times the home button ok 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.660
 today they are activated we have to activate 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.480
 this option to be able to use the trick 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.950
 and the good ability to use what 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.510
 what is our 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.660
 buff to be able to jump 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.730
 to be able to jump into our system here 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.730
 we will see will mark 112 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.630
 two 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.700
 and we are going to mark and know the bar 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.060
 Green will block the button 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.280
 blocked the mind march 112 call to 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.350
 each blocked once the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.030
 screen what we are going to do is go back 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.530
 to unlock the phone but we're not going 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.790
 to press this button we are going to press 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.590
 the home button we always have to 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.580
 press the home button so you can 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.220
 unlock ok let's give it home button 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.210
 and let's go down here 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.720
 and swipe to adjust the settings 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.580
 and they were the place if you do not have these 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.210
 users without names we are going to add 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.210
 simply 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.490
 and we go to where you want to add photo to 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.580
 Photo 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.120
 and take photos button 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.070
 the viewer let's take the picture j 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.460
 once the picture is taken we will use 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.460
 Photos 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.780
 that is the catÃ³n photo 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.830
 ok button 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.830
 that is all 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.270
 and now that you have your dreams without 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.030
 name we are going to select if you do not have 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.470
 none simply selection if not 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.290
 you had none simply selections 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.600
 the unnamed user you want ok by 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.310
 example let's select this 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.630
 let's say it's already down where it says 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.630
 block contact 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.040
 what does not need phone calls 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.540
 messages 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.770
 what we are going to give you three times 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.770
 so we can block them 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.250
 listing 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.190
 and let's activate with three times or three 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.500
 times and unlock and deactivate the 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.510
 today are the deactivated 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.590
 and you have to put him block contact and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.000
 apply three times fast apply 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.290
 three times fast and fast the most 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.940
 as fast as you can to unlock 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.820
 to unlock and enter this 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.490
 ok menu and here we already have what is this 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.660
 our operating system of ios see in 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.910
 this case we can not open applications 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.030
 it's the bad thing we can just open 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.160
 facetime and what is the kiosk 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.900
 probably if you want to enter a kiosk 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.489
 here you can enter 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.370
 but if you want to go back out 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.310
 just block the phone 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.790
 home button and slips to unlock and 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.530
 go back at least and you give home button 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.319
 in some applications to see 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.200
 often it's just going to go back to what 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.609
 what is the record of what they see and what 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 we have to do probably it's not 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.540
 a solution let's say very big but you 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.969
 will help a lot because probably 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.310
 we can use a vulnerability from 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:58.439
 here we can use what is the phone 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.140
 somehow you can enter a bug and 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.090
 to be able to say what you can to 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.980
 phone in some way if someone 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.180
 comes to develop another method for 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.219
 to be able to enter what is the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.389
 system configuration and well then 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.829
 It has been everything I hope you liked it 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.829
 See you in our next video
