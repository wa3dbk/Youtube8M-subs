characters<00:03:23.600> but<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.470> was<00:03:24.560> one<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.710> those

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
characters but it was one of those

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.660 
characters but it was one of those
things<00:03:24.890> where<00:03:25.010> we<00:03:25.220> needed<00:03:25.460> to<00:03:25.520> have

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
things where we needed to have

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.220 
things where we needed to have
characters<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.210> really<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.720> know<00:03:26.810> we

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
characters that really you know we

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.590 
characters that really you know we
didn't<00:03:27.380> want<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.530> dispose<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:27.920> so<00:03:28.640> we<00:03:29.180> ended<00:03:29.510> up

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
didn't want to dispose of so we ended up

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.030 
didn't want to dispose of so we ended up
working<00:03:29.720> with<00:03:29.900> Hasbro<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.500> collaborating

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
characters for the game so we called the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.520 
characters for the game so we called the
drones<00:03:35.000> for<00:03:35.300> lack<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.660> better<00:03:35.720> term<00:03:35.900> we

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
drones for lack of a better term we

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.170 
drones for lack of a better term we
ended<00:03:36.710> up<00:03:36.800> building<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.340> game<00:03:37.520> 10<00:03:37.910> unique

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
ended up building in the game 10 unique

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.210 
ended up building in the game 10 unique
characters<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:39.380> we<00:03:39.500> designed<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:39.950> do<00:03:40.010> clap

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220

big characters fighting in a city and

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.890 
big characters fighting in a city and
then<00:04:28.490> some<00:04:28.820> driving<00:04:29.030> into<00:04:29.300> need<00:04:29.420> for<00:04:29.600> speed<00:04:29.780> we

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
then some driving into need for speed we

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.390 
then some driving into need for speed we
actually<00:04:30.140> looked<00:04:30.260> at<00:04:30.380> a<00:04:30.410> lot<00:04:30.560> as<00:04:30.680> well<00:04:30.710> because

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
actually looked at a lot as well because

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.340 
actually looked at a lot as well because
i<00:04:31.700> would<00:04:32.360> say<00:04:32.450> transformers<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.050> mixture<00:04:33.290> of

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
i would say transformers is a mixture of

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.050 
i would say transformers is a mixture of
a<00:04:33.440> bunch<00:04:33.620> of<00:04:33.710> different<00:04:33.830> genres<00:04:34.040> but<00:04:34.910> it's

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
a bunch of different genres but it's

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.480 
a bunch of different genres but it's
yeah<00:04:35.480> we<00:04:35.840> don't<00:04:35.960> it's<00:04:36.710> really<00:04:36.950> leveraging<00:04:37.400> the

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
yeah we don't it's really leveraging the

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.620 
yeah we don't it's really leveraging the
fact<00:04:37.670> that<00:04:37.700> we've<00:04:37.880> got<00:04:38.000> these<00:04:38.150> characters

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
fact that we've got these characters

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.480 
fact that we've got these characters
they're<00:04:39.320> in<00:04:39.410> an<00:04:39.500> environment<00:04:39.950> be<00:04:40.100> at<00:04:40.190> a<00:04:40.280> city

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
they're in an environment be at a city

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.370 
they're in an environment be at a city
be<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.880> desert<00:04:41.330> being<00:04:41.600> small<00:04:41.870> town<00:04:42.110> and

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
be the desert being small town and

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.990 
be the desert being small town and
really<00:04:42.860> leveraging<00:04:43.190> the<00:04:43.310> fact<00:04:43.490> again<00:04:43.640> to<00:04:43.880> the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
really leveraging the fact again to the

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.670 
really leveraging the fact again to the
point<00:04:44.210> of<00:04:44.270> transformation<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.110> saying<00:04:45.590> you

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
point of transformation and saying you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.230 
point of transformation and saying you
know<00:04:45.710> how<00:04:46.070> can<00:04:46.250> we<00:04:46.310> use<00:04:46.340> transformation<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.180> a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
know how can we use transformation in a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.300 
know how can we use transformation in a
cool<00:04:47.420> way<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:48.350> think<00:04:48.590> sort<00:04:48.770> of<00:04:48.830> our<00:04:48.980> three

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
cool way and I think sort of our three

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.830 
cool way and I think sort of our three
sort<00:04:49.670> of<00:04:49.730> key<00:04:49.910> themes<00:04:50.210> we<00:04:50.390> always<00:04:50.570> play<00:04:50.690> down

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
sort of key themes we always play down

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.000 
sort of key themes we always play down

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
we look at something is like okay how

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.860 
we look at something is like okay how
can<00:04:52.070> we<00:04:52.250> leverage<00:04:52.370> transformation<00:04:53.090> how<00:04:53.720> can

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
can we leverage transformation how can

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.060 
can we leverage transformation how can
we<00:04:53.900> make<00:04:54.020> the<00:04:54.140> destruction<00:04:54.530> look<00:04:54.650> really<00:04:54.860> cool

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
we make the destruction look really cool

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.590 
we make the destruction look really cool
and<00:04:55.370> how<00:04:55.430> can<00:04:55.490> make<00:04:55.760> these<00:04:55.910> guys<00:04:56.060> look<00:04:56.270> larger
