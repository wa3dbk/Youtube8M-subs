00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.790
 in my video I would like to talk about 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.230
 my personal experience using 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.040
 nicotinic acid in conjunction with 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.230
 burdock oil the backstory is such that 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.820
 somewhere will be back I cut my own 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.949
 front hair under the square 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.439
 and the rear left a length of which 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.150
 I had them, but later it scorched 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.910
 that this hairstyle does not suit me at all 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.029
 somewhere I was growing my hair 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 comparing their length 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.949
 here and recently I wanted the army again 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.739
 cut them a little and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.559
 how would my signs understand me at all 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.760
 what I want therefore he did exactly that 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.829
 haircut like a year ago 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 just the front hair he took me still 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.800
 in short and so I decided 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.960
 from take advantage of nicotinic acid 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.270
 because a lot of girls wrote her 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.140
 reviews on the Internet about how they have 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:59.340
 hair there grew by a centimeter in 10 days 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 so I decided to use it myself 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.890
 this advice as you can see my front 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.760
 my hair is the best 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 short they are a little bit lower chin 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:16.729
 literally a centimeter so 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.040
 and my rear is pretty long 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.439
 So I want to equalize their length at least 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.810
 a little bit and have my front hair 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.909
 not so separated from the rear because 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.759
 it looks pretty 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.780
 ugly honestly so i 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.819
 hairstyle completely media's course 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.490
 nicotinic acid soldiers this is just 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.890
 per month you need to rub and a little by 1 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 ampoule a day but that's how i will 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.520
 grow only front hair back 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.009
 I will not touch therefore I think personally 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:51.920
 I have enough somewhere maybe half 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:54.380
 ampules day they are 1 and today is October 10 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.140
 and somewhere in exactly a month that is 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 November 10, I will release a new video in which 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.649
 will show 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.619
 again the length of their hairs 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.539
 and tell your own review about 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.610
 I liked this negative acid 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.009
 did not like the advice she enjoyed not 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.489
 I advise you also did not read side 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.239
 The effects of one of these were dandruff but I 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.440
 I think that even though I mostly threaten people 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.989
 with dry scalp 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.450
 auburn hair turn greasy plus also 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.390
 some girls wrote about what they have 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.109
 beginning began dizziness still such 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.120
 I thought how it would depend on the person to me 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.489
 it seems that someone has a side 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.470
 the effect of someone not here in general through 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.959
 month wait my new videos in which i 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.630
 In general, I will tell everything about frost as a whole. 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.400
 everything went through what changed in general and you 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.120
 yourself can see changed 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.120
 something or not 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.070
 if you like my video if you 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.650
 want to know what has changed at all 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.960
 in a month and how does everything influence the hair 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.780
 negative acid then subscribe to 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.370
 my channel put me a thumbs up and that's it 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.370
