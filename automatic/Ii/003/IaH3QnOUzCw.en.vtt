little bit from the root all the way to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
little bit from the root all the way to
the<00:01:38.790> answer<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.390> start<00:01:39.750> palm<00:01:40.020> rolling

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the answer then you start palm rolling

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.120 
the answer then you start palm rolling
and<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.070> palm<00:01:41.369> roll<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.329> pol<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:43.740> whole

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and you palm roll and you pol that whole

back<00:01:44.549> combed<00:01:44.909> red<00:01:45.270> until<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.110> gets<00:01:46.320> nice<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
back combed red until it gets nice and

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.530 
back combed red until it gets nice and
smooth<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.250> gets<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.640> nice<00:01:47.820> shape<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.420> you
