00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
was with people trickshot it wasn't

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.330 
was with people trickshot it wasn't
playing<00:00:44.660> properly<00:00:45.660> anymore<00:00:45.809> well<00:00:46.649> apart<00:00:47.250> from

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
playing properly anymore well apart from

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
playing properly anymore well apart from
light<00:00:47.640> generally<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.360> such<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.690> good<00:00:48.899> game<00:00:49.079> i

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
light generally was such a good game i

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950 
light generally was such a good game i
think<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.680> wasn't<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.600> like<00:00:51.600> on<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
think it wasn't just the like on the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
think it wasn't just the like on the
modern<00:00:52.199> warfare<00:00:52.289> 3<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> black<00:00:53.370> ops<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
modern warfare 3 and the black ops the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.139 
modern warfare 3 and the black ops the
first<00:00:54.120> black<00:00:54.360> ops<00:00:55.699> but<00:00:56.699> i<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:56.850> mainly

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
first black ops but i think mainly

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.540 
first black ops but i think mainly
modern<00:00:57.510> warfare<00:00:57.660> 3<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.320> really<00:00:58.590> ruined<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
modern warfare 3 it really ruined the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.150 
modern warfare 3 it really ruined the
game<00:00:59.730> of<00:01:00.030> how<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.410> don't<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.829> if<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:01.980> say

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
game of how it I don't know if you say

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.460 
game of how it I don't know if you say
complex<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.910> how<00:01:03.030> much<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.199> too

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
complex but how much more there was too

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
complex but how much more there was too
much<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.519> better<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.119> being

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
much to it it was better just being

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.120 
much to it it was better just being
that's<00:01:06.689> why<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> enjoyed<00:01:07.260> called<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.950> well

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that's why I enjoyed called for as well

the core do it serious it was a lot
better<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.460> game<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.670> much<00:01:15.030> more

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
better because the game was much more

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.560 
better because the game was much more
simple<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.580> purely<00:01:17.970> down<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
they didn't really make much of a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490 
they didn't really make much of a
difference<00:01:50.899> obviously<00:01:51.899> made<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> little<00:01:52.350> bit

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
difference obviously made a little bit

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.789 
difference obviously made a little bit
but<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.909> nothing<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
but not more what not nothing to to

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.420 
but not more what not nothing to to
stand<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.540> modern<00:01:57.899> warfare<00:01:58.049> 3

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
stand out like he is on modern warfare 3

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.469 
stand out like he is on modern warfare 3
but<00:01:59.430> i<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.579> that's<00:01:59.820> what<00:01:59.969> made<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.149> game

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
but i think that's what made that game

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.230 
but i think that's what made that game
so<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:01.020> it's<00:02:01.170> pure<00:02:01.500> simplicity<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.399> I'd

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
so good it's pure simplicity of it I'd

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.420 
so good it's pure simplicity of it I'd
really<00:02:03.689> did<00:02:03.840> enjoy<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.070> could<00:02:05.340> just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
really did enjoy it how you could just

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.150 
really did enjoy it how you could just
pick<00:02:05.729> up<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.939> weapon<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.829> they'd<00:02:07.829> all<00:02:07.979> be

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
pick up a weapon and they'd all be

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.420 
pick up a weapon and they'd all be
around<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> same<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.310> they

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
around like the same like how good they

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.800 
around like the same like how good they
were<00:02:11.459> they<00:02:12.450> were<00:02:12.510> all<00:02:12.690> about<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.110> same

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
were they were all about the same

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.120 
were they were all about the same
but<00:02:13.959> that<00:02:14.170> was<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.380> best<00:02:14.590> thing<00:02:14.770> about<00:02:14.890> that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
but that was the best thing about that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.100 
but that was the best thing about that
call<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.400> duty<00:02:15.819> how<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:16.090> could<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.870> was<00:02:16.989> all

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
call of duty how you could it was all

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.020 
call of duty how you could it was all

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
came to gain switches the akimbo what

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.430 
came to gain switches the akimbo what
would<00:03:13.090> he<00:03:13.150> call<00:03:13.360> like<00:03:13.630> remembers<00:03:14.110> akimbo

would he call like remembers akimbo
shotgun<00:03:14.980> thing<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.340> and<00:03:15.549> they<00:03:16.209> did<00:03:16.630> get<00:03:16.750> over

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
shotgun thing is and they did get over

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.479 
shotgun thing is and they did get over
power<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> patch<00:03:17.950> there<00:03:18.220> was<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.340> lot

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
power but like a patch there was a lot

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.190 
power but like a patch there was a lot
of<00:03:18.519> little<00:03:18.910> bits<00:03:19.329> like<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:19.900> apart<00:03:20.140> from

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
of little bits like that but apart from

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.259 
of little bits like that but apart from
that<00:03:20.350> generally<00:03:20.950> nothing<00:03:21.609> was<00:03:21.790> really<00:03:21.940> too

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
that generally nothing was really too

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.000 
that generally nothing was really too
overpowered<00:03:22.900> on<00:03:22.989> that<00:03:23.109> game<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:23.739> went<00:03:23.890> pee

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
overpowered on that game you went pee

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.039 
overpowered on that game you went pee
for<00:03:24.160> if<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.400> was<00:03:24.579> pretty<00:03:24.790> strong<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.450> those<00:03:25.840> are

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
for if I was pretty strong but those are

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.800 
for if I was pretty strong but those are
the<00:03:26.079> guns<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.160> could<00:03:27.430> cope<00:03:27.640> with<00:03:28.269> which<00:03:28.570> foot

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
the guns that could cope with which foot

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.900 
the guns that could cope with which foot
which<00:03:29.620> would<00:03:29.829> be<00:03:30.280> able<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.519> deal<00:03:30.670> with<00:03:30.730> that

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
which would be able to deal with that

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.410 
which would be able to deal with that

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
high action pace so all the time you

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.689

actually<00:06:26.380> majorly<00:06:27.099> massive<00:06:27.610> maps<00:06:27.940> like<00:06:28.599> their

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
actually majorly massive maps like their

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.170 
actually majorly massive maps like their
husband<00:06:29.110> on<00:06:29.199> the<00:06:29.229> other<00:06:29.349> core<00:06:29.650> do<00:06:29.830> is<00:06:30.150> but<00:06:31.150> I

husband on the other core do is but I

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.540 
husband on the other core do is but I
think<00:06:31.419> that's<00:06:31.479> what<00:06:31.750> makes<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:32.080> good<00:06:32.229> games

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550

like<00:06:33.550> a<00:06:33.580> high<00:06:33.940> pace

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.570 

a<00:06:36.880> good<00:06:37.150> tempo<00:06:37.570> they<00:06:37.870> had<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.080> game<00:06:38.560> so<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.430> get

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
a good tempo they had a game so you get

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.510 
a good tempo they had a game so you get
some<00:06:39.610> high<00:06:39.880> action<00:06:40.410> which<00:06:41.410> make<00:06:41.770> it<00:06:41.800> boring<00:06:42.100> it

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
some high action which make it boring it

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.600 
some high action which make it boring it
always<00:06:42.970> always<00:06:43.890> watching<00:06:44.890> out<00:06:45.010> round<00:06:45.550> your

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
always always watching out round your

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.220 
always always watching out round your
corn<00:06:45.910> is<00:06:46.090> it<00:06:46.480> looked<00:06:46.690> makes<00:06:46.930> it<00:06:47.050> a<00:06:47.080> lot<00:06:47.170> more

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
corn is it looked makes it a lot more

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.650 
corn is it looked makes it a lot more

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.000 
fun so for me black ops 2 is probably
the<00:06:52.750> best<00:06:52.900> call<00:06:53.140> of<00:06:53.230> duty<00:06:53.590> and<00:06:55.320> in<00:06:56.320> second
