00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.449
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.310
 more mmo so and guide today 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.350
 we join the fight from tc man in 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.609
 nordend and I show you in the 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.619
 following minutes 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.779
 Well how do you do this quickly and effectively 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.330
 you can defeat it 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.790
 actually no big exercise except yes 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.830
 that here are some pads on level 25 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.320
 should have or at least approximate 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.150
 at this stage and as I said I show 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.460
 you can now as you defeat them 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.159
 have fun our first opponent is rest 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.100
 dragon desert and this one is 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:51.729
 a bit more complicated than he has 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.119
 over a kite pad and two and dead 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.729
 yes kites the but also some 

00:00:55.119 --> 00:01:00.790
 We can recommend kite skills 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:02.500
 Here you best a humanoid spec 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.059
 right at the beginning to use 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.580
 example here the ambassador flames 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.290
 beat and then follow pads with 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.330
 small tip skills or too 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.220
 small animals to themselves because these are on 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.260
 best suited against him and thus 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.420
 you will to win it fairly quickly 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.270
 Because these skills simply carry on 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.310
 most effective against him are and yes 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.590
 continue to be wary of 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.690
 his undead petz because these sweep 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.850
 back after her first death 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.770
 So you should be prepared for it 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.830
 and possibly pets 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.370
 have the defensive skills in the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.870
 have repertoire and yes you should 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.920
 actually no big problems with it 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.440
 have and quickly defeat him yours 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.690
 next opponent is at kiel under one 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.580
 small gnome in hollen fjord which 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.070
 two turkeys and a penguin 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.710
 will use the two in the fight 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.950
 yes turkey or is a chicken and a 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.830
 turkey as you see have the type of flight 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.380
 as a pet guy sitting against this guy 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.479
 they are the best in Japan about magic 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.760
 skills are available here, for example 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.220
 Small parts I have taken around 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.750
 with that you should have the first two 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.130
 actually defeat places pretty quickly 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.760
 maybe even with a pad 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.379
 alone i have two magical pet 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.659
 in any case packed for the 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.670
 penguin in the end you should have a pad 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.829
 take which overflight skills 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.260
 because these are special 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.720
 effective against the penguin and also 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
 through this simple constellation of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.190
 You should be the opponent quite quickly 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.840
 win 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.090
 the third house pulls trainer we 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.860
 today you introduce nordend is the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.040
 citizen a good which you 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.750
 this is actually challenging 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.209
 no big challenge for you 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.640
 all you need is one 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.470
 wild animal and two mechanical pads or 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.989
 also a mechanical tack depending on 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.420
 how offensive or defensive you are with them 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.090
 You see, this is his two 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.280
 maggots he has with him are as 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.590
 Wild animals classified against these expensive ones 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.769
 mechanical space 1 or pads with 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.049
 mechanical skills and his rat 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.940
 Of course, it's a small animal against them 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.099
 can you, for example, a cat 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.859
 which everyone probably uses 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.409
 of you yes in his collecting book has 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.349
 and this fight is generally mine 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.239
 opinion after one of the simplest and 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.910
 should be done quickly 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:30.030
 actually only an obstacle to success 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:32.400
 that he gets in the end then the 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.709
 fourth coach we beat today 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.319
 must is the almost headless Jacob 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.120
 this could be for some of you 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.250
 pose a bigger problem for example 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.139
 for me too because he owns three 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.359
 Undead adversaries I personally have 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.549
 actually hardly petz of the type small animal 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.819
 but these are especially effective against 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.120
 him 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:53.819
 So you should have at least two ipads 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.879
 in this fight they send over small ones 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.230
 skills at least dispose of when 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.690
 you have that then is this fight 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.010
 relatively easy if not recommended then 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.699
 I definitely patch you too 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.519
 use 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.370
 they have magic skills 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.470
 For example, have or patch 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.449
 have defensive skills 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.549
 so that you could survive longer than 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:16.349
 all of his three ipads will be after the 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.870
 death only once reappears you know 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.449
 that yes from the undead pets this 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.460
 are not defeated right away but you 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.409
 in principle, then only this further 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.810
 round when they came back over 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.230
 live and it could be that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.640
 he the 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.350
 I have to do the fight again 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.730
 Personally, he was lucky in the end as well 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.640
 it was a bit shorter for me 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.410
 Nevertheless, I think that this coach 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.050
 not the hardest one for that yet 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:45.300
 Let's get the last fight 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.730
 pet trainer is on the list today 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.620
 major payne which you at the agency 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.920
 tournament finds and he sends the same 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.630
 his first pad into the race that too 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.990
 his strongest is this bear 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.000
 is a wild animal and has the annoying 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.890
 habit to cure high during 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.790
 Of course, he can turn himself 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.490
 do not attack 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.260
 heals but several more 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.450
 a hundred life points is so high 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.040
 quite an annoying opponent 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.140
 altogether also sent one 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.110
 mechanical pad in the fight and a 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:18.150
 Elementary to my setup looked like this 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.950
 I've been walking with the tiny 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.110
 Bomb started so a mechanical 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.940
 pad against his bear against his 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.880
 then I have a mechanical pad again 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.980
 an elementary in the fight and sent 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.420
 against are sent elementary at the end 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.730
 you just a pad of the 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.350
 classification water then you should 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.390
 actually no big problems 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.370
 have that be important in the fight 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.710
 actually that he was this bear on 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.780
 survived at the beginning and can defeat him 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.360
 because you should not succeed 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.880
 The fight is really very difficult and hard 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.620
 the bear it in principle, I also find the 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.740
 hurdle you have to master if you 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.570
 defeated the bear then the rest is 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.940
 actually a child game because his 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.780
 Other pads have far weaker ones 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.040
 Skills 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.960
 I hope I could give you a little bit 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.630
 help and wish you in any case 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.790
 Have fun imitating and yourself 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.650
 Try the entire written 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.780
 Of course, you will find on a car 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.730
 and de is of course still in the bottom 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.980
 video description linked there 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.690
 We have many details again to the 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.880
 single fight pet trainers 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.860
 listed I wish you something 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.860
 until next time your karbach
