not the most crucial first turn maneuver

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.230 
not the most crucial first turn maneuver
but<00:01:16.009> maybe<00:01:16.280> if<00:01:16.460> you<00:01:16.490> wants<00:01:16.759> to<00:01:16.820> make<00:01:16.940> sure<00:01:16.970> no

but maybe if you wants to make sure no
one<00:01:17.360> else<00:01:17.479> gets<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.930> because<00:01:18.440> I<00:01:18.560> can<00:01:18.710> imagine

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
one else gets it because I can imagine

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.410 
one else gets it because I can imagine
if<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.780> read<00:01:20.780> red<00:01:21.290> or<00:01:21.500> green<00:01:21.770> if<00:01:21.979> they<00:01:22.100> go<00:01:22.280> a

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
if you read red or green if they go a

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.760 
if you read red or green if they go a
combat<00:01:23.420> modifier<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.049> then<00:01:24.140> grab<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.409> snake

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
combat modifier and then grab the snake

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.100 
combat modifier and then grab the snake
as<00:01:24.950> well<00:01:25.159> maybe<00:01:25.909> that<00:01:26.119> make<00:01:26.420> very<00:01:26.869> difficult

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
as well maybe that make very difficult

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.820 
as well maybe that make very difficult
to<00:01:27.470> defeat<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.970> red<00:01:29.750> looks<00:01:30.470> like<00:01:30.650> they're

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
to defeat so red looks like they're

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.250

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.929 
definitely useful but you don't get the
victory<00:02:00.829> once<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:01.700> one<00:02:01.820> of<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
victory once for that but one of the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.789 
victory once for that but one of the
people<00:02:02.119> has<00:02:02.240> charged<00:02:02.509> it<00:02:02.659> also<00:02:02.869> negates<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:03.710> as

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
people has charged it also negates it as

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.010 
people has charged it also negates it as
well<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.189> while<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:04.970> useful<00:02:05.390> as<00:02:05.689> charged

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
well so while that is useful as charged

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.050 
well so while that is useful as charged
essence<00:02:06.320> early<00:02:06.680> I'd<00:02:06.920> say<00:02:07.189> it's<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.490> very<00:02:07.640> strong

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
essence early I'd say it's a very strong

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.780 
essence early I'd say it's a very strong
ability<00:02:09.100> looks<00:02:10.100> like<00:02:10.190> blue<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.369> upgrading

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
look for them three power so the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.490 
look for them three power so the
important<00:02:14.390> thing<00:02:14.510> there<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.750> they<00:02:15.019> still<00:02:15.290> have

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
important thing there is they still have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.979 
important thing there is they still have
the<00:02:15.620> power<00:02:15.799> to<00:02:15.920> purchase<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:17.540> upgrade

the power to purchase that upgrade

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.380 
the power to purchase that upgrade
whatever<00:02:18.829> that<00:02:19.040> could<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.340> gained<00:02:19.519> from<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
whatever that could have gained from the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.569 
whatever that could have gained from the
two<00:02:21.459> looks<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.730> Fred<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.600> now<00:02:24.579> spending

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
that's strong but it's more of a late

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.580 
that's strong but it's more of a late
round<00:02:43.820> maneuver<00:02:44.300> right<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:45.170> don't<00:02:45.350> want<00:02:45.530> to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
round maneuver right you don't want to

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.630 
round maneuver right you don't want to
do<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.770> too<00:02:45.980> early<00:02:46.220> beginning<00:02:46.490> because

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
do that too early beginning because

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400 
do that too early beginning because
you're<00:02:46.760> basically<00:02:47.270> putting<00:02:47.720> paying<00:02:48.080> yourself

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
combo well with the red ability which

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.830 
combo well with the red ability which
allows<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.340> basically<00:03:13.370> discard<00:03:14.060> them<00:03:14.240> for<00:03:14.420> +1

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840

effective
looks<00:03:24.740> like<00:03:24.860> rights<00:03:25.130> grabbing<00:03:25.460> an<00:03:25.550> additional

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
looks like rights grabbing an additional

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.880 
looks like rights grabbing an additional
temple<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.560> red<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.640> temporary<00:03:29.030> beat<00:03:29.180> vp<00:03:29.890> it

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
temple so red is to temporary beat vp it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.530 
temple so red is to temporary beat vp it
looks<00:03:31.310> like<00:03:31.460> in<00:03:31.580> there<00:03:31.670> in<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.820> head<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:32.420> that

looks like in there in the head but that

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.700 
looks like in there in the head but that
doesn't<00:03:32.720> really<00:03:32.840> mean<00:03:33.080> much<00:03:33.110> because<00:03:33.560> those

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
doesn't really mean much because those

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.760 
doesn't really mean much because those
spots<00:03:33.950> can<00:03:34.130> be<00:03:34.280> open<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.820> attack<00:03:35.560> looks<00:03:36.560> like

green it's no Oh yep speaking of attack

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.360 
green it's no Oh yep speaking of attack
green<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:43.910> moving<00:03:44.270> over<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.930> red<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:46.040> it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.800 
green is now moving over to red and it

looks like we're gonna have a fight so

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.360 
looks like we're gonna have a fight so
it<00:03:47.870> moves<00:03:48.020> over<00:03:48.140> all<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.440> units<00:03:48.710> like<00:03:49.070> I<00:03:49.190> said

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
it moves over all the units like I said

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
you really don't want to do in the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.500 
you really don't want to do in the
beginning<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:51.260> want<00:03:51.440> to<00:03:51.500> make<00:03:51.620> sure<00:03:51.650> to<00:03:52.510> try

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
beginning you want to make sure to try

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.750 
beginning you want to make sure to try
it<00:03:53.600> later<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.650> turn<00:03:54.860> try<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.310> solidify

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
it later in the turn try to solidify

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.030 
it later in the turn try to solidify
your<00:03:55.970> grasp<00:03:56.360> because<00:03:57.170> if<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.350> lose<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.590> you

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
your grasp because if you lose that you

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.100 
your grasp because if you lose that you
basically<00:03:58.190> wasted<00:03:58.880> a<00:03:58.940> movement<00:03:59.150> you<00:03:59.750> wasted

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
basically wasted a movement you wasted

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.380 
basically wasted a movement you wasted
the<00:04:00.140> prayer<00:04:00.470> and<00:04:01.190> effectively<00:04:01.970> for<00:04:02.180> nothing

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
the prayer and effectively for nothing

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.510 
the prayer and effectively for nothing
so<00:04:02.570> let's<00:04:03.500> see<00:04:03.950> what<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.250> combat<00:04:04.580> cards<00:04:04.880> are

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
so let's see what the combat cards are

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.030 
so let's see what the combat cards are
all<00:04:07.520> right<00:04:07.640> blue<00:04:08.480> has<00:04:08.690> spent<00:04:08.990> for<00:04:09.770> two

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
all right blue has spent for two

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.479 
all right blue has spent for two
strength<00:04:10.400> ah<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:13.360> blue<00:04:14.360> is<00:04:14.750> or<00:04:15.800> sorry<00:04:16.160> blue

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
strength ah so blue is or sorry blue

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.550 
strength ah so blue is or sorry blue
green<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.239> effectively<00:04:17.660> destroyed<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.170> combat

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
green is effectively destroyed in combat

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.430 
green is effectively destroyed in combat
now<00:04:19.340> that<00:04:19.520> seems<00:04:19.760> like<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:19.940> terrible<00:04:20.239> loss<00:04:21.080> for

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
now that seems like a terrible loss for

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.510 
now that seems like a terrible loss for
red<00:04:21.830> but<00:04:22.490> lost<00:04:22.700> or<00:04:22.970> but<00:04:23.480> she<00:04:23.660> just<00:04:23.870> played<00:04:24.050> the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
red but lost or but she just played the

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.670 
red but lost or but she just played the
three<00:04:25.520> blood<00:04:25.930> which<00:04:26.930> kills<00:04:27.170> three<00:04:27.350> units<00:04:27.590> and

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
three blood which kills three units and

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.150 
three blood which kills three units and
gets<00:04:27.800> her<00:04:27.860> six<00:04:28.160> power<00:04:28.630> so<00:04:29.630> this<00:04:30.410> is<00:04:30.590> why<00:04:30.800> I

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
gets her six power so this is why I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.010 
gets her six power so this is why I
think<00:04:31.370> crusade<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.060> one<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.330> these<00:04:32.480> strongest

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
think crusade is one of these strongest

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.290 
think crusade is one of these strongest
cards<00:04:33.260> in<00:04:33.380> the<00:04:33.440> game<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:34.520> can<00:04:34.730> charge<00:04:35.030> up

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
cards in the game you can charge up

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.540 
cards in the game you can charge up
without<00:04:35.840> having<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.230> waste<00:04:36.380> actions<00:04:36.860> true<00:04:37.250> she

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550

without having to waste actions true she
went<00:04:38.120> there<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.660> wasn't<00:04:39.140> able<00:04:39.290> to<00:04:39.440> keep<00:04:39.620> it

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
went there and wasn't able to keep it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.550

which<00:05:26.420> I<00:05:26.540> would<00:05:26.660> recommend<00:05:26.950> so<00:05:27.950> definitely

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
which I would recommend so definitely

gotten<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.950> upgrade<00:05:31.730> that<00:05:31.880> allows<00:05:31.940> them<00:05:32.390> to

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
gotten the upgrade that allows them to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.280 
gotten the upgrade that allows them to
pay<00:05:32.750> less<00:05:33.020> for<00:05:33.880> upgrade<00:05:34.880> so<00:05:35.060> that's<00:05:35.240> nice<00:05:35.480> so

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
pay less for upgrade so that's nice so

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.640 
pay less for upgrade so that's nice so
definitely<00:05:38.020> good<00:05:39.020> for<00:05:39.230> them

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
definitely good for them

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.040 
definitely good for them
and<00:05:40.310> that's<00:05:40.550> gonna<00:05:40.670> be<00:05:40.820> a<00:05:40.850> strong<00:05:41.240> that's<00:05:41.960> a

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
and that's gonna be a strong that's a

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.110 
and that's gonna be a strong that's a
strong<00:05:42.350> thing<00:05:42.530> to<00:05:42.650> get<00:05:42.740> in<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:42.950> early<00:05:43.400> part<00:05:44.060> of

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
strong thing to get in the early part of

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.400 
strong thing to get in the early part of
the<00:05:44.210> game<00:05:45.670> but<00:05:46.670> obviously<00:05:47.150> as<00:05:47.480> you<00:05:47.840> later<00:05:48.200> into

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
the game but obviously as you later into

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.530 
the game but obviously as you later into
the<00:05:48.440> game<00:05:48.710> more<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:49.400> more<00:05:49.610> rounds<00:05:50.060> becomes

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
the game more and more rounds becomes

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.090 
the game more and more rounds becomes
less<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:50.900> less<00:05:50.960> effective<00:05:51.200> for<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.770> life<00:05:51.920> the

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
less and less effective for the life the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.000 
less and less effective for the life the
game<00:05:52.280> so<00:05:53.120> it<00:05:53.780> turns<00:05:54.050> out<00:05:54.170> we<00:05:54.320> have<00:05:54.500> green<00:05:54.860> with

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
game so it turns out we have green with

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.530 
game so it turns out we have green with
one<00:05:55.190> permanent<00:05:55.460> victory<00:05:55.790> for<00:05:56.000> that<00:05:56.120> combat

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.540 
one permanent victory for that combat

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.930 
one permanent victory for that combat
win<00:05:56.720> and<00:05:56.930> one<00:05:57.020> temporary<00:05:57.470> victory<00:05:57.650> point<00:05:58.190> red

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
win and one temporary victory point red

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.120 
win and one temporary victory point red
has<00:05:59.150> two<00:05:59.510> one<00:05:59.960> from<00:06:00.140> the<00:06:00.200> temple<00:06:00.560> and<00:06:00.710> one<00:06:00.980> from
