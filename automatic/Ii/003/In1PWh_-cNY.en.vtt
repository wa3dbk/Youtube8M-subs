00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.869
 I have a preference for all city hand made passengers with 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.869
 what people have been doing a craft went to

 I have expressed in being 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.550
 the leica set he already knows 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.770
 What he wants as a designer for ICT is not obligatory to his idea 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770

 she that means a lot of good and I have a very specific taste and lost 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.430
 kars taken 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.920
 but a bit of what I mean to make which to make 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 and i like to notice it that way 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:12.549

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.249
 material and 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.339
 not directly with 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.339

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.209
 saying that maybe that is a bit too 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.709
 spirit of the moment to make things a little quieter 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:53.789
