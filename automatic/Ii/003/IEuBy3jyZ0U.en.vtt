00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.810

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.280
 You can see here, you already recognized me 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.010
 my ipad 3 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.809
 its wi-fi version and see 6.1 and I know that 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.390
 just click on boil to 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.910
 start this herb and is characterized by 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.019
 to be too easy, so easy that 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.180
 we do not even need to put in 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.640
 matter mode of us and good is 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.500
 compatible with the fourth ipod touch 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.000
 fifth generation generation 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.690
 the ipad second third and fourth 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.680
 generation the ipad mini iphone 4 the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.509
 3gs 4 that and the iphone 5 in practically 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.369
 because the positive that can be in 96 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.869
 but as you can see here is already 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.490
 loading what they are told not to 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.250
 we touch nothing and decide to do it from 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.630
 touch those who touch absolutely nothing and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.119
 let's wait for it to continue as they can 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.009
 see on the ipad already started loading what 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.100
 is the jailbreak and we are going to wait for a 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.100
 moment 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 I liked how you can see here in the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.030
 application already finished tells us what is 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.940
 what we have our device and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.350
 we press the jailbreak button that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.600
 is in this part of here as what 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.650
 can appreciate let's open it and good 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.290
 will keep charging what is the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.130
 procedure to be able to conclude and the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.130
 installation also decided 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.370
 and good as you can see here I end up 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.010
 I do not know we can close the application 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.159
 is and only what is going to be the epa 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.750
 at that moment it restarts to start and 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.700
 good we have that as always 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.439
 connect to our Wi-Fi network before 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.360
 can say so I can load all 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.530
 the files needed to run the 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.510
 application 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.299

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.340
 application 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.220
 but as you can see it 's loading 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.960
 and we go for the one that starts 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.860

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.900
 silvia to start loading all the 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.600
 necessary files to be able to run the 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.000
 application after this is going to close 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.320

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.220
 saturated with the network but once 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.360
