 yes hello and welcome to wow place the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.590
 Nobody knows or almost nobody knows 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.830
 we are here in the araki highlands 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 Below me is the camp of the pale 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.440
 borken 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.990
 and we will be heading right now 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 marshland flying 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.560
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.560
 ipad can get 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.240
 So here's the direction swamp lander 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
 and you see the bridge who is not 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.360
 Can also fly over the bridge 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:45.360
 ride and then left here on the mountain 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 along comes the circle of life 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.489
 and immediately we are in the raptor 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.809
 Degree 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.570
 you can see that a bit 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.750
 entrance of a cave 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.070
 here are loud dinosaurs and fly there 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.559
 we go in and if we are lucky 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.489
 we will have a little the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.489
 to be able to use 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.479
 I've been in there before and 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.149
 there was actually the egg of 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.829
 Cinemas elsewhere and I will do that for you 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.390
 even now I do not know 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.740
 whether that always somewhere else bond or at the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.310
 same place if you changed that 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.819
 I do not know 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.450
 Now is the chance of materials 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:44.319
 here the nest is the click march on 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:50.380
 and then we get the sheep here 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:55.509
 few cubs it used to be 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:59.799
 so this one can be here on 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.729
 Entrance of a small felsspalte 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.729
 has found 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.010
 down 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.670
 and the nest is here in that 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.670
 area locked 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.230

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.310
