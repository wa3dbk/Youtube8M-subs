00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
like to 200 me is I like to tune the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.380 
like to 200 me is I like to tune the
18-inch<00:00:25.170> for<00:00:25.470> Tom<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:25.980> low<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:27.060> get<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
18-inch for Tom as low as I can get it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.419 
18-inch for Tom as low as I can get it
getting<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> wrinkles<00:00:28.619> out<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.980> head<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
giving it as much bottom end as I can

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.639 
giving it as much bottom end as I can
then<00:00:32.420> what<00:00:33.420> I'd<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.140> tuned<00:00:34.440> up

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
then what I'd like to do is I tuned up

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.400 
then what I'd like to do is I tuned up
from<00:00:35.100> there<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> try<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> tune<00:00:37.200> in

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
from there and I like to try to tune in

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.799 
from there and I like to try to tune in
fifths<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.120> hit<00:00:39.329> two<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.570> them

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
fifths so that when you hit two of them

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
fifths so that when you hit two of them
next<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.260> each<00:00:40.320> other<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> creates<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
next to each other it kind of creates a

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170 
next to each other it kind of creates a
power<00:00:42.059> chord<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:43.110> that's<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> idea<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
power chord and that's the idea of this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.610 
power chord and that's the idea of this
whole<00:00:45.390> thing<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.320> give<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.559> an

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
whole thing so I'm gonna give you an

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.760 
whole thing so I'm gonna give you an
example<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.539> I'm<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> hit<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.289> top

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
example of that I'm going to hit the top

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.170 
example of that I'm going to hit the top
two<00:00:49.980> Tom's<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.640> then<00:00:50.730> I'll<00:00:50.820> just<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
two Tom's and then I'll just kind of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479 
two Tom's and then I'll just kind of
work<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.539> way<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:51.750> two<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> time<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.430> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
work my way down two at a time so you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.610 
work my way down two at a time so you
can<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.850> an<00:00:53.969> idea<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.170> might<00:00:55.350> sound

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
can get an idea of what that might sound

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:59.560 
can get an idea of what that might sound
like<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.280> go

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.880 

therefore<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.720> to<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.110> lot<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> crack

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
therefore I like to have a lot of crack

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
therefore I like to have a lot of crack
and<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.240> have<00:02:03.510> a<00:02:03.540> lot<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:05.330> ring<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.900> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.090 
and like you have a lot of ring I like a
lot<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.200> ring<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
lot of ring to it

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.150 
lot of ring to it
not<00:02:09.000> super-tight<00:02:09.480> the<00:02:10.320> head<00:02:10.500> not<00:02:10.740> super-tight

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
not super-tight the head not super-tight

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
it kind of gives it a crack with a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.110 
it kind of gives it a crack with a
little<00:02:15.510> bit<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.780> ring<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:17.280> here's<00:02:17.550> how<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
little bit of a ring so here's how the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.700 
little bit of a ring so here's how the
snare<00:02:18.480> drum<00:02:18.690> sounds<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.230> way<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.590> to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
snare drum sounds is the way I like to

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
snare drum sounds is the way I like to
tune<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.040> snare<00:02:20.250> drum

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.260 

I<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> tune<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.140> it's<00:03:02.940> very<00:03:03.940> loose

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
I like to tune so that it's very loose

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.990 
I like to tune so that it's very loose
so<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.110> gets<00:03:05.319> as<00:03:05.590> low<00:03:06.010> a<00:03:06.040> pitch<00:03:06.430> as<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:06.640> can<00:03:06.819> now

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
so it gets as low a pitch as you can now

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.720 
so it gets as low a pitch as you can now
the<00:03:07.390> thing<00:03:07.600> that<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.750> noticed<00:03:08.260> when<00:03:08.860> playing

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
the thing that I noticed when playing

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.820 
the thing that I noticed when playing
around<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:11.140> sometimes<00:03:11.590> you<00:03:11.709> can

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
around with it is that sometimes you can

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.080 
around with it is that sometimes you can
have<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.100> absolutely<00:03:12.489> as<00:03:12.610> loose<00:03:12.820> as<00:03:13.000> possible

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
have it absolutely as loose as possible

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.699 
have it absolutely as loose as possible
you<00:03:13.780> know<00:03:13.900> getting<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.170> wrinkles<00:03:14.560> out<00:03:14.650> of

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
you know getting the wrinkles out of

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.130 
you know getting the wrinkles out of
both<00:03:14.980> heads<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.519> whatever<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.840> get<00:03:16.989> it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
both heads and whatever you can get it

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.840 
both heads and whatever you can get it
really<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.650> loose<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.430> still<00:03:18.670> won't

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
really really loose and it still won't

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.370 
really really loose and it still won't
give<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.209> quite<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.750> sound<00:03:19.989> that<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.350> want

when I when I go to record so I love if
you<00:03:35.230> look<00:03:35.380> at<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.530> other<00:03:35.590> video<00:03:35.890> you'll<00:03:36.519> also

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670

see<00:03:36.940> that<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:39.130> trick<00:03:39.459> hard<00:03:40.090> plastic

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
see that I have the trick hard plastic

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.100

beaters<00:03:40.959> with<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.800> click<00:03:42.580> pad<00:03:42.819> on<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.959> bass

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
drum so it gives it as much attack on

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.210 
drum so it gives it as much attack on
this<00:03:46.600> side<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.959> kid<00:03:47.140> anyway<00:03:47.320> as<00:03:47.620> possible
