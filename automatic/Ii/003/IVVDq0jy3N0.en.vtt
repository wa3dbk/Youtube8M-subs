I'm<00:00:00.240> gonna<00:00:00.780> talk<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.230> guys<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.410> little<00:00:01.650> bit

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I'm gonna talk to you guys a little bit

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.930 
I'm gonna talk to you guys a little bit
about<00:00:02.040> how<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> calculate<00:00:03.650> linkage<00:00:04.650> map<00:00:05.190> units

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
about how to calculate linkage map units

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.390 
about how to calculate linkage map units
in<00:00:06.390> genetics<00:00:07.379> so<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:07.859> were<00:00:07.950> talking<00:00:08.099> today

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
in genetics so we were talking today

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.520 
in genetics so we were talking today
about<00:00:08.790> how<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> determine<00:00:10.080> what<00:00:10.260> every

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
about how to determine what every

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.190 
about how to determine what every
comment<00:00:11.070> organism<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> first<00:00:13.019> thing

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
comment organism was so the first thing

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.330 
comment organism was so the first thing
we're<00:00:13.290> gonna<00:00:13.380> do<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.710> look<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.070> problem

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
we're gonna do is look at this problem

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.540 
we're gonna do is look at this problem
in<00:00:14.580> mastering<00:00:15.000> biology<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.980> chapter<00:00:16.980> 15

and<00:00:17.580> it's<00:00:18.000> item<00:00:18.449> number<00:00:18.660> six<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.380> your

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and it's item number six in your

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.950 
and it's item number six in your
homework<00:00:19.910> you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> problem<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.689> on

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
homework you can see the problem here on

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.240 
homework you can see the problem here on
the<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:22.199> if<00:00:22.410> two<00:00:22.590> genes<00:00:22.830> are<00:00:22.949> found<00:00:23.160> on

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
the right if two genes are found on

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.920 
the right if two genes are found on
different<00:00:23.550> chromosomes<00:00:23.850> or<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:24.630> are<00:00:24.750> far

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
different chromosomes or if they are far

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050 
different chromosomes or if they are far
enough<00:00:25.109> apart<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> same<00:00:25.859> chromosome<00:00:26.220> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
enough apart on the same chromosome that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.730 
enough apart on the same chromosome that
the<00:00:27.210> chance<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.660> crossover<00:00:28.019> between<00:00:28.199> them

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the chance of a crossover between them

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.200 
the chance of a crossover between them
is<00:00:28.830> very<00:00:28.859> high<00:00:29.250> then<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> genes<00:00:30.000> are

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
is very high then the genes are

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.450 
is very high then the genes are
considered<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:30.840> unlinked<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.769> these

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
considered to be unlinked and these

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.880 
considered to be unlinked and these
aren't<00:00:32.640> Mendelian<00:00:33.180> genes<00:00:33.360> however<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
aren't Mendelian genes however if the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
aren't Mendelian genes however if the
two<00:00:35.040> genes<00:00:35.370> are<00:00:35.550> traveling<00:00:36.329> together<00:00:36.480> because

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
two genes are traveling together because

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.479 
two genes are traveling together because
they're<00:00:37.170> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> same<00:00:37.530> chromosome<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.280> close

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
they're on the same chromosome or close

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.979 
they're on the same chromosome or close
to<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.760> another<00:00:38.790> they're<00:00:39.270> said<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.690> linked

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
to one another they're said to be linked

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
to one another they're said to be linked
and<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.160> follow<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.820> law<00:00:41.850> of

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
and they do not follow the law of

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.639 
and they do not follow the law of
independent<00:00:42.420> assortment<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:43.260> what<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> have

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
independent assortment so what we have

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.080 
independent assortment so what we have
done<00:00:43.829> already<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.219> class<00:00:44.370> today<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:44.910> looked

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
done already in class today is we looked

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.069 
done already in class today is we looked
at<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.329> tomato<00:00:45.840> plants<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> their<00:00:47.160> traits

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
at these tomato plants and their traits

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.860 
at these tomato plants and their traits
the<00:00:49.079> solid<00:00:49.469> leaves<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.789> dominant<00:00:51.629> trait

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the solid leaves are the dominant trait

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.819 
the solid leaves are the dominant trait
or<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> wild-type

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
or the wild-type

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.090 
or the wild-type
normal<00:00:53.699> hind<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.149> smooth<00:00:54.449> skin<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
normal hind and smooth skin and then the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610 
normal hind and smooth skin and then the
recessive<00:00:56.699> traits<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.600> mottled<00:00:57.899> leaves

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
recessive traits are the mottled leaves

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.910 
recessive traits are the mottled leaves
the<00:00:59.039> dwarf<00:00:59.309> plant<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.910> peach<00:01:00.120> skin<00:01:00.920> so

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the dwarf plant and the peach skin so

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.080 
the dwarf plant and the peach skin so
what<00:01:02.039> we've<00:01:02.160> done<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.730> already<00:01:02.969> went

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
what we've done here we already went

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
what we've done here we already went
through<00:01:03.300> how<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> determine<00:01:05.600> basically<00:01:06.830> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
through how to determine basically the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
through how to determine basically the
phenotypic<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.790> genotypic<00:01:09.210> ratio<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.930> I'm

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
phenotypic and genotypic ratio so I'm

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.289 
phenotypic and genotypic ratio so I'm
gonna<00:01:10.170> scroll<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.650> way<00:01:11.010> down<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.729> past

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
gonna scroll all the way down here past

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.609 
gonna scroll all the way down here past
all<00:01:12.570> these<00:01:12.720> things<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.049> we've<00:01:13.200> already<00:01:13.380> done

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
all these things that we've already done

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.499 
all these things that we've already done
Part<00:01:14.280> B<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> be<00:01:14.880> important<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
Part B is going to be important in just

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.580 
Part B is going to be important in just
a<00:01:15.689> second<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:17.570> basically<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.960> asking<00:01:19.200> us

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a second so basically it's asking us

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.749 
a second so basically it's asking us
well<00:01:19.860> let<00:01:19.979> me<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.220> scroll<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> way<00:01:20.580> down

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
well let me just scroll all the way down

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.370 
well let me just scroll all the way down
here<00:01:20.939> suppose<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.540> perform<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> cross

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
here suppose that we perform the cross

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
here suppose that we perform the cross
discussed<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.130> Part<00:01:23.400> B<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.210> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
discussed in Part B and here it is that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.320 
discussed in Part B and here it is that
the<00:01:25.350> heterozygous<00:01:26.159> individual<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
the heterozygous individual and the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.539 
the heterozygous individual and the
recessive<00:01:27.900> individual<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.979> we've<00:01:29.100> planted<00:01:29.340> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
recessive individual so we've planted a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.359 
recessive individual so we've planted a
thousand<00:01:29.939> tomato<00:01:30.150> seeds<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.720> result

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
thousand tomato seeds and they result

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
thousand tomato seeds and they result
with<00:01:32.369> these<00:01:32.640> individuals<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.750> on<00:01:33.840> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
with these individuals here on this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.569 
with these individuals here on this
table<00:01:34.400> if<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:35.610> 420<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.740> them<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.159> look

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
table if you have 420 of them that look

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.410 
table if you have 420 of them that look
like<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.680> heterozygous<00:01:40.680> individual<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.549> then

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
like a heterozygous individual and then

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.630 
like a heterozygous individual and then
various<00:01:42.869> numbers<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.500> variants<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.549> at

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
various numbers of variants and then at

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.990 
various numbers of variants and then at
the<00:01:44.729> bottom<00:01:45.030> we<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.350> 416<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.490> recessive

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the bottom we have 416 of the recessive

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.450 
the bottom we have 416 of the recessive
individual<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.439> I've<00:01:49.590> done<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.920> I've

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
individual so what I've done is I've

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
individual so what I've done is I've
kind<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> put<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.390> together<00:01:51.600> over<00:01:52.110> here

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
kind of put all this together over here

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.679 
kind of put all this together over here
on<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.439> left<00:01:52.770> into<00:01:53.329> my<00:01:54.329> own<00:01:54.509> little<00:01:54.689> table<00:01:56.689> so

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
on the left into my own little table so

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.690 
on the left into my own little table so
I've<00:01:58.049> got<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.500> parental<00:01:58.799> types<00:01:59.159> from<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> very

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
I've got my parental types from the very

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.660 
I've got my parental types from the very
beginning<00:01:59.939> we<00:02:00.630> had<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.189> homozygous<00:02:02.189> dominant

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
beginning we had a homozygous dominant

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.480 
beginning we had a homozygous dominant
individual<00:02:03.479> cross<00:02:04.380> with<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.070> recessive

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
individual cross with a recessive

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.940 
individual cross with a recessive
individual<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.329> then<00:02:07.049> after<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.829> we

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
individual and then after that we

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.949 
individual and then after that we
decided<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.429> do<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> test<00:02:08.819> cross<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
decided to do a test cross so so the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.559 
decided to do a test cross so so the
numbers<00:02:10.229> we<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:11.090> are<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.300> numbers

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
numbers we have here are the numbers

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.910 
numbers we have here are the numbers
resulting<00:02:13.170> from<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> test<00:02:13.620> cross

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
resulting from the test cross

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.590 
resulting from the test cross
however<00:02:14.670> when<00:02:14.940> we're<00:02:15.060> talking<00:02:15.210> about<00:02:15.420> our

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
however when we're talking about our

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.570 
however when we're talking about our
parental<00:02:15.930> types<00:02:16.380> we<00:02:16.650> have<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.950> look<00:02:17.130> back<00:02:17.310> at

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
parental types we have to look back at

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.940 
parental types we have to look back at
the<00:02:17.700> very<00:02:17.910> beginning<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.170> P<00:02:19.380> generation

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
the very beginning to the P generation

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.730 
the very beginning to the P generation
not<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.640> f1<00:02:21.180> generation<00:02:21.319> so<00:02:22.319> when<00:02:22.590> we're

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
not the f1 generation so when we're

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.350 
not the f1 generation so when we're
asking<00:02:23.160> okay<00:02:23.430> are<00:02:23.610> these<00:02:23.790> individuals

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
asking okay are these individuals

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.199 
asking okay are these individuals
recombinant<00:02:25.110> or<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.500> we're<00:02:26.340> asking<00:02:26.760> do<00:02:27.060> they

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
recombinant or not we're asking do they

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.660 
recombinant or not we're asking do they
look<00:02:27.480> like<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.780> parental<00:02:28.319> type<00:02:28.980> or<00:02:29.340> do<00:02:29.520> they

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
look like a parental type or do they

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.699 
look like a parental type or do they
look<00:02:29.880> like<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.270> recombinant<00:02:30.959> type<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.590> they

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
look like a recombinant type do they

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.370 
look like a recombinant type do they
have<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.040> same<00:02:32.420> phenotype<00:02:33.420> as<00:02:33.600> a<00:02:33.630> parental<00:02:34.020> or

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
have the same phenotype as a parental or

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.680 
have the same phenotype as a parental or
not<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.459> what<00:02:35.760> we're<00:02:35.880> gonna<00:02:35.970> do<00:02:36.209> here<00:02:36.390> we've

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
not so what we're gonna do here we've

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.260 
not so what we're gonna do here we've
set<00:02:36.840> up<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.020> little<00:02:37.140> table<00:02:37.430> we<00:02:38.430> can't<00:02:38.670> look<00:02:39.150> at

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
set up a little table we can't look at

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.449 
set up a little table we can't look at
all<00:02:39.360> three<00:02:39.570> genes<00:02:40.020> at<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.320> same<00:02:40.500> time<00:02:40.800> so

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
all three genes at the same time so

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.050 
all three genes at the same time so
we're<00:02:41.580> gonna<00:02:41.670> look<00:02:41.880> at<00:02:42.030> each<00:02:42.239> one<00:02:42.440> as<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.500> pair

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
we're gonna look at each one as a pair

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.040 
we're gonna look at each one as a pair
so<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.239> first<00:02:45.450> thing<00:02:45.600> we're<00:02:45.690> gonna<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:46.020> is

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
so the first thing we're gonna do is

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.610 
so the first thing we're gonna do is
okay<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.489> locus<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> indeed<00:02:48.420> do<00:02:49.260> we<00:02:49.410> have

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
okay for the locus and indeed do we have

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.890 
okay for the locus and indeed do we have
any<00:02:49.920> recombinants<00:02:50.820> now<00:02:50.970> these<00:02:51.209> guys<00:02:51.510> look

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
any recombinants now these guys look

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.259 
any recombinants now these guys look
like<00:02:52.080> one<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.650> parents<00:02:53.070> or<00:02:53.250> both<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:53.910> in

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
like one of the parents or both but in

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.030 
like one of the parents or both but in
this<00:02:54.390> case<00:02:54.540> they<00:02:54.690> look<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.200> parent<00:02:55.590> so

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
this case they look like one parent so

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.640 
this case they look like one parent so
we<00:02:56.340> can't<00:02:56.519> call<00:02:56.700> them<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.910> recombinant<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.530> what

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
we can't call them a recombinant so what

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.780 
we can't call them a recombinant so what
we've<00:02:58.739> got<00:02:58.800> to<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.190> go<00:02:59.310> all<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.550> way<00:02:59.580> down

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
we've got to do is go all the way down

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.910 
we've got to do is go all the way down
this<00:02:59.910> whole<00:03:00.090> first<00:03:00.360> column<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.920> determine

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
this whole first column and determine

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.240 
this whole first column and determine
who<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.670> recombinants<00:03:03.300> are<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.660> our<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:05.040> our

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
who the recombinants are of our of our

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.360 
who the recombinants are of our of our
offspring<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:05.970> our<00:03:06.120> progeny<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:08.220> we've

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
offspring here our progeny so what we've

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.350 
offspring here our progeny so what we've
got<00:03:09.680> recombinant<00:03:10.680> here

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
got recombinant here

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.009 
got recombinant here
here<00:03:12.440> here<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:14.040> here<00:03:14.269> these<00:03:15.269> guys<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.840> not

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
here here and here these guys do not

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.020 
here here and here these guys do not
look<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.470> parent<00:03:16.890> for<00:03:17.100> those<00:03:17.310> too<00:03:17.519> low

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
look like a parent for those too low

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.490 
look like a parent for those too low
side<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.540> M<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.989> Adi

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
side the M and Adi

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.789 
side the M and Adi
alright<00:03:20.430> so<00:03:20.640> they<00:03:20.790> don't<00:03:21.209> have<00:03:21.650> they<00:03:22.650> either

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
alright so they don't have they either

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.250 
alright so they don't have they either
have<00:03:23.010> mottled<00:03:23.340> skin<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.030> then<00:03:24.989> they<00:03:25.079> don't

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
have mottled skin and then they don't

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.560 
have mottled skin and then they don't
have<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> other<00:03:25.680> trait<00:03:25.980> or<00:03:26.239> they<00:03:27.239> don't<00:03:27.420> have

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
have the other trait or they don't have

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
have the other trait or they don't have
the<00:03:27.660> mottled<00:03:27.870> skin<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.170> they<00:03:28.230> do<00:03:28.290> have<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
the mottled skin and they do have the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.380 
the mottled skin and they do have the
other<00:03:28.709> trait<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.190> for<00:03:29.549> example<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.209> has

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
other trait so for example this one has

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.069 
other trait so for example this one has
the<00:03:30.540> mottled<00:03:30.840> skin<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.829> it<00:03:32.070> is<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.579> Dorf<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:34.019> we

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
the mottled skin but it is a Dorf and we

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.390 
the mottled skin but it is a Dorf and we
don't<00:03:34.230> have<00:03:34.320> a<00:03:34.380> parent<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.829> has<00:03:34.950> mottled

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
don't have a parent that has mottled

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.069 
don't have a parent that has mottled
skin<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.910> as<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> dwarf<00:03:36.390> we<00:03:36.630> have<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.750> parent

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
skin and as a dwarf we have a parent

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.069 
skin and as a dwarf we have a parent
that's<00:03:37.290> modeled<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:37.950> tall<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:39.420> we<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.049> a

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
that's modeled and tall and we have a

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.340 
that's modeled and tall and we have a
parent<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.799> is<00:03:41.510> I'm<00:03:42.510> sorry<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.810> solid<00:03:43.200> and

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
parent that is I'm sorry a solid and

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.289 
parent that is I'm sorry a solid and
tall<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.829> then<00:03:44.340> we<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.579> a<00:03:44.760> mottled<00:03:45.180> and

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
tall and then we have a mottled and

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.039 
tall and then we have a mottled and
dwarf<00:03:45.570> but<00:03:45.750> we<00:03:45.840> don't<00:03:46.019> have<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:46.380> that's<00:03:46.500> a

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
dwarf but we don't have one that's a

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.130 
dwarf but we don't have one that's a
solid<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.260> work<00:03:49.799> if<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.519> makes<00:03:50.670> any<00:03:50.760> sense

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
solid and work if that makes any sense

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.440 
solid and work if that makes any sense
okay<00:03:52.140> so<00:03:52.470> that's<00:03:52.650> how<00:03:52.709> we<00:03:52.829> determine<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:54.209> one

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
okay so that's how we determine this one

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.090 
okay so that's how we determine this one
is<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.890> solid<00:03:56.100> leaf<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.209> a<00:03:57.450> dwarf<00:03:57.600> also<00:03:58.100> this

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
is the solid leaf and a dwarf also this

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.400 
is the solid leaf and a dwarf also this
one<00:03:59.310> has<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.850> mottled<00:04:00.209> leaf<00:04:00.420> but<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.870> normal

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
one has the mottled leaf but is normal

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.650 
one has the mottled leaf but is normal
height<00:04:01.560> or<00:04:01.739> tall<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.360> then<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.450> one<00:04:03.630> also

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
height or tall and then this one also

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.890 
height or tall and then this one also
has<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:05.010> mottled<00:04:05.310> leaf<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:06.150> tall<00:04:06.630> so

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
has the the mottled leaf and is tall so

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.509 
has the the mottled leaf and is tall so
that's<00:04:07.440> why<00:04:07.590> those<00:04:07.739> aren't<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.070> recombinant

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
that's why those aren't the recombinant

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.470 
that's why those aren't the recombinant
so<00:04:08.700> I'm<00:04:08.760> gonna<00:04:08.850> go<00:04:09.000> ahead<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.150> fill<00:04:09.329> in<00:04:09.360> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.120 
so I'm gonna go ahead and fill in the
chart<00:04:09.720> for<00:04:09.840> all<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.109> these<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:10.950> this<00:04:11.070> is

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
chart for all of these and this is

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.130 
chart for all of these and this is
something<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.640> can<00:04:11.850> also<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:12.510> at<00:04:12.600> home<00:04:18.140> this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
something you can also do at home this

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.270 
something you can also do at home this
one

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
one

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.400 
one
okay<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.390> then<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.630> last<00:04:21.660> column<00:04:22.079> we're

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
okay and then the last column we're

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.920 
okay and then the last column we're
looking<00:04:22.680> at<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.920> D<00:04:23.130> and<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.520> P<00:04:23.700> locus<00:04:24.330> so<00:04:24.660> is

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
looking at the D and the P locus so is

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.900 
looking at the D and the P locus so is
it<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.200> door<00:04:25.410> for<00:04:25.590> naught<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.670> the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
it a door for naught and is it have the

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.730 
it a door for naught and is it have the
smooth<00:04:27.150> skin<00:04:27.450> or<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.630> peach<00:04:27.810> skin<00:04:28.020> on<00:04:28.620> the

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
smooth skin or the peach skin on the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.060 
smooth skin or the peach skin on the
tomato<00:04:29.040> plant<00:04:29.750> tomato<00:04:30.750> fruit<00:04:32.060> -<00:04:33.740> these<00:04:34.740> guys

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
tomato plant tomato fruit - these guys

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.970 
tomato plant tomato fruit - these guys
are<00:04:35.130> recombinant<00:04:36.260> there's<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.500> Bell

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
are recombinant there's the Bell

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.500 
are recombinant there's the Bell
time<00:04:38.190> for<00:04:38.310> me<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.490> go<00:04:38.610> home<00:04:38.730> just<00:04:38.790> kidding<00:04:39.420> and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
time for me to go home just kidding and

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.700 
time for me to go home just kidding and
then<00:04:40.410> this<00:04:41.400> one<00:04:41.670> is<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.820> recombinant<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:43.590> this

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
then this one is a recombinant and this

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.800 
then this one is a recombinant and this
is<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:43.890> recombinant<00:04:44.400> okay<00:04:45.120> so<00:04:45.180> now<00:04:45.450> we<00:04:45.510> know<00:04:45.690> who

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
is a recombinant okay so now we know who

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.020 
is a recombinant okay so now we know who
our<00:04:45.840> recombinants<00:04:46.530> are<00:04:46.680> what<00:04:47.610> we're<00:04:47.700> gonna<00:04:47.790> do

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
our recombinants are what we're gonna do

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.720 
our recombinants are what we're gonna do
is<00:04:48.660> we're<00:04:48.840> gonna<00:04:48.900> add<00:04:49.140> up<00:04:49.170> how<00:04:50.130> many<00:04:50.190> progeny

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
is we're gonna add up how many progeny

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.360 
is we're gonna add up how many progeny
do<00:04:50.940> we<00:04:51.030> have<00:04:51.500> for<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.560> recombinant<00:04:53.100> in<00:04:53.280> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
do we have for the recombinant in the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.590 
do we have for the recombinant in the
first<00:04:53.580> column<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:55.110> I'm<00:04:55.380> gonna<00:04:55.500> do<00:04:55.680> some<00:04:55.890> math

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
first column so I'm gonna do some math

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.030 
first column so I'm gonna do some math
without<00:04:57.600> my<00:04:57.870> trusty<00:04:58.169> calculator<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.890> you

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
without my trusty calculator that you

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.800 
without my trusty calculator that you
can't<00:04:59.370> see<00:04:59.610> YouTube<00:04:59.940> plus<00:05:00.330> 52<00:05:01.220> plus<00:05:02.220> 62<00:05:02.820> plus<00:05:03.330> 4

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
can't see YouTube plus 52 plus 62 plus 4

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:13.480 
can't see YouTube plus 52 plus 62 plus 4
is<00:05:04.710> me<00:05:04.890> 120<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:07.730> then<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:09.120> next<00:05:09.360> column<00:05:11.990> 21:52

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
is me 120 and then the next column 21:52

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.630 
is me 120 and then the next column 21:52
62<00:05:14.780> 23<00:05:15.780> this<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:16.650> 158<00:05:18.500> 58<00:05:19.500> and<00:05:20.130> then<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.460> last

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
62 23 this is 158 58 and then the last

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.750 
62 23 this is 158 58 and then the last
one<00:05:20.940> 21<00:05:22.280> -<00:05:23.840> 4<00:05:25.160> +<00:05:26.160> 23<00:05:26.570> that's<00:05:27.570> 50<00:05:28.370> all<00:05:29.370> right<00:05:29.520> so

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
one 21 - 4 + 23 that's 50 all right so

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.630 
one 21 - 4 + 23 that's 50 all right so
now<00:05:29.940> we<00:05:30.300> know<00:05:30.450> how<00:05:30.720> many<00:05:30.780> of<00:05:31.110> each<00:05:31.460> group<00:05:32.460> are

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
now we know how many of each group are

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.880 
now we know how many of each group are
recombinant<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:34.169> what<00:05:34.290> we<00:05:34.380> do<00:05:34.530> now<00:05:34.680> is

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
recombinant so what we do now is

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.830 
recombinant so what we do now is
determine<00:05:35.040> the<00:05:35.340> recombination<00:05:36.030> frequency<00:05:36.210> or

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
determine the recombination frequency or

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.469 
determine the recombination frequency or
how<00:05:37.050> often<00:05:37.710> do<00:05:38.370> we<00:05:38.460> see<00:05:38.610> those<00:05:38.790> recombinants

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
how often do we see those recombinants

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:40.909 
how often do we see those recombinants
in<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.660> progeny<00:05:39.990> so<00:05:40.260> I'm<00:05:40.350> actually<00:05:40.530> gonna<00:05:40.740> do

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
in the progeny so I'm actually gonna do

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.550 
in the progeny so I'm actually gonna do
the<00:05:41.100> math<00:05:41.250> right<00:05:41.460> here<00:05:41.610> on<00:05:41.700> Excel

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
the math right here on Excel

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:50.780 
the math right here on Excel
sorry<00:05:43.560> 120<00:05:44.550> into<00:05:44.669> 1,000<00:05:46.430> it's<00:05:47.430> 12%<00:05:49.460> 158<00:05:50.460> into

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
sorry 120 into 1,000 it's 12% 158 into

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.080 
sorry 120 into 1,000 it's 12% 158 into
1,000<00:05:51.740> because<00:05:52.740> 1,000<00:05:53.490> is<00:05:53.550> our<00:05:53.669> total<00:05:53.850> number

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
1,000 because 1,000 is our total number

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:01.490 
1,000 because 1,000 is our total number
of<00:05:54.300> offspring<00:05:54.419> and<00:05:54.840> then<00:05:56.479> 50<00:05:57.479> to<00:05:58.140> 1,000<00:05:59.570> 5%<00:06:00.570> all

right<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.680> I'm<00:06:01.740> gonna<00:06:01.830> scroll<00:06:02.100> down<00:06:02.310> over

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
right and I'm gonna scroll down over

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.200 
right and I'm gonna scroll down over
here<00:06:02.640> on<00:06:02.729> the<00:06:02.820> right<00:06:04.220> into<00:06:05.220> our<00:06:05.340> map<00:06:05.550> you<00:06:06.000> can

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
here on the right into our map you can

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.330 
here on the right into our map you can
see<00:06:06.240> that<00:06:06.510> I've<00:06:06.780> already<00:06:06.900> filled<00:06:07.260> this<00:06:07.380> in<00:06:07.590> but

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
see that I've already filled this in but

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.460 
see that I've already filled this in but
if<00:06:08.760> you<00:06:08.940> if<00:06:09.270> you<00:06:09.360> couldn't<00:06:09.540> see<00:06:09.690> that<00:06:09.810> what

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
if you if you couldn't see that what

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.900 
if you if you couldn't see that what
we're<00:06:10.620> gonna<00:06:10.680> look<00:06:10.979> at<00:06:11.160> over<00:06:11.400> here<00:06:11.430> these

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
we're gonna look at over here these

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.719 
we're gonna look at over here these
three<00:06:12.180> numbers<00:06:12.470> we<00:06:13.470> have<00:06:13.650> to<00:06:13.770> determine<00:06:14.400> the

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
three numbers we have to determine the

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.450 
three numbers we have to determine the
order<00:06:14.880> in<00:06:15.300> which<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.660> genes<00:06:15.870> appear<00:06:16.350> so<00:06:17.070> since

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
order in which the genes appear so since

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.360 
order in which the genes appear so since
this<00:06:17.729> 15.8%<00:06:18.660> this<00:06:19.080> is<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:19.350> biggest<00:06:19.590> gap

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
this 15.8% this is the biggest gap

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.180 
this 15.8% this is the biggest gap
between<00:06:20.790> m<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.210> p<00:06:21.720> is<00:06:22.200> telling<00:06:22.560> us<00:06:22.680> that<00:06:22.740> the<00:06:22.979> D

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
between m and p is telling us that the D

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.610 
between m and p is telling us that the D
locus<00:06:23.550> would<00:06:23.729> be<00:06:23.850> between<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.450> two<00:06:24.500> with<00:06:25.500> the

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
locus would be between the two with the

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.770 
locus would be between the two with the
D<00:06:25.860> being<00:06:26.729> closer<00:06:27.330> to<00:06:27.479> P<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:29.010> M<00:06:29.780> being

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
D being closer to P and the M being

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.719 
D being closer to P and the M being
closer<00:06:31.050> on<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.440> other<00:06:31.590> end<00:06:31.800> so<00:06:32.130> if<00:06:32.370> you<00:06:32.490> scroll

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
closer on the other end so if you scroll

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.159 
closer on the other end so if you scroll
down<00:06:32.789> over<00:06:32.940> here<00:06:33.240> you<00:06:33.300> can<00:06:33.539> see

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
down over here you can see

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.909 
down over here you can see
M<00:06:34.319> is<00:06:35.219> farthest<00:06:35.669> away<00:06:35.759> from<00:06:36.210> P<00:06:36.740> Steve<00:06:37.740> being

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
M is farthest away from P Steve being

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.730 
M is farthest away from P Steve being
between<00:06:38.310> and<00:06:38.550> then<00:06:39.360> of<00:06:39.479> course<00:06:39.719> if<00:06:40.199> you<00:06:40.319> add<00:06:40.469> 12

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
between and then of course if you add 12

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.679 
between and then of course if you add 12
and<00:06:40.889> 5<00:06:41.039> together<00:06:41.219> you<00:06:41.460> get<00:06:41.610> about<00:06:41.849> 17

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
and 5 together you get about 17

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:46.760 
and 5 together you get about 17
that's<00:06:42.840> not<00:06:42.990> 15.8%<00:06:43.740> exactly<00:06:44.610> but<00:06:45.210> as<00:06:45.779> you<00:06:46.529> have

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
that's not 15.8% exactly but as you have

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.830 
that's not 15.8% exactly but as you have
learned<00:06:46.979> the<00:06:47.370> map<00:06:47.580> units<00:06:47.909> are<00:06:48.060> not<00:06:48.300> precise

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
learned the map units are not precise

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.179 
learned the map units are not precise
and<00:06:49.080> measurements<00:06:49.469> but<00:06:49.590> they're<00:06:49.710> intended<00:06:50.159> to

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:50.189 
and measurements but they're intended to

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:52.820 
and measurements but they're intended to
be<00:06:50.310> there<00:06:50.669> to<00:06:51.330> give<00:06:51.659> you<00:06:51.810> a<00:06:51.840> general<00:06:52.349> idea<00:06:52.499> of

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
be there to give you a general idea of

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.610 
be there to give you a general idea of
how<00:06:53.009> far<00:06:53.310> apart<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:54.180> jeans<00:06:54.479> are<00:06:54.719> so<00:06:55.439> that's

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:55.620 
how far apart the jeans are so that's

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.089 
how far apart the jeans are so that's
how<00:06:55.770> we<00:06:55.830> do<00:06:56.009> the<00:06:56.039> math<00:06:56.430> behind<00:06:57.770> drawing<00:06:58.770> this

00:06:59.089 --> 00:06:59.099 
how we do the math behind drawing this

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.999 
how we do the math behind drawing this
map<00:06:59.779> and<00:07:00.779> then<00:07:01.110> I'm<00:07:01.319> gonna<00:07:01.469> scroll<00:07:01.710> down<00:07:01.770> so

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
map and then I'm gonna scroll down so

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.489 
map and then I'm gonna scroll down so
you<00:07:02.099> can<00:07:02.219> see<00:07:02.249> the<00:07:02.460> explanation<00:07:03.060> here<00:07:03.330> and<00:07:03.599> you

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:04.499 
you can see the explanation here and you

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.679 
you can see the explanation here and you
can<00:07:04.680> see<00:07:04.889> the<00:07:05.460> two<00:07:05.729> jeans<00:07:05.939> are<00:07:06.090> close<00:07:06.300> together

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:06.689 
can see the two jeans are close together

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:09.200 
can see the two jeans are close together
on<00:07:06.960> the<00:07:07.050> chromosome<00:07:07.849> crossing<00:07:08.849> over<00:07:08.969> between

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
on the chromosome crossing over between

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.820 
on the chromosome crossing over between
those<00:07:09.569> two<00:07:09.749> jeans<00:07:09.990> would<00:07:10.110> be<00:07:10.259> rare<00:07:10.499> so<00:07:10.740> we

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
those two jeans would be rare so we

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:13.670 
those two jeans would be rare so we
would<00:07:10.949> find<00:07:11.219> them<00:07:11.689> together<00:07:12.689> in<00:07:13.229> an<00:07:13.319> organism

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
would find them together in an organism

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.320 
would find them together in an organism
more<00:07:14.099> frequently<00:07:14.580> than<00:07:14.939> if<00:07:15.120> they<00:07:15.270> were

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
more frequently than if they were

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.499 
more frequently than if they were
farther<00:07:16.229> apart<00:07:16.520> also<00:07:17.520> something<00:07:17.819> to<00:07:17.969> note<00:07:18.120> is

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
farther apart also something to note is

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.959 
farther apart also something to note is
that<00:07:18.539> if<00:07:18.810> the<00:07:19.129> if<00:07:20.129> the<00:07:20.279> two<00:07:20.430> jeans<00:07:20.669> are<00:07:20.789> very

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
that if the if the two jeans are very

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.269 
that if the if the two jeans are very
close<00:07:21.240> to<00:07:21.389> the<00:07:21.509> center<00:07:21.870> here<00:07:22.229> it's<00:07:22.830> likely

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:23.279 
close to the center here it's likely

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:24.469 
close to the center here it's likely
that<00:07:23.310> they<00:07:23.490> won't<00:07:23.699> cross<00:07:23.849> over<00:07:24.180> at<00:07:24.300> all

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
that they won't cross over at all

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.260 
that they won't cross over at all
because<00:07:24.839> the<00:07:25.229> centromere<00:07:25.740> is<00:07:25.919> very

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 
because the centromere is very

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.179 
because the centromere is very
controlled<00:07:27.270> and<00:07:27.509> and<00:07:28.349> everything<00:07:29.129> that's

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:29.189 
controlled and and everything that's

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.820 
controlled and and everything that's
close<00:07:29.460> to<00:07:29.490> the<00:07:29.699> middle<00:07:30.139> usually<00:07:31.139> sticks<00:07:31.439> right

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:31.830 
close to the middle usually sticks right

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.379 
close to the middle usually sticks right
there<00:07:32.039> and<00:07:32.159> doesn't<00:07:32.279> go<00:07:32.430> anywhere<00:07:32.669> else<00:07:32.729> so<00:07:32.999> I

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
there and doesn't go anywhere else so I

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.779 
there and doesn't go anywhere else so I
hope<00:07:33.629> that<00:07:33.779> helps<00:07:34.080> explain<00:07:34.259> to<00:07:34.830> you<00:07:35.039> how<00:07:35.339> to<00:07:35.370> do

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:35.789 
hope that helps explain to you how to do

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:37.670 
hope that helps explain to you how to do
this<00:07:35.939> linkage<00:07:36.270> map<00:07:36.479> we'll<00:07:37.139> be<00:07:37.289> doing<00:07:37.499> some
