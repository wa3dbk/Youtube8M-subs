two<00:01:36.810> thousand<00:01:37.290> points<00:01:37.470> rise<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
two thousand points rise out of the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.429 
two thousand points rise out of the
object<00:01:40.350> at<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> end<00:01:41.479> so<00:01:42.479> that's<00:01:42.930> nice<00:01:43.170> little

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
actually push right on the analog stick

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually push right on the analog stick
and<00:01:57.960> keep<00:01:58.350> your<00:01:58.469> finger<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.740> triangle<00:01:59.579> for<00:02:00.509> ten
