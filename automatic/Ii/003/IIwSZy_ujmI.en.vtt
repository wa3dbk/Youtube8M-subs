00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.920
 but should be during the application interview 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.649

 I have considered really long as 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.420
 I really really really long 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.549
 thinking about the right outfit for 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.619
 our wood star star and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.780
 to find spectators why do you have 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.210
 then long considered and because in my 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.640
 It's the industry that you can do 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.259
 artists who's only change anyway 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.840

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.439
 also wear as you please and 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.700
 that's why you can shut up 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.979
 Appraisal interview actually too 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.540
 pretty casual because of the quasi 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.729
 about the style also has to express that 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.790
 you are creative and today I am 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.590
 but for a person between things 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.619
 So let's start with the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.170
 shoes and they are not shared 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.420
 Pointed sexy high heels with little heels 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.369
 but simply cozy comfortable way 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 is really super important that you out 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.759
 his shoe can run and not then 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.619

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.600

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.270
 not too intrusive nothing is text 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.030

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.709
 a detail exactly so I have one 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.080
 I think a bit but you can see 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.620
 nothing or mehsud should it please 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.440
 intoxicate 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.569
 I would just say you can just 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.560
 no breasts see what are you wearing 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.379
 like from head to toe so I wear 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.950
 shoes by kurt geiger 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:35.360
 I've shot in karstadt cell 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.750
 yes these are just leather shoes with 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:43.200
 offer high block sales so no 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.299
 lace shoes round went into plus and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.099
 lace of the bundesspitze round top 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:53.940
 just then I wear a very simple one 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:58.049
 Levi's jeans a white blouse which it from 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:03.360
 primark from 100 years ago and one 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.340
 blazer in cream white logos or something like that 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.340
 for the interview what absolutely 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.590
 is not your opinion chewing gum 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.690
 chewing as I am doing right now 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.889
 does not work for it I just wanted 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.569
 let's show how not to hold it 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:23.579
 yes to colorful shrill outfits what 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.920
 also are not nibbled or 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.840
 or not properly maintained 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.139
 Fingernails are also so mega 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.970
 fingernails very weak or so pink 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:36.630
 with rhinestones on it 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.060
 in any case, so to speak 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 or so you know i have for example 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.780
 also waives the lipstick if 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.329
 I like to wear red fabric but 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.410
 I thought so well and if you have 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.180
 not lipstick right now 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.730
 you do not have a lipstick 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.040
 But why now it has no red 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.980
 or just because it fits I think 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.510
 pretty pushy 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.190
 that's definitely the case with some companies 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.190
 good at or even with men because 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.610
 but determined 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.950
 I am now for a tone 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.150
 decided because he is more discreet 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.650
 Nude skin color exactly because I 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.010
 never knew how to pronounce the thought 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.380
 you 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.419
 tropez or dove with the coupe in bed 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:27.160

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:31.000
 her casual traveling or so dead dead 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:36.060
 dead dead dead dead dead ok all right 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.169
 fahrrad.de looser dutt so always everyone 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.240
 open hair I think it seems 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.740
 difficult again so he fumbles 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.150
 you always best still somehow 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.669
 in the hair all the newspapers or 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.760
 close or close a bit 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.470
 which to which application interview 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.560

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.350
 So this kind of clothes go which job 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.260
 so i do something creative and 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.120
 That's why I might even still 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.350
 a chain or something 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.419
 combine the whole thing a bit 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.220
 to spice up but generally I would 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.350
 say that what I wear now too 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.450
 so for office jobs or something suitable 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.330
 that is just very bad and wild 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.690
 not so noticeable and where are you going with it 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.200
 down 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.460
 So I would like that too 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.220
 bewerbung conversation as occupational therapist 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.729
 what I 'm wearing now 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:28.060
 exactly and yes it would 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.560
 probably also get dressed with 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.450
 another pants then 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.360
 probably suit lastiger looks 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:37.060
 So no denim I would that too 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.229
 wear to office senior talk 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.669
 are there any other tips you can 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.680
 have something for a recruitment interview 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.479
 not the fashion but this 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.139
 conversation itself or the preparations 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.630
 for this 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:49.300
 You definitely have to go over that 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.430

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.440

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.729
 deal with it and with what 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.889
 in which job is required even then 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.139
 You also have to know that and that 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.849
 so you have to the favorite question 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.009

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.740
