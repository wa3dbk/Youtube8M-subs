00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
imperfections around the car just be

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.259 
imperfections around the car just be
aware<00:00:53.829> it's<00:00:54.070> not<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.280> hundred<00:00:54.550> point<00:00:54.910> showed

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
aware it's not a hundred point showed

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.110 
aware it's not a hundred point showed
paint<00:00:55.840> job<00:00:56.170> but<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:57.670> something<00:00:57.940> on<00:00:58.000> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120

paint job but there's something on the
paint<00:00:58.300> there<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.510> think<00:00:58.809> we'll<00:00:58.930> be<00:00:59.050> able<00:00:59.109> to<00:00:59.230> get

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
paint there I think we'll be able to get

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
paint there I think we'll be able to get
that<00:00:59.530> off<00:00:59.739> it's<00:00:59.980> like<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.100> little<00:01:00.280> stain<00:01:00.670> a

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
that off it's like a little stain a

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.929 
that off it's like a little stain a
little<00:01:02.710> touch-up<00:01:02.920> here<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.430> can<00:01:06.580> see<00:01:06.759> there's

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
little touch-up here you can see there's

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.780 
little touch-up here you can see there's
a<00:01:07.000> little<00:01:07.320> touch-up<00:01:08.320> there<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.040> that<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.610> think

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
a little touch-up there and that I think

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.880 
a little touch-up there and that I think
will<00:01:10.030> rub<00:01:10.240> out<00:01:10.450> right<00:01:10.840> here<00:01:11.049> but<00:01:11.530> that's<00:01:11.680> a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
will rub out right here but that's a

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.490 
will rub out right here but that's a
little<00:01:11.979> touch-up<00:01:15.960> another<00:01:16.960> little<00:01:17.229> stress
