think<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.220> signature<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.030> off

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
think this is the signature of this off

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.120 
think this is the signature of this off

Oceanic during the summer vintage and we

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.020 
Oceanic during the summer vintage and we
had<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.600> work<00:02:42.810> very<00:02:43.110> hard<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.040> vineyard<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
had to work very hard in the vineyard to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.610 
had to work very hard in the vineyard to
remove<00:02:46.160> all<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.489> risk<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:49.050> water<00:02:49.260> which

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
remove all the risk of the water which

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.040 
remove all the risk of the water which
is<00:02:49.830> dilution<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.670> decrease<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.540> yields<00:02:51.870> we

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
is dilution so decrease the yields we

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.970 
is dilution so decrease the yields we
did<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> lot<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:53.060> green<00:02:54.060> harvesting<00:02:54.980> decreasing

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
did a lot of green harvesting decreasing

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.180 
did a lot of green harvesting decreasing
the<00:02:56.100> yields<00:02:56.370> by<00:02:56.489> 30<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.060> 40<00:02:57.540> percent<00:02:57.980> in<00:02:58.980> some

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the yields by 30 to 40 percent in some

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.990 
the yields by 30 to 40 percent in some
