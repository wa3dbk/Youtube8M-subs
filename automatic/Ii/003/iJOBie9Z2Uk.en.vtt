00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
gear shift usually you get parking

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.670 
gear shift usually you get parking
reverse<00:00:41.550> neutral<00:00:41.910> Drive<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.720> so<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:42.989> here<00:00:43.410> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
reverse neutral Drive and so on here you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.540 
reverse neutral Drive and so on here you
get<00:00:43.830> reverse<00:00:44.640> neutral<00:00:45.050> automatic<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.230> manual

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
get reverse neutral automatic and manual

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
get reverse neutral automatic and manual
now<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.090> park<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> car<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.110> neutral

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
now you have to park the car in neutral

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.560 
now you have to park the car in neutral
which<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.239> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.300> weird<00:00:51.559> then<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> electric

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
which is kind of weird then the electric

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.259 
which is kind of weird then the electric
parking<00:00:54.570> brake<00:00:54.720> does<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.280> stopping<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:57.030> for

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
parking brake does the stopping bit for

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.650 
parking brake does the stopping bit for
you<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:58.680> start<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> car<00:00:59.610> you<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.420> in

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you to start the car you have to be in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
you to start the car you have to be in
neutral<00:01:02.390> press<00:01:03.390> start<00:01:05.630> then<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.899> can<00:01:07.290> switch

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
neutral press start then you can switch

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.520 
neutral press start then you can switch
into<00:01:07.860> automatic<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:09.240> usually<00:01:09.899> you<00:01:10.080> end<00:01:10.110> up

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
into automatic but usually you end up

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.550 
into automatic but usually you end up
switching<00:01:11.119> into<00:01:12.119> manual<00:01:12.630> which<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.259> quite

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
switching into manual which is quite

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.460 
switching into manual which is quite
annoying<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> have<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.660> back<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
annoying so you have to go back to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
annoying so you have to go back to
automatic<00:01:18.200> in<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.320> normal<00:01:19.710> hybrid<00:01:20.340> car<00:01:20.780> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
automatic in a normal hybrid car you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.029 
automatic in a normal hybrid car you
would<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> electric<00:01:24.060> motor<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
would get the electric motor and the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.680 
would get the electric motor and the
combustion<00:01:26.039> engine<00:01:26.490> working<00:01:27.210> somewhere<00:01:27.570> in

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
four-wheel drive which I shall use now

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.590 
four-wheel drive which I shall use now
because<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.549> are<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> kind<00:02:21.329> of<00:02:21.450> rough

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
because we are in a kind of rough

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.650 
because we are in a kind of rough
terrain

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:36.810 

I<00:02:32.310> suppose<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.900> normal<00:02:34.900> Peschel<00:02:35.410> owner<00:02:35.890> will

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
I suppose the normal Peschel owner will

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.580 
I suppose the normal Peschel owner will
never<00:02:37.650> go<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.950> far<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.250> mean<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.780> not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
never go this far I mean this is not

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.120 
never go this far I mean this is not

winter when it's you know snow slush
rain<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.220> suppose<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.410> might<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.650> nice<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.890> have

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
rain I suppose it might be nice to have

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.070 
rain I suppose it might be nice to have
this<00:02:51.370> kind<00:02:51.580> of<00:02:51.610> feeling<00:02:52.150> of<00:02:52.420> security<00:02:52.720> that

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
this kind of feeling of security that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:00.220 
this kind of feeling of security that
you<00:02:53.290> will<00:02:53.950> actually<00:02:54.220> be<00:02:54.730> okay

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.530 

I've<00:03:01.230> driven<00:03:02.220> here<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.930> peso<00:03:04.580> 3008<00:03:05.610> that's

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
I've driven here with a peso 3008 that's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.460 
I've driven here with a peso 3008 that's
the<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:07.490> that's<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.670> crossover<00:03:09.330> with<00:03:10.050> so

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the one that's the crossover with so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.320 
the one that's the crossover with so
called<00:03:10.650> grip<00:03:10.980> control<00:03:11.370> that's<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:12.150> an

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
called grip control that's like an

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.950 
called grip control that's like an
electronic<00:03:12.870> system<00:03:13.080> that<00:03:13.460> works<00:03:14.460> the<00:03:14.960> front

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
electronic system that works the front

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.200 
electronic system that works the front
axle<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.860> make<00:03:17.250> sure<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.910> get<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
axle and it's make sure you get the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.910 
axle and it's make sure you get the
right<00:03:18.240> traction<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.880> idea<00:03:21.210> is<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.920> you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
right traction the idea is that you

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.200 
right traction the idea is that you
don't<00:03:23.100> really<00:03:23.250> need<00:03:23.490> four-wheel<00:03:24.000> drive

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
don't really need four-wheel drive

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.660 
don't really need four-wheel drive
because<00:03:24.450> electronics<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.500> sort<00:03:25.860> out<00:03:26.040> many

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
because electronics can sort out many

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.080 
because electronics can sort out many
things<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.130> however<00:03:29.130> with<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> grip

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
is no passenger at the moment and then
