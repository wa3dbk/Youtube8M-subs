just<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.470> lot<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:09.709> fun<00:02:09.829> to<00:02:09.950> watch<00:02:10.070> it<00:02:10.310> go<00:02:10.399> around

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
just a lot of fun to watch it go around

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.449 
just a lot of fun to watch it go around
and<00:02:10.970> I<00:02:11.540> think<00:02:11.810> adding<00:02:12.769> in<00:02:12.859> those<00:02:13.040> lights<00:02:13.250> will

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
and I think adding in those lights will

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.770 
and I think adding in those lights will
give<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.970> ferris<00:02:14.239> wheel<00:02:14.269> of<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.540> movement

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
give the ferris wheel of that movement

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.349 
give the ferris wheel of that movement
the<00:02:15.230> process<00:02:15.650> is<00:02:15.799> very<00:02:16.030> collaborative<00:02:17.030> from

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
the process is very collaborative from

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.319 
the process is very collaborative from
the<00:02:17.510> moment<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:19.190> artist<00:02:19.579> in<00:02:19.940> this<00:02:20.090> case

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
the moment that the artist in this case

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.360 
the moment that the artist in this case
Adam<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:21.019> sort<00:02:21.410> of<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.650> sketch<00:02:22.040> phase

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
Adam is sort of in that sketch phase

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.789 
Adam is sort of in that sketch phase
we're<00:02:23.090> talking<00:02:23.630> talking<00:02:24.170> about<00:02:24.500> what<00:02:24.680> that

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
we're talking talking about what that

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.530 
we're talking talking about what that
sketch<00:02:25.130> might<00:02:25.400> look<00:02:25.579> like<00:02:25.640> what<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.180> colors

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
sketch might look like what the colors

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.660 
sketch might look like what the colors
might<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.320> then<00:02:27.769> we<00:02:28.220> sort<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.519> let<00:02:28.640> the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
might be and then we sort of let the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.729 
might be and then we sort of let the
artist<00:02:29.030> go<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.209> work<00:02:29.450> for<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.720> while<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.200> then

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
artist go to work for a while and then

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.590 
artist go to work for a while and then
determine<00:02:31.280> kind<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.850> what<00:02:31.970> direction<00:02:32.209> we<00:02:32.480> want

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
determine kind of what direction we want

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.539 
determine kind of what direction we want
to<00:02:32.750> take<00:02:32.900> from<00:02:33.109> there<00:02:33.380> what<00:02:33.799> I'm<00:02:33.890> proposing<00:02:34.070> is

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
to take from there what I'm proposing is

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.720 
to take from there what I'm proposing is
doing<00:02:35.350> using<00:02:36.350> my<00:02:36.500> medium<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.069> screen<00:02:37.340> printed

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
doing using my medium as screen printed

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.080 
doing using my medium as screen printed
prints<00:02:38.510> as<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.680> final<00:02:40.069> product<00:02:40.489> that<00:02:40.970> people

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
prints as the final product that people

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.479 
prints as the final product that people
could<00:02:41.390> buy<00:02:41.680> fabulous<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:42.829> think<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.160> would<00:02:43.370> be

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
could buy fabulous I think that would be

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.800 
could buy fabulous I think that would be
wonderful<00:02:43.700> because<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.269> think<00:02:44.420> that's<00:02:44.690> what

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
wonderful because I think that's what

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.319 
wonderful because I think that's what
people<00:02:44.840> expect<00:02:45.650> from<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.489> is<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> screen

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:47.329 
people expect from you is it is a screen

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.759 
people expect from you is it is a screen
when<00:02:47.630> they're<00:02:47.780> buying<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.260> piece<00:02:48.470> they're

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
when they're buying a piece they're

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.189 
when they're buying a piece they're
buying<00:02:48.949> a<00:02:49.100> screen<00:02:49.370> print<00:02:49.669> from<00:02:50.419> you<00:02:50.660> I<00:02:50.870> think

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:51.199 
buying a screen print from you I think

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.080 
buying a screen print from you I think
this<00:02:51.320> is<00:02:51.410> great<00:02:51.530> but<00:02:52.340> afterwards

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
this is great but afterwards

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.640 
this is great but afterwards
through<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.330> initial<00:02:53.540> sketch<00:02:54.019> phase<00:02:54.319> and

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
through that initial sketch phase and

concept asst is really on their own to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.500 
concept asst is really on their own to
create<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.099> piece<00:03:01.310> once<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.879> sketch<00:03:02.239> is

the<00:04:16.530> process<00:04:17.009> i<00:04:17.220> call<00:04:17.430> it<00:04:17.579> is<00:04:17.790> analog<00:04:18.329> digital

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
the process i call it is analog digital

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.530 
the process i call it is analog digital
analog<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.519> everything<00:04:20.519> is<00:04:20.790> really<00:04:20.970> started

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
analog and everything is really started

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.810

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
created by hand it's brought it in the

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.890 
created by hand it's brought it in the
computer<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:27.090> separated<00:04:27.660> through<00:04:27.810> the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
computer it's separated through the

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
take it to be Madden and frame I really

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.040 
take it to be Madden and frame I really
like<00:05:54.610> the<00:05:54.790> madding<00:05:55.120> to<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.420> some<00:05:55.660> sort<00:05:55.840> of<00:05:55.930> an

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
like the madding to have some sort of an

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.290 
like the madding to have some sort of an
accent<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:57.160> color<00:05:57.370> that's<00:05:57.640> actually<00:05:58.120> in

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
accent of the color that's actually in

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.000 
accent of the color that's actually in
the<00:05:58.540> print<00:05:58.780> you<00:05:58.960> have<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.200> background<00:05:59.410> gray

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010

the print you have that background gray
that's<00:06:00.340> there<00:06:00.580> I<00:06:00.610> think<00:06:00.880> that<00:06:01.060> would<00:06:01.240> be<00:06:01.420> a

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
that's there I think that would be a

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.020 
that's there I think that would be a
nice<00:06:01.660> neutral<00:06:02.560> kind<00:06:02.800> of<00:06:03.070> accent<00:06:03.640> on<00:06:03.760> the<00:06:03.910> edge

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
nice neutral kind of accent on the edge

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.780 
nice neutral kind of accent on the edge

beginning back in 2004 it's something
like<00:06:10.510> this<00:06:11.610> that's<00:06:12.610> kind<00:06:12.820> of<00:06:12.880> nice<00:06:13.030> yeah<00:06:13.540> I

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
like that let's take a look at some

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.190 
like that let's take a look at some
frames<00:06:15.760> long<00:06:16.330> that<00:06:16.540> would<00:06:16.630> coordinate<00:06:17.020> with

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
frames long that would coordinate with

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.600 
frames long that would coordinate with
those<00:06:17.350> Gray's<00:06:17.710> would<00:06:18.220> be<00:06:18.400> nice<00:06:20.040> so<00:06:21.040> here's<00:06:21.370> a

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
those Gray's would be nice so here's a

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.900 
those Gray's would be nice so here's a
silver<00:06:22.300> with<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.600> great<00:06:23.020> kind<00:06:23.440> of<00:06:23.790> striation<00:06:24.790> in

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.210 
silver with a great kind of striation in
it<00:06:25.030> but<00:06:25.630> I<00:06:25.720> really<00:06:26.020> think<00:06:26.050> that<00:06:26.320> sets<00:06:26.980> off<00:06:27.160> the

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 
it but I really think that sets off the

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.310 
it but I really think that sets off the
art<00:06:27.580> I<00:06:27.850> love<00:06:28.150> it<00:06:28.330> I<00:06:28.450> think<00:06:28.780> we're<00:06:28.870> good<00:06:28.990> to<00:06:29.080> go<00:06:29.110> I

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
art I love it I think we're good to go I

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:40.470
