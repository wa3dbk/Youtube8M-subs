New<00:00:10.690> York<00:00:11.020> has<00:00:12.030> been<00:00:13.030> dominated<00:00:13.780> by<00:00:14.170> a<00:00:14.440> one

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
New York has been dominated by a one

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.060 
New York has been dominated by a one
dimensional<00:00:14.830> approach<00:00:15.779> to<00:00:16.779> its<00:00:16.930> streets<00:00:17.230> it's

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
dimensional approach to its streets it's

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.939 
dimensional approach to its streets it's
all<00:00:18.279> about<00:00:18.480> moving<00:00:19.480> cars<00:00:19.779> faster<00:00:20.380> through<00:00:20.920> a

all about moving cars faster through a

all about moving cars faster through a
given<00:00:21.250> place

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.349 

the<00:00:25.929> real<00:00:26.169> danger<00:00:26.410> is<00:00:26.740> its<00:00:27.160> anti<00:00:27.910> social

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
the real danger is its anti social

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.900 
the real danger is its anti social
qualities<00:00:28.599> its<00:00:29.410> environmental<00:00:30.070> qualities

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
qualities its environmental qualities

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.819 
qualities its environmental qualities
and<00:00:31.179> the<00:00:31.839> fact<00:00:32.110> that<00:00:32.199> we're<00:00:32.410> getting<00:00:32.500> ever

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
and the fact that we're getting ever

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.030 
and the fact that we're getting ever
more<00:00:32.920> than<00:00:33.280> we<00:00:33.760> now<00:00:33.940> have<00:00:34.680> 230<00:00:35.680> million

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
more than we now have 230 million

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.479 
more than we now have 230 million
automobiles<00:00:36.969> I<00:00:37.840> mean<00:00:38.050> that's<00:00:38.379> probably<00:00:39.070> one

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
automobiles I mean that's probably one

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.689 
automobiles I mean that's probably one
for<00:00:39.699> every<00:00:39.969> man<00:00:40.600> woman<00:00:40.629> and<00:00:41.230> pet<00:00:41.500> it<00:00:41.860> shouldn't

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
for every man woman and pet it shouldn't

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:45.720 
for every man woman and pet it shouldn't
be<00:00:42.790> considered<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.540> privilege<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:44.339> walk<00:00:45.339> or

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
be considered a privilege to walk or

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.850 
be considered a privilege to walk or
bicycle<00:00:45.970> in<00:00:46.480> your<00:00:46.600> own<00:00:46.690> neighborhood<00:00:46.899> and<00:00:47.379> not

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
bicycle in your own neighborhood and not

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.560 
bicycle in your own neighborhood and not
get<00:00:48.100> hit<00:00:48.220> by<00:00:48.399> a<00:00:48.430> truck<00:00:48.729> that<00:00:49.180> should<00:00:49.420> be<00:00:49.540> a

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
get hit by a truck that should be a

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.479 
get hit by a truck that should be a
basic<00:00:49.839> right<00:00:50.440> so<00:00:51.040> it's<00:00:51.220> going<00:00:51.339> to<00:00:51.430> be

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
basic right so it's going to be

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.729 
basic right so it's going to be
increasingly<00:00:51.970> difficult<00:00:52.510> for<00:00:52.989> New<00:00:53.260> York<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
increasingly difficult for New York to

increasingly difficult for New York to

we're not able to solve the congestion

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the point something that in fact

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.139 
the point something that in fact
enhances<00:01:08.500> complexity<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.490> enhances

enhances complexity that enhances

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.830 
enhances complexity that enhances
flexibility<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.200> frees<00:01:11.619> us<00:01:11.890> from<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:13.420> from

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
flexibility that frees us from from from

stasis<00:01:14.229> cuz<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> automobile<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:16.090> know<00:01:16.240> it

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
stasis cuz the automobile you know it

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.370 
stasis cuz the automobile you know it
just<00:01:16.509> doesn't<00:01:17.020> work

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 

we<00:01:22.950> introduced<00:01:23.430> something<00:01:23.969> called

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
we introduced something called

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.450 
we introduced something called
congestion<00:01:24.600> charging<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> London<00:01:26.100> which

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
congestion charging here in London which

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.209 
congestion charging here in London which
was<00:01:26.700> designed<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.420> reduce<00:01:28.110> traffic<00:01:28.799> flows

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
was designed to reduce traffic flows

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:32.149 
was designed to reduce traffic flows
into<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> center<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.780> city<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.259> well<00:01:31.950> as

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
into the center of the city as well as

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.859 
into the center of the city as well as
to<00:01:32.369> reduce<00:01:32.520> congestion<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.509> terms<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
to reduce congestion in terms of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
to reduce congestion in terms of
congestion<00:01:34.229> charging<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.100> think<00:01:35.429> what<00:01:35.759> that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
congestion charging I think what that

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.600 
congestion charging I think what that
has<00:01:36.119> done<00:01:36.149> is<00:01:36.479> given<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.899> strong<00:01:37.110> message<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
has done is given a strong message to

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.870 
has done is given a strong message to
cities<00:01:38.610> across<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.030> Western<00:01:39.570> world<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
cities across the Western world but the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.960 
cities across the Western world but the
road<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> scarce<00:01:42.929> good<00:01:43.319> and<00:01:43.819> therefore<00:01:44.819> we

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
road is a scarce good and therefore we

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.300 
road is a scarce good and therefore we
have<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.179> have<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:46.259> way<00:01:46.289> of<00:01:46.740> making<00:01:47.280> people

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
have to have some way of making people

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.639 
have to have some way of making people
feel<00:01:47.819> differently<00:01:48.390> about<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.049> way<00:01:49.170> they<00:01:49.380> use

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
feel differently about the way they use

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.399 
feel differently about the way they use
it<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.939> four<00:01:51.509> years<00:01:51.539> plus<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.289> I've

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it just in the four years plus that I've

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.919 
it just in the four years plus that I've
been<00:01:52.619> here<00:01:52.860> we've<00:01:53.310> achieved<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:54.000> major<00:01:54.360> change

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
been here we've achieved a major change

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:57.710 
been here we've achieved a major change
and<00:01:55.319> that<00:01:55.590> public<00:01:56.099> transport<00:01:56.670> use<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.179> now<00:01:57.390> up

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
and that public transport use is now up

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.719 
and that public transport use is now up

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
use is down four percent and now we can

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.309 
use is down four percent and now we can
