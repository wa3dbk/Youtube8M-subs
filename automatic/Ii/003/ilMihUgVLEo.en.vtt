love<00:03:06.560> them<00:03:06.709> they<00:03:07.250> could<00:03:07.459> be<00:03:07.580> beefed<00:03:07.760> up<00:03:07.940> a

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
love them they could be beefed up a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.340 
love them they could be beefed up a
little<00:03:08.300> bit<00:03:08.480> maybe<00:03:08.660> spice<00:03:08.959> them<00:03:09.110> up<00:03:09.140> a<00:03:09.260> little

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
little bit maybe spice them up a little

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.800 
little bit maybe spice them up a little
bit<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:10.670> that<00:03:10.820> assault<00:03:11.120> chopper<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.510> called

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
bit like that assault chopper I called

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.300 
bit like that assault chopper I called
in<00:03:11.959> that<00:03:12.110> they<00:03:12.290> need<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.650> buff<00:03:12.830> slightly

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
in that they need to be buff slightly

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.850 
in that they need to be buff slightly
but<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.880> think<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.780> games<00:03:14.989> got<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> nice<00:03:15.440> streak

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
but I think this games got a nice streak

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.729 
but I think this games got a nice streak

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.949 
2 is probably my least favorite Treyarch
game<00:04:16.790> but<00:04:16.940> it's<00:04:17.030> still<00:04:17.150> playable<00:04:17.540> man<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.750> can

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
game but it's still playable man I can

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.449 
game but it's still playable man I can
still<00:04:18.109> play<00:04:18.229> it<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.739> have<00:04:18.919> fun<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.310> have<00:04:19.400> a

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
still play it and have fun and have a

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.479 
still play it and have fun and have a
good<00:04:19.489> time<00:04:19.789> and<00:04:20.000> it's<00:04:20.120> action

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
good time and it's action

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.480 
good time and it's action
back<00:04:20.849> so<00:04:21.329> right<00:04:22.289> now<00:04:22.440> Treyarch<00:04:22.979> is<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.280> only

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
back so right now Treyarch is the only

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.189 
back so right now Treyarch is the only
