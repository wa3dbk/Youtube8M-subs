00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
okay so in this first chapter we're

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.609 
okay so in this first chapter we're
going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.390> looking<00:00:24.449> at<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> introduction

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
going to be looking at the introduction

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.710 
going to be looking at the introduction
so<00:00:26.220> again<00:00:26.400> we're<00:00:26.550> looking<00:00:26.789> at<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.090> piece<00:00:27.420> in

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
so again we're looking at this piece in

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
so again we're looking at this piece in
terms<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.140> all<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> different<00:00:28.619> parts<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
terms of all the different parts all the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.490 
terms of all the different parts all the
different<00:00:29.699> sections<00:00:30.019> sort<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.109> thinking<00:00:31.349> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
different sections sort of thinking it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
different sections sort of thinking it
as<00:00:31.619> thinking<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> as<00:00:32.579> like<00:00:32.790> component

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
as thinking of it as like component

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
as thinking of it as like component
parts<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.899> once<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.800> learn<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> these

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
parts and once we learn all of these

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.000 
parts and once we learn all of these
individual<00:00:35.940> sections<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.739> put<00:00:37.890> them

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
individual sections we can put them

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.030 
individual sections we can put them
together<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.610> we'll<00:00:39.180> have<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> form<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.530> we

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
together and we'll have a form that we

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.790 
together and we'll have a form that we
can<00:00:41.160> use<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.730> play<00:00:42.059> along<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> recording

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
can use to play along with the recording

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.190 
can use to play along with the recording
and<00:00:43.950> everything<00:00:44.760> should<00:00:45.030> sit<00:00:45.270> perfectly<00:00:46.079> with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
and everything should sit perfectly with

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.770 
and everything should sit perfectly with
the<00:00:46.260> recording<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.640> looking<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.090> intro<00:00:48.539> I

sessions<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> key<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> e-flat<00:01:10.860> minor

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
sessions so in the key of e-flat minor

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600 
sessions so in the key of e-flat minor
here<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.540> pretty<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:13.250> all<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> these

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
here so pretty much using all of these

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.630 
here so pretty much using all of these
black<00:01:14.909> notes<00:01:15.710> out<00:01:16.710> front<00:01:17.130> here<00:01:17.340> we're<00:01:17.520> just

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
black notes out front here we're just

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.010 
black notes out front here we're just
kind<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> starting<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.150> e<00:01:18.360> flat<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> B<00:01:18.990> flat

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
kind of starting on e flat and B flat

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.070 
kind of starting on e flat and B flat
okay<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> sound<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.570> those<00:01:21.720> those

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
okay so it's this sound of those those

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.569 
okay so it's this sound of those those
fifths<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.740> we're<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:22.950> hearing<00:01:28.579> all

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
fifths that we're really hearing all

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.399 
fifths that we're really hearing all
right<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:29.850> we're<00:01:29.970> doing<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.299> flat<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.689> B<00:01:30.840> flat

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
right so we're doing a flat and B flat

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.020 
right so we're doing a flat and B flat
and<00:01:32.530> going<00:01:33.100> back<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.250> forth<00:01:33.460> between<00:01:33.700> that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
and going back and forth between that

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.210 
and going back and forth between that
and<00:01:34.180> this<00:01:34.420> G<00:01:34.720> flat<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.229> D<00:01:35.380> flat<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.920> fifth

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
and this G flat and D flat so a fifth

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.149 
and this G flat and D flat so a fifth
year<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.700> fifth<00:01:36.939> year<00:01:37.030> here<00:01:40.680> walks<00:01:41.680> down<00:01:41.950> to

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
year and a fifth year here walks down to

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.520 
year and a fifth year here walks down to
the<00:01:42.250> F<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.909> C<00:01:43.150> okay<00:01:44.020> so<00:01:44.049> that's<00:01:44.350> sort<00:01:44.440> of

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
the F and the C okay so that's sort of

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:53.310 
the F and the C okay so that's sort of
our<00:01:44.619> key<00:01:44.830> signature<00:01:50.460> sort<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:52.049> B<00:01:53.049> flat

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
our key signature sort of like a B flat

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.219 
our key signature sort of like a B flat
Dorian<00:01:53.770> right<00:01:54.190> because<00:01:54.580> for<00:01:55.149> anybody<00:01:55.420> who's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
Dorian right because for anybody who's

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.499 
Dorian right because for anybody who's
watching<00:01:56.500> understands<00:01:57.100> those<00:01:57.340> modes<00:01:57.670> really

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
watching understands those modes really

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.359 
watching understands those modes really
thinking<00:01:58.780> about<00:01:58.960> sort<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.440> a<00:01:59.530> D<00:01:59.770> flat<00:02:00.070> major

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
thinking about sort of a D flat major

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.559 
thinking about sort of a D flat major
scale<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.740> begins<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.190> ends<00:02:03.340> on<00:02:03.640> E<00:02:04.030> flat<00:02:04.149> so

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
scale that begins and ends on E flat so

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.690 
scale that begins and ends on E flat so
a<00:02:04.600> flat<00:02:04.960> minor<00:02:05.200> E<00:02:05.560> flat<00:02:05.590> Dorian<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.460> be<00:02:06.520> more

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
a flat minor E flat Dorian to be more

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.059 
a flat minor E flat Dorian to be more
precise<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.690> this<00:02:07.840> is<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.080> groove<00:02:08.440> up<00:02:08.800> front

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
precise so this is the groove up front

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:22.650 
precise so this is the groove up front
here<00:02:20.550> okay<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.730> does<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.090> three<00:02:22.450> times

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
here okay so it does that three times

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.720 
here okay so it does that three times
basically<00:02:23.019> here's<00:02:23.410> one<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:27.310> every<00:02:27.519> piece

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
basically here's one then every piece

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.030 
basically here's one then every piece
and<00:02:27.880> does<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.120> again<00:02:31.500> memory<00:02:32.500> pizza<00:02:32.739> does<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
and does it again memory pizza does it a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.020 
and does it again memory pizza does it a
third<00:02:33.280> time<00:02:37.170> now<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:39.459> into<00:02:39.610> this<00:02:39.730> fourth

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
third time now going into this fourth

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.340 
third time now going into this fourth
time<00:02:40.299> we're<00:02:40.660> still<00:02:40.840> going<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.049> be<00:02:41.110> doing<00:02:41.200> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
time we're still going to be doing the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.080 
time we're still going to be doing the
same<00:02:41.380> rhythm<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.370> we're<00:02:42.549> changing<00:02:42.970> that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
same rhythm but we're changing that

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.310 
same rhythm but we're changing that
shape<00:02:43.360> now<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:44.100> playing<00:02:45.100> this<00:02:45.280> flat<00:02:45.910> minor<00:02:46.320> to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
shape now and playing this flat minor to

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.849 
shape now and playing this flat minor to
a<00:02:47.590> flat<00:02:48.220> major<00:02:48.459> E<00:02:48.970> flat<00:02:49.450> minor<00:02:49.930> triad<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.829> a

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
a flat major E flat minor triad to a

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.000 
a flat major E flat minor triad to a
flat<00:02:51.310> major<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:53.230> let<00:02:53.320> me<00:02:53.410> show<00:02:53.530> you<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.769> one

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
flat major so let me show you that one

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.580 
flat major so let me show you that one
time<00:02:54.359> this<00:02:55.359> is<00:02:55.540> essentially<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.989> fourth<00:02:56.290> time

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
time this is essentially the fourth time

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.890 
time this is essentially the fourth time
through<00:02:57.040> this<00:02:57.640> this<00:02:58.060> sort<00:02:58.269> of<00:02:58.329> rhythmic<00:02:58.570> riff

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
through this this sort of rhythmic riff

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.349 
through this this sort of rhythmic riff
here

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.149 

all<00:03:08.359> right<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.260> it's<00:03:09.409> just<00:03:09.469> going<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.890> flat

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
all right so it's just going a flat

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.449 
all right so it's just going a flat
minor<00:03:10.430> B<00:03:10.790> flat<00:03:10.819> E<00:03:11.209> flat<00:03:11.239> G<00:03:11.510> flat<00:03:12.010> -<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.040> flat

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
minor B flat E flat G flat - a flat

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:25.869 
minor B flat E flat G flat - a flat
major<00:03:13.840> C<00:03:14.840> E<00:03:15.079> flat<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.620> flat<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:25.220> does<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.579> twice

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
major C E flat a flat it does that twice

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.170 
major C E flat a flat it does that twice
so<00:03:26.870> it's<00:03:27.079> three<00:03:27.349> times<00:03:27.590> through<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:29.060> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
so it's three times through on just the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.110 
so it's three times through on just the
fifths<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:29.780> then<00:03:30.349> two<00:03:30.530> times<00:03:30.769> through<00:03:31.120> on

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
fifths and then two times through on

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.580 
fifths and then two times through on
these<00:03:32.680> triads<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:35.000> let's<00:03:35.150> try<00:03:35.389> that<00:03:35.590> once

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
these triads so let's try that once

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.780 
these triads so let's try that once
together<00:03:36.889> I'm<00:03:36.950> going<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.099> kind<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.310> count<00:03:37.609> as

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
together I'm going to kind of count as

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.610 
together I'm going to kind of count as
we<00:03:38.000> go<00:03:38.150> through<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.780> see<00:03:39.349> if<00:03:39.439> we<00:03:39.470> can

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
we go through this and see if we can

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.559 
we go through this and see if we can
play<00:03:39.799> this<00:03:39.980> slowly<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.700> three<00:03:41.000> times<00:03:41.239> using

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
play this slowly so three times using

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.729 
play this slowly so three times using
just<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.989> fifths<00:03:42.439> and<00:03:42.970> then<00:03:43.970> two<00:03:44.180> times<00:03:44.359> using

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
just the fifths and then two times using

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.530 
just the fifths and then two times using
these<00:03:45.739> triads<00:03:46.310> now<00:03:46.459> up<00:03:46.819> in<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.389> new

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
these triads now up in this new

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.259 
these triads now up in this new
