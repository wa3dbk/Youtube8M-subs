idea of having a retro card let's say if

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.560 
idea of having a retro card let's say if
it<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.409> jordan<00:01:52.740> 14<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.000> every<00:01:54.360> single

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it was a jordan 14 to have every single

it was a jordan 14 to have every single
color<00:01:54.899> way<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> jordan<00:01:55.680> 14<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
color way of the jordan 14 from the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.139 
color way of the jordan 14 from the
original<00:01:57.240> launch<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.130> card<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.579> i

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
original launch in on the card just i

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.030 
original launch in on the card just i
think<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.719> if<00:02:00.840> they<00:02:00.960> did<00:02:01.320> something<00:02:01.590> small

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
think that if they did something small

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.270 
think that if they did something small
like<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.390> help<00:02:03.950> promote<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
like that it can help promote the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280 
like that it can help promote the
product<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.820> future<00:02:06.509> sales<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.049> they<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.259> a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
product in future sales if they have a

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.570 
product in future sales if they have a
retro<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.740> those<00:02:07.829> original<00:02:08.220> colors<00:02:08.459> again

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
just my two cents I think it's it would

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.700 
just my two cents I think it's it would
be<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> great<00:02:11.690> promotions<00:02:12.690> marketing<00:02:12.930> tool

this<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.560> back<00:04:01.920> in<00:04:02.070> this<00:04:02.220> era<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.730> when<00:04:02.940> I

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
this is this back in this era is when I

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.210 
this is this back in this era is when I
really<00:04:03.390> started<00:04:03.690> to<00:04:03.870> become<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.860> hoarder

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
really started to become a hoarder

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.910 
really started to become a hoarder
collector<00:04:05.790> because<00:04:05.970> it<00:04:06.240> was<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.860> ended<00:04:07.860> up

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
collector because it was like I ended up

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.890 
collector because it was like I ended up
being<00:04:08.430> able<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.700> afford<00:04:08.760> buying<00:04:09.240> a<00:04:09.540> couple

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
being able to afford buying a couple

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.350 
being able to afford buying a couple
pairs<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.410> then<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.310> was<00:04:11.610> able<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.850> just<00:04:11.940> keep

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
pairs and then I was able to just keep

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.690 
pairs and then I was able to just keep
him<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.630> ice<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.710> mean<00:04:14.220> that's<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.640> don't

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
him on ice and so I mean that's I don't

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.680 
him on ice and so I mean that's I don't
know<00:04:14.850> it's<00:04:15.000> kind<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.270> beginning<00:04:15.360> of<00:04:15.630> the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
know it's kind of the beginning of the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.150 
know it's kind of the beginning of the
end<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:15.930> me<00:04:16.109> when<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:16.350> when<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.590> started<00:04:16.980> I

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
end for me when it when it started I

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.470 
end for me when it when it started I
didn't<00:04:17.670> have<00:04:17.790> every<00:04:18.030> single<00:04:18.270> one<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.390> the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
didn't have every single one of the

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.070 
didn't have every single one of the
Jordans<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.380> one<00:04:19.890> through<00:04:20.130> 23<00:04:20.989> kind<00:04:21.989> of

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
Jordans in the one through 23 kind of

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.320 
Jordans in the one through 23 kind of
collection<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.669> so<00:04:23.850> this<00:04:24.000> was<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.180> of

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
collection and and so this was kind of

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.870 
collection and and so this was kind of
like<00:04:24.450> in<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.660> humble<00:04:24.930> beginnings<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.350> that

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880
