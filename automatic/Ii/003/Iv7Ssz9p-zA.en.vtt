part of the spinal cord is supplied by
the<00:02:11.970> interior<00:02:12.570> spinal<00:02:12.930> artery

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the interior spinal artery

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:25.820 
the interior spinal artery
actually<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:15.450> is<00:02:15.890> anterior<00:02:17.060> yes<00:02:24.830> anterior

actually this is anterior yes anterior

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
actually this is anterior yes anterior
2/3<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> spinal<00:02:27.660> cord<00:02:29.180> interior<00:02:30.180> 2/3<00:02:30.630> of

the spinal cord is supplied with the
blood<00:02:34.590> from<00:02:35.130> anterior<00:02:35.850> spinal<00:02:37.040> artery

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
blood from anterior spinal artery

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.660 
blood from anterior spinal artery
it<00:02:38.610> means<00:02:38.880> if<00:02:39.680> anterior<00:02:40.680> spinal<00:02:40.830> artery<00:02:41.430> is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it means if anterior spinal artery is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.710 
it means if anterior spinal artery is
blocked<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:43.800> then<00:02:44.370> interior<00:02:44.910> 2/3<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.630> the

spinal cord at that level of the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.100 
spinal cord at that level of the
blockage<00:02:48.420> will<00:02:48.900> undergo<00:02:49.230> infarction

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
blockage will undergo infarction

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.890 
blockage will undergo infarction
necrosis<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.550> right<00:02:53.760> undergo<00:02:54.450> Escamilla

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
necrosis is the right undergo Escamilla

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.380 
necrosis is the right undergo Escamilla
and<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.530> ischemia<00:02:55.980> severe<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:57.000> may<00:02:57.209> lead<00:02:57.360> to

the depth of necrosis of that part of
spinal<00:02:59.550> cord<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.450> really<00:03:00.630> happens<00:03:01.110> that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
spinal cord so what really happens that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.860 
spinal cord so what really happens that
anterior<00:03:02.310> spinal<00:03:02.490> artery<00:03:03.120> supplies<00:03:03.540> about

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
anterior spinal artery supplies about

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.540 
anterior spinal artery supplies about
interior<00:03:04.440> 2/3<00:03:04.980> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.360> what<00:03:07.310> spinal<00:03:08.310> cord

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
interior 2/3 of the what spinal cord

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.790 
interior 2/3 of the what spinal cord
right<00:03:09.239> another<00:03:09.600> important<00:03:10.110> thing<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.530> course

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
right another important thing of course

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800 
right another important thing of course
there's<00:03:11.370> not<00:03:11.489> so<00:03:11.790> much<00:03:11.940> blood<00:03:12.300> coming<00:03:12.630> from

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
there's not so much blood coming from

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.260 
there's not so much blood coming from
here<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.709> it<00:03:13.920> will<00:03:14.070> supply<00:03:14.340> all<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.750> down

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
here that it will supply all the down

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.699 
here that it will supply all the down
rather<00:03:18.440> there<00:03:19.440> are<00:03:19.620> special<00:03:20.959> branches<00:03:21.959> which

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
rather there are special branches which

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.800 
rather there are special branches which
are<00:03:22.800> called<00:03:23.070> segmental<00:03:23.790> arteries<00:03:24.209> which<00:03:24.690> are

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
are called segmental arteries which are

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.460 
are called segmental arteries which are
coming<00:03:24.959> at<00:03:25.170> multiple<00:03:25.800> levels<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.570> reinforce

do<00:03:31.290> you<00:03:31.380> know<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.820> segmental<00:03:33.180> arteries

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
do you know that the segmental arteries

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.060 
do you know that the segmental arteries
because<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.930> spinal<00:03:37.200> cord<00:03:37.350> if<00:03:37.739> into<00:03:37.950> your

spinal arteries start from here and goes
down<00:03:40.850> right<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:43.200> does<00:03:43.380> not<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.680> enough<00:03:44.010> blood

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
down right it does not have enough blood

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.550 
down right it does not have enough blood
to<00:03:44.489> supply<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.120> spinal<00:03:45.959> cord<00:03:46.200> into<00:03:46.380> your

to supply all the spinal cord into your

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.210 
to supply all the spinal cord into your

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
2/3 so it is reinforced right from

special<00:04:00.959> supply<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:01.920> entire<00:04:02.160> spinal

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
special supply to the entire spinal

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.339 
special supply to the entire spinal
artery<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.480> added<00:04:03.959> blood

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
artery so that added blood

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.649 
artery so that added blood
should<00:04:04.980> come<00:04:05.219> there<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.670> spinal<00:04:06.299> cord<00:04:06.329> should

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
should come there and spinal cord should

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.800 
should come there and spinal cord should
be<00:04:06.749> properly<00:04:07.109> nourished<00:04:07.819> right<00:04:08.819> so<00:04:09.359> let's

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
be properly nourished right so let's

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.059 
be properly nourished right so let's
suppose<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.349> one<00:04:10.499> artery

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
suppose this is one artery

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.479 
suppose this is one artery
what<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:11.939> the<00:04:12.090> snowy<00:04:12.329> tree<00:04:12.659> called<00:04:13.489> segmental

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
what is the snowy tree called segmental

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.319 
what is the snowy tree called segmental
artery<00:04:14.849> so<00:04:15.420> segmental<00:04:15.959> arteries<00:04:16.380> are

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
artery so segmental arteries are

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.029 
artery so segmental arteries are
entering<00:04:18.329> into<00:04:18.660> from<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.470> some<00:04:19.650> arteries

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
entering into from the some arteries

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.749 
entering into from the some arteries
which<00:04:20.190> are<00:04:20.280> on<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> side<00:04:21.590> right<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.949> these

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 
which are on the side right and these

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.529

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
segmental arteries as the move medially

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.430 
segmental arteries as the move medially
they<00:04:28.050> divide<00:04:28.410> into<00:04:28.620> interior<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:30.660> the

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
they divide into interior and the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.700 
they divide into interior and the
