00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.240
 with plastic container that we do not use 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.100
 we can make animal figures only 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.049
 we have to decorate them with rubber eva 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.670
 give them an animalistic aspect what 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.460
 important is to make the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.320
 imagination we cut four strips of 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.150
 eva rubber of various different colors 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.540
 all will measure as the length of the 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.830
 container in this case 20 centimeters two 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.950
 strips has a width of four 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.969
 centimeters two of two centimeters and one 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.350
 three centimeters to all are 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.420
 william we will make shapes 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.630
 lost making diagonal cuts 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.430
 for one side and then for the other for 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.000
 complete the triangles as if they were 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.220
 Pointy hills with the container 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.260
 lying down let's stick these strips on the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.230
 Loin of container using hot silicone 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.100
 goes side by side to imitate the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.100
 fur an animal 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 we will also make ears by cutting two 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.010
 oval pieces of eva rubber shaped like 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 the leaf of a tree we put together the edges 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.310
 from its widest part and we stick them in 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.310
 the sides of the container 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.939
 now we can see clearly how the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.620
 container lid becomes the 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.600
 nose of the animal 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.990
 but to complete his face we will make him 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.210
 eyes and eyebrows the eyes are of a bearing 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.890
 10 pesos coin and the eyebrows are 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 small rectangles that are glued 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.610
 over 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.799
 how the animal has to lie down 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.320
 we are going to make a base for 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.259
 hold it in a 3 mm wood 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.049
 we are going to copy the outline of the container and 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.580
 we cut it with a handsaw 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.320
 we need two equal pieces so that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.720
 be the sides of the base and a 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.039
 12 x 4 centimeters rectangle for 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.039
 let it be the bottom 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.520
 then the three pieces we paste them with 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.260
 cold tail once dry we painted it with 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.410
 some color that matches the fur 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.210
 the ears we could make several of 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.460
 these animals and collect the o 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.069
 also give them another use for example as 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.019
 light screen 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.090
 you just have to open the base and put 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.769
 inside a bulb holder with the bulb 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.700
 of energy saving so that it does not 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.700
 hot plastic
