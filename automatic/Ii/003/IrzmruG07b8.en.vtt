00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.410
 after the disappointing 20 of double agent e 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.720
 a modest success of splinter cell 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.000
 conviction ubisoft tries one more 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.590
 aimed at bringing up 360 and ps3 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.030
 the adventures of sam fisher with a new one 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.010
 adventure and much to agree 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.690
 both the nostalgic as the players 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.220
 most passionate tom clancy's splinter 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.420
 cell black list 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.430
 in fact, it ends after the events 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.989
 narrated in the previous episode with a 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.460
 simple the group is visibly 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.800
 tempered by the mishaps experienced 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.150
 together with his daughter the story thinks 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.850
 but from style to church a good e 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.130
 of matrix to the mixed between lingus x and 007 gods 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.050
 first money with a plot that moves away 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.720
 by itself, I ask you to think of a tangle of 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.180
 interesting spies and multi-faceted game 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.950
 look then it passed back to the 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.060
 many features have been overturned 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.100
 left behind 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.899
 back to the present all this black 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.640
 once customizable in any suspicion 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.860
 the trial and error structure that 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.720
 distinguished the first chapters e 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.220
 the program also returns and there was one 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.020
 however the course will be played by the player 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.280
 orders and check the wheels yes 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.899
 of operations from the shovel of a 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.820
 gigantic ring and military that 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.259
 it functions as an operational base by performing 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.600
 exactly the same functions as 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.860
 standard of the mass the contribution of the parades 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.240
 the player can talk to 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.459
 second-handers to discover new details 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.380
 on the plot about their some background 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.179
 sire weapons upgrade and access to 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.759
 multiplayer compartment testing in this way 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.470
 so the new interesting canisters but 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.149
 perfection not yet implemented 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.459
 in fact it is not possible to talk to all 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.110
 characters and also in this case the 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.550
 conversation almost always resolves the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.170
 briefing of a secondary mission 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.290
 without going too far into 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.360
 characterization of the interlocutors 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 not bad because the real game starts 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.930
 only once I fell to the ground and to 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.300
 some missions are noticed many 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.700
 differences from the collisions 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.110
 first only apparently marginal e 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.920
 that you can move i again 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.680
 bodies of enemies 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.210
 the second more important than the various ones 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.220
 situations could be addressed 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.200
 with three different approaches for which 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.780
 let's play the Lutheran game we mean 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.220
 nardi end of each mission 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.660
 you can then choose to play from 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.760
 ghost and avoid the various enemies 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.370
 decide to happen all silently 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.690
 matera mode 9 finally prefer 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.340
 the approach defined assault e 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.500
 face damage to the circumstance 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.180
 smooth sin only that very often 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.530
 this choice does not have a real one 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.240
 the fact about the mission because 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.890
 depending on the sword 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.380
 you will decide of that heart that you have me 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.660
 always having to face 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.490
 the various rooms great themes of friends who 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.960
 they have prepared for you 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.210
 however, this is a secondary problem 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.340
 which the game overcomes abundantly 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.170
 with a wide variety of levels 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.280
 you will be tossed around for the whole 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.810
 globe through a series of 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.700
 realistic settings that bars 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.590
 from iran to america passing by 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.640
 regions bread and rough bunker 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.680
 safety 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.360
 a race towards variety this is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.730
 next to the most interested wealth 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.040
 of levels after the basic DVD expulsion 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.660
 for play we in fact found ourselves for 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.120
 check the subtitles in front of the 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.340
 Udine will dominate from the top of the gods 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.070
 Enemy Vehicles of Segmental Launch e 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.050
 even checking the brics of 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.940
 new sel partner of a section in 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.650
 subjective probably meant for 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.220
 introduce the mechanical system of 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.020
 competitive multiplayer control 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.880
 an eclecticism that followed by splinter 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.020
 cell black list that you will like or not 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.180
 according to taste 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.800
 what has not convinced us are 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.690
 the interrogations conducted for six years 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.330
 often violently and now 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.160
 managed through simple signed al 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.930
 player will only have to decide if 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.000
 imprison save the founders of 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.500
 round an option which moreover does not 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.670
 will make no difference in the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.670
 I continue with the story 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.640
 to embellish splinter cell black keys 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.590
 think about the multiplayer sector that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.930
 compared to the previous money was 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.090
 entirely refined and improved a 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.740
 part of the usual competitive mode that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.510
 He sees the players divided into teams 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.310
 he explained of mercenaries with the task 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.080
 respectively to conquer one 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.880
 defend certain goals 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.270
 and now you can also enjoy a new one 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.070
 mode co op the latter will not see me 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.350
 but in the shoes of two spies I was not me but 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.940
 of the same fisher and of isaac brixen a 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.740
 new character that will accompany them 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.120
 for the whole affair with him you can 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.769
 face the secondary missions of the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.109
 campaign specifically designed for 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.150
 players both online and is called with 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.130
 the video in this way the one before 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.110
 it was better by the taxes they intersect 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.830
 history by increasing longevity 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.570
 of the title 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.100
 what emerges is therefore a time is 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.570
 changed from the past in the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.280
 attempt to implement them together i 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.510
 strengths of milic scionts and those 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.910
 to be called a capitol emi for 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.580
 please everyone but nobody depending 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.349
 of points of view 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.930
 the technical sector is not convincing 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.550
 which decorous proposes one more type 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.379
 expressive and the emotions of the door 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.300
 news and sums up this 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.530
 you would expect black list we find ourselves of 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.050
 facing a different chapter from his 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.479
 predecessor and for commission has thought 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.550
 more from critics than from the public 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.169
 fun at times even working the 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.389
 game manages to offer an experience a 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.680
 all round designed to please with 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.500
 all fans of the series 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.479
 old and new without them though 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.479
 show a strong personality
