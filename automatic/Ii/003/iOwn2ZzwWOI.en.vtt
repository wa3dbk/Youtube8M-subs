a cheap way to defeat the computer

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.750 
a cheap way to defeat the computer
hopefully<00:00:28.590> it'll<00:00:28.740> work<00:00:28.920> because<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.490> mean

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
hopefully it'll work because I mean

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.939 
hopefully it'll work because I mean
there<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> cram<00:00:30.599> ton<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:30.900> Romans<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
against the computer in situations like

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.100 
against the computer in situations like
this<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.550> make<00:00:44.850> me<00:00:44.879> angry<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.539> go<00:00:45.809> ahead<00:00:45.899> and

them<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> actually<00:00:56.340> need<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:58.730> rush<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
them so I actually need to rush up to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.549 
them so I actually need to rush up to
the<00:01:00.180> gate<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:02.570> Tim<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> Romans<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.260> city

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the gate and Tim the Romans in the city

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.740 
the gate and Tim the Romans in the city
and<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.610> need<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.850> try<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.119> destroy<00:01:06.510> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
and I need to try and destroy that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.219 
and I need to try and destroy that
before<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> reinforcements<00:01:08.070> arrive

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
before the reinforcements arrive

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.149 
before the reinforcements arrive
so<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.640> Romans<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> city<00:01:13.100> should<00:01:14.100> be

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so the Romans in the city should be

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
so the Romans in the city should be
coming<00:01:14.700> out<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.969> the<00:01:15.060> gate<00:01:17.780> but<00:01:18.780> apparently

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
coming out of the gate but apparently

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.459 
coming out of the gate but apparently
they're<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:20.420> it's<00:01:21.420> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.659> curious<00:01:21.899> usually

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
they're not it's kind of curious usually

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.919 
they're not it's kind of curious usually
they<00:01:22.590> run<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.039> gate<00:01:23.780> basically<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.810> don't

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
they run out the gate basically I don't

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.200 
they run out the gate basically I don't
want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> get<00:01:25.320> surrounded<00:01:25.799> by<00:01:25.950> Romans

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.490 

well<00:01:31.210> I<00:01:31.450> guess<00:01:31.690> they're<00:01:31.900> not<00:01:32.050> gonna<00:01:32.170> come<00:01:32.380> out

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.100 
well I guess they're not gonna come out
of<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.680> gate<00:01:32.860> because<00:01:34.110> they're

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
of the gate because they're

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.830 
of the gate because they're
reinforcements<00:01:36.010> are<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:36.370> way<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:37.720> what

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.280 

I'm<00:02:00.700> just<00:02:00.910> gonna<00:02:01.030> march<00:02:01.300> my<00:02:01.479> hoplites<00:02:01.900> forward

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
I'm just gonna march my hoplites forward

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.389 
I'm just gonna march my hoplites forward
and<00:02:02.470> take<00:02:02.650> these<00:02:02.800> guys<00:02:02.860> out

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
and take these guys out

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.679 
and take these guys out
shouldn't<00:02:06.399> take<00:02:06.460> long<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:07.210> study<00:02:07.479> here

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
shouldn't take long to study here

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.330 
shouldn't take long to study here
absolutely<00:02:08.289> no<00:02:08.440> magic<00:02:08.860> very<00:02:09.039> any

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.120 

easily<00:02:15.340> cutting<00:02:15.640> them<00:02:15.790> down<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.770> have<00:02:17.950> this

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
easily cutting them down and I have this

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.280 
easily cutting them down and I have this
huge<00:02:18.850> generals<00:02:19.480> bodyguard

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
yeah I mean you can see this is a pretty

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.839 
yeah I mean you can see this is a pretty
messy<00:05:54.710> urban<00:05:55.160> warfare

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.369 

but<00:05:58.360> I<00:05:58.389> think<00:05:58.599> I've<00:05:58.689> recorded<00:05:58.959> enough<00:05:59.259> for

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
but I think I've recorded enough for

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:00.450 
but I think I've recorded enough for
this<00:05:59.499> battle

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
this battle

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.070 
this battle
back<00:06:00.580> with<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:00.819> results<00:06:03.569> all<00:06:04.569> right<00:06:04.750> here's

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
the battle results for you as you can

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
the battle results for you as you can
see<00:06:06.819> I<00:06:07.389> killed<00:06:08.319> every<00:06:08.710> single<00:06:08.889> Roman

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
see I killed every single Roman

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:14.060 
see I killed every single Roman
that<00:06:09.810> attended<00:06:10.500> this<00:06:10.860> party<00:06:11.090> and<00:06:12.950> they<00:06:13.950> have

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
that attended this party and they have

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.330 
that attended this party and they have
zero<00:06:14.100> min<00:06:14.610> remaining

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
zero min remaining

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.600 
zero min remaining
so<00:06:17.340> I<00:06:17.370> thought<00:06:17.730> that<00:06:17.790> turned<00:06:18.150> out<00:06:18.270> rather<00:06:18.450> well
