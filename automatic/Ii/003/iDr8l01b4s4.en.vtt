randomly in the deck and you're actually
just<00:01:46.740> blooming<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> deck<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> exactly<00:01:47.880> two

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
just blooming the deck in exactly two

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389

piles are exactly the same cuz they

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
piles are exactly the same cuz they
don't<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.340> 51<00:01:53.790> cards<00:01:54.030> in

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.749 
don't think that you have 51 cards in
your<00:01:54.270> hand<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.219> told<00:01:56.369> them<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
your hand then and then you told them to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.399 
your hand then and then you told them to
memorize<00:01:57.090> their<00:01:57.270> card<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.840> place<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.229> on

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
memorize their card and place it on

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.359 
memorize their card and place it on
whatever<00:01:58.740> pile<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.840> but<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.219> they

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
whatever pile they want but and so they

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.830 
whatever pile they want but and so they
can<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> you'll<00:02:03.420> place<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.630> other

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
can do that and you'll place the other

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.310 
can do that and you'll place the other
power

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
power

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.560 
power
top<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.830> pile<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.430> proceed<00:02:06.330> with<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
top of that pile and proceed with the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.300 
top of that pile and proceed with the
trick<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:06.990> before<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> show<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> how<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.130> do

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
trick but before I show you how to do

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.770 
trick but before I show you how to do
that<00:02:08.429> part<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> next<00:02:09.179> part<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> trick

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
that part the next part of the trick

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.930 
that part the next part of the trick
what<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.710> was<00:02:10.860> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.009> tell<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.190> guys<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.730> as

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
what I was going to tell you guys is as

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.100 
what I was going to tell you guys is as
you're<00:02:12.090> scrolling<00:02:12.300> through<00:02:12.720> cards<00:02:13.020> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
you're scrolling through cards and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.910 
you're scrolling through cards and
counting<00:02:13.410> them<00:02:13.530> three<00:02:13.800> four<00:02:14.220> five<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.920> they

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
counting them three four five and they

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
counting them three four five and they
just<00:02:17.100> picked<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> earlier<00:02:18.030> Carter

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
just picked one of the earlier Carter

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.840 
just picked one of the earlier Carter
going<00:02:18.630> one<00:02:18.810> two<00:02:18.959> three<00:02:19.470> four<00:02:19.740> five<00:02:19.800> six<00:02:20.370> seven

going one two three four five six seven
eight<00:02:21.150> nine<00:02:21.209> ten<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:22.140> your<00:02:22.500> mind<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.890> telling

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
eight nine ten in your mind and telling

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.800 
eight nine ten in your mind and telling
them<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.280> pick<00:02:23.490> any<00:02:23.670> card<00:02:23.940> bet<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.270> want<00:02:24.510> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
them to pick any card bet they want and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.350 
them to pick any card bet they want and
then<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.320> got<00:02:25.650> 15<00:02:26.070> 16<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.700> then<00:02:26.970> let's<00:02:27.209> say<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
then I got 15 16 and then let's say to

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.910 
then I got 15 16 and then let's say to
pick<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:27.720> card<00:02:28.050> so<00:02:28.500> while<00:02:28.680> they're<00:02:28.860> looking

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
pick this card so while they're looking

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.920 
pick this card so while they're looking
at<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.220> card<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.580> know<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.270> is<00:02:30.330> 16<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:30.810> I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
at the card I know that this is 16 so I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.610 
at the card I know that this is 16 so I
just<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.290> 17<00:02:32.040> 18<00:02:32.550> 19<00:02:32.580> 20<00:02:33.390> 21<00:02:33.690> in<00:02:34.020> my<00:02:34.260> head<00:02:34.440> while

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
just go 17 18 19 20 21 in my head while

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.780 
just go 17 18 19 20 21 in my head while
they're<00:02:34.740> looking<00:02:34.830> at<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.100> card<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> just<00:02:35.520> put

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
they're looking at the card and just put

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.520 
they're looking at the card and just put
my<00:02:35.910> finger<00:02:36.240> there<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.020> then<00:02:37.170> they<00:02:37.320> look<00:02:37.440> at

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
my finger there so then they look at

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.680 
my finger there so then they look at
their<00:02:37.680> card<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.790> said<00:02:39.090> okay<00:02:39.570> I'm

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
their card and then I said okay I'm

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.600 
their card and then I said okay I'm
going<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.930> randomly<00:02:40.680> cut<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.280> deck<00:02:41.430> where

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
going to randomly cut the deck where

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.880 
going to randomly cut the deck where
ever<00:02:41.730> feel<00:02:42.239> like<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.720> then<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.900> cut<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.709> exactly

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
ever feel like so then I cut it exactly

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.120 
ever feel like so then I cut it exactly
into<00:02:44.550> piles<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:45.540> look<00:02:45.720> at<00:02:45.810> their<00:02:45.959> card<00:02:46.260> which

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
into piles they look at their card which

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.850 
into piles they look at their card which
in<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.430> case<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.970> seven<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.600> clubs<00:02:48.860> they

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
in this case is the seven of clubs they

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.500 
in this case is the seven of clubs they
place<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.310> whatever<00:02:50.489> pile<00:02:50.880> they<00:02:51.090> want<00:02:51.330> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
place it on whatever pile they want and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.060 
place it on whatever pile they want and
it<00:02:51.840> doesn't<00:02:52.110> matter<00:02:52.260> whichever<00:02:52.560> pile<00:02:52.860> they

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
it doesn't matter whichever pile they

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.680 
it doesn't matter whichever pile they
place<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.580> because<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.090> they<00:02:54.270> place<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.480> on

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
place it on because if they place it on

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.509 
place it on because if they place it on
this<00:02:54.840> pow<00:02:55.020> when<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.290> complete<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.800> cut<00:02:55.980> it'll

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
this pow when I complete the cut it'll

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.460 
this pow when I complete the cut it'll
be<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.850> card<00:02:57.060> will<00:02:57.209> be<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.480> 22nd<00:02:58.050> position

will be in the 22nd position they

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.900 
will be in the 22nd position they
obviously<00:03:03.959> don't<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.890> let's<00:03:05.670> say<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
obviously don't know this let's say the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.440 
obviously don't know this let's say the
spectator<00:03:06.360> pics<00:03:06.690> this<00:03:07.290> file<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:09.030> then<00:03:09.209> you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
spectator pics this file so then you

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
spectator pics this file so then you
tell<00:03:09.600> them<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.780> are<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.049> complete<00:03:10.350> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
tell them that are going to complete the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.560 
tell them that are going to complete the
cut<00:03:10.680> their<00:03:11.430> cards<00:03:11.730> buried<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.209> deck<00:03:12.360> and

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
cut their cards buried in the deck and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.090 
cut their cards buried in the deck and
there's<00:03:12.720> no<00:03:13.019> possible<00:03:13.560> way<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.950> can

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
there's no possible way that you can

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.759 
there's no possible way that you can
know<00:03:14.250> their<00:03:14.400> card<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.170> next<00:03:16.440> part<00:03:16.560> of

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
know their card so now the next part of

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.710 
know their card so now the next part of
this<00:03:16.920> trick<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.190> really<00:03:17.970> self<00:03:18.209> working

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
this trick is really self working

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.300 
this trick is really self working
actually<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.680> all<00:03:19.829> you're<00:03:19.980> going<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.160> actually

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
actually so all you're going to actually

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.759 
actually so all you're going to actually
have<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.940> is<00:03:21.209> tell<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.959> spectator<00:03:22.530> that

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
have to do is tell the spectator that
