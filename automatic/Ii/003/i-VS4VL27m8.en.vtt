00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.720
I'm Makoto Kisaragi, i'm 15 years old !

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.700
My big sister is a charismatic high school magazine model.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.040
"Cute" was my sister's favorite word ever since she was little.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.040
However,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.060
Shouldn't I become a sparkling high schooler on my own?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.660
Baka~! (Idiot!) Where are you kicking it ?

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Sorry! (Gome~!) Are you okay ?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.280
Makoto, your back !

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.300
I want to cry..

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.900
It shouldn't be like this...

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.460
Kisaragi, wear this.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.500
Illya-kun's amazing right ?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
His follow up was cool too.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640
Somehow I have an amazing feeling about this !

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.400
What's going on ? What's all this racket ?

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.680
It's Kisagari Rika !

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.220
The real one !

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.060
Amazing !

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.160
Big sis ? (Onee-Chan ?)

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.120
I'm Kisaragi Makoto,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.160
15 years old !

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.280
My sister is a super famous magazine model.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.260
Oh! Your uniform is really cute and stylish!

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.680
So she does get advice from her sister after all !

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.060
Huh? This isn't right..

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.920
This isn't how it should be.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.820
What's wrong ?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.520
I want to hear what you have to say too, Kisaragi.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.980
Thanks for worrying about me.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.840
Kisaragi, do you really want to be that kind of character ?

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.460
It kind of feels like you're forcing yourself, or rather...

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.640
I..

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.200
have to be cuter.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.200
If I just had a little bit more strength,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.000
If only I had more confidence in myself!

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.720
I might get discouraged right away...

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.600
but at least I'll come to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.520
like my hard-working self!

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.260
When girls think about becoming cute,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.260
they become stronger!

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.440
Well then, I'll be cool too,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.260
so the two of us match.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.960
I thought his way of smiling was really arrogant yet..

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.960
Come on

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.960
shall we go ?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.940
I really want to be stronger,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.440
I wish to be able love myself and others!

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.140
Show me your e-mail address.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.080
Okay!

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.020
That'd be nice, exchanging e-mails.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.600
Oh yeah. Can I have your e-mail address, Kisaragi ?

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.000
S-sure !

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.720
Wow my e-mail is lame isn't it ?

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.420
Like smiley faces,

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.540
and like rabbits ?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.700
Someone cover me. He'll think I'm lame.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.520
It only I'd worried about this a bit sooner...

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.560
It's fine. Don't force yourself to tell me.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.840
I get it and everything. Illya-kun is always surrounded by people

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.740
Don't oversleep tomorrow.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.820
I want to know more about him. Not because he's a classmate.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.140
But because he's Illya-kun!

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.400
C-can I have your e-mail address?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.620
This marker is water-based so

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.160
if you cry it'll disappear.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.780
The record for most romantic moment of my life was just broken!

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.520
The subtitles were added by Shylisa,

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.000
Sources are in the description

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.960
It's Romantica Clock, not Sugar Soldier, I'm sorry.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.040
