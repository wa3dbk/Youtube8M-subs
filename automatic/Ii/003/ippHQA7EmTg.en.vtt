00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
crystal I would have liked to see a

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.800 
crystal I would have liked to see a
sapphire<00:01:32.409> crystal<00:01:32.950> on<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.549> watch<00:01:33.790> but<00:01:34.119> from

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
sapphire crystal on this watch but from

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.940 
sapphire crystal on this watch but from
what<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:34.960> understand<00:01:35.469> that<00:01:35.680> would<00:01:35.799> have

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
what I understand that would have

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.240 
what I understand that would have
increased<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.549> cost<00:01:37.390> significantly<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:38.590> so

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
increased the cost significantly and so

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.520 
increased the cost significantly and so
you<00:01:39.520> know<00:01:39.610> that's<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.880> trade-off<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:41.200> keep<00:01:41.409> in

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
you know that's a trade-off to keep in

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.620 
you know that's a trade-off to keep in
mind<00:01:41.770> let's<00:01:42.460> take<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.700> look<00:01:42.939> now<00:01:43.149> at<00:01:43.180> what<00:01:43.479> this
