very<00:01:04.850> small<00:01:05.420> headset<00:01:06.170> probably<00:01:06.680> one<00:01:06.830> of<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
very small headset probably one of the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.190 
very small headset probably one of the
smallest<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:07.820> have<00:01:08.030> personally<00:01:08.300> used<00:01:08.600> and

smallest that I have personally used and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.590 
smallest that I have personally used and

it fits right in your ear very well

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.540 
it fits right in your ear very well
because<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.050> weighs<00:01:12.230> pretty<00:01:12.950> much<00:01:13.190> nothing

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
because it weighs pretty much nothing

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.480 
because it weighs pretty much nothing
