00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
hmm and I think the coolest feature of

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.330 
hmm and I think the coolest feature of
all<00:02:54.650> the<00:02:54.890> radio<00:02:55.720> puts<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.810> thousand<00:02:57.230> watt<00:02:57.380> amp

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
all the radio puts a thousand watt amp

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:15.110 
all the radio puts a thousand watt amp
and<00:02:58.700> here<00:02:59.180> goes
