00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.520
 but before 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.220
 nothing takes us back to the past than a ride in a carriage drawn by 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.749
 horses 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:10.309
 an external vehicle 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.319
 both in appearance and construction 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.789
 built one today still requires the expertise of several 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.630
 traditional craftsmen from blacksmiths to wheel mechanics 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.640
 the mechanism that will come carriage a 5th round that is positioned for this 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.220
 currently on the two front wheels 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.920
 workers soldamaq fifth-wheel steel carriage structure 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.480
 then released the frame stirrups and install the driver's seat that will be 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 soldier in position 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.850
 when structure is complete 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.999
 goes through an acid wash to remove any visitor 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.580
 welded joints are harvested to smooth the surface 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.280
 canoeing has drum brakes the workers were on the shaft who rode 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.220
 the steel springs that make up the suspension 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.990
 ansa 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.990
 and also goes to fux at night 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.680
 then connect a brake cable 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.970
 yes the assembly of all installed under structure of the carriage 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.710
 keeping the tradition the rounds are made of wood the metal is not 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.080
 flexible enough to withstand the road bumps 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.750
 brake is used because it is a hard battery that also does not rot 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 workers easily place 16 reais around a cube according to the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.899
 they put opposition websites compressing those that tell the toucan 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.370
 which are 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 and then fasten them with bolts and nuts 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.460
 she following marks rays in two places yes the first line shows 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.519
 how much to cut in each box 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.500
 the second line 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 how far they would fit on the 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.859
 to form the gang first they model the cone-shaped tip 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.859
 I then held him in captivity 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:32.389
 cards of mica that will fit into the corresponding holes that now 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:36.709
 are made in two semicircular strips of wood the strips form what if 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.709
 flame of araujo from there all of the route 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:44.259
 because 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.579
 the workers open to the public after pressing a band of steel called the 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.169
 khanal against the aurora 

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:52.039
 chem 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:54.759
 Mrs. 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.680
 they cut the plateau more 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 then release the tips 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 then the subject is racing to have a satin finish 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:11.589
 then they open eight holes in the channel using a drilling machine 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:16.149
 then shelters the holes to secure the bolts that the hamilton to the atrium 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:21.069
 the screws are tightened with a special 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.529
 the tires are made of rubber 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.749
 they contain two steel tacks to fasten those of the place on the route 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.469
 the workers rules to the water channel of the graffiti water so that the first 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.799
 easily slide the wheel then reassembled into the automatic 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.799
 tire which pulls out the wires by clicking 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.209
 on wheels calil 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.449
 with the tips of the wires are soldered using near miss this time to the 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:51.449
 assembles stronger 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:57.310
 then the wheel is struck on the ground but 4 5 times the third liminal distance 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.450
 between the tips of the tire and covering saadane soldiers inside 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.769
 a hammer strike followed by a final hit on the ground ensures that the 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.999
 tire union is firm 

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.920
 now the wheels can be mounted on the axles and this website on the body of the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.870
 carriage 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.099
 but in no time 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.279
 you 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:30.279
 and after noting that all fronts 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 it's time to apply the finishing touches 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.610
 that 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.439
 now only the horsepower is lacking
