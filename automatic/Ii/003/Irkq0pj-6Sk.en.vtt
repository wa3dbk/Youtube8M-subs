00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
so nice thing about this mill is that we

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.030 
so nice thing about this mill is that we
can<00:00:55.850> adjust<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.690> granule<00:00:57.230> size<00:00:57.500> as<00:00:57.829> we're

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
can adjust the granule size as we're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.830 
can adjust the granule size as we're
sort<00:00:58.219> of<00:00:58.280> milling<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.270> take<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.600> look

dry<00:03:43.470> ingredients<00:03:43.790> turn<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.720> speed

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
dry ingredients turn it back on to speed

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.580 
dry ingredients turn it back on to speed
one<00:03:47.570> incorporate<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.690> flour<00:03:48.960> making<00:03:49.350> sure

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
one incorporate the flour making sure

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.740 
one incorporate the flour making sure
not<00:03:49.770> to<00:03:49.830> overwork<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.610> then<00:03:51.210> immediately

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
not to overwork it then immediately

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.070 
not to overwork it then immediately
afterwards<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.010> add<00:03:53.220> my<00:03:53.630> fruit<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:54.930> has

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
afterwards and I add my fruit that has

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:03.830 
afterwards and I add my fruit that has
been<00:03:55.290> soaked<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.890> dried<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:02.450> then<00:04:03.450> I<00:04:03.540> fold

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
been soaked and dried and then I fold

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:22.320 
been soaked and dried and then I fold
the<00:04:03.990> remaining<00:04:05.930> flour<00:04:06.930> in<00:04:07.320> by<00:04:07.530> hand

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.270 

so<00:04:23.330> after<00:04:23.870> we've<00:04:23.990> got<00:04:24.170> half<00:04:24.380> our<00:04:24.530> flour<00:04:24.950> and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
so after we've got half our flour and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
so after we've got half our flour and
all<00:04:25.490> of<00:04:25.670> our<00:04:25.790> fruit<00:04:26.540> in<00:04:26.810> there<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.910> take<00:04:28.910> it<00:04:29.090> off

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
all of our fruit in there I take it off

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.410 
all of our fruit in there I take it off
the<00:04:29.780> mixer<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.680> folding<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.220> rest<00:04:31.490> of<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
the mixer and folding the rest of the

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.420 
the mixer and folding the rest of the
dry<00:04:32.690> ingredients<00:04:32.720> by<00:04:33.470> hand<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:34.040> trick<00:04:34.250> here

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
dry ingredients by hand the trick here

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.760 
dry ingredients by hand the trick here
is<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.640> don't<00:04:34.760> want<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.030> over<00:04:35.360> fold<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:36.080> so

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
is you don't want to over fold it so

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.410 
is you don't want to over fold it so
that<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:36.980> gets<00:04:37.160> too<00:04:37.370> tough<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:37.910> like<00:04:38.120> doing

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
that it gets too tough so I like doing

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:54.870 
that it gets too tough so I like doing
this<00:04:38.570> portion<00:04:39.080> by<00:04:39.230> hand

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.170 

so<00:04:55.880> we<00:04:56.120> can<00:04:56.270> use<00:04:56.420> these<00:04:56.690> tartlet<00:04:57.650> pans<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.400> for

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
so we can use these tartlet pans and for

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.050 
so we can use these tartlet pans and for
size<00:04:59.420> like<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.960> I'd<00:05:00.590> recommend<00:05:01.070> filling<00:05:01.940> it

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
size like this I'd recommend filling it

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:10.310 
size like this I'd recommend filling it
to<00:05:02.090> about<00:05:02.390> 250<00:05:03.380> grams<00:05:03.410> of<00:05:03.950> our<00:05:04.070> batter

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.000 

and<00:05:10.410> then<00:05:11.010> with<00:05:11.190> an<00:05:11.310> offset<00:05:11.580> spatula<00:05:13.010> we're

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
and then with an offset spatula we're

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.560 
and then with an offset spatula we're
gonna<00:05:14.130> move<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:15.030> batter<00:05:15.300> into<00:05:15.750> a<00:05:16.740> nice<00:05:17.570> even

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
gonna move the batter into a nice even

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:38.909 
gonna move the batter into a nice even
surface

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.679 

clean<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.639> edge<00:05:39.789> off<00:05:40.060> with<00:05:40.300> your<00:05:40.419> finger

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:47.039 

and<00:05:43.779> then<00:05:44.439> you<00:05:44.619> can<00:05:44.830> garnish<00:05:45.759> the<00:05:46.059> edge<00:05:46.239> with

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:47.049 
and then you can garnish the edge with

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:54.089 
and then you can garnish the edge with
some<00:05:47.259> blanched<00:05:47.649> whole<00:05:48.489> almonds<00:05:52.889> after<00:05:53.889> this

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
some blanched whole almonds after this

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.009 
some blanched whole almonds after this
it's<00:05:54.639> ready<00:05:54.909> to<00:05:55.029> go<00:05:55.119> into<00:05:55.389> the<00:05:55.509> oven

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:56.019 
it's ready to go into the oven

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:59.339 
it's ready to go into the oven
I'd<00:05:56.829> recommend<00:05:57.189> baking<00:05:57.699> these<00:05:57.879> at<00:05:58.119> about<00:05:58.349> 350

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
I'd recommend baking these at about 350

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.799 
I'd recommend baking these at about 350
degrees<00:05:59.919> in<00:06:00.099> a<00:06:00.159> convection<00:06:00.549> oven<00:06:00.809> till

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:01.809 
degrees in a convection oven till

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:05.850 
degrees in a convection oven till
they're<00:06:01.929> nice<00:06:02.249> golden-brown<00:06:03.249> and<00:06:04.349> then<00:06:05.349> once

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
they're nice golden-brown and then once

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.419 
they're nice golden-brown and then once
cooled

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:06.429 
cooled

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:33.449 
cooled
they're<00:06:07.059> ready<00:06:07.299> to<00:06:07.389> enjoy<00:06:32.099> so<00:06:33.099> once<00:06:33.309> you're

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:33.459 
they're ready to enjoy so once you're

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.069 
they're ready to enjoy so once you're
done<00:06:33.489> with<00:06:33.789> the<00:06:33.969> Dundee<00:06:34.419> cakes<00:06:34.749> and<00:06:34.959> they've

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:35.079 
done with the Dundee cakes and they've

00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.589 
done with the Dundee cakes and they've
cooled<00:06:35.379> they<00:06:36.129> might<00:06:36.399> stick<00:06:36.879> just<00:06:37.149> a<00:06:37.360> little

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
cooled they might stick just a little

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.169 
cooled they might stick just a little
bit<00:06:37.749> so<00:06:38.110> heating<00:06:38.649> it<00:06:38.739> over<00:06:39.129> a<00:06:39.159> little<00:06:39.489> burner

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:40.179 
bit so heating it over a little burner

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:44.969 
bit so heating it over a little burner
helps<00:06:40.779> and<00:06:40.989> then<00:06:41.289> it<00:06:41.409> lifts<00:06:41.919> right<00:06:42.159> out<00:06:43.979> and

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
helps and then it lifts right out and

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.919 
helps and then it lifts right out and
then<00:06:45.669> again<00:06:45.909> if<00:06:45.999> the<00:06:46.119> bottom<00:06:46.479> is<00:06:46.659> a<00:06:46.779> little

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:46.929 
then again if the bottom is a little

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:49.199 
then again if the bottom is a little
sticky<00:06:47.229> just<00:06:48.099> carefully<00:06:48.759> heat<00:06:48.939> it<00:06:49.029> over<00:06:49.179> a

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:49.209 
sticky just carefully heat it over a

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:52.350 
sticky just carefully heat it over a
little<00:06:49.269> bit<00:06:49.419> of<00:06:49.569> a<00:06:49.689> flame<00:06:50.699> take<00:06:51.699> an<00:06:51.819> offset

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
little bit of a flame take an offset

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.930 
little bit of a flame take an offset
spatula

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.100 

the<00:07:00.900> lease<00:07:01.110> set

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.730 

and<00:07:05.289> then<00:07:05.889> you<00:07:06.039> can<00:07:06.189> put<00:07:06.400> it<00:07:06.520> on<00:07:06.610> a<00:07:06.669> plate<00:07:07.740> and

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
and then you can put it on a plate and

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.150 
and then you can put it on a plate and
it's<00:07:09.340> ready<00:07:09.580> for<00:07:09.789> service
