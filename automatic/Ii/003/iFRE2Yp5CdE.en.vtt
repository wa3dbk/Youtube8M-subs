00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.850 

other<00:00:00.810> people<00:00:01.140> some<00:00:01.350> of<00:00:01.410> you<00:00:01.469> guys<00:00:01.589> know<00:00:01.829> that

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
other people some of you guys know that

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.970 
other people some of you guys know that
was<00:00:02.129> losing<00:00:02.429> compression<00:00:02.909> out<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.179> the<00:00:03.270> LTV

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:03.980 
was losing compression out of the LTV

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.600 
was losing compression out of the LTV
everything<00:00:05.089> so<00:00:06.089> took<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.390> motor<00:00:06.569> out<00:00:07.610> sitting

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
everything so took the motor out sitting

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.000 
everything so took the motor out sitting
right<00:00:08.730> here<00:00:09.349> took<00:00:10.349> off<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> top<00:00:10.860> end<00:00:13.070> you<00:00:14.070> know

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
right here took off the top end you know

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.109 
right here took off the top end you know
took<00:00:17.010> off<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> whole<00:00:17.580> cylinder<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
took off the whole cylinder and

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.920 
took off the whole cylinder and
everything<00:00:18.590> put<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.650> back<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:20.210> put<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
everything put it back on put it in the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.670 
everything put it back on put it in the
quad<00:00:22.170> again<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.660> got<00:00:24.810> 20<00:00:25.080> more<00:00:25.199> compression

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
quad again and I got 20 more compression

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.490 
quad again and I got 20 more compression
out<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.310> still<00:00:26.609> not<00:00:26.789> fired<00:00:27.140> so<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.380> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
out of it but still not fired so then I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.880 
out of it but still not fired so then I
took<00:00:28.680> out<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> piston<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.349> here<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.560> as

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
took out the piston and here it is as

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.280 
took out the piston and here it is as
you<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.189> see<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.579> can't<00:00:32.850> really<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.290> decided

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you can see you can't really see decided

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
you can see you can't really see decided
to<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.680> grind<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.160> down<00:00:35.190> cuz<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.700> pick<00:00:35.880> my

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
to really grind it down cuz I pick my

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.709 
to really grind it down cuz I pick my
own<00:00:36.180> injection<00:00:36.809> blue<00:00:37.969> because<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> bought

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
own injection blue because when I bought

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.299 
own injection blue because when I bought
it<00:00:39.750> somebody<00:00:40.290> shoved<00:00:40.590> like<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.860> ball<00:00:41.100> bearing

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
it somebody shoved like a ball bearing

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.810 
it somebody shoved like a ball bearing
inside<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.120> hose<00:00:42.300> no<00:00:43.079> oil<00:00:43.290> can<00:00:43.559> get<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.789> I

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
inside the hose no oil can get out so I

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.540 
inside the hose no oil can get out so I
think<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.149> could<00:00:45.210> scratch<00:00:45.660> off<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> frigging

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
think I could scratch off the frigging

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.490 
think I could scratch off the frigging
piston<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.610> everything<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.030> bad<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> can

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
piston and everything really bad you can

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.160 
piston and everything really bad you can
see<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.910> can't<00:00:51.360> really<00:00:51.480> see<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.960> there

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
see and you can't really see it in there

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.490 
see and you can't really see it in there
I<00:00:52.829> don't<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.520> those<00:00:53.670> little<00:00:53.730> Nick's

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
I don't you see all those little Nick's

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.029 
I don't you see all those little Nick's
anything<00:00:55.610> but<00:00:57.199> there's<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> lot<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> Nick's<00:00:58.829> in

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
anything but there's a lot of Nick's in

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.340 
anything but there's a lot of Nick's in
there<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> everything<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
there and everything and there's a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
there and everything and there's a
couple<00:01:01.590> little<00:01:02.070> holes<00:01:02.480> and<00:01:03.830> I<00:01:05.090> think<00:01:06.090> that's

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
couple little holes and I think that's

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.310 
couple little holes and I think that's
why<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.659> using<00:01:06.689> compression<00:01:08.990> as<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.170> can

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
why I was using compression as you can

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
why I was using compression as you can
see<00:01:10.560> make<00:01:11.369> policy<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> little<00:01:12.090> better

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
see make policy a little better

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.830 
see make policy a little better
I<00:01:12.540> was<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.439> Nick's<00:01:14.330> and<00:01:15.330> everything<00:01:15.720> in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I was a little Nick's and everything in

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.499 
I was a little Nick's and everything in
my<00:01:15.960> cylinder<00:01:16.409> head<00:01:16.820> itself<00:01:17.820> has<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> same

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
my cylinder head itself has the same

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.760 
my cylinder head itself has the same
thing<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.930> where<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> spark<00:01:19.409> plug<00:01:19.590> goes

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
thing like where the spark plug goes

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
thing like where the spark plug goes
inside<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.700> anyone<00:01:21.030> knows<00:01:21.180> how<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.360> clean<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
inside if anyone knows how to clean that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
inside if anyone knows how to clean that
up<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> cylinder<00:01:22.380> head<00:01:22.619> that'd<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.430> great

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
up on the cylinder head that'd be great

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.980 
up on the cylinder head that'd be great
and<00:01:24.180> also<00:01:25.340> this<00:01:26.340> ring<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> bottom<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.840> one

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and also this ring at the bottom the one

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170 
and also this ring at the bottom the one
that's<00:01:28.170> sticking<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.820> frozen

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
that's sticking out that one was frozen

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.420 
that's sticking out that one was frozen
in<00:01:30.570> look<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> top<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.040> look

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
in look at just like the top one look

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.630 
in look at just like the top one look
you<00:01:33.030> could<00:01:33.150> see<00:01:33.299> it's<00:01:33.420> like<00:01:33.600> flush<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.680> like

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
you could see it's like flush and like

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060 
you could see it's like flush and like
as<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.630> missing<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.020> ring<00:01:37.229> that's

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
as if like it was missing a ring that's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
as if like it was missing a ring that's
probably<00:01:38.430> how<00:01:38.549> hot<00:01:38.850> they<00:01:39.090> got<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.570> there<00:01:39.750> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
probably how hot they got in there this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.569 
probably how hot they got in there this
one<00:01:40.829> was<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.369> frozen<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:42.060> finally<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.509> unfrozen

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
one was so frozen I finally got unfrozen

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.660 
one was so frozen I finally got unfrozen
and<00:01:44.579> yeah<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> got<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> connecting

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and yeah and then I got the connecting

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.690 
and yeah and then I got the connecting
rod<00:01:47.880> bearing<00:01:48.710> but<00:01:49.710> basically<00:01:50.130> that's<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.460> my

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
rod bearing but basically that's it my

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
rod bearing but basically that's it my
piston<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.049> bad<00:01:52.229> shape

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
piston is in bad shape

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
piston is in bad shape
thirty<00:01:53.640> hours<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> piston<00:01:54.600> thirty<00:01:54.869> dollars

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
thirty hours for a piston thirty dollars

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.429 
thirty hours for a piston thirty dollars
for<00:01:55.229> rings<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.630> also<00:01:57.750> need<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.110> clip

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
for rings so and I also need that clip

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530 
for rings so and I also need that clip
in<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.130> mine<00:01:59.369> broke<00:01:59.640> off<00:01:59.850> both<00:02:00.329> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
in there because mine broke off both of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.350 
in there because mine broke off both of
mine<00:02:00.659> broke<00:02:00.930> off<00:02:01.369> like<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.119> don't

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
mine broke off like they like I don't

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.060 
mine broke off like they like I don't
even<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.630> where<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.500> gotta<00:02:04.829> find

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
even know where they are so I gotta find
