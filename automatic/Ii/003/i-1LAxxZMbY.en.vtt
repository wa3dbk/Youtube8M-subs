watching these films as a kid and even

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.060 
watching these films as a kid and even

all<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> elements<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.270> part<00:00:51.539> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
all of the elements that are a part of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
all of the elements that are a part of
her<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.760> guess<00:00:54.110> semi-human<00:00:55.110> incarnation<00:00:55.800> kind

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
her I guess semi-human incarnation kind

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.720 
her I guess semi-human incarnation kind
of<00:00:56.930> foreshadow<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.379> issue<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.980> while<00:00:59.489> her

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of foreshadow this issue so while her

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.790 
of foreshadow this issue so while her
headdress<00:00:59.969> does<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> certain<00:01:01.109> medieval

headdress does have a certain medieval

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
headdress does have a certain medieval
quality<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.579> it's<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.769> symbolic<00:01:04.769> for

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
quality to it it's really symbolic for

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
quality to it it's really symbolic for
the<00:01:05.159> horns<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.760> part<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> her<00:01:06.360> dragon

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
the horns that are part of her dragon

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.679 
the horns that are part of her dragon
head<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.500> her<00:01:08.250> her<00:01:08.850> whole<00:01:09.000> gallon<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> way

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
head and her her whole gallon in the way

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.270 
head and her her whole gallon in the way
it<00:01:09.840> sort<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.110> waves<00:01:10.560> out<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it sort of waves out really is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
it sort of waves out really is
representative<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> dragons<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.080> wings

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
representative of the dragons and wings

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
representative of the dragons and wings
so<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.460> wanted<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.729> kind<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> capture<00:01:15.680> elements

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
so we wanted to kind of capture elements

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
so we wanted to kind of capture elements
of<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.860> certainly<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> costume<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.840> of

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
of that certainly the costume was one of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
of that certainly the costume was one of
the<00:01:19.049> most<00:01:19.619> difficult<00:01:20.189> elements<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> figure

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
the most difficult elements to figure

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.999 
the most difficult elements to figure
out<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> still<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> things<00:01:22.799> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
out and still one of the things with

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.700 
out and still one of the things with
these<00:01:23.130> animated<00:01:23.520> characters<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.390> are

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
these animated characters that we are

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.080 
these animated characters that we are
really<00:01:25.710> having<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> stretch<00:01:26.820> our

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
really having to kind of stretch our

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.350 
really having to kind of stretch our
imagination<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.750> little<00:01:27.780> bit<00:01:28.080> because<00:01:29.360> when

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
imagination a little bit because when

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.120 
imagination a little bit because when
they<00:01:30.450> draw<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> garments<00:01:31.680> they're<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.100> for

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
they draw the garments they're there for

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
they draw the garments they're there for
capturing<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.119> sweep<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.750> kind<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
capturing the sweep and kind of the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.840 
capturing the sweep and kind of the
silhouette<00:01:34.890> or<00:01:34.920> went<00:01:35.220> out<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> character

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
silhouette or went out of the character

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
silhouette or went out of the character
and<00:01:35.970> there's<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:37.049> much

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
and there's not really as much

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.649 
and there's not really as much
consideration<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.329> how<00:01:39.420> does<00:01:39.570> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
consideration for you know how does this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
consideration for you know how does this
garment<00:01:40.140> actually<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:41.070> work<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.670> was

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
garment actually really work if it was

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.569 
garment actually really work if it was
put<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> human<00:01:43.259> being<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.100> these<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.280> these

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
put on a human being so these are these

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.830 
put on a human being so these are these
are<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.790> interesting<00:01:45.210> things<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.630> do

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
are the interesting things that we do

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.149 
are the interesting things that we do
have<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> solve<00:01:46.500> when<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.770> handle<00:01:47.070> these

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
have to solve when we handle these

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789

disney<00:02:36.640> villains<00:02:37.000> but<00:02:37.210> i<00:02:37.450> think<00:02:37.660> really

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
disney villains but i think really

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.530 
disney villains but i think really
resonates<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.740> most<00:02:38.830> with<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.310> character

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
resonates the most with this character

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.380 
resonates the most with this character
so<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.600> sort<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:40.960> perched<00:02:41.230> atop<00:02:41.470> her<00:02:41.740> staff

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
so you sort of perched atop her staff

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.080 
so you sort of perched atop her staff
and<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:44.380> base<00:02:44.770> was<00:02:45.100> another<00:02:45.340> great<00:02:45.550> place<00:02:45.850> for

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and the base was another great place for

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.700 
and the base was another great place for
us<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.210> kind<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.480> bring<00:02:46.780> in<00:02:46.930> themes<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.590> the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
us to kind of bring in themes of the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.350 
us to kind of bring in themes of the
animation<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.370> think<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.760> like<00:02:49.030> one<00:02:49.330> of

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
animation I think this is like one of

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.230 
animation I think this is like one of
the<00:02:49.480> things<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:50.760> important<00:02:51.760> to<00:02:51.880> us<00:02:52.030> when

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
the things that is important to us when

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.850 
the things that is important to us when
doing<00:02:52.480> these<00:02:52.630> Disney<00:02:53.080> interpretations

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
doing these Disney interpretations

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.800 
doing these Disney interpretations
because<00:02:54.190> there's<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.460> lot<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.670> elements<00:02:55.360> of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
because there's a lot of elements of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.220 
because there's a lot of elements of
just<00:02:56.080> sort<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.350> art<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:58.000> in<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.810> animation

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
just sort of art in the in the animation

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.470 
just sort of art in the in the animation
and<00:02:59.560> even<00:02:59.770> in<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.950> opening<00:03:00.280> credits<00:03:00.460> so<00:03:00.970> when

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
and even in the opening credits so when

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.570 
and even in the opening credits so when
we<00:03:01.600> did<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.870> base<00:03:02.110> we<00:03:02.740> wanted<00:03:03.040> to<00:03:03.070> bring<00:03:03.310> in

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
we did the base we wanted to bring in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.240 
we did the base we wanted to bring in
that<00:03:03.850> aspect<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.630> that<00:03:04.750> thorn<00:03:05.200> motif<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.040> so

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
that aspect of that thorn motif and so

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.620 
that aspect of that thorn motif and so
it's<00:03:06.430> sort<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.760> wrapped<00:03:07.030> around<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.480> waist

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
it's sort of wrapped around the waist

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.450 
it's sort of wrapped around the waist
band<00:03:07.990> of<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.680> base<00:03:09.460> pedestal<00:03:10.090> itself
