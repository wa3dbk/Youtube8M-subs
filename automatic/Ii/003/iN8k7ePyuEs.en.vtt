that is 6al 4v titanium and all

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.540 
that is 6al 4v titanium and all
components<00:01:35.890> except<00:01:36.890> for<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.130> blade<00:01:37.370> in<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
components except for the blade in the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:44.500 
components except for the blade in the
bearings<00:01:37.970> are<00:01:38.210> titanium<00:01:42.250> as<00:01:43.250> far<00:01:43.520> as<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:44.120> can

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
bearings are titanium as far as I I can

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.090 
bearings are titanium as far as I I can
tell<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.320> same<00:01:45.530> size<00:01:45.860> as<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.220> normal<00:01:46.700> sng

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
tell it's the same size as a normal sng

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.560 
tell it's the same size as a normal sng
so<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.160> don't<00:01:49.340> think<00:01:49.520> anything<00:01:49.910> as<00:01:50.030> far<00:01:50.180> as<00:01:50.300> size

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
so I don't think anything as far as size

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.850 
so I don't think anything as far as size
has<00:01:51.140> changed<00:01:52.180> however<00:01:53.180> um<00:01:53.720> because<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.800> the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
has changed however um because of the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.520 
has changed however um because of the
titanium<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:55.970> about<00:01:56.060> 5<00:01:56.450> ounces<00:01:56.660> but<00:01:57.380> it

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
titanium it's about 5 ounces but it

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
20 CV blade it's asymmetrically ground

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:58.090 
20 CV blade it's asymmetrically ground
ok<00:02:51.530> so<00:02:51.590> there<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.190> see<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:53.980> edge<00:02:54.980> on<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:57.100> all

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
ok so there you see the edge on that all

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.559 
ok so there you see the edge on that all
right<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.519> then

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.599 

trying<00:03:03.349> to<00:03:03.409> get<00:03:03.499> my<00:03:03.560> new<00:03:03.799> camera<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.219> work<00:03:04.249> here

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
trying to get my new camera to work here

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:13.360 
trying to get my new camera to work here
for<00:03:04.819> me<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:09.560> you<00:03:09.650> go<00:03:11.769> completely<00:03:12.769> flat<00:03:13.219> on

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
for me there you go completely flat on

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.959 
for me there you go completely flat on
that<00:03:13.549> side<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.799> from<00:03:15.799> what<00:03:16.010> I've<00:03:16.159> done<00:03:16.549> on<00:03:16.849> the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 
that side and from what I've done on the

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.970 
that side and from what I've done on the
research<00:03:17.359> on<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.019> chromium<00:03:18.499> nitride

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
research on this the chromium nitride

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.839 
research on this the chromium nitride
basically<00:03:19.819> the<00:03:20.120> edge<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.719> it<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:22.579> supposed

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
basically the edge that it it's supposed

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.270 
basically the edge that it it's supposed
to<00:03:22.969> give<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.209> 85<00:03:24.730> HR<00:03:25.730> see<00:03:27.129> that's<00:03:28.129> what

I mean you can't even really tell what
knife<00:04:21.080> it<00:04:21.320> is<00:04:21.470> in<00:04:21.680> the<00:04:21.769> pocket<00:04:21.980> other<00:04:22.340> than<00:04:22.520> the

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
knife it is in the pocket other than the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:23.920 
knife it is in the pocket other than the
fact<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.330> know<00:04:23.360> if<00:04:23.540> you<00:04:23.690> know<00:04:23.810> what<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
fact that you know if you know what the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.820 
fact that you know if you know what the
MSC<00:04:24.470> stands<00:04:24.740> for<00:04:25.010> then<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.280> obviously<00:04:25.370> know

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
MSC stands for then you obviously know

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.700 
MSC stands for then you obviously know
what<00:04:27.830> a<00:04:27.860> great<00:04:28.130> clip<00:04:28.430> it's<00:04:29.120> actually<00:04:29.500> see<00:04:30.500> if<00:04:30.620> I

what a great clip it's actually see if I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.900 
what a great clip it's actually see if I
can<00:04:30.890> shradha<00:04:32.140> it's<00:04:33.140> actually<00:04:33.290> milled<00:04:33.830> see<00:04:34.820> the

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
can shradha it's actually milled see the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.520 
can shradha it's actually milled see the
side<00:04:35.180> of<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.390> scale<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.170> actually<00:04:37.160> milled<00:04:37.490> in

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
side of that scale is actually milled in

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.650 
side of that scale is actually milled in
for<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.650> clip<00:04:39.920> so<00:04:40.730> it's<00:04:40.910> not<00:04:41.060> going<00:04:41.270> to<00:04:41.360> swivel

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
for the clip so it's not going to swivel

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
well how is it secured it looks like it

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.300 
well how is it secured it looks like it
could<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:47.000> know<00:04:47.120> spin<00:04:47.540> nope<00:04:47.990> make<00:04:48.950> thought<00:04:49.190> of

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
could you know spin nope make thought of

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.540 
could you know spin nope make thought of
that<00:04:51.940> see<00:04:52.940> if<00:04:53.030> i<00:04:53.150> can<00:04:53.300> get<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:53.540> again<00:04:54.340> come<00:04:55.340> on

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
that see if i can get it again come on

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.360 
that see if i can get it again come on
there<00:04:56.090> we<00:04:56.210> go<00:04:56.450> there<00:04:57.050> we<00:04:57.080> go<00:04:57.350> it<00:04:58.010> is<00:04:58.130> actually

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
there we go there we go it is actually

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
there we go there we go it is actually
milled<00:04:58.940> out<00:04:59.150> there<00:04:59.480> for<00:05:00.440> the<00:05:00.560> clip<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:02.000> yep

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
milled out there for the clip and yep

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.330 
milled out there for the clip and yep
while<00:05:02.720> we're<00:05:02.870> right<00:05:03.020> there<00:05:03.260> go<00:05:04.010> ahead<00:05:04.220> and

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
while we're right there go ahead and

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.909 
while we're right there go ahead and
take<00:05:04.520> a<00:05:04.550> look<00:05:04.640> look<00:05:05.150> at<00:05:05.210> those<00:05:06.640> standoffs

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
take a look look at those standoffs

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.090 
take a look look at those standoffs
perfect<00:05:09.919> not<00:05:10.669> too<00:05:10.850> much<00:05:11.060> not<00:05:11.450> too<00:05:11.630> little

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
perfect not too much not too little

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.430 
perfect not too much not too little
that's<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.220> nice<00:05:13.370> flare<00:05:13.730> and<00:05:14.000> up<00:05:15.490> yep<00:05:16.490> sure<00:05:17.030> did

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
that's a nice flare and up yep sure did
