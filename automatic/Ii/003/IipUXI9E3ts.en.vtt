00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the stop-motion animation consists of 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 move and photograph objects box to 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 picture to make an animation 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.389
 stop-motion the first thing we should have 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.719
 is a character with an object to 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.719
 encourage 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.150
 we should have a camera and we should have 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.010
 optimal light conditions is to say that 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.930
 let's have a continuous light hopefully it's 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.580
 an artificial light and that does not enter light 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.840
 of the day so that we do not have jumps of 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 light between one frame and another 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.010
 the camera should show the connected to a 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.270
 computer and the computer must have a 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.850
 software for stop-motion animation 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.980
 also with mobile apps 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.989
 both on Android platform and for 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.210
 iphone in children there are applications 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.140
 free and some pay to do 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.140
 stop motion animations 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.090
 the camera being fixed on a tripod 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.740
 frame to prevent movement 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.810
 only the elements have to be moved 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.640
 inside the screen the following 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.350
 start moving objects box 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.250
 picture to photograph them with the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.250
 stop move software 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.009
 let's go capturing each of the 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.299
 pictures and we are going to move the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.299
 plasticine or water when 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.140
 the idea of ​​this is that the logo is 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.409
 start to put together but let's do the 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.090
 animation backwards we put it together because it's 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.100
 more difficult in modeling and we're going to 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.820
 begin to disarm it then what but 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 we will go backwards 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.760
 the traditional audiovisual has 30 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.590
 frames per second the video the cinema 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.380
 has 24 frames per second that is 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 they pass 24 photos one after the other 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.680
 per second in animation we 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.630
 we can vary the number of pictures 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.940
 that go by second in this case we're 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.580
 cheering at 8 frames per second we have 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.370
 to take 8 photos each with 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.740
 movement 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.590
 to give us a second video 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.300
 the more photos take one per second 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 more fluid is going to be the movement and more 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.420
 continuous it will feel less 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 fragmented 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.069
 either with a homemade camera or 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.750
 semi-professional or with a cell phone 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.620
 these simple steps could make a 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.620
 animation in Stockholm
