00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.160
 we're seeing the Sony Ericsson w205 feasting here in Ireland as one 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.649
 so far deal with the bigger one 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.859
 On the one hand, there is volume. Button man is here the slot 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.010
 Festhalle turns for the headphones and if you buy it also for 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.779
 a USB cable 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.799
 behind the one comma 3-megapixel camera 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.710
 I hug one 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.359
 angry 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.669
 and here 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.609
 on the right side 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:34.170
 is the slot for 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.170
 expand the memory stick and the memory 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.430
 Unfortunately, the catenary is not quite as good 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.430
 the piglet of many things recently the markets and forth 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.590
 AUD it could be a bit better 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 arrived as I think 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.400
 Unfortunately, that's not all that nice, but I think so 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.420
 if you buy quite cheap mobile phone you have of course synonymous compromises 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.640
 do 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.470
 so the display shows Amazon Katie Display something of 60 thousand colors 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 and 128 times 160 pixels 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.860
 So me too high values ​​but 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 Here are some for a stand-up phone, that's okay 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.980
 so open 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.800
 to the painting of a special functions and Stuhr 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.740
 This is quite wrong you can Tiffany quasi with several people 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.370
 Sharing land to sweetheart her Han i would like to have 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.010
 there are contacts down here 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.740
 several phone books there is a common phone book 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.180
 and then 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.190
 you can here 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.010
 four telephone books 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.550
 he uses that means four people can use their own contacts here 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 manage that for me here is a very nice feature 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.900
 otherwise only from Milan 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.960
 At last a nice name 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.170
 A focus of internet search entertainment comrades news 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.340
 Brockmann 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.660
 Caller contacts and setting 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.040
 and now we want to have mine's news in India around all the keyboard 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.289
 try 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:15.709
 the keys John are actually quite good taxes also one thinks with 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.409
 Peter bigger 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.409
 Fingers that is very neat which also have 2 rule 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.689
 pleasant pressure point 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.609
 Now I want to go here and have to try the pastor 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:37.389
 and what strikes me is that the 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:40.989
 Vienna with the different groups came here for example 4 notes 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.169
 you hardly 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:44.739
 if you press and in principle not on the phone actually 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.209
 Jams has reacted the 5 Amedick in turn can be very well dried 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.559
 so that is 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.749
 Schaefer Esser and so different 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:57.650
 You can feel very good when you are on the 5 of these small survey animals 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.419
 but the transition to the left and right for me is not quite so clear 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.469
 successful 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.009
 that would have been accepted 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.479
 we could have done better there you have to 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.179
 already felt exactly so far 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.649
 So sounds just so it is not suitable with the phone and as I said 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:19.589
 So especially the FIA ​​then you hardly notice the Ticino Jura and ruled 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:20.139
 on the pressure
