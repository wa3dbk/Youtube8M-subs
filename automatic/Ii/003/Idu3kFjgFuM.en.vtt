00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.630
 the committee's protest continues 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.309
 spontaneous of the parents born in montalbano 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.040
 to test against the choice of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.660
 alternative viability to implement via 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.120
 around the middle school 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.470
 lucky where they are in the meantime 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.140
 school pupils transferred 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.090
 elementary in montalbano was held a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.890
 encounter a sort of inspection by 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
 part of the mayor and the administration 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.110
 municipal that was the occasion also 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.059
 to meet the citizens to understand 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.130
 what are the different positions 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.929
 the situation is very simple here 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.699
 we try to divert the problem we don't have 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:38.010
 never questioned the practicability 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.989
 of the school but the viability for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.059
 accessing it is a slightly different thing 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.620
 we have taken note of the parking lots of the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.879
 back area that they have set up of 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.499
 this we can only acknowledge 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.210
 to the administration but we must not 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:50.550
 forget that to log in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.829
 this area must pass by a road 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 of 333 and a half meters four meters 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.600
 maximum where two cars in the opposite direction e 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.339
 a child go in a narrow way 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.159
 so I mean no spare stock 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.070
 high even though they also told us the 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.960
 municipal police that suits 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.850
 moment we want an outlet of 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.979
 this road albeit temporarily 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.619
 we have three we have via maroncelli 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 we have via xxiv May via rosato in 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.430
 waiting for the big deal 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.469
 of the final outlet on via 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.780
 rosato could also very well open 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.790
 a provisional outlet with an order 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.969
 as was done in this one 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.140
 right now and wait for it 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.119
 construction of the new road 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.649
 finally among the various initiatives the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.020
 collection of signatures to pay attention 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.640
 of the prefect this problem what is there 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.049
 expect 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 but we certainly expect some 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.500
 be careful because he signed a third party 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.570
 of the community and this to justify 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.700
 that our requests are not far-fetched 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.740
 in the air and absolutely contrary 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.930
 as someone asserts they are not 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 politicized or exploited 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 but I have kept myself to do this 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.159
 inspection today that it was done 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.380
 jointly also with the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.909
 parents' representatives why 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.850
 I wanted to try to understand what they were 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.150
 the real arguments they brought 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.650
 to say no to this transfer from 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.610
 ascoli 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.160
 I personally think that if this 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.130
 this is not the optimal solution 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.209
 absolutely no traffic jam problems 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.310
 any problem there is no problem 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.600
 eventual bottling is as if 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.700
 we were facing the gigantic 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.459
 roundabouts which can be accessed from one 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.830
 part and it is said of the as in the full e 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.989
 complete safety of children there 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.060
 I want to point out why you can 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.730
 see were drawn on the ground 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.130
 over 80 parking stalls plus the whole 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.530
 stop for teaching and non-teaching staff 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.690
 teacher who comes the whole system 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.489
 reports practically who accompanies the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.290
 child at school enters through a gate 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.870
 park accompanies the child 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.730
 inside the school he gets into 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.140
 car and it goes away sincerely not 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.130
 I can still understand what is coming 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.440
 complained by parents even in the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.000
 arguments written in those two 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.920
 pages sent to prefect are 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.260
 absolutely insubstantial so much so that 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.420
 i am going to order and invite if there 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.799
 had the prefect of toast on the spot 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.610
 to realize what we are 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.170
 speaking 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.510
 regardless of the school's interior 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.090
 which has beautiful classrooms with classrooms 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.190
 aura classrooms interactive whiteboards with i 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.480
 computer labs so what 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.880
 what are we talking about that other one 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.430
 school or sight and I saw this too 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.799
 really you're talking about sex 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.810
 of the angels of something that I do not 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.890
 I can still understand we will be 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.460
 present from the beginning to 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.680
 both to say to carry out the ordinaries 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:35.060
 traffic police duties but also for 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.410
 monitor watch see those 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.780
 which may possibly be the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.400
 criticalities and therefore the improvements that 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.650
 we could make an immediate future 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.550
 the provisions of the code 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.310
 of the road 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.560
 about lane width measurements 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.020
 they are all respected 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.370
 having said that we see what will be 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.680
 if there will be the first critical points 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.569
 so I would give to have a 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.659
 more collaborative attitude and more 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.510
 marked by impartial observation 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:10.200
 objective of those that may be 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.200
 any problems
