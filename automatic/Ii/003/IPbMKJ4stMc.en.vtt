00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.209
 Today, cosmetic surgery can correct the effects of aging 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.820
 face, remodeling the different parts of the latter. 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.090
 But what is important is to preserve its natural expression. 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.830
 For the lower face, it is possible to correct both the jowls, the sagging 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.660
 at the level of the cheeks and folds at the level of the neck by performing a cervicofacial lifting. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 For the eyelid spots, the pockets and the sagging of the latter in particular, 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.790
 can be corrected by palpebroplasty, inferior to relax the eyelids 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:55.390
 from the bottom, and upper ones which aim to reposition the upper natural palpebral fold and therefore 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.920
 restore the radiance of the look of the younger person. 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 With regard to wrinkles, it is possible to reduce them by different types of injections. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.549
 But it must be natural here too, and there is a time for everything, so you have to 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:23.200
 weigh the indication and then this gesture is complementary to the surgery 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.480
 which we have previously mentioned. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.140
 For the ears, what is embarrassing classically are the ears off. 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.390
 So possible to recompile them by repositioning them, this in order to find harmony at the level 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.479
 of the oval of the face. 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.310
 For the nose, rhinoplasty, intervention that helps reshape the nose allows the 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.100
 time to correct the appearance of the face by refining it, in particular or by repositioning the tip 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.100
 of the nose. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.329
 And especially by changing his profile especially his projection for people who 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.439
 have bumps for example, or who has a nose too hollow and vice versa. 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.911
 This intervention can also be both aesthetic but also bring a 

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:11.560
 functional behavior for people who have nasal breathing problems. 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.680
 We talked about different aspects of max-ido-facial surgery but who are 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.610
 essentially aesthetic aspects and this surgery is not only aesthetic, 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.830
 it is also a surgery trained in functional and reconstructive facial surgery 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.700
 and this surgery can also help correct bone malformations that this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.830
 either on the upper maxillary floor or the mandible in particular.
