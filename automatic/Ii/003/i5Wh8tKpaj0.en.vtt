 then a line is created put 10 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.460
 10.1 the top of the range graphics 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.310
 captivating that incorporates the graffiti that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.549
 they are located in lionel's hometown 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.490
 which is rosary in argentina in fact 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.400
 you see it should resume the graphic of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.720
 these graffiti are orange turquoise 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.619
 with these geometries and the three strips 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.720
 three adidas bands in white almost 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.150
 practically imprinted on the wall 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.630
 as we said turquoise and orange on 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.780
 upper upper in hybrid touch 2.0 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.780
 a very soft synthetic material 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.140
 very light because of course one 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.830
 shoe created by fast players 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.450
 fast offensive that can play either 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.330
 on the outside however in the part 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.700
 offensive of the head to the British 2.0 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:01.680
 material that was seen above 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.490
 upper worked with a weft 3 of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.720
 this 3d texture makes the upper 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 slightly rough is a technology 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.700
 fit dribla and tex that holds the ball 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.500
 attached to the foot in all conditions e 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.070
 then it conditions when wet them that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.180
 from dry 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.720
 3d tends to slip away 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.660
 the water that keep the balloon attached 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.570
 at the foot in very rapid technical gestures 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.670
 let's move on to the tacchetta can 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.030
 see so many datura challenges between sean 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.280
 of adidas triangular package behind the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.860
 four triangles behind two more 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.200
 large and two smaller ones this for 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.730
 sink in the best way in the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.569
 ground to have much more grip and for 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.749
 have a weight distribution 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.840
 best of all on the whole plant of 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:56.700
 front foot of the lamellar seeds ie 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.829
 enough strain in the air 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.959
 tight with these two cleats that 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.689
 tend to be almost horizontal to 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.609
 have a group at the time of 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:07.620
 sprinter then when you go to 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.260
 load on the foot van 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.329
 you will have a better grip on this cleat 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.400
 tura fg as you can see and the apt 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.459
 architecture for hard fields 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.889
 then we'll have on the soccer shop we also have 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.859
 the tit tour asg then for the fields 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.200
 soft and you will also see that ag for 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:28.590
 synthetic fields possibility to insert 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.370
 the ni coach as you know this 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.870
 technology 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.269
 find it on the top of the range this is the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.430
 version 10.2 you see that you can't 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.269
 insert of coach changes the sole changes 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.590
 sole that is turquoise-colored tops 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.419
 you will recognize the turquoise and gods 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.269
 orange cleats that reflect the 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:52.829
 color of the upper and then the version 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:57.109
 instead 10.3 which takes up the sole of the 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:00.629
 10.1 but you see the materials are 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.269
 many do you see the sprint 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.269
 frame taken from the f50 collections 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.400
 these in shell which serves for 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.379
 stabilize the more low heel 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.770
 then traditional normal shells 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.020
 will give you 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.180
 feel less stiff on the heel 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.790
 than usual 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.890
 because you see that it leaves the heel 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.620
 very soft then a tad less than 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.080
 protection but more stability and agility 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.450
 if you don't want to lose all the new ones 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.740
 releases and new militant products
