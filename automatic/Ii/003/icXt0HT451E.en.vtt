00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
before but this helps to kind of keep it

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.720 
before but this helps to kind of keep it
I<00:02:00.170> should<00:02:01.170> pry<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.650> didn't<00:02:01.980> use<00:02:02.100> half<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.610> those

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
I should pry I didn't use half of those

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.500 
I should pry I didn't use half of those
soft<00:02:03.420> plastics<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.110> had<00:02:04.700> before<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.330> it's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
soft plastics that I had before so it's

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.270 
soft plastics that I had before so it's
fine<00:02:06.780> nice<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.230> I<00:02:07.350> usually<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.860> use<00:02:07.920> all

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
fine nice because I usually I use all

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.590 
fine nice because I usually I use all
these<00:02:10.250> will<00:02:11.250> start<00:02:11.550> off<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.910> these<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.450> some

these will start off with these got some

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.440 
these will start off with these got some
nice<00:02:12.720> reaction<00:02:12.990> innovations<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.180> beavers<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
nice reaction innovations to beavers I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.730
