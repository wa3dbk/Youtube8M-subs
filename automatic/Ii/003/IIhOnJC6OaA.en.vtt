you've never played it before then it's

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.700 
you've never played it before then it's
actually<00:00:14.120> very<00:00:14.240> hard<00:00:14.509> time<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:15.170> describe<00:00:15.530> what

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
actually very hard time to describe what

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.870 
actually very hard time to describe what
it<00:00:15.799> is<00:00:15.860> so<00:00:16.009> I'm<00:00:16.099> probably<00:00:16.219> just<00:00:16.550> best<00:00:16.730> off

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
it is so I'm probably just best off

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.700 
it is so I'm probably just best off
showing<00:00:17.119> you<00:00:17.210> really<00:00:20.170> so<00:00:21.170> at<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.380> start

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
showing you really so at the start

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.439 
showing you really so at the start
basically<00:00:22.100> to<00:00:22.369> profile<00:00:22.880> or<00:00:23.090> you<00:00:23.150> compete

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
basically to profile or you compete

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.820 
basically to profile or you compete

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
drill the rankings I've just basically

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.470 
drill the rankings I've just basically
gone<00:00:25.160> an<00:00:25.279> or<00:00:25.400> profile<00:00:25.850> which<00:00:26.029> doesn't<00:00:26.390> have

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
gone an or profile which doesn't have

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.910

everything unlocked on anything like

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.050 
everything unlocked on anything like
that<00:00:28.130> some<00:00:28.369> say<00:00:28.490> I<00:00:28.519> don't<00:00:28.550> like<00:00:28.760> to<00:00:28.880> shop

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060

spoilers<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.689> stuff<00:00:29.929> but<00:00:30.500> from<00:00:31.130> there<00:00:31.310> you

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
spoilers and stuff but from there you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.210 
spoilers and stuff but from there you
choose<00:00:31.460> a<00:00:31.699> character<00:00:31.939> and<00:00:32.890> before<00:00:33.890> I<00:00:33.920> go<00:00:34.129> on

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
choose a character and before I go on

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.979 
choose a character and before I go on
are<00:00:34.400> probably<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.970> best<00:00:35.420> way<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.600> describe<00:00:35.930> it

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
are probably the best way to describe it

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.110 
are probably the best way to describe it
is<00:00:36.199> almost<00:00:36.290> like<00:00:36.559> an<00:00:36.710> arcade<00:00:37.129> action<00:00:37.460> puzzler

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
is almost like an arcade action puzzler

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.729 
is almost like an arcade action puzzler
type<00:00:38.330> thing<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:38.659> anywhere<00:00:39.019> you<00:00:39.379> choose<00:00:39.409> your

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
type thing but anywhere you choose your

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.710 
type thing but anywhere you choose your
character<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.339> v-chip<00:00:40.489> of<00:00:40.699> different<00:00:41.089> skills

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
character the v-chip of different skills

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.079 
character the v-chip of different skills
so<00:00:41.989> this<00:00:42.140> guy's<00:00:42.350> very<00:00:42.620> fast<00:00:42.979> this<00:00:43.519> guy<00:00:43.790> can<00:00:43.970> get

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
so this guy's very fast this guy can get

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.270 
so this guy's very fast this guy can get
hit<00:00:44.299> twice<00:00:44.600> before<00:00:44.870> he<00:00:45.199> dies<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:45.799> the<00:00:45.949> second

hit twice before he dies like the second

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.430 
hit twice before he dies like the second
time<00:00:46.309> kills<00:00:46.699> them<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.269> guy<00:00:47.479> can<00:00:47.750> well<00:00:48.140> this

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
time kills them this guy can well this

dog I suppose and that's not a guide to
ball<00:00:50.600> but<00:00:50.780> but<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.379> dog<00:00:51.589> can<00:00:51.830> climb<00:00:52.040> to<00:00:52.339> bricks

game so definitely plenty to do and the
whole<00:01:34.850> point<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.180> if<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.360> know<00:01:35.450> if<00:01:35.570> later<00:01:35.720> miss

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
whole point is if you know if later miss

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.080 
whole point is if you know if later miss
another<00:01:36.080> game<00:01:36.320> before<00:01:36.500> you've<00:01:37.100> got<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.370> welcome

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
another game before you've got a welcome

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.490 
another game before you've got a welcome
what<00:01:38.180> did<00:01:38.270> I<00:01:38.330> see<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.480> die<00:01:38.780> in<00:01:38.840> seconds<00:01:39.320> but

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
what did I see a die in seconds but

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.410 
what did I see a die in seconds but
they've<00:01:39.680> got<00:01:39.920> done<00:01:40.190> so<00:01:40.400> you've<00:01:40.880> got<00:01:41.090> basically

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
they've got done so you've got basically

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.730 
they've got done so you've got basically
get<00:01:41.600> army<00:01:41.930> I'm<00:01:42.050> on<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.230> right<00:01:42.350> side<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.710> your

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
get army I'm on the right side of your

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.170 
get army I'm on the right side of your
screen<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.550> have<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:43.760> collect<00:01:43.909> air

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
screen and you have to collect air

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.460 
screen and you have to collect air
capsules<00:01:44.690> before<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.080> die<00:01:45.260> obviously

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
capsules before you die obviously

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.080 
capsules before you die obviously
because<00:01:46.159> we<00:01:46.280> run<00:01:46.430> out<00:01:46.550> of<00:01:46.580> air<00:01:46.729> that's<00:01:46.940> it

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
because we run out of air that's it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.520 
because we run out of air that's it
you're<00:01:47.210> dead<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:48.050> whole<00:01:48.170> point<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:48.500> to

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
you're dead and the whole point is to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
you're dead and the whole point is to
literally<00:01:48.979> continue<00:01:49.490> digging<00:01:49.670> down<00:01:50.000> until

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
literally continue digging down until

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.930 
literally continue digging down until
you<00:01:50.540> get<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:51.229> meter<00:01:51.409> box<00:01:51.650> or<00:01:52.100> obviously<00:01:52.820> with

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
you get the meter box or obviously with

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.280 
you get the meter box or obviously with
this<00:01:53.060> one<00:01:53.210> I've<00:01:53.300> got<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.479> get<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.750> 500<00:01:54.170> meter

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
this one I've got to get the 500 meter

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.750 
this one I've got to get the 500 meter
mark<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.770> then<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:54.890> complete<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.310> level<00:01:55.580> it

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
mark and then I complete the level it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.100 
mark and then I complete the level it
tells<00:01:56.150> me<00:01:56.300> how<00:01:56.390> while<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.600> done

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
tells me how while I done

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.910 
tells me how while I done
I<00:01:57.140> get<00:01:57.560> ranked<00:01:57.890> on<00:01:57.979> that<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.460> they're<00:01:59.300> done

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
I get ranked on that and they're done

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.050 
I get ranked on that and they're done
there's<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:00.979> some<00:02:01.460> rules<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.880> digging

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
there's a some rules to digging

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.210 
there's a some rules to digging
basically<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.900> can<00:02:03.049> dig<00:02:03.440> through<00:02:03.650> blocks<00:02:04.010> on

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
basically it can dig through blocks on

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.190 
basically it can dig through blocks on
that<00:02:04.370> you've<00:02:05.060> got<00:02:05.240> these<00:02:05.420> X's<00:02:05.840> over<00:02:05.930> here

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
that you've got these X's over here

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.630 
that you've got these X's over here
which<00:02:06.320> I'll<00:02:06.500> try<00:02:06.710> my<00:02:06.770> best<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.070> actually<00:02:07.400> dig

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
which I'll try my best to actually dig

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.649 
which I'll try my best to actually dig
through<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.299> show<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.539> what

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 
through one just to show you what

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.960 
through one just to show you what
happens<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.440> basically<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.069> X<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:10.549> you<00:02:10.670> dig

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
happens but basically the X if you dig

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.580 
happens but basically the X if you dig
the<00:02:11.150> hell<00:02:11.330> out<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.510> them<00:02:11.750> because<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.260> takes<00:02:12.470> a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
the hell out of them because it takes a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the hell out of them because it takes a
lot<00:02:12.740> of<00:02:12.770> work

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
lot of work

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.930 
lot of work
you<00:02:13.790> lose<00:02:14.270> quite<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.900> bit<00:02:15.170> of<00:02:15.260> oxygen<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:16.160> there

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
you lose quite a bit of oxygen so there

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.000 
you lose quite a bit of oxygen so there
we<00:02:17.090> go<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.270> lost<00:02:17.630> 20%<00:02:17.900> oxygen<00:02:18.260> there<00:02:18.620> just<00:02:18.860> from

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
we go I lost 20% oxygen there just from

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.140 
we go I lost 20% oxygen there just from
digging<00:02:19.280> through<00:02:19.430> there<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.850> want<00:02:20.060> to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
digging through there so you want to

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.820 
digging through there so you want to
avoid<00:02:20.270> them<00:02:20.630> but<00:02:21.110> obviously<00:02:21.230> you<00:02:21.470> can't<00:02:21.680> get

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
avoid them but obviously you can't get

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.770 
avoid them but obviously you can't get
air<00:02:21.980> capsules<00:02:22.460> but<00:02:22.670> even<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.090> still<00:02:23.540> want

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
air capsules but even so you still want

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.290 
air capsules but even so you still want
to<00:02:23.840> avoid<00:02:24.110> them<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:25.730> whole<00:02:25.910> point<00:02:26.090> is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
to avoid them and the whole point is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.150 
to avoid them and the whole point is
with<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.600> different<00:02:27.320> colors<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.710> that<00:02:27.770> when

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
with the different colors and that when

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.980 
with the different colors and that when
the<00:02:28.280> emerge<00:02:28.550> job<00:02:28.790> will<00:02:29.300> disintegrate<00:02:29.660> on

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the emerge job will disintegrate on

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.840 
the emerge job will disintegrate on
themselves<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.130> manage<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.580> for

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
themselves so if you manage to get for

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.150 
themselves so if you manage to get for
them<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.120> fall<00:02:32.330> together<00:02:32.480> or<00:02:32.960> more<00:02:33.260> than<00:02:33.770> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
them to fall together or more than that

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.220 
them to fall together or more than that
block<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:34.520> then<00:02:35.390> gets<00:02:35.630> created<00:02:36.050> basically

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
block that then gets created basically

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.440 
block that then gets created basically
will<00:02:36.620> destroy<00:02:37.130> itself<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.790> while<00:02:38.300> that

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
will destroy itself and while that

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.240 
will destroy itself and while that
sounds<00:02:38.510> helpful<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.590> also<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.040> type<00:02:40.220> of

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
sounds helpful it's also the type of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.530 
sounds helpful it's also the type of
thing<00:02:40.490> that<00:02:40.520> can<00:02:40.760> cause<00:02:40.940> an<00:02:41.060> avalanche<00:02:41.180> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
thing that can cause an avalanche of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.880 
thing that can cause an avalanche of
things<00:02:41.690> above<00:02:41.930> yet<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.290> get<00:02:42.410> your<00:02:42.530> question

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
things above yet and get your question

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.340 
things above yet and get your question
killed<00:02:43.100> so<00:02:43.610> it's<00:02:44.030> equally<00:02:44.600> as<00:02:44.690> dangerous<00:02:44.930> as

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
killed so it's equally as dangerous as

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.220 
killed so it's equally as dangerous as
it<00:02:45.470> is<00:02:45.560> helpful<00:02:45.830> really<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:50.330> here<00:02:50.810> we<00:02:50.930> go<00:02:51.050> then

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
it is helpful really so here we go then

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.510 
it is helpful really so here we go then
at<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> end<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.709> level<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.010> basically

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
at the end of a level just basically

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.760 
at the end of a level just basically
sure<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:52.970> said<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.360> here<00:02:53.660> one<00:02:54.140> UV<00:02:54.380> tonality

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
sure you said it's here one UV tonality

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.430 
sure you said it's here one UV tonality
get<00:02:54.920> ranked<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.310> certain<00:02:55.670> things<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.440> the

those<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.340> I'll<00:03:01.430> be<00:03:01.550> honest<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.880> first

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
those so that I'll be honest the first

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.220

time<00:03:02.270> I've<00:03:02.360> played<00:03:02.390> mr.<00:03:02.780> draw<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:02.989> game<00:03:03.200> I

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
time I've played mr. draw the game I

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.500 
time I've played mr. draw the game I
thought<00:03:03.650> this<00:03:04.280> is<00:03:04.459> terrible<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.090> is<00:03:05.300> so

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
thought this is terrible this is so

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.300 
thought this is terrible this is so
simple<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:05.989> basic<00:03:06.350> I'm<00:03:06.739> not<00:03:06.950> gonna<00:03:07.070> have<00:03:07.220> any

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
simple and basic I'm not gonna have any

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.340 
simple and basic I'm not gonna have any
formulas<00:03:07.700> at<00:03:07.820> all<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:08.120> doubt<00:03:08.840> I'll<00:03:08.989> even<00:03:09.080> play

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
formulas at all I doubt I'll even play

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.650 
formulas at all I doubt I'll even play
it<00:03:09.410> for<00:03:09.590> longer<00:03:09.800> than<00:03:09.860> five<00:03:10.100> minutes<00:03:10.130> about<00:03:11.030> 15

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
it for longer than five minutes about 15

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.300 
it for longer than five minutes about 15
I<00:03:11.810> was<00:03:11.930> lit<00:03:12.140> and<00:03:12.350> when<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.560> realized<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.040> hadn't

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
I was lit and when I realized I hadn't

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.070 
I was lit and when I realized I hadn't
slept<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.910> couldn't<00:03:14.209> stop<00:03:14.390> playing<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.900> and

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
slept and couldn't stop playing it and

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.590 
slept and couldn't stop playing it and
not<00:03:15.200> went<00:03:15.739> through<00:03:15.950> several<00:03:16.280> TS<00:03:16.700> charges<00:03:17.330> then

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
not went through several TS charges then

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.199 
not went through several TS charges then
yeah<00:03:18.440> I<00:03:18.769> realized<00:03:19.250> that<00:03:19.459> it's<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.730> type<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:19.940> game

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
yeah I realized that it's a type of game

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.390 
yeah I realized that it's a type of game
that<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.720> may<00:03:21.049> look<00:03:21.320> be<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> sake<00:03:21.830> book<00:03:22.130> it's

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
that it may look be a sake book it's

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.360 
that it may look be a sake book it's
very<00:03:22.850> fun<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.450> very<00:03:23.540> addictive<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.560> it's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
very fun and very addictive and it's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.130 
very fun and very addictive and it's
just<00:03:25.670> one<00:03:25.820> of<00:03:25.850> those<00:03:26.030> if<00:03:26.269> you<00:03:26.360> if<00:03:26.570> it<00:03:26.720> hooks<00:03:26.930> you

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
just one of those if you if it hooks you

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.600 
just one of those if you if it hooks you
that's<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.739> you'll<00:03:27.920> be<00:03:28.010> hooked<00:03:28.250> for<00:03:28.340> life<00:03:30.610> but

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
that's it you'll be hooked for life but

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.070 
that's it you'll be hooked for life but
there's<00:03:32.000> pretty<00:03:32.209> much<00:03:32.330> nothing<00:03:32.600> really<00:03:32.870> left

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
there's pretty much nothing really left

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.810 
there's pretty much nothing really left
to<00:03:33.260> mention<00:03:33.590> there's<00:03:33.799> different<00:03:34.310> block<00:03:34.489> types

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
to mention there's different block types

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.520 
to mention there's different block types
and<00:03:35.000> that's<00:03:35.090> as<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.570> can<00:03:35.690> see<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.230> stars

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
and that's as you can see that the stars

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.229 
and that's as you can see that the stars
flash<00:03:36.860> and<00:03:37.100> they'll<00:03:37.220> basically<00:03:37.489> disintegrate

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
flash and they'll basically disintegrate

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.729 
flash and they'll basically disintegrate
on<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.420> wall<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.630> you<00:03:38.720> can<00:03:38.870> also<00:03:38.989> get<00:03:39.200> Aldus

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
on the wall and you can also get Aldus

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.620 
on the wall and you can also get Aldus
which<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.549> borders<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.030> can<00:03:41.180> delete<00:03:41.450> them

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
which the borders you can delete them

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.360 
which the borders you can delete them
but<00:03:41.810> if<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:41.959> get<00:03:42.590> all<00:03:42.739> them<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:43.010> fall<00:03:43.220> together

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
but if you get all them to fall together

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.280 
but if you get all them to fall together
than<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.880> want<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.269> sin<00:03:44.510> well<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.110> won't

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
than the want is sin well the won't

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.350 
than the want is sin well the won't
delete<00:03:45.560> themselves<00:03:45.769> like<00:03:46.489> what<00:03:46.760> well<00:03:47.180> for

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
delete themselves like what well for
