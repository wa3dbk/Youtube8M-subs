 is going to be to strengthen our hair is 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.309
 a mask that we are going to apply 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:14.139
 before washing our hair and done with 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.480
 the products that are very economical and 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.130
 that surely we all have at home or 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.210
 If not, then we acquire very 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.650
 easily 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.599
 the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.779
 are honey bee are we going to use the 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.840
 cinnamon powder to see that I put it good 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.520
 it's cinnamon powder and then oil 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.750
 olive 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.340
 Well, what we are going to do is put 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.110
 approximately how little was the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.710
 spoon two tablespoons of this oil 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.710
 two tablespoons 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.739
 two 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.620
 we put olive oil because it is very 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.949
 rich in vitamin e also vitamin that 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.350
 it does not have polyphenols and we see it is a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.840
 food that is very moisturizing very 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.820
 nutritious now let's put 2 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.820
 teaspoons of honey 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.660
 Honey is a natural treatment that 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.120
 obviously it's great to take it 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.450
 but it's also great for our 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.660
 beauty and here we are going to use it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.180
 because it has antiseptic properties 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.630
 anti-inflammatory 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.170
 good nourishing moisturizer also has 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.170
 vitamins 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.899
 and here we give you an agreement of masters of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.689
 a great a great wealth and then 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.780
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.750
 what cinnamon powder is that this 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.020
 what he's going to do to us is a vasodilator 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.350
 we will further boost 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:04.799
 enrichment of this one 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.170
 as I say this formula or this 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.700
 mix as you want to call it good 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.700
 we have to mix this 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 and you will see that we will have more or 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.200
 less a pasta like that 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.970
 this also helps us to help what is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.730
 a jacket on all the hair when 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.129
 I talk about hair loss I do not mean 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.769
 to big alopecia 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.610
 because yesterday jazz lopez or hair falls 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.890
 that we think goes directly 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.220
 linked although they are hormonal issues to 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.560
 issues of food deficiencies 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.329
 so here is not something that 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.489
 is going to help us a lot because there are other 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.379
 but always causes can help 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.480
 stop this is basically going to help us 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.180
 very much in what are the falls 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.519
 seasonal when it's spring 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.040
 When it is autumn, it produces more 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.379
 hair fall and this and harassed this what 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 what it does is nurture what the bulb is 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.769
 hairy give more strength and then the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.590
 hair will leave us much healthier 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.180
 to notice let's go I started to notice already 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.840
 more or less a month that is not putting 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.690
 in a regular manner as it is applied by 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.889
 We apply this with dry hair 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.859
 because I tell them when it sounds is that the 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.580
 variant so then one and a half hours 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.830
 before 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.650
 approximately do you do some 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.530
 divisions in the hair 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 well nothing center that divisions go to 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.379
 hundred separations and in each separation 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.989
 Well, you are putting some of this 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.030
 pill that will be exhibiting here and 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.489
 to cover virtually everything 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.560
 it would be the scalp we will finish 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.409
 expand everything that is this 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.720
 mask we will finish expanding 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.269
 with what is a gentle massage with the 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.069
 fingertips doing good 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:04.219
 messages thus rotating in this way 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.989
 when we do this here, yes, no 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.519
 it's both a treatment for the tips 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.180
 but it is for already I say to you for 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.799
 scalp 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.409
 if I'm going to explain other 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.019
 natural for what they are the subject of 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.150
 dry tips and such and if you want too 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.699
 Now I'm trying a shampoo that 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.690
 I have also made a better turn and 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.330
 is giving me very good results 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.270
 also to fortify and to prevent 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.460
 hair loss and well done this 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.320
 parentheses then nothing after us 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.729
 we wrap the hair so you can use 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.710
 Well, from those towels that sell like this 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.080
 which are microfiber we can use 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.900
 a normal plastic bath cap and 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.570
 current 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.699
 also in aluminum foil any 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.919
 What I do is that this 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.539
 penetrate well after one hour of 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.190
 four and a half hours 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.669
 then we can remove it from the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:56.680
 hair, nothing 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.740
 remove with warm water and then 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.210
 we can proceed to our washing and nothing 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.830
 to the guidelines for this mask 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.280
 they will be to have the most 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.800
 performance for two months twice 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.020
 a week if large winds are the 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.020
 hair then once a week then well 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.970
 once a week and his most 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.130
 times then only twice you go to 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.530
 give the change and then to maintain 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.930
 the effects of this mask is because 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.449
 convenient to apply it once to the 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.090
