00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
don't know if we mentioned it's a 3G and

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.350 
don't know if we mentioned it's a 3G and
the<00:04:37.319> GPS<00:04:37.770> that<00:04:38.039> combo<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.580> interesting<00:04:39.030> and

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
connected to like a 3G data signal right

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.180 
connected to like a 3G data signal right
there's<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.720> GPS<00:04:51.720> functionality<00:04:52.319> that'll

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
there's a GPS functionality that'll

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.430 
there's a GPS functionality that'll
actually<00:04:53.370> let<00:04:53.729> you<00:04:53.849> use<00:04:54.120> this<00:04:54.419> when<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.319> do

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
actually let you use this when you do

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.990 
actually let you use this when you do
have<00:04:55.560> to<00:04:55.590> have<00:04:55.710> a<00:04:55.740> 3G<00:04:56.099> signal<00:04:56.280> but<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.639> locks

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
have to have a 3G signal but you locks

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.279 
have to have a 3G signal but you locks
it<00:04:57.240> in<00:04:57.360> while<00:04:57.539> your<00:04:57.719> right<00:04:57.840> you<00:04:57.960> don't<00:04:58.080> have<00:04:58.139> to

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
it in while your right you don't have to

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.320 
it in while your right you don't have to
be<00:04:58.379> actively<00:04:58.740> pulling<00:04:59.039> down<00:04:59.280> bait<00:04:59.550> okay<00:04:59.849> right

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
be actively pulling down bait okay right

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.029 
be actively pulling down bait okay right
and<00:05:00.479> then<00:05:00.810> in<00:05:01.080> combination<00:05:01.650> with<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.830> latest

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
and then in combination with the latest

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.249 
and then in combination with the latest
version<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.400> maps<00:05:02.729> what<00:05:03.599> you<00:05:03.719> can<00:05:03.900> do<00:05:04.020> is

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
version of maps what you can do is

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.649 
version of maps what you can do is
actually<00:05:04.919> cache<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.729> maps<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.479> you<00:05:06.539> don't

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:06.659 
actually cache the maps so you don't

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.600 
actually cache the maps so you don't
have<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.810> be<00:05:06.900> using<00:05:07.469> an<00:05:07.590> active<00:05:07.740> data<00:05:08.159> signal

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
have to be using an active data signal

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.670 
have to be using an active data signal

know the ability to predefined an area

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.510 
know the ability to predefined an area
maps<00:05:34.199> and<00:05:34.440> go<00:05:34.529> ahead<00:05:34.680> and<00:05:34.830> download<00:05:34.919> that<00:05:35.310> into

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
maps and go ahead and download that into

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.939 
maps and go ahead and download that into
the<00:05:35.669> system<00:05:35.819> okay<00:05:36.360> yep<00:05:36.779> great<00:05:36.990> cool<00:05:37.740> so<00:05:37.919> let's

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
the system okay yep great cool so let's

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:42.649 
the system okay yep great cool so let's
move<00:05:38.279> on<00:05:38.550> to<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:39.060> 21:09<00:05:40.370> right<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:41.610> this<00:05:41.940> cover

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
move on to the 21:09 right so this cover

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:45.110 
move on to the 21:09 right so this cover
because<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.710> use<00:05:43.889> case<00:05:44.130> for<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:44.400> nine<00:05:44.580> inch<00:05:44.819> is

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
because the use case for a nine inch is

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.680 
because the use case for a nine inch is
more<00:05:46.400> oriented<00:05:47.400> towards<00:05:47.819> actually<00:05:48.300> sitting

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
more oriented towards actually sitting

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.510 
more oriented towards actually sitting
there<00:05:48.840> and<00:05:48.930> using<00:05:49.409> it<00:05:49.500> to<00:05:49.590> watch<00:05:49.740> videos<00:05:50.310> and
