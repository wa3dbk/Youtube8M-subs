00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.210
 Hello dear friends with you necrosis 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.980
 and today we'll talk about how 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.759
 still interrupt duel legion 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.360
 commander and I think that for anyone of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.760
 it's no secret that you can escape from 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.519
 duel with the help of the cross dazzle with 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:27.109
 deezer community or using astral 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.380
 astral imprisonment of the second skill 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.250
 devara but that will just save you from 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.469
 Damage dole it will not stop but there is 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.800
 ways that allow 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.160
 just cancel the duel let's see 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.390
 how to do it well firstly if we 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.059
 click on alt and we duel we 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.160
 We learn that the duel will end if 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.199
 participants disperse at a distance of 2 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 thousand units 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.170
 This can be done most easily with 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.030
 hair dryer and vespa we start a duel with me 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 by the way aganim and so the duel will be 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:12.370
 last forever we take and depot them legion 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:18.460
 show on base 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:21.910
 and the length ends here it is possible 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.290
 do the same thing now write 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.810
 refresh duel im stash is not easy 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.490
 drip it somewhere here let's say 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:36.220
 and the duel safely ends but 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.870
 there is one very funny and interesting 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:45.310
 way to stop the duel 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:49.960
 let's take somebody not to go 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:53.470
 same yes again we start dueling and us 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.670
 need a ghoul with an aganim who can 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:02.500
 gobble ally and duel again 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.840
 such friends come to a stop 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.590

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.350
