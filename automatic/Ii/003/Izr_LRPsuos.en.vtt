00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.920
 food processor 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.570

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.860
 accessories and on the food processor 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.509
 we also find three more mixing bowls one 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.630
 of 4 liters 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.369
 one of 2.4 liters and one of 1 liter 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.259
 on the lid we find the big one 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.270
 filling opening here we see the medium for 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.040
 opening and here the small lot opening 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.590
 in the accessory smokes we will have one 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.350
 large cutting knife and an extra mucus is for 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.489
 the small bowl and dough knife this adjustable 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.859
 scrape disk 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.660
 the reversible grating disc the grating disc 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.089
 for hard cheeses and ice cream 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.100
 add the fries and the chicken cubes 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.199
 the cubes will hear a cutting disc 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.260
 8mm grid cubes and a lid 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.760
 including pushing the egg beater 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.420
 and a spatula and you get of course 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.489
 also a manual we like it 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.589
 device fall and look closer then 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.150
 we see here the on and off switch and 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.340
 you can also choose that for the pulse 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.130
 function with this lever you can control the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.230
 set speed which is otherwise unique 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.870
 and very special about the device is that 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.620
 you with this him on the cutting thickness externally 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.950
 can set 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.050
 he also has a metal housing 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.000
 here we see the cord further you see 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.640
 here another silicone ring 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900
 This ensures that he is a perfect 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.190
 lockable by which is very handy if 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.580
 for example you put the hot soup on it 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.580
 prepare 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.400
 Isabelle stands next to me and his goes 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.200
 a number of special features of 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.570
 show the foot processor 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.630
 is right and start with the adjustable 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.930
 drag disk this is cool slide that 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.330
 works in combination with the external thickness 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.870
 control just show you how 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.450
 assembles 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.050
 and how the device works in the first place 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.550
 place the sliding disc in the instance 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.980
 afternoon 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.140
 which will simply connect to the 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.060
 bottom of the bowl and if you are ok then 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.830
 look then you notice by setting 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.980
 of that thickness controller 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:11.099
 that the disk at any position 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.099
 pushed down slightly lower 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.790
 I put the lid back on living 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.130
 I'm going to plan a cucumber now and me 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.130
 use the medium fire opening for this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.750
 the device they fourth in cars 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.150
 and for the force use force one 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.770
 because it is a soft ingredient I go 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.110
 not the full power of the device 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.650
 use 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.650
 here we go 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.160
 and now the cubes or blow up 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.530
 for this on a food processor and 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.700
 we place this first in a large bowl 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.090
 stalk 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.170
 with places like the afternoon boils 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.690
 that cubes 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.370
 distributors through these two openings 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.250
 you have a possibility to be with you 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.290
 fingers to easily attach this child 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.940
 you slide the in the bowl and have to be beautiful 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.700
 click in the holes of the bowl on it 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.640
 and then the plane 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.250
 place in just without on top and you 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.250
 I close it with the lid and me 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.549
 move nicely from left to right 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.940
 the cover must always be over the slide 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:38.440
 sit at the top in it closes 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.320
 device through the laps through the lid and 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.660
 we go primase through the medium filling opening 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.910
 or cut into cubes 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.810
 I put you in front of a cow that goes 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.370
 set up the device in the opening and in 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.120
 how much time did you cut nicely 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.120
 cubes 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:03.239
 you are the remaining blocks 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.069
 remove completely , remove with 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.580
 lid 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:11.459
 you remove the scale and with the help of 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.430
 From the by your child you can get the remaining 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.639
 cubes standing heavenly 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:22.410
 by 10 then now the grater disc for it 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:25.979
 chopping hard cheeses and assembled 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.290
 this disc on the supplied stick this 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.770
 place of the large mixing bowl 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:34.919
 yes the central axis 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.500
 that the nicely fits the lid there 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:41.510
 just in places 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.510
 I use a medium fill opening 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:56.030
 ice cubes move the lever at speed 2 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.289
 since it is a very powerful 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.289
 is president and the city 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.800
 this is the turn for the disk 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.249
 so someone has five through it 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.879
 included step in this place you too 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:19.389
 in the mention so that he was perfect 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.389
 suits 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.710
 put the lid back on the come 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.710
 you use the menin filling opening 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.979
 dispute the potatoes 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.620
 so then on position for an extra force 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.729
 to put 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.729
 and then we put appliances 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.130
 He does know some space on your kitchen counter 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.310
 thanks to the molded construction 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.920
 metal, the food processor is robust 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.720
