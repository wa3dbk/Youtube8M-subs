00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.990 
will see how the game plays there's
three<00:02:30.739> stages<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.640> this

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
three stages so you have the this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.729 
three stages so you have the this
village<00:02:32.420> area<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.900> have<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.140> desert<00:02:33.500> area

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
village area you have the desert area

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.250 
village area you have the desert area
and<00:02:33.920> some<00:02:34.130> sort<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> city<00:02:34.790> nighttime<00:02:35.420> type

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and some sort of city nighttime type

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.449 
and some sort of city nighttime type
stage<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.799> that's<00:02:36.920> actually<00:02:37.160> pretty<00:02:37.280> cool

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
stage and that's actually pretty cool

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.039 
stage and that's actually pretty cool
because<00:02:37.610> games<00:02:37.880> like<00:02:38.000> Jetpack<00:02:38.420> Joyride<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
because games like Jetpack Joyride and

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.240 
because games like Jetpack Joyride and
stuff<00:02:39.200> don't<00:02:39.410> usually<00:02:39.560> op<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.040> at<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.220> just

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
stuff don't usually op it at it's just

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.130 
stuff don't usually op it at it's just
one<00:02:40.519> stage<00:02:40.819> endlessly<00:02:41.360> scrolling<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:41.989> it

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
one stage endlessly scrolling and it

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.050 
one stage endlessly scrolling and it
gets<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.440> stale<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:42.920> old<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.880> game

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
gets really stale and old so this game

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.250 
gets really stale and old so this game
there's<00:02:44.269> actually<00:02:44.660> a<00:02:44.690> different<00:02:44.959> levels<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
there's actually a different levels you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.840 
there's actually a different levels you
can<00:02:45.290> actually<00:02:45.500> reach<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.250> instead<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.760> just

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
can actually reach to instead of just

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.949 
can actually reach to instead of just
trying<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> get<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.299> highest<00:02:47.450> scorer<00:02:47.810> and

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
trying to get the highest scorer and

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.240 
trying to get the highest scorer and
beat<00:02:48.080> your<00:02:48.170> friends<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.769> can<00:02:48.950> be<00:02:49.040> pretty

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
beat your friends it just can be pretty

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.070 
beat your friends it just can be pretty
annoying<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:50.330> then<00:02:50.420> each<00:02:50.540> stage<00:02:50.750> actually

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
annoying and then each stage actually

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.479 
annoying and then each stage actually
had<00:02:51.200> its<00:02:51.319> own<00:02:51.410> boss<00:02:51.590> which<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:52.310> don't<00:02:52.370> think

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
had its own boss which I don't think

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.300 
had its own boss which I don't think
