00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
exfoliating the light stuff like that I

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.500 
exfoliating the light stuff like that I
like<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.310> use<00:03:07.520> a<00:03:07.550> toner<00:03:07.850> this<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.360> one<00:03:08.480> I

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
like to use a toner this is the one I

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.199 
like to use a toner this is the one I
use<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:08.959> see<00:03:09.140> simple<00:03:09.590> facial<00:03:10.580> toner<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:11.060> is

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
use it see simple facial toner this is

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.729 
use it see simple facial toner this is
the<00:03:11.330> only<00:03:11.600> one<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.870> doesn't<00:03:12.080> drop<00:03:12.350> masking

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
the only one that doesn't drop masking

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.350 
the only one that doesn't drop masking
because<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:12.950> find<00:03:13.190> toners<00:03:13.640> can<00:03:13.850> get<00:03:13.970> quite<00:03:14.150> dry

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
because I find toners can get quite dry

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.180 
because I find toners can get quite dry
especially<00:03:14.930> when<00:03:15.320> they<00:03:15.440> have<00:03:15.590> alcohol

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
especially when they have alcohol

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.229 
especially when they have alcohol
because<00:03:16.400> they<00:03:16.550> can<00:03:16.700> make<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.910> faithful

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
because they can make the faithful

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.940 
because they can make the faithful
redder<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.870> definitely<00:03:18.320> try<00:03:18.530> out<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.800> one

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
because it has no alcohol it feels nice

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.300 
because it has no alcohol it feels nice
