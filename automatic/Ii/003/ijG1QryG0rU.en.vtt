00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.469
 in Miami 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.969
 Hi, how about I want to talk to you a bit about 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 the new thing that comes with the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.800
 Scanner updates it shows 4 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.140
 Scanner updates are noticeable 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.380
 four have been free for five years 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.160
 since 2007 it went up the scanner 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.759
 this year 2002 then about 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.850
 the scanners that were bought until July 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.480
 of 2010 approximately the number of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.579
 11,000 series for down already require 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.370
 pay for the scanner updates 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.149
 cj 4 when you buy new comes with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.399
 two years of updates but these 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.469
 scanner have had rather five years 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.620
 these scanners have had five years and in 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.960
 this moment the serial numbers 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.569
 less than 11 thousand or approximately 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.839
 those that were bought before July of 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:06.030
 2010 will require to start paying for 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.790
 the updates the updates 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.510
 they have a very low cost less than 300 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.640
 dollars and that includes everything that comes out 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.700
 for a full year 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.130
 not just an update but all the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 updates that are given or injected 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 click free during that year they will be 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.790
 available for that amount that is going to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.940
 pay at this time are 247 dollars 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.060
 but it's going to be there in the order of 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.080
 of child under 300 dollars then 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.930
 I want to show you a little bit that is going to come 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.450
 on a card of this type that is taken out 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.830
 of the package and this card is going to have a 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.930
 serial number and above all we are going to 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.869
 scrape is going to have a part here where 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.000
 you can scrape and this is the code that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.860
 you have to enter in the website of 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.110
 klimt inyecto 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.580
 to be able to liberate so to speak 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.310
 updates for a year for the cj 4 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.350
 but it is not interesting to enter into that detail 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.200
 because there is a clean inject video that 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.480
 handles the whole procedure basically 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.940
 the objective of collecting the 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 updates is that there is a 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.230
 growth much greater than there was 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.360
 so far then they are 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.910
 hiring more programmers is 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.790
 hiring people from development and the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170
 idea is that this same recovery of 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.000
 money that is achieved through the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.209
 updates will be reinvested from 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.310
 way you're going to feel an increase 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.280
 remarkable in fact coverage is already 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.730
 are opening development centers for 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:45.239
 software in costa rica we are already 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.880
 taking information from vehicles 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.570
 to add it in cj 4 we have 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.370
 authorized to do development of so 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.370
 less what is information here and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.890
 then there will be growth and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.830
 scanner regionalization fine 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.040
 interesting we could even be in 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.200
 the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.939
 ability to go to a country of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.159
 Central America to do development 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.500
 specific for vehicles that have not 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.750
 connection then basically those are 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.640
 good news the good news is that 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 let's grow faster in coverage 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.290
 that there is a strong investment in 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.319
 programmers and the price of 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.019
 good updates has been for is by 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.730
 for five years for free and the price is 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.599
 lowest price you can get in 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.760
 the market so that to update the 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:38.269
 cj 4 to have to have this 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.360
 available in the next 12 months of 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.630
 updates thank you very much 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.630
 do not
