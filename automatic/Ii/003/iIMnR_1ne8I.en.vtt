00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.079
 the hunger 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.480
 the result is always the same leftovers 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.059
 food on the plate 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.059
 the portion a little smaller there to 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.129
 enjoy taking better advantage of this 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
 mall in the west area of ​​são paulo 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.710

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.140
 Christian went to feed a vegetable garden 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.199
 I'm glad to know that you're going to give 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.000
 a destination a destination for that there 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 do not be trash can 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.920
 the route is on the roof of the mall a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.170
 contrast to the marginal one pine 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.869
 the main roads of são paulo by 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.119
 where thousands of vehicles pass 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.740
 the days 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.080
 four hundred pounds of food that would 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.009
 for daily trash are collected 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.820
 in this sixth here goes all rice sauce 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.299
 meat now throw away but the purpose 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.060
 good all that lot of rice beans 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.930
 hamburger will stop in the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 mall 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 here if together with the remains of leaves 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.500
 of the trees around the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.780
 all this seems to me to be 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.720
 concrete mixer used in a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.630
 works where they are mixed with accelerator 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.180
 of composting that generates the feed 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.149
 composting has always made the whole world 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.780
 held her for six months eight months four 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.000
 months 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.799
 today with this technology developed 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.329
 Can you do this in three days? 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.790
 This is very fast. 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.980
 the compost accelerator also has the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.410
 inhibit the bad smell of the defendants 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.540
 of food is giving treatment age is 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.390
 an organic residue if you noticed 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.310
 When did you go up there with Tanya? 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.800
 when he won the treat and has a 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.080
 smell but gazidis to be momentary is 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 behaving when you are here with 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.000
 much more waste or, I suppose, 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.490
 the product already smells more 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.680
 characteristic that already came with garden 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.970
 the fertilizer is tapping with at least one 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 hour after it's ready it goes to a bucket 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.070
 here on the roof that organic compost 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.800
 of life plants the seedlings of vegetables 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.840
 are thus planted straight into the bucket 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.150
 I work for miriam who left 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.150
 cleaning service to take care of the garden 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:59.880
 I work the pacha plantar watering caring 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.300
 which gives from the garden after harvesting have already been 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.880
 planted pepper lettuce herbs and until 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.110
 Eggplant that Miriam knew how to enjoy 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.960
 very well 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.400
 I already had pepper already eggplant already 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.250
 made lasagna here to receive the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.860
 very tasty shopping mall staff 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.250
 products are donated to employees 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.400
 the idea is to turn the 9,500 meters 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.800
 slab on a live roof every employee 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.170
 who identifies a project it can 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 look for us but make a guided visit 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.420
 and he makes his own crop and leads to 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.420
 House 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.740
 residents of the village of Madalena in the 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.350
 west zone of são paulo also has 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.030
 fresh product close to home 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.430
 a year ago they maintain a collective garden 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.870
 the first in a square in the capital 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.370
 paulista 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.170
 this vegetable garden is not a vegetable garden 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.810
 supplying it mainly serves to 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.710
 for environmental education in practice 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.870
 to live, do not resume this contact with 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.150
 plants with food origin and 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.950
 nutritional education also because 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.590
 people today, especially the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.750
 Children are too far away to go out. 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.480
 away from natural foods 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.180
 the idea came from three people today 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.420
 the whole help community always has to 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.580
 have someone here to charge to give 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.320
 a look at her are happy they 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.470
 need more at all 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:27.000
 are more than 50 species of plants and 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.760
 basil oregano parsley mint 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 Madalena has the salad almost ready 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.290

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.640

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:46.750
 I know who cares how we care and thinks 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:51.340
 that the organic does not have poison does not have 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.720
 is nothing that will give a problem in the health of 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.150
 of my son's people 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.850

 became fashionable all over the world with 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.290
 many people have implemented the 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.510
 own food 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.910
