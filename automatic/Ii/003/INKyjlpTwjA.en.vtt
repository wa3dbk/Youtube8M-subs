00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.459
 because it's hard and I knew 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.759
 always somehow I want to go there 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.039
 I want to play 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.289
 I am extremely excited that I have 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.430
 Nowhere else can you find destillerie 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.430
 it is something very special 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.110
 leipzig north debris field for 40 years 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.100
 is not really what happened and 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.100
 so the whole city looked quite 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.750
 under dripped real condensation 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.280
 from the ceiling so really would have 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.850
 always a layer of water in these 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.040
 all stuff so you just go 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.040
 what printed or from a microphone 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.040
 taken the last place 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.260
 I was at the fogger and there 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.150
 given full substance 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:23.060
 your jaw last year native as a teenager 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.060
 had and you give the flush for reprimands 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.570
 suddenly someone came and wanted you 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.380
 Take it away it's all about it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 all or nothing 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.130
 either tell gamer there and and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.509
 move something or it will be easy 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.750
 Sang- and soundless in nothing 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.750
 disappear 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.229
 But what often feels that right 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.229
 do not let us down 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.400
 and I like morton before 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.610
 danced table is rather little 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.020
 that is, the addresses must serve as 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.710
 and then of course it was the thing 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.710
 you come in 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 the load lives Palatinate keep pool of 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.690
 many crazy creative minds is 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.980
 you just have to understand that many 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.900
 get the best noticed 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.730
 I've tried to quit often 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.200
 or wanted more often 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.599
 stop because I have mine too 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.930
 job 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.930
 it does not work either 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.190
 why should we now sign for 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.190
 any investors 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.629
 at 50 50 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.629
 that works
