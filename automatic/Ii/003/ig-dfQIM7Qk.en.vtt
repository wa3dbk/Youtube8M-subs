00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
from the jet stream with a blast of

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.830 
from the jet stream with a blast of
arctic<00:01:43.560> air<00:01:44.009> from<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.369> north<00:01:44.459> three<00:01:45.390> elements

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
arctic air from the north three elements

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.209 
arctic air from the north three elements
colliding<00:01:46.409> over<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.709> country's<00:01:47.069> most

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
colliding over the country's most

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.270 
colliding over the country's most
populated<00:01:48.000> corridor<00:01:48.539> and<00:01:48.770> this<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.920> exactly

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
populated corridor and this is exactly

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
populated corridor and this is exactly
what<00:01:50.640> steers<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.119> storm<00:01:51.420> system<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:51.869> right

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
what steers that storm system now right

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.229 
what steers that storm system now right
now<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.469> idea<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> sandy<00:01:53.640> will<00:01:53.789> continue

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:54.239 
now the idea is that sandy will continue

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.940 
now the idea is that sandy will continue
to<00:01:54.360> weaken<00:01:54.659> as<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.840> moves<00:01:55.140> up<00:01:55.349> the<00:01:55.379> Atlantic

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
to weaken as it moves up the Atlantic

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
to weaken as it moves up the Atlantic
system<00:01:56.310> seaboard<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.239> this<00:01:57.450> front<00:01:57.780> has<00:01:57.989> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
system seaboard but this front has a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.990 
system seaboard but this front has a
tendency<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.469> draw<00:01:58.860> systems<00:01:59.369> toward<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.789> any

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
tendency to draw systems toward it any

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.179 
tendency to draw systems toward it any
cold<00:02:00.420> front<00:02:00.689> kind<00:02:00.929> of<00:02:01.079> does<00:02:01.289> so<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> looks<00:02:02.129> like

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
cold front kind of does so it looks like

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.550 
cold front kind of does so it looks like
this<00:02:02.459> system<00:02:02.819> will<00:02:02.969> get<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.539> far<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.379> try

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
this system will get so far and then try

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.289 
this system will get so far and then try
to<00:02:04.619> make<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> little<00:02:05.039> hook<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.429> that<00:02:06.030> hook<00:02:06.179> will

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
to make a little hook in that hook will

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.520 
to make a little hook in that hook will
be<00:02:06.420> anywhere<00:02:06.750> from<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.989> Delmarva<00:02:07.409> Peninsula

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
be anywhere from the Delmarva Peninsula

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
be anywhere from the Delmarva Peninsula
in<00:02:08.009> toward<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.310> New<00:02:08.429> York<00:02:08.640> long<00:02:08.819> long<00:02:09.209> island

in toward the New York long long island
area<00:02:09.780> right<00:02:10.319> there<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.619> we<00:02:10.709> believe<00:02:11.069> this

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
area right there that we believe this

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280 
area right there that we believe this
storm<00:02:11.549> system<00:02:11.700> will<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.299> a<00:02:12.329> hybrid<00:02:12.629> storm<00:02:13.140> by

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
storm system will be a hybrid storm by

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.050 
storm system will be a hybrid storm by
the<00:02:13.379> time<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.709> moves<00:02:13.829> there<00:02:14.129> and<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.670> forecast

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the time it moves there and the forecast

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.369 
the time it moves there and the forecast
models<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.510> kind<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.720> agreeing<00:02:16.079> with<00:02:16.319> that

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
models are kind of agreeing with that

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.020 
models are kind of agreeing with that
you<00:02:16.650> remember<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.099> couple<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.489> days<00:02:17.609> ago<00:02:17.760> they
