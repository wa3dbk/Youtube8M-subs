00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
crazy surgery to repair the problem is

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.670 
crazy surgery to repair the problem is
that<00:02:31.250> because<00:02:31.879> he<00:02:32.180> had<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.480> surgery<00:02:32.750> he

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
that because he had that surgery he

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.260 
that because he had that surgery he
probably<00:02:34.040> had<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> lot<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.580> adhesions

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
probably had a lot of adhesions

probably had a lot of adhesions
going<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:35.720> his<00:02:35.840> stomach<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.980> good<00:02:37.220> thing

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
going on in his stomach the good thing

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.450 
going on in his stomach the good thing
is<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.910> this<00:02:38.660> type<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.960> surgery<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.860> not

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
is that this type of surgery is not

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.910 
is that this type of surgery is not
anything<00:02:40.940> big<00:02:41.570> or<00:02:41.780> major<00:02:42.020> it's<00:02:42.380> like<00:02:42.620> they

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
anything big or major it's like they

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.530 
anything big or major it's like they
make<00:02:43.190> two<00:02:43.400> little<00:02:43.700> incisions<00:02:44.180> around<00:02:44.300> the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
make two little incisions around the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.900 
make two little incisions around the
stomach<00:02:44.780> or<00:02:45.080> they<00:02:45.740> would<00:02:45.890> shove<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> camera<00:02:46.460> in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
stomach or they would shove a camera in

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.410 
stomach or they would shove a camera in
to<00:02:47.630> inspect<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.410> area<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.040> then<00:02:49.640> remove<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
to inspect the area and then remove the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.140 
to inspect the area and then remove the
the<00:02:51.050> connection<00:02:51.740> so<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.520> good<00:02:52.640> thing<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:52.880> he's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the connection so the good thing is he's

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.300 
the connection so the good thing is he's
out<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.600> hospital<00:02:53.630> I<00:02:54.380> just<00:02:54.800> hope<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.010> is

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
out of the hospital I just hope that is

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.550 
out of the hospital I just hope that is
not<00:02:55.340> something<00:02:55.730> that's<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.180> be<00:02:56.330> a

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
not something that's going to be a

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.860 
not something that's going to be a
consistent<00:02:57.560> problem<00:02:58.070> with<00:02:58.400> him<00:02:58.640> and<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:59.600> hope

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
consistent problem with him and I hope

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.960 
consistent problem with him and I hope
that<00:03:00.050> he<00:03:00.230> gets<00:03:00.350> better<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:00.980> gets<00:03:01.430> well<00:03:01.640> soon

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
that he gets better and gets well soon

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
in order and pretty much it felt like he

difference it was probably the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.810 
difference it was probably the

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:39.870 
didn't have a lot of experience behind

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.900 
didn't have a lot of experience behind
but<00:07:40.530> we<00:07:40.650> just<00:07:40.800> don't<00:07:41.010> know<00:07:41.220> yet<00:07:41.250> at<00:07:41.670> this

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 
but we just don't know yet at this

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.210
