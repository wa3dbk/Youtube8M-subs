into it
yeah<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.440> mean<00:02:14.680> last<00:02:14.830> time<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.160> was<00:02:15.280> at<00:02:15.370> LCS<00:02:15.730> I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
yeah I mean last time I was at LCS I

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.610 
yeah I mean last time I was at LCS I
feel<00:02:16.390> like<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> little<00:02:16.750> bit<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:16.989> my<00:02:17.049> confidence

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
feel like a little bit of my confidence

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440 
feel like a little bit of my confidence
was<00:02:17.769> shattered<00:02:18.099> so<00:02:18.610> again<00:02:18.879> it's<00:02:19.030> kind<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
was shattered so again it's kind of the

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.580 
was shattered so again it's kind of the
whole<00:02:19.480> confidence<00:02:19.989> thing<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.290> me<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.500> think

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
whole confidence thing for me I think

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.440 
whole confidence thing for me I think
I'm<00:02:20.890> much<00:02:21.549> more<00:02:21.730> decisive

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
I'm much more decisive

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.509 
I'm much more decisive
you<00:02:22.629> know<00:02:22.750> I'm<00:02:23.200> decisive<00:02:23.799> comment<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.370> what<00:02:24.489> I

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519

you know I'm decisive comment of what I
do<00:02:24.610> so<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.120> think<00:02:25.269> that's<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.569> big<00:02:25.720> part<00:02:26.019> of<00:02:26.080> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
do so I think that's a big part of it
