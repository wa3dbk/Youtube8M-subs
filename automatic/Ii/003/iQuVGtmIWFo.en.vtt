00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
instance they try and get in the right

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.710 
instance they try and get in the right
position<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.789> they<00:01:41.910> can<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.450> release

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
of the ball and that red light it's very

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.100 
of the ball and that red light it's very
hard<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.940> almost<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.330> be<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.660> perfect

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
hard you almost have to be in a perfect

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.100 
hard you almost have to be in a perfect
spot<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:46.979> very<00:01:47.700> often<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.300> official<00:01:48.690> listens

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
spot so very often the official listens

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
spot so very often the official listens
for<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> buzzer<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.979> best<00:01:50.190> way<00:01:50.399> where

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
for the buzzer that's the best way where

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.249 
for the buzzer that's the best way where
you<00:01:51.030> can<00:01:51.210> watch<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.600> release<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.080> ball

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you can watch the release of the ball

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.960 
you can watch the release of the ball
and<00:01:52.500> hear<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> you're<00:01:53.369> not<00:01:53.460> watching<00:01:53.850> two

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
and hear it you're not watching two

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.210 
and hear it you're not watching two
things<00:01:54.210> simultaneously<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.350> listening<00:01:56.130> on

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
things simultaneously and listening on

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.190 
things simultaneously and listening on
the<00:01:56.310> buzzer<00:01:56.580> in<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.690> appeared<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the buzzer in that one it appeared that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.540 
the buzzer in that one it appeared that
the<00:01:58.380> ball<00:01:58.560> may<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.860> still<00:01:59.070> been<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.369> same

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
the ball may have still been in the same

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.730 
the ball may have still been in the same
you<00:01:59.700> rely<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.330> buzzer<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.050> so<00:02:01.320> hard

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
you rely on the buzzer that is so hard

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.340 
you rely on the buzzer that is so hard
