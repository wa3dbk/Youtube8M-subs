00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
in Japanese but I was able to figure

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.029

most about through trial and error and

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
most about through trial and error and
since<00:02:11.400> I'm<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:12.090> smart<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.780> should<00:02:13.110> be

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
since I'm not that smart you should be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.290 
since I'm not that smart you should be
able<00:02:13.380> to<00:02:13.530> figure<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.010> your<00:02:14.130> own<00:02:14.280> or<00:02:14.580> I

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
able to figure it out on your own or I

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.250 
able to figure it out on your own or I
could<00:02:15.540> just<00:02:15.569> tell<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:15.840> how<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.990> play<00:02:16.080> right

now<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.470> guess<00:02:16.790> kumoi<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.210> puzzle<00:02:18.569> game<00:02:18.600> with

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
now I guess kumoi is a puzzle game with

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.570 
now I guess kumoi is a puzzle game with
a<00:02:18.900> really<00:02:19.200> unique<00:02:19.350> hook<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.280> play<00:02:20.430> as<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
a really unique hook you play as a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.190 
a really unique hook you play as a

each<00:02:24.180> board<00:02:25.080> gives<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.440> time<00:02:25.680> limit<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
each board gives you a time limit and a

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
individual stage apparently my copy was

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.720 
individual stage apparently my copy was
owned<00:03:29.600> by<00:03:29.660> someone<00:03:29.959> named<00:03:30.230> samee<00:03:30.650> been<00:03:31.610> named

doesn't<00:03:32.000> sound<00:03:32.300> Japanese<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.080> who<00:03:33.470> owned<00:03:33.650> it

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
doesn't sound Japanese so who owned it

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.490 
doesn't sound Japanese so who owned it
before<00:03:33.860> me<00:03:34.220> who<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:34.970> samee<00:03:35.420> d<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:36.140> question

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
before me who is samee d this question

00:03:36.500 --> 00:04:05.970 
before me who is samee d this question
will<00:03:36.680> haunt<00:03:36.920> me<00:03:37.070> until<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.459> end<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.760> my<00:03:37.880> days

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.380 

so<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.130> I<00:04:07.220> said<00:04:07.280> I<00:04:07.490> just<00:04:07.610> got<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.030> game<00:04:08.240> this

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
so like I said I just got this game this

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.150 
so like I said I just got this game this
past<00:04:08.569> weekend<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.170> kind<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:09.739> haven't<00:04:09.920> been
