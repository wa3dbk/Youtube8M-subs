00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
running a Super Bowl this year here's my

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.970 
running a Super Bowl this year here's my
prediction<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> Bears<00:00:49.230> were<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
prediction if the Bears were just the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.069 
prediction if the Bears were just the
regular<00:00:50.309> Bears<00:00:50.550> versus<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> Patriots<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
regular Bears versus the Patriots it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
regular Bears versus the Patriots it
would<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.940> 385<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.210> 17<00:00:54.750> all<00:00:55.289> right<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.489> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
would be 385 to 17 all right and if it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.189 
would be 385 to 17 all right and if it
was<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.760> coach<00:00:57.210> Ditka<00:00:57.719> playing<00:00:58.020> the
