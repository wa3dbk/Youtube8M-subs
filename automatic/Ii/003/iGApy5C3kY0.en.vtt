00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 fast we are rich guys we are 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:20.189
 absolutely rich, take the elixir 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:22.619
 good archers hi all guys are 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.570
 the Akitas and today we are here in the sixth 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.880
 episode of the clash of clans series 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.189
 from the beginning as you will surely already have 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 noted the town hall and level 5 is 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.469
 finished then we can build 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.840
 really lots of buildings and let's get started 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.480
 immediately building a mine is a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 we put them here now put 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.820
 the buildings just completely random 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.460
 then we will calmly rebuild a beautiful village 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.559
 now what we improve army we have 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 unlocked a new camp that does 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.050
 really convenient because it really is 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.480
 so much stuff 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.020
 so we put it here then what we have 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 the spell factory that it costs 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.270
 200 thousand leases madonna guys so much 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.930
 stuff 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.060
 a cannon and a tower of the archer and 25 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.490
 wall and then look at some beautiful 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.650
 to the sorcerer actor and others 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.930
 various bills we build everything I would say of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.070
 build the cannon immediately and see it 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.350
 here we build that where we also build 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.780
 a bit of walls always at random like this 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.570
 meanwhile we all put them together 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.280
 ok since we're getting better 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.049
 also therefore we bring it all at least to 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.990
 level 2 then we calmly see 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.119
 carry from level 4 and then all 100 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.729
 walls we have will be brought to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.500
 level 5 or that is the floor plan that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.180
 we improve everything is so much alone 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 a thousand so we don't even spend 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.310
 too much gold this part 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.470
 surely it will be speeded up because there 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.390
 I will get too bored because I am who 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.240
 such I can't talk to accomplish 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.729
 a complete speech we have 300 best 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.950
 minimum there are only ghinis ok ok ok 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.369
 ok you get this first color fan 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.680
 all and the walls only at level 2 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.240
 we collect the money from the mines of 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.700
 extractors that I had forgotten to 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.310
 collect we are rich guys we are 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.810
 absolutely rich improves the municipalities 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.810
 level 5 requires reward 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.590
 we build the archer's tower very much 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.540
 I would say well 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.030
 meanwhile we always do other walls than 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.830
 they don't do the important thing is to keep themselves 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.110
 180,000 so then we will have the money 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.660
 needed to build the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.200
 then the sorcerer's tower 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.030
 come on 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520
 let's still enhance a lot of walls 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.020
 sachet and zack and the jacket type underwent 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.730
 another account I'm making the walls 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.980
 level 8 neo I do two a day 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.370
 really these were good times here 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.680
 when you made a wall with 5 thousand from 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.430
 what kind of goodies we almost have 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.340
 finished 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.430
 yes give us we can make them all perfect 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.800
 boys have finished very well 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.300
 guys and then we'll definitely have to 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.180
 enhance the laboratory so we can 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.340
 make all the level 3 troops that beautiful 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.290
 but let's say now I build i 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.090
 last two buildings then I will make a cut e 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.410
 I'll see you when I'm a little longer 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:13.370
 next 26 25 24 by the mason works up 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:16.400
 fast 15 14 13 12 21 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.760
 we can now the new camp 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 can contain as many as 100 troops we build 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.710
 then our sorcerer's tower 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.340
 that costs well 180,000 gold we put it 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.050
 type here 31 bam and we also make to do 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.700
 this goddamned factory 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.280
 spells that last episode 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.980
 I'd say confused with the camp 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.580
 sorry but occasionally mistakes there 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.660
 they are 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.030
 3 2 1 I recommend eh if you don't have it 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.980
 given the episode number 5 go immediately 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.380
 to see it you will find the link below in 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.270
 description but we guys see you 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.490
 very soon because I am now 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.860
 dissolve roi you will find a village 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.390
 let's say a little later , I can 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.880
 time travel 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.920
 here we are, the village did 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.780
 many progress we have finished the 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.460
 the wizard's tower we finished the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.490
 spell factory then ho 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.950
 brought all the walls to level 4 and ne 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.810
 I did even a little level 5 then 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.770
 ok or enhanced the extractors at 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.000
 mines 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.489
 otherwise nothing creative 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.220
 give us level 3 fee level 4 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.079
 perfect I would say let's start looking 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.480
 someone to attack we will go for a 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.610
 attack with barbarian archers e 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.050
 today's goal will be to seek for 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.290
 get to a thousand and one trophies since 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.490
 we are at 988 we can do it guys 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.320
 I believe in you 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.600
 obviously if we also find some 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.940
 bad resource does not therefore we try 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.100
 let's try let's try this 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.810
 interesting guys maybe if there is 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.400
 It can also do was play 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.990
 50 percent 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.090
 so let's put all the archers 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.280
 around so they destroy all the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.040
 or even to save buildings 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.310
 the barbarians ok now it only touches us 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.800
 wait and hope obviously fast 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.050
 we can already 10 percent of our 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.720
 archers continue to throw arrows i 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.080
 our barbarians continue to take SMA 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.669
 spa given these damned defenses calmly 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.270
 we will be able to do all that 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.010
 we want 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.320
 Meanwhile, however, we are taking ourselves 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.410
 really many beautiful resources that 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.690
 surely we will need 38 per 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.940
 a hundred yes yes yes we can do it a lot 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.860
 very comfortably so we can also 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.590
 wasting troops for a moment 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.240
 more hurry and then let's see if we can 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.520
 also take some elixir da co ha 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.950
 so let's put the clan troops in that 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.500
 they should be perfect giants 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.990
 guys if we can take it too 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.360
 the elixir very well we put behind the 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.190
 archers you're done 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.620
 we have now made a star from a 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.960
 piece we are already at 63 percent then 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.490
 this really a lot of stuff 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.370
 attack take the elixir good archers 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.590
 well well well well it says still in life 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.380
 no one back home a good booty 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.750
 I would even say a great booty 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.790
 Now what do we guys do? 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.870
 let's enhance some other walls say 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.479
 at least 45 so so and so 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.669
 then we put the cannon to level 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.940
 5 so we bring it like all the 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.280
 others ok 321 go and we also put the 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.560
 perfect archer tower 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.630
 I would say that at this point, given that we are in 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.330
 dance we can also do the 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.669
 mortar at level 3 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:33.110
 which surely will be stronger and stronger 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:35.270
 so 321 go we put it out of the 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.219
 walls inside we put the tower of the 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.199
 sorcerer and then still within the 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.400
 next video I will definitely make a 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.860
 different village 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.479
 look how nice the sorcerer level 1 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.370
 here the guys for this video to everything 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:47.990
 I hope he liked me 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.330
 know if you like the videos made 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.550
 so therefore not all at once but 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.560
 perhaps cut into several parts so vi 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.539
 I show more progress not only 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.180
 video personally seems to me a thing 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:01.069
