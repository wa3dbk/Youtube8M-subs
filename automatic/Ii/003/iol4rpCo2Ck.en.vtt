00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
actually reading an article that there's

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.250 
actually reading an article that there's
no<00:05:01.940> such<00:05:02.150> thing<00:05:02.330> as<00:05:02.360> time<00:05:02.660> it's<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.900> completely

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
no such thing as time it's a completely

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.710 
no such thing as time it's a completely
made-up<00:05:03.410> concept<00:05:04.090> so<00:05:05.090> technically<00:05:05.480> we're

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
made-up concept so technically we're

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.210 
made-up concept so technically we're
never<00:05:05.840> gonna<00:05:06.020> age<00:05:06.290> if<00:05:06.620> there<00:05:06.770> is<00:05:06.920> no<00:05:07.070> such

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
never gonna age if there is no such

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.430 
never gonna age if there is no such
thing<00:05:07.400> as<00:05:07.460> time<00:05:07.640> it's<00:05:07.970> human-made<00:05:08.440> absolutely

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
thing as time it's human-made absolutely

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.060 
thing as time it's human-made absolutely
don't<00:05:09.590> guess<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.770> means<00:05:10.010> we<00:05:10.100> never<00:05:10.250> die

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
don't guess it means we never die

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.480 
don't guess it means we never die
perhaps<00:05:13.070> we<00:05:13.220> just<00:05:13.250> expire<00:05:13.760> I<00:05:14.060> don't<00:05:14.390> know<00:05:15.490> I'm

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490
