pounds we use it for scooters and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.490 
pounds we use it for scooters and
motocross<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> reason<00:00:31.079> is<00:00:31.230> isn't

motocross the reason is isn't
recommended<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.369> street<00:00:32.879> bikes<00:00:33.120> it's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
recommended for street bikes it's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.410 
recommended for street bikes it's
because<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.350> short<00:00:34.649> five-foot<00:00:35.280> ramp<00:00:35.519> as

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
because of the short five-foot ramp as

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
because of the short five-foot ramp as
street<00:00:36.780> bikes<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.320> enough<00:00:37.530> ground

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
street bikes don't have enough ground

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.399 
street bikes don't have enough ground
clearance<00:00:38.070> so<00:00:38.629> mainly<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:39.839> scooters<00:00:40.199> and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:40.409 
clearance so mainly for scooters and

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.470 
clearance so mainly for scooters and
motocross<00:00:40.909> so<00:00:41.909> I'm<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.269> going<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
motocross so I'm just going to

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.689 
motocross so I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:42.659> some<00:00:43.110> features<00:00:43.470> of<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.650> carrier

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
demonstrate some features of the carrier

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.930 
demonstrate some features of the carrier
they<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:46.070> adjustable<00:00:47.070> pins<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.790> your

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
they have adjustable pins for your

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.840 
they have adjustable pins for your
wheels<00:00:48.210> in<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.949> situation<00:00:50.159> with

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
wheels in this in this situation with

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.000 
wheels in this in this situation with
the<00:00:50.940> scooter<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.659> took<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> smaller<00:00:52.710> wheels

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the scooter I took the smaller wheels

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
the scooter I took the smaller wheels
I'm<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> pull<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.359> one<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> pins

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
I'm going to pull out one of the pins

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.970 
I'm going to pull out one of the pins
here<00:00:57.079> basically<00:00:58.079> you'd<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.679> line<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
here basically you'd want to line up the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.240 
here basically you'd want to line up the
wheels<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> gap<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.679> the<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
wheels to to the the gap in the in the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
wheels to to the the gap in the in the
carrier<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> make<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.239> drops<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.780> with

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
carrier to make sure it drops in with

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
carrier to make sure it drops in with
scooters<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:05.850> weight<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
scooters they have more weight in the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
scooters they have more weight in the
backend<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.110> them<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.679> you<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> do

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
backend of them so what you want to do

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
backend of them so what you want to do
is<00:01:08.250> bring<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> back<00:01:08.789> end<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.179> bit<00:01:09.330> over

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is bring the back end a little bit over

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.779 
is bring the back end a little bit over
Center<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.800> balance<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.429> weight<00:01:11.550> on<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
Center so you balance the weight on the

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.969 
Center so you balance the weight on the
carrier<00:01:12.149> a<00:01:12.390> motocross<00:01:13.170> bikes<00:01:13.500> pretty<00:01:13.740> much

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
carrier a motocross bikes pretty much

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.560 
carrier a motocross bikes pretty much
evenly<00:01:14.310> distributed<00:01:14.940> where<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.179> can<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
evenly distributed where you can put it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.930 
evenly distributed where you can put it
right<00:01:15.690> dead<00:01:16.020> center<00:01:16.310> center<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> carrier

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
right dead center center on the carrier

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.910 
right dead center center on the carrier
track<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.470> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
track so what I'm going to do is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
demonstrate here me actually loading it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.609 
demonstrate here me actually loading it

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
to do is remove the loading ramp

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.139 
to do is remove the loading ramp
it's<00:01:30.509> got<00:01:30.690> wing<00:01:30.899> nuts<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.380> it

actually<00:01:41.380> connects<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.100> carrier<00:01:42.460> track

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.639 

drops<00:01:46.570> in<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.810> hole<00:01:49.140> next<00:01:50.140> thing<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.439> want<00:01:50.619> to

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
hooked up to the the tie-down hooks here

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.639 
hooked up to the the tie-down hooks here
so<00:01:58.119> when<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.299> drip<00:01:58.569> when<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:58.840> roll<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.079> kick

so when you drip when you roll the kick
scooter<00:02:00.039> up<00:02:00.280> onto<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.929> carrier<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:03.219> can<00:02:03.250> tie

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
scooter up onto the carrier you can tie

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:15.440 
scooter up onto the carrier you can tie
it<00:02:03.610> down<00:02:03.759> with<00:02:03.819> with<00:02:04.210> one<00:02:04.420> person

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.089 

so<00:02:15.959> if<00:02:16.110> you're<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> shorter<00:02:16.620> person<00:02:16.800> you're

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
so if you're a shorter person you're

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.290 
so if you're a shorter person you're
probably<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.520> want<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:17.940> helper

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
probably going to want to have a helper
