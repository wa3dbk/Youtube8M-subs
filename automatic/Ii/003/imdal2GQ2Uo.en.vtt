00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
is we essentially brought heat from the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.700 
is we essentially brought heat from the
side<00:00:22.210> that<00:00:22.240> looks<00:00:22.840> like<00:00:23.019> it's<00:00:23.199> least<00:00:23.560> likely

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
side that looks like it's least likely

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.529 
side that looks like it's least likely
to<00:00:24.130> bring<00:00:24.310> Heat<00:00:24.609> and<00:00:24.759> we're<00:00:24.970> only<00:00:25.060> sending

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
defensive scheme or play would be

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.750 
defensive scheme or play would be
effective<00:02:38.930> without<00:02:39.140> its<00:02:39.680> man<00:02:40.549> or<00:02:40.730> zone

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
effective without its man or zone

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.209

linebacker up crash right play around

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.240 
linebacker up crash right play around
with<00:02:56.599> these<00:02:56.810> players<00:02:57.079> doesn't<00:02:57.680> matter

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.129 

doesn't<00:03:01.250> matter<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:02.230> he<00:03:03.230> comes<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:05.780> exact

same way so now you have the same look

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.679 
same way so now you have the same look
two<00:03:11.930> different<00:03:12.290> plays<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:13.299> you<00:03:14.299> have<00:03:14.419> heat

off of both end edges and you're only
sending<00:03:18.349> four<00:03:18.799> guys<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.790> keep<00:03:20.449> that<00:03:20.599> in<00:03:20.659> mind
