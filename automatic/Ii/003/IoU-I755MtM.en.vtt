00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
which we are dealing with and I would

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.680 
which we are dealing with and I would
guess<00:02:20.120> by<00:02:20.710> the<00:02:21.710> amount<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.130> mold<00:02:22.420> in<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
guess by the amount of mold in the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.480 
guess by the amount of mold in the
