00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.180
 capital construction in Ukraine 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.040
 dictates builders need 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.200
 application of new accelerating 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.480
 construction technology at the stage 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.799
 interior decoration 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.859
 floor production has always been 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.949
 very time consuming and lengthy process 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:25.080
 self-leveling canal fast way 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.939
 getting the perfect gender based on 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.230
 floor evenly applied 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:34.820

 or heating pipes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.190
 moisture absorbing backfill should their 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:49.469
 cover the next stage around

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.850
 load sharing 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.530
 during further work so that the moisture does not 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.830
 hit the walls isolate them 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.890

 construction stapler 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.479
 but 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.270
 because 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.110
 now when the floor is prepared he 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.700
 covered with paper underlying but 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.300

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.240
 each sheet overlaps on 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.240
 another sheet by 10 centimeters 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.430
 bases for a bulk floor 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.430
 prepared 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.130
 for the next job level 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.130
 we expose beacons 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:42.230
 now we will prepare a solution of a bulk floor 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:48.349

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.340
 How to determine the readiness of the solution by 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.440
 turnover criteria 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.769
 spot diameter at section 1 is whole 3 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.959
 tenths of a liter of the solution is 45 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.340

 material consumption per centimeter 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.700
 floor thickness is approximately equal to 19 kilograms 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.620
 per square meter 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.030

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.010
 processing mixture 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.269
 about 60 minutes it is applied all over 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.209
 areas according to the exposed lighthouses 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.010
 brush the solution evenly 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.349
 the bubbles formed are distributed 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:47.140
 air out the height of the self-leveling floor 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.769
 35-40 millimeters to walk on such a floor 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.180
 it is possible to load in 24 hours 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:57.190
 allowed after three days 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.639
 ideal floor surface is achieved 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.760
 due to physical flow property 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.970

 knauf self-leveling floors represent 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.220
 a dry mix based on gypsum with 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.950
 necessary supplements and after 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.920
 water mixing serve for the device 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.109

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.890
 and the fill is generally carried out 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.590
 by machine 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.590
 the finished floor has high 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.300
 consumer properties significantly 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.570

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.920
 intended for cooking and 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.070
 machine fillings making them 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.100
 high-performance device while 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.260
 account for fast cure and capability

 almost immediately walk across the flooded 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.260
 layer 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.650
 makes their use profitable and 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.650
 promising
