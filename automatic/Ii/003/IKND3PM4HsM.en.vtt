the shades and you can always experiment
with<00:01:54.520> smoky<00:01:55.180> eyes<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:55.750> if<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.930> want<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.170> go

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
with smoky eyes so if you want to go

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.470 
with smoky eyes so if you want to go
which<00:01:56.440> is<00:01:56.530> basic<00:01:56.980> with<00:01:57.160> one<00:01:57.370> color<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:58.240> makes

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
which is basic with one color it makes

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.060 
which is basic with one color it makes
more<00:01:58.720> sense<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:59.050> buy<00:01:59.260> a<00:01:59.290> quad<00:01:59.650> it's<00:01:59.890> much

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
more sense to buy a quad it's much

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.830 
more sense to buy a quad it's much
cheaper<00:02:00.100> that<00:02:00.520> way<00:02:00.700> true<00:02:01.270> it's<00:02:01.600> far<00:02:01.810> more

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
cheaper that way true it's far more

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.260 
cheaper that way true it's far more
economical<00:02:02.470> so<00:02:03.190> I<00:02:03.250> take<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.550> generous<00:02:04.000> amount

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
economical so I take a generous amount

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
economical so I take a generous amount
on<00:02:04.510> my<00:02:04.840> flat<00:02:05.260> brush<00:02:06.210> very<00:02:07.210> very<00:02:07.450> important<00:02:07.960> to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
skin why is that we'll let me keep

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.000 
skin why is that we'll let me keep
patching<00:02:13.720> if<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.990> don't<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.410> will<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.890> will

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
patching if you don't it will it will

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.220 
patching if you don't it will it will
add<00:02:15.220> excess<00:02:15.760> product<00:02:16.209> it<00:02:16.360> will<00:02:16.450> make<00:02:16.930> it<00:02:17.080> more

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
add excess product it will make it more

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.330 
product on your eye so as you can see
what<00:02:56.590> I'm<00:02:56.709> doing<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.340> I'm<00:02:58.050> not<00:02:59.050> brushing<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
what I'm doing is I'm not brushing the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.370 
what I'm doing is I'm not brushing the
product<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.180> eyes<00:03:01.300> on<00:03:01.630> your<00:03:01.870> eye<00:03:01.900> asking

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
product on the eyes on your eye asking

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.310 
product on the eyes on your eye asking
it<00:03:02.500> I'm<00:03:02.709> patting<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.370> lightly<00:03:03.640> okay<00:03:04.480> gently

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
it I'm patting it lightly okay gently

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.259 
it I'm patting it lightly okay gently
because<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.950> will<00:03:06.160> deposit<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.790> product

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
because that will deposit the product

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.539 
because that will deposit the product
the<00:03:07.780> minute<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.140> start<00:03:08.410> doing<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.920> mm-hmm

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
the minute you start doing this mm-hmm

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.970 
the minute you start doing this mm-hmm
it<00:03:09.700> will<00:03:09.910> get<00:03:10.060> rid<00:03:10.239> of<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.480> product<00:03:10.810> okay<00:03:11.500> all

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
it will get rid of the product okay all

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.840 
it will get rid of the product okay all
right<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.180> idea<00:03:13.209> is<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:14.190> layer<00:03:15.190> as<00:03:15.580> much

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
right so the idea is to layer as much

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.350 
right so the idea is to layer as much
product<00:03:16.239> as<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.600> possibly<00:03:17.019> can<00:03:17.440> mm-hmm

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
product as you possibly can mm-hmm

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.440 
product as you possibly can mm-hmm
on<00:03:19.930> your<00:03:20.170> eyes<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.340> I'm<00:03:21.400> not<00:03:21.580> going<00:03:21.850> above<00:03:22.240> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
on your eyes so I'm not going above the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.180 
on your eyes so I'm not going above the
eye<00:03:22.480> socket<00:03:23.110> I'm<00:03:23.260> just<00:03:23.470> going<00:03:23.770> in<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.160> eye

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
eye socket I'm just going in the eye

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.520 
eye socket I'm just going in the eye
socket<00:03:24.700> area<00:03:24.880> here<00:03:25.300> just<00:03:25.810> until<00:03:26.170> her<00:03:26.260> crease

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
socket area here just until her crease

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.800 
socket area here just until her crease
right

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
right

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.000 
right
so<00:03:28.810> basically<00:03:29.230> when<00:03:29.470> you're<00:03:29.620> working<00:03:29.980> with

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
so basically when you're working with

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.850 
so basically when you're working with
eyeshadows<00:03:30.820> go<00:03:31.420> from<00:03:31.780> your<00:03:31.990> lash<00:03:32.230> line<00:03:32.260> to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
eyeshadows go from your lash line to

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.860 
eyeshadows go from your lash line to
your<00:03:33.040> crease<00:03:33.280> don't<00:03:33.730> go<00:03:33.910> about<00:03:34.210> don't<00:03:34.690> go

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
your crease don't go about don't go

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.050 
your crease don't go about don't go
below<00:03:35.200> if<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.890> happen<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.250> get<00:03:36.460> any<00:03:36.700> product
