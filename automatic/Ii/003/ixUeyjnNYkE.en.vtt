you holding on to the edges of the
aluminum<00:02:26.260> foil<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.130> gonna<00:02:27.250> be<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> lot

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
aluminum foil and it's gonna be a lot

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.400 
aluminum foil and it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.330> cut<00:02:28.540> out<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.720> coffin<00:02:28.930> shapes<00:02:29.260> and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
get them get them free in this case what

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.450 
get them get them free in this case what
I<00:02:33.070> ended<00:02:33.310> up<00:02:33.400> having<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.910> do<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.620> cut<00:02:35.620> away<00:02:35.770> some

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
I ended up having to do is cut away some

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.220 
I ended up having to do is cut away some
of<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.700> edge<00:02:36.910> pieces<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.870> I<00:02:37.930> could<00:02:38.080> get<00:02:38.170> a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
of the edge pieces so that I could get a

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.190 
of the edge pieces so that I could get a
spatula<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:39.160> there<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:40.120> go<00:02:40.240> underneath<00:02:40.870> and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
spatula in there to go underneath and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.490 
spatula in there to go underneath and
lift<00:02:41.830> up<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.400> coffin<00:02:42.670> shapes<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:44.380> was

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
lift up the coffin shapes and it was

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.870 
lift up the coffin shapes and it was
difficult<00:02:44.710> because<00:02:45.040> they<00:02:45.220> wanted<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.640> break

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
difficult because they wanted to break

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.870 
difficult because they wanted to break
on<00:02:46.150> me<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:47.230> edges<00:02:47.620> weren't<00:02:47.920> weren't<00:02:48.700> that

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
on me and the edges weren't weren't that

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.530 
on me and the edges weren't weren't that
clean<00:02:49.510> looking<00:02:50.160> but<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.430> took<00:02:51.490> the<00:02:51.970> pieces<00:02:52.360> out

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
clean looking but I took the pieces out

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.150 
clean looking but I took the pieces out
and<00:02:52.570> they<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.020> kind<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.260> patted<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:53.800> edges

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
and they just kind of patted this edges

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.760 
and they just kind of patted this edges
down<00:02:54.400> so<00:02:54.760> they<00:02:54.880> worked<00:02:55.060> out<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.390> okay

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
down so they worked out to be okay

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.650 
down so they worked out to be okay
towards<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.640> end<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.910> realized<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.510> could

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
towards the end I realized that I could

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.080 
towards the end I realized that I could
just<00:02:58.780> put<00:02:58.990> the<00:02:59.110> cookie<00:02:59.350> cutter<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.800> then<00:03:00.700> they

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
just put the cookie cutter in then they

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.350 
just put the cookie cutter in then they
remove<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.720> edge<00:03:01.810> pieces<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.530> then<00:03:03.360> remove

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
remove the edge pieces and then remove

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.840 
remove the edge pieces and then remove
the<00:03:04.840> coffin<00:03:05.410> piece<00:03:05.620> with<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.890> spatula<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.730> it

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
the coffin piece with a spatula and it

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.480

just cut the corner off a little bit and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.810 
just cut the corner off a little bit and
then<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.050> use<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:12.070> squeeze

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
little bit in the mold and then you just

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.350 
little bit in the mold and then you just
give<00:04:23.200> them<00:04:23.350> all<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.650> tap<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.790> causes<00:04:25.090> the

out<00:04:57.169> of<00:04:57.349> the<00:04:57.439> molds<00:04:57.889> fairly<00:04:58.400> well<00:04:58.580> either<00:04:58.909> by

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
out of the molds fairly well either by

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.450 
out of the molds fairly well either by
just<00:04:59.300> tapping<00:04:59.479> it<00:04:59.840> or<00:05:00.349> just<00:05:00.710> by<00:05:00.800> flexing<00:05:01.340> the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
mold when they come out of the mold they

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.439 
mold when they come out of the mold they
should<00:05:06.919> be<00:05:07.039> nice<00:05:07.250> and<00:05:07.580> shiny<00:05:07.819> and<00:05:08.120> that's<00:05:08.270> how

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
should be nice and shiny and that's how

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.790 
should be nice and shiny and that's how
you<00:05:08.509> know<00:05:08.719> if<00:05:08.840> you<00:05:08.960> let<00:05:09.110> them<00:05:09.259> chill<00:05:09.500> long

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
you know if you let them chill long

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.309 
you know if you let them chill long
enough<00:05:10.159> and<00:05:10.789> there<00:05:11.659> are<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:12.020> completed

and the outline in red frosting and then

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.390 
and the outline in red frosting and then
I<00:05:26.240> just<00:05:26.449> used<00:05:26.719> parts<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.229> the<00:05:27.379> skeleton<00:05:27.620> to

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
I just used parts of the skeleton to

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.230 
I just used parts of the skeleton to
decorating<00:05:28.969> the<00:05:29.120> skull<00:05:29.509> and<00:05:30.009> the<00:05:31.120> couple<00:05:32.120> of

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
decorating the skull and the couple of

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.680 
decorating the skull and the couple of
the<00:05:32.449> pieces<00:05:32.870> of<00:05:33.020> bone<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:34.039> make<00:05:34.069> a<00:05:34.690> little

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
the pieces of bone to make a little

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.129 
the pieces of bone to make a little
skull<00:05:35.900> and<00:05:36.050> crossbones<00:05:37.569> that's<00:05:38.569> pretty<00:05:38.870> cute

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
skull and crossbones that's pretty cute

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.510 
skull and crossbones that's pretty cute
so<00:05:40.900> that's<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.110> plain<00:05:42.349> one<00:05:42.680> without<00:05:42.949> frosting

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
so that's the plain one without frosting

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.420 
so that's the plain one without frosting
which<00:05:43.639> is<00:05:43.759> icing<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:45.050> I'm<00:05:46.039> going<00:05:46.189> to<00:05:46.250> show<00:05:46.370> you

a few pictures of the skull and

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.680 
a few pictures of the skull and
crossbones<00:05:48.129> one<00:05:49.129> that<00:05:49.250> I<00:05:49.310> used<00:05:49.580> this<00:05:50.330> one<00:05:50.539> was

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
crossbones one that I used this one was

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.390 
crossbones one that I used this one was
my<00:05:50.810> favorite<00:05:51.259> I<00:05:51.379> think<00:05:51.590> this<00:05:51.710> is<00:05:51.830> quite<00:05:51.979> simple

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
my favorite I think this is quite simple

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.430 
my favorite I think this is quite simple
but<00:05:52.669> quite<00:05:52.819> effective<00:05:53.029> and<00:05:53.569> the<00:05:54.020> third<00:05:54.229> one

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
but quite effective and the third one

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.869 
but quite effective and the third one
what<00:05:54.590> I<00:05:54.620> did<00:05:54.860> was<00:05:55.099> and<00:05:55.279> this<00:05:55.310> is<00:05:55.400> my<00:05:55.639> initial

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:55.879 
what I did was and this is my initial

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.610 
what I did was and this is my initial
intention<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.599> whole<00:05:56.779> time<00:05:56.990> when<00:05:57.229> I<00:05:57.259> made

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
intention the whole time when I made

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.550 
intention the whole time when I made
these<00:05:57.860> as<00:05:58.430> I<00:05:58.610> hollowed<00:05:59.029> out<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.840> coffin<00:06:00.110> shape

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
these as I hollowed out the coffin shape

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.680 
these as I hollowed out the coffin shape
by<00:06:00.889> cutting<00:06:01.310> out<00:06:01.400> some<00:06:01.580> of<00:06:01.729> the<00:06:01.789> brownie<00:06:02.029> build

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
by cutting out some of the brownie build

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.779 
by cutting out some of the brownie build
it<00:06:02.870> with<00:06:02.990> chocolate<00:06:03.229> frosting<00:06:03.919> and<00:06:04.099> I<00:06:04.490> wanted

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789 
it with chocolate frosting and I wanted

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:06.850 
it with chocolate frosting and I wanted
to<00:06:04.849> put<00:06:05.089> the<00:06:05.270> skeleton<00:06:05.539> and<00:06:06.139> set<00:06:06.500> it<00:06:06.650> inside

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
to put the skeleton and set it inside

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.269 
to put the skeleton and set it inside
the<00:06:07.310> coffin<00:06:07.580> but<00:06:07.969> as<00:06:08.569> it<00:06:08.690> turns<00:06:08.900> out<00:06:09.139> my<00:06:09.650> coffin

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.279 
the coffin but as it turns out my coffin

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.649 
the coffin but as it turns out my coffin
shape<00:06:10.460> that<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:10.639> made<00:06:10.849> was<00:06:10.969> a<00:06:11.029> little<00:06:11.360> bit<00:06:11.479> too

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
shape that I made was a little bit too

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.990 
shape that I made was a little bit too
small<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.319> my<00:06:12.710> cup<00:06:12.979> in<00:06:13.219> the<00:06:13.400> skeleton<00:06:13.849> was<00:06:13.940> a

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
small and my cup in the skeleton was a

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.879 
small and my cup in the skeleton was a
little<00:06:14.210> bit<00:06:14.330> too<00:06:14.479> big<00:06:14.690> so<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.379> was<00:06:15.500> kind<00:06:15.800> of

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
little bit too big so it was kind of

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.740 
little bit too big so it was kind of
hanging<00:06:16.099> over<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.550> sides<00:06:16.789> but<00:06:17.330> he<00:06:17.449> was<00:06:17.569> still

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
hanging over the sides but he was still

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.699 
hanging over the sides but he was still
cute<00:06:18.020> so<00:06:18.740> why<00:06:19.039> don't<00:06:19.190> you<00:06:19.250> give<00:06:19.400> him<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.520> try
