 really very interesting goals 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.880
 or that of creating the pick in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.609
 iron is to create blocks 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560
 diamond an iron block will be 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.109
 certainly another block is still missing 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.039
 to complete the goal or that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.320
 of crepe hoeness 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.150
 I remember now carbon not good

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.199
 let's go and collect a moment 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.239

 how do you always back up 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.530
 then I call down the block of coal 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.780
 perfect was we will have completed 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 officially it really is all 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.170
 goals of the three perfect blocks 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000
 then one is written on the page 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
 facebook sent me a picture 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.490
 really interesting of his map 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.290
 of the grid cell 's happened to me 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 ask yourself to do this map 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.939
 however I sent a lot of writing 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.250
 beautiful indeed made me see his 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 world on this map and my brother is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.509
 a very interesting thing or has 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 used these squares that are there 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.720
 I get messages at home I forget 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.939
 always to put air mobility 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.250
 however he used these squares 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.140
 that there are almost was one of this ea ha 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.399
 covered the hole 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.899
 maybe we also do that there 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.729
 let me see if you don't understand well 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.770
 what I'm saying like that 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.090
 practically in this way now but not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.219
 we have a block and enough 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.170
 we will use many big hawks and different ones 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.670
 random projects is that we too 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.619
 I thank this episode very much 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.450
 that I sent this screen to us too a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.250
 this point we're going to do a farm 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.720
 I do n't know if it was in the goals to create a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.759
 form but 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.649
 I think so anyway but we do anyway 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.190
 we are going to do anyway because you like it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.530
 as an idea 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.840
 in practice he used every cuadrado 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.540
 circulating to make a freezing farm 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.270
 what to make of the sugar cane 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.790
 make it just the right stuff like that 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.090
 since we have this gesture anyway 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.030
 of carrots of cactus potatoes e 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.510
 let's say all the pensions we can 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.830
 do 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.720
 in the meantime we can stuff that much not 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.990
 I need to practically nothing even 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.800
 iron maybe so we make diamonds 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.930
 right armor for perfect protection 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.200
 kraft double strings I soundly 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.170
 very happy but no since was then not 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.450
 we can no longer make ourselves mature but come on 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.230
 perfect we wo n't have the bodice that 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.850
 shit 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.740
 however my panel immediately watered 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.330
 we still have none here 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.880
 water or say its really put 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.380
 very bad if Ligurian where we don't have the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.760
 source gave him here it is 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.790
 perfect 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.230
 now we're going to put the water here 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.800
 we also need perfect earth 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.330
 that we have not we are badly put there 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.560
 tender I have to escape from here if not 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.519
 feed John can never 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.170
 grow so it's good hopefully the 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.030
 let's go back over these 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.709
 plantations and so I think that 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.209
 we will complete another goal not me 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.580
 I remember if this was the goal 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.140
 stuff but we do it anyway 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.910
 same because I like it like I said 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.350
 this idea of ​​this pharma theirs 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.380
 we make nobel generates we do in the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.820
 especially of those who sent me the channels one 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.000
 we don't have enough stuff like that 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.250
 earth we make perfect infinite water 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.260
 where they fear an hour 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.989
 the last perfect block here had done 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.519
 the first farm of this series 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.110
 well it really isn't a bargain yet but 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.269
 effective because we still lack the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.739
 hoe and then we can say that we have 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.260
 made a farm 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.530
 now I make an iron hoe because 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.940
 I can I am strong 11 everything 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.730
 perfect soul take ours 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.530
 carrots that are in the head 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.480
 it is she then we can say that just one 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.459
 beautiful pharma we start silla Caroti 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.280
 sila brought by damiano we all have 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.620
 occupied spaces the right 4 to have arrived 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.330
 date maybe even made this right 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.780
 Rome 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.549
 I am convinced perfect ok now I would say of 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.150
 plant these saplings there are 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.640
 here because here the gest will never grow 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.960
 the saplings so I would say resign and 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.820
 it also comes to clean all the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.040
 territory because the stuff gives me 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.740
 even the pumpkins are annoying 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.300
 immediately we put several of them from 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.130
 the less they don't bother us anymore or not 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.920
 got to do were perfect we put the 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.190
 here now we think of this tree which 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.020
 feel of four blocks that 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.700
 only here but then will grow all 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.040
 but also four other troubles 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.500
 blocks let's put this birch here 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.350
 what destroyed that of the birch 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.510
 we alternate a little but will never grow here 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.370
 near the bed well we put the same 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.410
 is the last perfect here was theoretically 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.630
 they should grow and very slowly 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.580
 but they should grow when we put 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.470
 another we remove suzuka we already had 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.450
 done a lot of cleaning here in the 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.800
 our world 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.990
 ok let's go to sleep the houses already done 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.940
 night and then I think to close this one here 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.430
 episode my already made a goal 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.380
 15 I'm happy as I said I'm not 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.120
 convinced that it is a goal said by 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.180
 but you still seem to me a goal 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.730
 so the goal which will be this 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.440
 I was sorry you remember scraps for 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.570
 writings to always leave a like 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:34.390
 under this series under the other series 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.390
 to those not forthcoming videos for sure
