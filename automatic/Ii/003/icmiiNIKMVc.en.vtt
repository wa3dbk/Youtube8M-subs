explosion<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.510> that's<00:00:10.260> what<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.620> seeing

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
explosion and that's what we're seeing

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.950 
explosion and that's what we're seeing
all<00:00:10.950> across<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.429> world<00:00:11.580> an<00:00:12.330> animal<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.840> I've

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
all across the world an animal that I've

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.480 
all across the world an animal that I've
studied<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.440> nearly<00:00:13.620> 20<00:00:13.980> years<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.370> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
studied for nearly 20 years is the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.019 
studied for nearly 20 years is the
Humboldt<00:00:14.790> squid<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.500> they<00:00:16.500> are<00:00:17.029> incredibly

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
Humboldt squid and they are incredibly

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.679 
Humboldt squid and they are incredibly
fast<00:00:18.590> reproducing<00:00:19.590> animals<00:00:22.970> what<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.090> find<00:00:24.420> is

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
fast reproducing animals what we find is

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
fast reproducing animals what we find is
that<00:00:24.750> they're<00:00:25.170> wiping<00:00:25.470> out<00:00:25.619> all<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.830> other

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that they're wiping out all the other

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.300 
that they're wiping out all the other
fish<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.000> eat<00:00:27.170> salmon<00:00:28.310> perch

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
fish that we like to eat salmon perch

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.070 
fish that we like to eat salmon perch
all<00:00:29.820> these<00:00:30.119> other<00:00:30.300> populations<00:00:30.929> are

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
all these other populations are

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
all these other populations are
declining<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.619> direct<00:00:31.920> correlation<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.610> the

declining in direct correlation to the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.020 
declining in direct correlation to the
increase<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> population<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.050> squid<00:00:35.030> that's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
increase the population of squid that's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:46.439 
increase the population of squid that's
a<00:00:36.149> very<00:00:36.360> scary<00:00:36.450> fact

tiger sharks used to envelop pretty much
the<00:00:48.550> entire<00:00:48.820> globe<00:00:49.390> but<00:00:49.690> in<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.870> lot<00:00:50.019> of<00:00:50.050> places

the entire globe but in a lot of places

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.290 
the entire globe but in a lot of places
they're<00:00:50.679> extinct<00:00:51.129> from<00:00:51.280> shark<00:00:51.760> finning<00:00:51.969> and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
they're extinct from shark finning and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.849 
they're extinct from shark finning and
overfishing<00:00:52.780> but<00:00:53.350> here<00:00:53.559> in<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.739> Bahamas

overfishing but here in the Bahamas

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.830 
overfishing but here in the Bahamas
there's<00:00:54.489> a<00:00:54.579> great<00:00:54.940> population<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.839> sharks

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.130 

I<00:01:04.850> look<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:05.970> sharks<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.540> people<00:01:06.870> look<00:01:07.050> at

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
I look at sharks the way people look at

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:38.040 
I look at sharks the way people look at
the<00:01:07.260> family<00:01:07.590> dog

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.810 

right<00:01:39.050> after<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.500> tiger<00:01:39.770> shark<00:01:40.040> explored<00:01:40.520> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
right after the tiger shark explored the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.760 
right after the tiger shark explored the
GoPro<00:01:41.180> camera<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:41.780> then<00:01:42.020> spit<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.440> back<00:01:42.560> out

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
GoPro camera and then spit it back out

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.220 
GoPro camera and then spit it back out
we<00:01:43.520> were<00:01:43.670> starting<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.060> talk<00:01:44.300> about<00:01:44.570> if<00:01:45.050> we

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.230 
we were starting to talk about if we

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.950 
we were starting to talk about if we
wanted<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.560> let<00:01:45.710> this<00:01:45.830> information<00:01:46.040> out<00:01:46.640> and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
wanted to let this information out and

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.000 
wanted to let this information out and
we<00:01:47.960> were<00:01:48.080> thinking<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.470> people<00:01:48.830> are<00:01:48.890> gonna

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
we were thinking that people are gonna

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.500 
we were thinking that people are gonna
think<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.370> looks<00:01:49.550> like<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.820> shark<00:01:50.090> was<00:01:50.270> out

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
think it looks like the shark was out

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.940 
think it looks like the shark was out
there<00:01:50.630> trying<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:50.990> mindlessly<00:01:51.440> bite<00:01:51.680> stuff

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
there trying to mindlessly bite stuff

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.190 
there trying to mindlessly bite stuff
well<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.250> certainly<00:01:52.610> wasn't<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.810> was<00:01:53.960> trying

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
well it certainly wasn't it was trying

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.390 
well it certainly wasn't it was trying
to<00:01:54.260> get<00:01:54.410> to<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.620> food<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.980> was<00:01:55.070> right<00:01:55.220> there

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
to get to the food that was right there

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.830 
to get to the food that was right there
in<00:01:55.430> front<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.700> me<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.060> it<00:01:56.300> saw<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.630> little

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
in front of me and it saw this little

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.450 
in front of me and it saw this little
camera<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.380> potentially<00:01:57.890> something<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.310> eat

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
camera is potentially something to eat

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.969 
camera is potentially something to eat
and<00:01:58.870> they<00:01:59.870> test<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> world<00:02:00.410> with<00:02:00.620> their<00:02:00.770> teeth

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and they test the world with their teeth

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.880 
and they test the world with their teeth
so<00:02:01.880> they<00:02:02.120> don't<00:02:02.300> have<00:02:02.450> hands<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:03.770> the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
so they don't have hands so it's the

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.530 
so they don't have hands so it's the
same<00:02:04.070> as<00:02:04.220> a<00:02:04.250> child<00:02:04.580> everything<00:02:04.940> has<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.360> go<00:02:05.479> to

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
same as a child everything has to go to

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.290 
same as a child everything has to go to
the<00:02:05.690> mouth<00:02:05.870> but<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.560> no<00:02:06.830> way<00:02:07.070> was<00:02:07.400> this<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.880> shark

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the mouth but in no way was this a shark

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.150 
the mouth but in no way was this a shark
attack<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.050> no<00:02:09.200> place<00:02:09.470> was<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.770> really<00:02:10.070> in

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
attack and in no place was I really in

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.320 
attack and in no place was I really in
any<00:02:10.250> danger<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:16.160> reality<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.790> this<00:02:17.030> between

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
any danger the reality is this between

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.680 
any danger the reality is this between
73<00:02:17.990> million<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:18.700> 150<00:02:19.700> million<00:02:20.060> sharks<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.660> year

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
73 million and 150 million sharks a year

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.320 
73 million and 150 million sharks a year
are<00:02:21.080> killed<00:02:21.230> by<00:02:21.440> people<00:02:21.760> but<00:02:22.760> less<00:02:22.940> than<00:02:22.970> five

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
are killed by people but less than five

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.150 
are killed by people but less than five
people<00:02:23.720> die<00:02:23.870> from<00:02:24.050> shark<00:02:24.350> attacks<00:02:24.680> every<00:02:24.950> year

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
people die from shark attacks every year

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.410 
people die from shark attacks every year
so<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.970> real<00:02:26.180> monster<00:02:26.660> it's<00:02:27.200> us
