00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
worst-case scenario the really good

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.150 
worst-case scenario the really good
thing<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.510> Chelsea<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.230> season<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.980> I

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
thing about Chelsea this season is I

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.799 
thing about Chelsea this season is I
think<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.790> people<00:00:42.059> may<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.390> agree<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.660> me

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
think I'm people may not agree with me

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.540 
think I'm people may not agree with me
but<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.079> think<00:00:43.320> chassis<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> best

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
but I think chassis is one of the best

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.490 
but I think chassis is one of the best
squads<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> league<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.230> best

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
squads in the league if not the best

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
squads in the league if not the best
squad<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:47.550> opinion<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.360> best

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
squad in my opinion we have the best

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.490 
squad in my opinion we have the best
midfield<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:51.000> I

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
midfield I think that is you know I

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.959 
midfield I think that is you know I
don't<00:00:52.500> think<00:00:52.649> anyone<00:00:53.100> could<00:00:53.219> argue<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.820> fact

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
don't think anyone could argue that fact

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.209 
don't think anyone could argue that fact
verse<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.079> win<00:00:55.289> we<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> best

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
verse I think we win we have the best

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.639 
verse I think we win we have the best
midfield<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.270> actual<00:00:57.629> league<00:00:57.840> based<00:00:58.440> off

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
midfield in the actual league based off

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.520 
midfield in the actual league based off
our<00:00:58.800> tens<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.910> know<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.300> hazard<00:01:00.780> Oscar

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
our tens you know the hazard Oscar

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.780 
our tens you know the hazard Oscar
matter<00:01:02.090> Schurrle<00:01:03.350> William<00:01:04.350> now<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.250> don't

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
matter Schurrle William now so I don't

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.250 
matter Schurrle William now so I don't
think<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.720> were<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
think I don't think that if we were to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.649 
think I don't think that if we were to
you<00:01:07.979> know<00:01:08.010> loose<00:01:08.400> hazards<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.240> also<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you know loose hazards and also for a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.820 
you know loose hazards and also for a
game<00:01:09.840> or<00:01:09.869> two<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.200> don't<00:01:10.350> really<00:01:10.530> think<00:01:10.619> it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
game or two I don't really think it's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
game or two I don't really think it's
gonna<00:01:10.920> affect<00:01:11.159> us<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.549> big<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
gonna affect us that big I think the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
gonna affect us that big I think the
only<00:01:12.659> way<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.229> could<00:01:13.470> actually<00:01:13.590> help<00:01:13.860> us<00:01:14.040> more

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
only way it could actually help us more

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
only way it could actually help us more
than<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.939> hurt<00:01:15.060> us<00:01:15.210> because<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.780> means

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
than actually hurt us because that means

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.679 
than actually hurt us because that means

striker and hopefully Mourinho realizes
that<00:03:44.959> because<00:03:45.410> no<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.310> i<00:03:46.790> was<00:03:47.480> on<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.720> bandwagon

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
that because no I i was on the bandwagon

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.629 
that because no I i was on the bandwagon
at<00:03:48.590> one<00:03:48.709> point<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:48.980> was<00:03:49.099> like<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.310> know<00:03:49.340> what<00:03:49.609> I

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
at one point I was like you know what I

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.039 
at one point I was like you know what I

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
think matter can't play right wing I

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.420 
think matter can't play right wing I
think<00:03:51.230> he's<00:03:51.349> brought<00:03:51.560> his<00:03:51.680> left<00:03:51.980> foot<00:03:52.190> is<00:03:52.400> you

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
think he's brought his left foot is you

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.110 
think he's brought his left foot is you
can<00:03:52.760> do<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.000> business<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:53.599> I<00:03:53.980> think<00:03:54.980> it<00:03:55.910> I

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
can do the business but I think it I

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.180 
can do the business but I think it I
after<00:03:56.900> seen<00:03:57.079> him<00:03:57.169> it's<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.470> sniveling<00:03:58.010> yes<00:03:58.099> I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
after seen him it's a sniveling yes I

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.159 
after seen him it's a sniveling yes I
said<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.430> like<00:03:58.579> Emily<00:03:58.970> was<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.150> bit<00:03:59.299> slow<00:03:59.510> but<00:03:59.900> a

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
said it like Emily was a bit slow but a

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.129 
said it like Emily was a bit slow but a
little<00:04:00.859> sluggish<00:04:01.099> but<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.760> just<00:04:02.090> after<00:04:02.900> seeing

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
little sluggish but I just after seeing

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.629 
little sluggish but I just after seeing
that<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.319> just<00:04:03.590> don't<00:04:03.799> see<00:04:04.069> where<00:04:04.220> if<00:04:04.310> it's<00:04:04.519> I

behind the strike he needs are such a
fantastic<00:04:12.470> touch<00:04:13.160> a<00:04:13.190> matter<00:04:13.579> point<00:04:13.910> as<00:04:13.970> one<00:04:14.090> of

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
fantastic touch a matter point as one of

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.819

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.290 
I think I hopefully that's where he does
play<00:04:19.820> um<00:04:20.919> so<00:04:21.919> yeah<00:04:22.099> hopefully<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.880> same<00:04:23.060> and

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
play um so yeah hopefully the same and

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.580 
play um so yeah hopefully the same and
they're<00:04:23.570> not<00:04:23.659> as<00:04:23.810> serious<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.229> was<00:04:24.320> your

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
they're not as serious it was your

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.690 
they're not as serious it was your
school<00:04:24.860> one<00:04:24.950> looked<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.190> little<00:04:25.310> serious

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
school one looked a little serious

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.290 
school one looked a little serious
because<00:04:25.789> he<00:04:25.909> was<00:04:26.030> like

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
because he was like

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.110 
because he was like
basically<00:04:26.930> carried<00:04:27.199> off<00:04:27.409> and<00:04:27.620> but<00:04:28.069> hazard<00:04:28.490> you

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
basically carried off and but hazard you

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.059 
basically carried off and but hazard you
can<00:04:29.270> get<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.569> sever<00:04:29.900> current<00:04:30.319> of<00:04:30.379> his<00:04:30.500> Achilles

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
so the fact this recurring that could be

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.890 
so the fact this recurring that could be
a<00:04:33.169> little<00:04:33.259> bit<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.620> bad<00:04:34.220> thing<00:04:34.460> but<00:04:34.759> I<00:04:35.180> don't

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900
