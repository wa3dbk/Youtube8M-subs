 the best logo you sent me 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.250

 all subscribers someone wants to teach 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.500
 a sticker so that they could not save for 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.720

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.459

 I can not personally control everyone 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.330
 as first out from germany in 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.570
 second as it is very obstructive therefore 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.459
 need people who are from cities to carry 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.410
 will help distribute up to 7 mm 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.900
 leaves between 60 and they're already there

 one two stickers are handed over to those who want 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.870
 that's why I came up with such a small 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.150
 distribution method so that you yourself 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.230
