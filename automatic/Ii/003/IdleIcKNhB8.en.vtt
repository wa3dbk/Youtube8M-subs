00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
I'm going to add in 100 grams of crystal

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.810 
I'm going to add in 100 grams of crystal
malt<00:00:41.230> which<00:00:41.980> will<00:00:42.129> give<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.399> more<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.700> a

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
malt which will give it more of a

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.340 
malt which will give it more of a
biscuity<00:00:44.280> caramel<00:00:45.280> type<00:00:45.519> flavor<00:00:46.109> maybe<00:00:47.109> add<00:00:47.320> a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
biscuity caramel type flavor maybe add a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.060 
biscuity caramel type flavor maybe add a
little<00:00:47.440> bit<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:47.829> color<00:00:48.100> as<00:00:48.309> well<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.170> also<00:00:50.890> I'm

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
little bit of color as well and also I'm

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.069 
little bit of color as well and also I'm
going<00:00:51.159> to<00:00:51.219> add<00:00:51.370> in<00:00:51.519> 1<00:00:51.730> kilo<00:00:52.149> of<00:00:52.390> dry<00:00:52.870> malt

going to add in 1 kilo of dry malt

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.439 
going to add in 1 kilo of dry malt
extract<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.280> that's<00:00:54.460> going<00:00:54.609> to<00:00:54.670> replace<00:00:55.149> the

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
extract so that's going to replace the

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.439 
extract so that's going to replace the
dextrose<00:00:56.339> so<00:00:57.339> hopefully<00:00:57.699> it's<00:00:57.819> going<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.030> give

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
dextrose so hopefully it's going to give

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.360 
dextrose so hopefully it's going to give
you<00:00:58.539> a<00:00:58.600> better<00:00:58.780> better<00:00:59.260> quality<00:00:59.829> finished

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
you a better better quality finished

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.630 
you a better better quality finished
product<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.809> over<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.829> multi<00:01:03.129> dextran

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
product and over to the multi dextran

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.719 
product and over to the multi dextran
I'm<00:01:03.789> going<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:03.999> add<00:01:04.150> 100<00:01:04.659> grams<00:01:04.870> of<00:01:05.710> that<00:01:06.400> it's

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
I'm going to add 100 grams of that it's

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.460 
I'm going to add 100 grams of that it's
just<00:01:06.940> going<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.090> help<00:01:07.930> with<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.290> head

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
nicer and also I called it my Cooper's

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.120 
nicer and also I called it my Cooper's
real<00:01:23.979> galaxy<00:01:24.579> ale<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.229> name<00:01:26.380> galaxy<00:01:27.039> is

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
real galaxy ale so the name galaxy is

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.679 
real galaxy ale so the name galaxy is
coming<00:01:27.460> from<00:01:27.579> the<00:01:27.729> fact<00:01:27.939> I'm<00:01:28.119> going<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.390> base

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
coming from the fact I'm going to base

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.880 
coming from the fact I'm going to base
try<00:01:29.680> hopping<00:01:29.920> with<00:01:30.659> half<00:01:31.659> a<00:01:31.869> bag<00:01:32.079> of<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.649> is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
try hopping with half a bag of this is

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.149 
try hopping with half a bag of this is
50<00:01:33.250> grams<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.850> galaxy<00:01:34.450> hops<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:35.799> going<00:01:36.100> to

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
50 grams of galaxy hops that's going to

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.609 
50 grams of galaxy hops that's going to
impart<00:01:36.490> sort<00:01:37.299> of<00:01:38.250> sort<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.280> passion<00:01:39.850> fruit

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619

citrus type aromas and flavors to the
beer<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.460> then<00:01:45.640> finally<00:01:46.180> I'm<00:01:46.420> sitting<00:01:47.289> is<00:01:47.380> in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
beer and then finally I'm sitting is in

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.080 
beer and then finally I'm sitting is in
the<00:01:47.619> Cooper's<00:01:48.039> kit<00:01:48.280> yeast<00:01:48.579> I'm<00:01:48.850> going<00:01:48.969> to<00:01:49.030> be

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
the Cooper's kit yeast I'm going to be

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.399 
the Cooper's kit yeast I'm going to be
using<00:01:49.509> this<00:01:49.780> USO<00:01:50.530> 5a<00:01:51.310> all<00:01:51.729> yeast<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:53.229> I've

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
using this USO 5a all yeast I'm I've

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.050 
using this USO 5a all yeast I'm I've
just<00:01:53.590> found<00:01:53.770> using<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.369> instead<00:01:54.670> of<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.880> kit

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
just found using that instead of the kit

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.990 
just found using that instead of the kit
yeast<00:01:55.359> gives<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.960> much<00:01:56.320> better<00:01:57.000> tasting

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
yeast gives you a much better tasting

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.929 
yeast gives you a much better tasting
beer<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:59.500> overall<00:01:59.799> finished<00:02:00.429> product<00:02:00.789> is

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
beer and the overall finished product is

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.209 
beer and the overall finished product is
a<00:02:00.969> lot<00:02:01.119> better<00:02:01.329> so<00:02:01.899> there<00:02:02.079> we<00:02:02.170> go<00:02:02.229> now<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.039> might

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
a lot better so there we go now it might

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.889 
a lot better so there we go now it might
look<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.789> lot<00:02:03.969> of<00:02:04.090> ingredients<00:02:04.689> and<00:02:04.750> you're

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
look a lot of ingredients and you're

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.840 
look a lot of ingredients and you're
probably<00:02:05.020> thinking<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.649> cost<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.189> quite<00:02:06.460> high

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
probably thinking the cost is quite high

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.719 
probably thinking the cost is quite high
but<00:02:07.179> just<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:08.050> quick<00:02:08.950> add<00:02:09.220> up<00:02:09.460> and<00:02:09.640> you're

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
but just a quick add up and you're

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.430 
but just a quick add up and you're
looking<00:02:09.970> at<00:02:10.030> about<00:02:10.179> thirty-five<00:02:10.960> thirty-six

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
looking at about thirty-five thirty-six

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.580 
looking at about thirty-five thirty-six
dollars<00:02:12.330> which<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.480> don't<00:02:13.600> think<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.990> too<00:02:14.200> bad

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
dollars which I don't think is too bad

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.060 
dollars which I don't think is too bad
mainly<00:02:15.250> I'm<00:02:15.460> using<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.480> know<00:02:16.650> thirty<00:02:17.650> cents

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
mainly I'm using you know thirty cents
