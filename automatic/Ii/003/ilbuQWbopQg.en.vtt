not used to seeing babies in the tank
those<00:02:23.770> fish<00:02:24.070> aren't<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.550> when<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.970> add<00:02:25.660> more

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.510 
because they're going to take their food
they're<00:02:28.330> going<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> keep<00:02:28.660> chasing<00:02:28.840> them<00:02:29.520> most

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
they're going to keep chasing them most

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.290 
they're going to keep chasing them most
of<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.700> time<00:02:30.880> once<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.390> have<00:02:32.190> fish<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.300> have

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
of the time once you have fish that have

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.650 
of the time once you have fish that have
been<00:02:34.510> around<00:02:34.810> babies<00:02:35.050> all<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.100> time<00:02:36.310> then<00:02:36.660> you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
been around babies all the time then you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.210 
been around babies all the time then you
know<00:02:37.780> they<00:02:38.230> might<00:02:38.350> go<00:02:38.560> after<00:02:38.710> them<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.040> once

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
know they might go after them but once

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.890 
know they might go after them but once
they<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.520> them<00:02:39.670> move<00:02:39.880> they're<00:02:40.660> pretty<00:02:40.810> much

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
they see them move they're pretty much

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.680 
they see them move they're pretty much
leave<00:02:41.080> them<00:02:41.170> alone<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.880> know<00:02:43.030> you're

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
leave them alone so you know you're

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:44.640 
leave them alone so you know you're
you'll<00:02:44.050> be<00:02:44.140> fine

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
you'll be fine

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.260 
you'll be fine
don't<00:02:44.830> worry<00:02:44.980> about<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.220> most<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.180> these

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
don't worry about that most of these

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.930 
don't worry about that most of these
fish<00:02:46.650> actually<00:02:47.650> just<00:02:48.340> about<00:02:48.550> all<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.850> these

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
fish actually just about all of these

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.810 
fish actually just about all of these
fish<00:02:49.270> are<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.800> breed<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.520> know<00:02:51.640> all<00:02:51.790> of

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
fish are I breed it you know all of

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.600 
fish are I breed it you know all of
these<00:02:52.090> where<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.420> put<00:02:52.750> like<00:02:52.990> maybe<00:02:53.170> seven<00:02:54.160> fish

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
these where I put like maybe seven fish

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.000 
these where I put like maybe seven fish
in<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.820> tank<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:56.410> let<00:02:56.620> them<00:02:56.740> breed

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
in a tank and just let them breed

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.250 
in a tank and just let them breed
there's<00:02:57.430> probably<00:02:57.940> that<00:02:58.630> one<00:02:58.750> right<00:02:58.900> there<00:02:59.140> is

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
there's probably that one right there is

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.600 
there's probably that one right there is
my<00:02:59.290> first<00:02:59.770> my<00:03:00.760> first<00:03:02.250> generation<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.370> like<00:03:03.520> to

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
my first my first generation I like to

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.810 
my first my first generation I like to
call<00:03:03.760> them<00:03:03.940> they<00:03:04.180> actually<00:03:04.330> survived<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.820> you

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
call them they actually survived and you

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.640 
call them they actually survived and you
know<00:03:06.940> he's<00:03:07.090> the<00:03:07.240> most<00:03:07.330> noticeable<00:03:07.690> one<00:03:08.080> he's

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
know he's the most noticeable one he's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.590 
know he's the most noticeable one he's
still<00:03:08.890> alive<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.520> is<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:09.850> obviously

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
still alive and this is like obviously

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.680 
still alive and this is like obviously
like<00:03:10.660> 10<00:03:11.020> generations<00:03:11.940> because<00:03:12.940> I've<00:03:13.120> had<00:03:13.390> so

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
like 10 generations because I've had so

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.720 
like 10 generations because I've had so
many<00:03:13.810> litters<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.350> babies<00:03:14.680> it's<00:03:15.160> ridiculous

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
many litters of babies it's ridiculous

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.830 
many litters of babies it's ridiculous
so<00:03:17.340> like<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.430> said<00:03:18.489> all<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.000> these<00:03:19.300> fishes

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
so like I said all of these fishes

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.780 
so like I said all of these fishes
suffer<00:03:20.080> maybe<00:03:20.230> about<00:03:20.410> three<00:03:20.739> I've<00:03:21.280> read<00:03:21.640> it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
suffer maybe about three I've read it

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.510 
suffer maybe about three I've read it
and<00:03:22.320> I've<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.440> left<00:03:23.709> them<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.160> know<00:03:24.280> left

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
and I've just left them you know left

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.560 
and I've just left them you know left
them<00:03:24.640> how<00:03:24.730> they<00:03:24.880> are<00:03:24.910> just<00:03:25.150> leave<00:03:25.330> them<00:03:25.450> there

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
them how they are just leave them there

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.449 
them how they are just leave them there
and<00:03:25.690> just<00:03:25.870> they'll<00:03:26.410> make<00:03:26.650> they'll<00:03:27.250> have

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
and just they'll make they'll have

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.840 
and just they'll make they'll have
babies<00:03:27.820> so<00:03:27.850> my<00:03:28.780> opinion<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.260> easiest<00:03:29.290> way<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
babies so my opinion the easiest way to

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.070 
babies so my opinion the easiest way to
breed<00:03:30.850> fish<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:32.380> breed<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.430> Guppies<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.390> to

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
breed fish is to breed the Guppies is to

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.420 
breed fish is to breed the Guppies is to
