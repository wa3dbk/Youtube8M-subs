00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.859
 remember the Russian proverb yes porridge 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.779
 our food but unfortunately porridge now 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.059
 It is less and less, even toddlers and yet in vain 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.260
 National Cancer Institute Specialists 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.330
 cities rockwell usa 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.460
 strongly recommend not to neglect 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.310
 this dish because porridge contributes 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.970
 increase in life expectancy 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.439
 research Americans conducted 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.260
 large-scale watched the group 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 volunteers from 400 thousand people led 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.279
 observation for 20 years and here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.289
 long-awaited results participants 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.910
 who regularly used porridge from 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 various croup less likely to suffer 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.579
 oncological diseases at the very 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 really want to hear 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
 confirmation from our experts at 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 us guests 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.940
 Candidate of Medical Sciences 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.980
 Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.239
 natural sciences and doctor sergey arseniy 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.879
 near good morning 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 so what Americans they do not exaggerate 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 that kashtak is useful in what their useful 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.660
 you know how some pebbles contain 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.340
 a lot of fiber and this fiber in our 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.350
 the gastrointestinal tract acts like 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.469
 dagger you tossing their slags toxins 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.370
 that's why cancer incidence 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.320
 intestines dramatically reduced they are all porridges 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.229
 as useful as we would like to give 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.760
 advertising isn't it today some 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.840
 myths 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.909
 our viewers may be on them 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.560
 tarkashi open our eyes I won't see them 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.030
 something new let's be honest 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.979
 I would like to start from the very same 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.439
 research in the hands of many scientists they 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.450
 say that rice and oatmeal are 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.119
 just for without this is what ours need 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 body wrong they are right in that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.490
 that these porridges are very well favored 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 affects the gastrointestinal tract 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.470
 for example, the whole nko if you know and 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.970
 brew possess but exudes such mucus 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 But if a person is a disease 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.860
 gastritis yazal something else mucus 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.110
 envelop the intestinal wall of the stomach and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 does not give hydrochloric acid affects 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.960
 wall and this is not the wall itself is protected and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.149
 under this layer of porridge here this slime is very 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.950
 It heals well as iris so then 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.140
 it is logical quite right but on the first 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.969
 the place is still well, you know what kind of porridge like 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.469
 our russian is the best buckwheat she 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.700
 really very popular it is not 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.990
 only she herself is popular 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.489
 the most useful and this is well 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.080
 justification for example buckwheat porridge 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.000
 contains the maximum amount 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.769
 vegetable 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.920
 amino acids that is a caravan for us then 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.530
 eat this squirrels are our squirrels who want 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.510
 refuse meat who does it 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.420
 vegetarian something else that's this 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.950
 buckwheat porridge is a great substitute 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.840
 animal protein i know what you have 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 some recipe for buckwheat porridge let's 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.380
 we will start cooking it for but we are talking 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.989
 about everything else let's mean 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.569
 buckwheat porridge is still good than her 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.580
 cook completely optional and even 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.220
 do not need any room boiling water 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.090
 quite right and then we give it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.410
 taste which but which we want here 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.290
 know what let's add 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.829
 nuts marishka king nut in this almond 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.349
 because it sits down vitamins today 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.870
 cereal here is a lot of protein amino acids 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.620
 and almonds and a lot of amino acids 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.720
 beat and protein but almonds still eat fat and 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 who are useful to us who protect 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.590
 our heart vessels we have here 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.910
 the trap on the table I never prepare 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.299
 like bunny day to cook and cook 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.209
 very duty like to steal this beloved 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.620
 Peter's porridge first by the way this 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.180
 first and second 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.590
 for women it is feline good she 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.290
 as strong as possible stimulates 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.410
 production of our endogenous collagen 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.989
 so if girls are women or the same 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.959
 woman there is a boss balzakovskogo near 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.700
 girls till constantly consumes 1 porridge 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.380
 then they are significantly smoothed out 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.959
 wrinkles and this can be seen right 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.100
 literally two three months after 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.930
 regular use of takashi 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.170
 in the meantime we covered our buckwheat by 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.790
 chopped almonds are just right 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.459
 then we need to add honey, we will not 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.950
 add sugar and something else we just 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.060
 add here to us for one two walks 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.069
 tablespoons 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.569
 we mix it all know this 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.579
 the recipe actually cooked for me 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.730
 grandmother on I brought the window near the village 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.130
 it is this mud it to that of brewed in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.079
 so find a pot put in the stove and 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.780
 Here in the stove an old is the mess that 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.640
 languished honey added olive oil 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.480
 you need here if we added no olive 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.970
 butter is no longer 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.519
 need the most important thing is that this porridge is now 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:23.820
 incredibly useful I can not try 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:26.820
 sorry, well, I understand what else I will not 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.580
 lunch no lunch and breakfast 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.620
 This is again an important point because 2 + 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.220
 buckwheat when she comes to us 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.040
 inside 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.130
 she digested a very long time and she us 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.690
 energizes 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.430
 literally the whole day everything is decided this one 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.710
