00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
some way and and I don't know if it's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.180 
some way and and I don't know if it's
going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.960> be<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> hundred<00:00:43.230> percent<00:00:43.410> support

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
going to be a hundred percent support

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310
