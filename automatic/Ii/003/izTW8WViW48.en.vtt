so you know having multiple pcs in one

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.580 
so you know having multiple pcs in one
place<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> becoming<00:00:15.510> more<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.840> more<00:00:16.049> common

and a neck look guess what there are

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.030 
and a neck look guess what there are
people<00:00:24.419> that<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.750> all<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.200> those<00:00:25.710> machines

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.410 
making it very very easy and very very
space<00:00:55.410> efficient<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.370> multiple<00:00:56.879> pcs<00:00:57.239> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420

one<00:00:58.320> place<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.390> happens<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> be

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
one place and this just so happens to be

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.540 
one place and this just so happens to be
a<00:01:01.440> model<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.100> IOGEAR<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.449> are<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.550> huge

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
a model from IOGEAR but there are a huge

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.820 
a model from IOGEAR but there are a huge
number<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.539> different<00:01:06.690> kvms<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> all

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
number of different kvms which is all

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.080 
number of different kvms which is all
there<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.550> there<00:01:08.850> they<00:01:08.940> all

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
there they all out there they all

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.120 
there they all out there they all
basically<00:01:09.390> do<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.259> same<00:01:10.289> thing<00:01:10.560> they<00:01:10.920> allow

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
basically do the same thing they allow

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.060 
basically do the same thing they allow
you<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.280> share<00:01:11.580> one<00:01:12.119> keyboard<00:01:12.539> and<00:01:12.780> mouse<00:01:12.930> with

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
you to share one keyboard and mouse with

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.499 
you to share one keyboard and mouse with
multiple<00:01:14.070> computers<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.940> there<00:01:15.149> are<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.330> few

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
multiple computers now there are a few

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.029 
multiple computers now there are a few
options<00:01:15.750> you're<00:01:16.289> going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.679> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> deal

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
options you're going to want to deal

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.010 
options you're going to want to deal
with<00:01:17.069> this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.429> a<00:01:17.459> very<00:01:17.729> simplified<00:01:18.179> one<00:01:18.599> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
with this is a very simplified one this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.609 
with this is a very simplified one this
is<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.440> VGA<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:21.179> USB<00:01:21.569> port<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.530> will

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
is a VGA and two USB port so it will

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.580 
is a VGA and two USB port so it will
share<00:01:22.800> one<00:01:23.160> USB<00:01:23.880> keyboard<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.869> USB<00:01:25.229> mouse<00:01:25.349> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
share one USB keyboard one USB mouse and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.400 
share one USB keyboard one USB mouse and
one<00:01:25.740> VGA<00:01:26.099> monitor<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.270> other<00:01:27.660> types<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
one VGA monitor there are other types of

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.870 
one VGA monitor there are other types of
models<00:01:28.770> out<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.310> also<00:01:29.670> share

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
models out there that will also share

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.020 
models out there that will also share
sound<00:01:30.300> there<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:31.080> DVI<00:01:31.619> KVM<00:01:32.399> switches<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
sound there are DVI KVM switches so you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.410 
sound there are DVI KVM switches so you
don't<00:01:33.179> have<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.330> use<00:01:33.450> VGA<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.259> use<00:01:34.470> DVI

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
don't have to use VGA you can use DVI

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.529 
don't have to use VGA you can use DVI
there<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.690> multiple<00:01:37.440> options<00:01:37.740> out<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.670> but

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
there are multiple options out there but

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:40.699 
there are multiple options out there but
you<00:01:39.690> just<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.899> to<00:01:39.929> find<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.289> one<00:01:40.440> that's

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
you just have to find the one that's

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.770 
you just have to find the one that's
best<00:01:40.860> for<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.459> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> good<00:01:42.479> one<00:01:42.660> because

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
best for you this is a good one because

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.350 
best for you this is a good one because
we're<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.410> looking<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.679> use<00:01:43.860> VGA<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.700> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
we're just looking to use VGA and it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
we're just looking to use VGA and it
allows<00:01:45.599> us<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.929> kind<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.170> stash<00:01:46.440> things<00:01:46.830> under

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
allows us to kind of stash things under

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.699 
allows us to kind of stash things under
our<00:01:47.520> desk<00:01:47.849> so<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.090> don't<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.599> a<00:01:48.690> KVM<00:01:49.319> switch

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
our desk so we don't have a KVM switch

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.710 
our desk so we don't have a KVM switch
box<00:01:49.979> actually<00:01:50.190> out<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.759> open<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.630> you're

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
box actually out in the open when you're

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.059 
box actually out in the open when you're
actually<00:01:51.869> using<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.739> would<00:01:52.830> actually

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069 
actually using this you would actually

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:54.290 
actually using this you would actually
kind<00:01:53.190> of<00:01:53.250> stash<00:01:53.489> all<00:01:53.700> this<00:01:53.849> somewhere<00:01:54.239> else

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
kind of stash all this somewhere else

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.139 
kind of stash all this somewhere else
and<00:01:54.630> use<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.530> included<00:01:56.099> remote<00:01:56.250> button<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
and use the included remote button to

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
and use the included remote button to
switch<00:01:57.390> between<00:01:57.569> all<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.560> various
