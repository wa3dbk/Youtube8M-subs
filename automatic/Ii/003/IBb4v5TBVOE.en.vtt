00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 yes hello people cordially you come 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.600
 this video this is the connection 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.890
 videos to the topic of curvature that 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 you should definitely look 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.410
 before this video is shyly linked 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.809
 so now I go so now 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.880
 assuming that you are the predecessor 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.029
 video have seen what that is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.220
 bit oriented too and that 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.340
 especially beginner field is just 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.140
 very hard to look far enough ahead 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.760
 but also experienced bikers fall 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.700
 especially in dangerous situations too 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.380
 very hard enough to look ahead 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.180
 is simply because of that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 human being just not so high 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 Speeds is designed and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.469
 earlier just the danger came from near 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.500
 Therefore, just for example in the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.690
 emergency brake just super fast right in front of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 motorcycle looks and does not go there 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.110
 Look where you ever land the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.430
 To learn correct look technique 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.980
 definitely a long-term process 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 where you keep reminding yourself 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 he would have to be mine 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.320
 looking leadership eighth to one them then 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 just in meat and blood 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.840
 and yes, almost automatically used by 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.100
 special meaning is the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.290
 view guide in curves 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.360
 There is always as deep as possible in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.460
 turn in to look at curve exit 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.400
 but not a point 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.770
 always be fixed as far as possible 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.409
 removed poses starting point 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.939
 one leaves the curve naturally 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.390
 then continue straight on the street 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.850
 also looked so people short sipping 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.140
 still on the topic of sightseeing 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.250
 we are now in one 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.380
 small circles 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.810
 Here I can explain you quite well 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.790
 how one should lead the view and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.840
 Although we can here in this case 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.689
 actually fix this tree, so to speak 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.240
 or just as possible to look behind it 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.170
 just the curve exit here too 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.820
 observe 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.829
 and I can definitely do it for you 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.460
 for such a place to recommend 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.680
 search 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.270
 now should teach gyro 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.340
 or somehow, somehow 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.439
 big empty space might be there 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.909
 also my clothes in the middle too 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.579
 and then just a few 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.960
 to drive round and thereby one can 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.929
 Practice it well then 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.150
 finally in the right traffic 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.180
 implement 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.970
 eg obstacles ground waves or similar 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.500
 be recognized as early as possible 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.599
 and respond accordingly 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.610
 if, for example, in the turn 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 small oil stain or a stone lies 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.680
 or so then one reacts when one 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.780
 Maybe I'm not trained 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.480
 the time to say so that you give the stone 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.159
 fixed and we learned that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.650
 you always go wherever you go 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:39.379
 So you look at the middle of the first 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.120
 oil stain with over the stone yes and 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.579
 crashed in case of doubt then once the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.650
 Regard the look and attention paid 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.239
 next to it also the curve drive on it 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.670
 fits then you can already 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.099
 in time to see the problem and he has 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
 still enough reaction time to just that 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.780
 curve radius to change so that you 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.579
 just yes circumnavigate the obstacle or 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.930
 can react to it as well as possible 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.849
 so that was it for the look 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.139
 technology the last video you have 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.639
 Safety already seen because of it 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.859
 now link up with another one 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.109
 nice video bottom left you have mine 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.909
 social networks if you like the channel 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.829
 chickens did not subscribe then you should 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.760
 Subscribe to it in any case and then 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.449
 not see something very soon 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.579
 Initially videos will be call training 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:24.430
 technology the right look to technology 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.840
 learning is definitely a long one 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.840
 to learn the right way technically 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.940
 of particular importance is the curves 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.659
 already a special meaning is the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.479
 looking leadership precisely in situations curves 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:52.389
 Curves situation with cures situation 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:52.389
 I can take it myself 5 137 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.260
 optimize it as optimally as possible 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.090
 flowers decided
