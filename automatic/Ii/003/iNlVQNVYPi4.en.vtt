cable<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:17.380> now<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.620> we've<00:02:17.830> reviewed<00:02:17.860> our

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
cable so now that we've reviewed our

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.150 
cable so now that we've reviewed our
basic<00:02:18.700> types<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.090> microphones<00:02:19.950> let's<00:02:20.950> take<00:02:21.130> a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
basic types of microphones let's take a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.780 
basic types of microphones let's take a
look<00:02:21.310> at<00:02:21.489> how<00:02:21.910> we<00:02:22.450> would<00:02:22.720> set<00:02:23.080> up<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.320> Mike<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
look at how we would set up the Mike and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.530 
look at how we would set up the Mike and
get<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> patched<00:02:25.090> into<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.800> Priyan<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:28.120> first

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
get it patched into the Priyan so first

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.360 
get it patched into the Priyan so first
before<00:02:29.500> we<00:02:29.860> hook<00:02:30.010> up

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
before we hook up

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.509 
before we hook up
I<00:02:30.400> need<00:02:31.090> my<00:02:31.209> steady<00:02:31.600> preempt<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:33.160> need<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.370> put

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
I need my steady preempt we need to put

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.690 
I need my steady preempt we need to put
it<00:02:33.610> on<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:33.760> stand<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:34.600> likely<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.430> way<00:02:36.550> that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
it on a stand it's likely the way that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.220 
it on a stand it's likely the way that
you<00:02:36.790> want<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.030> do<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.840> want<00:02:37.989> to<00:02:38.050> take

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.009 

and<00:03:21.079> we<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:21.409> take<00:03:21.620> in<00:03:21.859> this<00:03:22.280> case<00:03:22.549> our

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
and we can take in this case our

and we can take in this case our
standard<00:03:24.019> three-pin<00:03:24.590> XLR<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:31.569> plug<00:03:32.569> it<00:03:32.719> in<00:03:34.510> to

standard three-pin XLR and plug it in to
the<00:03:35.599> back<00:03:35.719> of<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.870> microphone<00:03:36.139> like<00:03:36.379> so<00:03:36.939> so

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
the back of the microphone like so so

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:39.309 
the back of the microphone like so so
now<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.180> we<00:03:38.329> have<00:03:38.359> the<00:03:38.540> cable<00:03:38.689> plugged<00:03:39.109> into

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
now that we have the cable plugged into

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.410 
now that we have the cable plugged into
the<00:03:39.680> mic<00:03:39.889> we<00:03:40.219> need<00:03:40.370> to<00:03:40.459> plug<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.819> into<00:03:40.969> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
the mic we need to plug it into the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.720 
the mic we need to plug it into the
correct<00:03:41.689> preamp<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.500> correct<00:03:42.769> out<00:03:42.950> the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
correct preamp and the correct out the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.379 
correct preamp and the correct out the
input<00:03:44.500> so<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:46.639> it<00:03:46.879> can<00:03:46.909> look<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.239> little

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
input so it can it can look a little

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:48.759 
input so it can it can look a little
messy<00:03:47.569> back<00:03:47.930> here<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.319> can<00:03:48.469> be<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.620> little

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
messy back here it can be a little

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.449 
messy back here it can be a little
confusing<00:03:49.659> but<00:03:50.659> it's<00:03:50.870> easy<00:03:51.049> if<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:51.950> remember

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
confusing but it's easy if you remember

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.720 
confusing but it's easy if you remember
that<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.870> first<00:03:53.900> preamp<00:03:54.859> that<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> want<00:03:55.669> to

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
that the first preamp that you want to

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.259 
that the first preamp that you want to
be<00:03:55.819> plugging<00:03:56.060> into<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.829> bottom<00:03:58.519> preamp

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
be plugging into is the bottom preamp

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.839 
be plugging into is the bottom preamp
and<00:03:59.980> there's<00:04:00.980> some<00:04:01.159> reasons<00:04:01.489> for<00:04:01.549> this<00:04:01.790> and

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
and there's some reasons for this and

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.409 
and there's some reasons for this and
we'll<00:04:02.000> get<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.299> that<00:04:02.450> in<00:04:02.569> a<00:04:02.629> bit<00:04:03.370> now<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:05.299> our

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
we'll get to that in a bit now in our

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.490 
we'll get to that in a bit now in our
case<00:04:05.659> we<00:04:05.900> are<00:04:05.930> using<00:04:06.379> a<00:04:06.739> standard<00:04:07.219> three-pin

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
case we are using a standard three-pin

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.709 
case we are using a standard three-pin
dynamic<00:04:09.500> microphone<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.370> in<00:04:10.969> this<00:04:11.120> case<00:04:11.450> that

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:11.719 
dynamic microphone and in this case that

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.140 
dynamic microphone and in this case that
means<00:04:12.129> we're<00:04:13.129> going<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.430> be<00:04:13.579> plugging<00:04:13.790> into

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
means we're going to be plugging into

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.339 
means we're going to be plugging into
the<00:04:14.569> third<00:04:15.379> input<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:17.570> bottom<00:04:17.870> preamp<00:04:18.199> now

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
the third input on the bottom preamp now

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.039 
the third input on the bottom preamp now
why<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.560> third<00:04:18.859> input<00:04:19.479> because<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:20.720> first

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
why the third input because the first

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.520 
why the third input because the first
two<00:04:21.380> inputs<00:04:21.949> on<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.789> preamps<00:04:23.389> are<00:04:23.530> reserved

bottom preamp like so and we're done all
right<00:04:50.389> now<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.320> we<00:04:51.620> are<00:04:52.340> plugged<00:04:52.880> in<00:04:53.090> on<00:04:53.270> both

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
right now that we are plugged in on both

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.360 
right now that we are plugged in on both

the microphone side and the preamp side

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.950 
the microphone side and the preamp side
we<00:04:55.610> can<00:04:55.759> safely<00:04:56.000> start<00:04:56.479> turning<00:04:56.870> the

we can safely start turning the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.649 
we can safely start turning the
equipment<00:04:57.409> on<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.729> first<00:04:59.030> thing<00:04:59.419> that

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
equipment on so the first thing that

equipment on so the first thing that
you're<00:05:00.050> going<00:05:00.349> to<00:05:00.380> want<00:05:00.680> to<00:05:00.740> do<00:05:00.919> is<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.820> turn<00:05:02.659> on

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
you're going to want to do is to turn on

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.200 
you're going to want to do is to turn on
they<00:05:03.770> handle<00:05:04.130> off<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.400> digital<00:05:04.759> converter

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
they handle off to digital converter

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:12.610 
they handle off to digital converter
right<00:05:06.250> here

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.450 

once<00:05:13.220> this<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.580> turned<00:05:13.850> on<00:05:15.040> you<00:05:16.040> want<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.310> make

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
once this is turned on you want to make

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.200 
once this is turned on you want to make
sure<00:05:16.490> that<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.900> monitors<00:05:18.590> are<00:05:18.950> muted<00:05:19.670> in<00:05:19.880> the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
sure that the monitors are muted in the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.870 
sure that the monitors are muted in the
control<00:05:20.660> room<00:05:20.690> we<00:05:21.500> do<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:21.860> to<00:05:22.580> make<00:05:22.730> sure

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
control room we do this to make sure

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.550 
control room we do this to make sure
that<00:05:23.030> when<00:05:23.180> we<00:05:23.300> turn<00:05:23.510> on<00:05:23.600> the<00:05:23.750> preamp<00:05:24.200> that<00:05:24.440> we

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
that when we turn on the preamp that we

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.510 
that when we turn on the preamp that we
don't<00:05:24.740> hear<00:05:24.950> any<00:05:25.300> possible<00:05:26.300> popping<00:05:27.520> or

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
don't hear any possible popping or

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.310 
don't hear any possible popping or
feedback<00:05:31.390> so<00:05:32.390> assuming<00:05:32.840> we've<00:05:32.990> done<00:05:33.170> that

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
feedback so assuming we've done that

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.700 
feedback so assuming we've done that
which<00:05:33.560> we've<00:05:33.770> had<00:05:34.840> you'll<00:05:35.840> turn<00:05:36.140> on<00:05:36.320> the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
which we've had you'll turn on the

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.760 
which we've had you'll turn on the
bottom<00:05:36.890> preamp<00:05:37.580> first<00:05:38.770> right<00:05:39.770> here<00:05:41.680> now<00:05:42.680> the

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
bottom preamp first right here now the

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.740 
bottom preamp first right here now the
reason<00:05:43.100> why<00:05:43.220> we<00:05:43.280> use<00:05:43.700> the<00:05:43.970> bottom<00:05:44.390> milennia

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
reason why we use the bottom milennia

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.910 
reason why we use the bottom milennia
preamp<00:05:46.150> before<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.570> second<00:05:47.990> millenia<00:05:48.560> preamp

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
preamp before the second millenia preamp

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.020 
preamp before the second millenia preamp
here<00:05:49.100> is<00:05:49.580> because<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:50.030> bottom<00:05:50.260> preamp<00:05:51.260> is

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
here is because the bottom preamp is

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.460 
here is because the bottom preamp is
remote<00:05:53.030> controlled<00:05:54.520> from<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.610> control<00:05:56.000> room

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
remote controlled from the control room

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.290 
remote controlled from the control room
which<00:05:57.470> we'll<00:05:57.680> get<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.890> soon<00:05:59.770> so<00:06:00.770> if<00:06:01.610> you<00:06:02.120> are

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
which we'll get to soon so if you are

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.210 
which we'll get to soon so if you are
using<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:03.170> second<00:06:03.500> preamp<00:06:03.860> if<00:06:03.980> the

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
using the second preamp if the

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.860 
using the second preamp if the
microphones<00:06:06.070> count<00:06:07.070> demands<00:06:07.580> it<00:06:07.850> then<00:06:08.750> you

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
microphones count demands it then you

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.600 
microphones count demands it then you
can<00:06:09.020> turn<00:06:09.110> on<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.350> second<00:06:09.620> preamp<00:06:10.070> just<00:06:10.460> like

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
can turn on the second preamp just like

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.590 
can turn on the second preamp just like
so<00:06:11.740> now<00:06:12.740> like<00:06:12.920> I<00:06:13.040> said<00:06:13.100> the<00:06:13.370> difference

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
so now like I said the difference

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.840 
so now like I said the difference
between<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:14.870> two<00:06:15.080> is<00:06:15.260> that<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:16.280> bottom<00:06:16.670> one

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
between the two is that the bottom one

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.320 
between the two is that the bottom one
is<00:06:16.880> controlled<00:06:17.570> in<00:06:18.050> the<00:06:18.890> control<00:06:19.280> room<00:06:19.460> but

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
is controlled in the control room but

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.930 
is controlled in the control room but
the<00:06:21.230> second<00:06:21.530> one<00:06:21.650> is<00:06:21.740> not<00:06:21.920> so<00:06:22.490> that<00:06:22.520> means<00:06:22.820> we

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
the second one is not so that means we

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.560 
the second one is not so that means we
have<00:06:23.030> to<00:06:23.150> set<00:06:23.360> up<00:06:23.390> the<00:06:24.110> game<00:06:24.940> and<00:06:25.940> the<00:06:26.210> phantom

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
have to set up the game and the phantom

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.590 
have to set up the game and the phantom
power<00:06:26.690> in<00:06:27.020> here<00:06:27.460> which<00:06:28.460> at<00:06:29.060> the<00:06:29.150> bottom<00:06:29.480> when

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
power in here which at the bottom when

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.940 
power in here which at the bottom when
you<00:06:29.660> would<00:06:29.780> otherwise<00:06:29.990> do<00:06:30.350> in<00:06:30.470> the<00:06:30.590> control

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
you would otherwise do in the control

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.550 
you would otherwise do in the control
room<00:06:31.510> so<00:06:32.510> that<00:06:33.080> being<00:06:33.320> said<00:06:34.270> if<00:06:35.270> you<00:06:35.900> had<00:06:36.350> to

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
room so that being said if you had to

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.890 
room so that being said if you had to
set<00:06:36.770> up<00:06:36.800> the<00:06:37.040> gain<00:06:37.250> or<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.580> phantom<00:06:38.420> power<00:06:38.600> in

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
set up the gain or the phantom power in

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.880 
set up the gain or the phantom power in
here<00:06:39.410> on<00:06:39.530> the<00:06:39.740> second<00:06:40.100> preamp<00:06:41.470> it's<00:06:42.470> very

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
here on the second preamp it's very

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.280 
here on the second preamp it's very
simple<00:06:43.310> you<00:06:44.150> just<00:06:44.330> have<00:06:44.480> to<00:06:44.510> see<00:06:44.840> that<00:06:45.020> the

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
simple you just have to see that the

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.070 
simple you just have to see that the
knobs<00:06:45.500> here<00:06:46.630> corresponds<00:06:47.630> the<00:06:47.780> amount<00:06:47.990> of

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
knobs here corresponds the amount of

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.110 
knobs here corresponds the amount of
gain<00:06:50.410> which<00:06:51.410> you<00:06:52.250> don't<00:06:52.460> really<00:06:52.610> want<00:06:52.850> to<00:06:52.940> mess

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 
gain which you don't really want to mess

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.680 
gain which you don't really want to mess
with<00:06:53.420> unless<00:06:54.670> you<00:06:55.670> go<00:06:55.760> back<00:06:55.790> into<00:06:56.180> the<00:06:56.330> control

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690 
with unless you go back into the control

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.740 
with unless you go back into the control
room<00:06:56.810> and<00:06:57.260> you<00:06:57.770> hear<00:06:58.130> that<00:06:58.310> it<00:06:58.580> is<00:06:58.760> either

00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.750 
room and you hear that it is either

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.440 
room and you hear that it is either
getting<00:07:00.230> way<00:07:00.320> too<00:07:00.380> much<00:07:00.710> gain<00:07:00.980> or<00:07:01.100> to<00:07:01.880> less<00:07:02.270> of

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
getting way too much gain or to less of

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.670 
getting way too much gain or to less of
gain<00:07:02.630> but<00:07:02.810> generally<00:07:03.200> we<00:07:03.290> have<00:07:03.320> a<00:07:03.470> good

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:03.680 
gain but generally we have a good

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.930 
gain but generally we have a good
balance<00:07:03.890> already<00:07:04.870> you'll<00:07:05.870> see<00:07:06.050> also<00:07:06.230> here<00:07:06.940> on

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
balance already you'll see also here on

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.270 
balance already you'll see also here on
channel<00:07:08.480> 6<00:07:08.810> we<00:07:09.320> already<00:07:09.680> have<00:07:09.860> the<00:07:10.010> phantom

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
power that you're going to be looking

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.850 
power that you're going to be looking
for<00:07:21.730> for<00:07:22.730> the<00:07:22.850> condenser<00:07:23.330> microphones<00:07:23.840> and<00:07:24.110> in

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
for for the condenser microphones and in

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.470 
for for the condenser microphones and in
particular

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:26.480 
particular

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.000 
particular
the<00:07:27.100> r122<00:07:28.100> that<00:07:28.460> we<00:07:28.550> looked<00:07:28.730> at<00:07:28.820> earlier<00:07:30.010> now

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.010 
the r122 that we looked at earlier now

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.500 
the r122 that we looked at earlier now
like<00:07:31.160> I<00:07:31.190> said<00:07:31.310> is<00:07:31.580> it<00:07:31.730> impaired<00:07:32.120> it<00:07:32.360> is

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.510 
like I said is it impaired it is
