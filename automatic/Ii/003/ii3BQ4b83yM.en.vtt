00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.429
 blur in friends in friends the book in 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 france bleu in friends as regards 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.450
 the station and the cleaning of the accessories 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.890
 there are two schools of thought 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.109
 substantially who uses 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.670
 quietly bisulfite and who 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.640
 instead of ceiling heads it does not serve to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.039
 nothing he knows nothing does not eliminate 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 nothing and use bleach 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.179
 then I say one thing this is the seventh 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.439
 beer that I do I tell you what it is 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.540
 my experience 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.450
 I have recently ordered that I do the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.890
 beer with the kit I also made a fg 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.930
 I have always used my face 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.940
 filter I also used to bleach 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.250
 however, it is not always added 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.960
 then also bisulfite used 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.700
 using the bisol up to perform 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.410
 what I did however is that some still 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.850
 taste because they are still certain 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 they still have to mature well though 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.920
 however already tasting the must 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.309
 however the beer after a short period 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.719
 of maturation did not seem at all 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.730
 pleasing to the good in the sense that not 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.530
 arrives caught some 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.750
 contamination 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.270
 so I think the ceiling is more 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.070
 that great and very comfortable to use 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.439
 I think I will continue to use 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.049
 the one who claims that of the ceiling does not 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.150
 it is known not to be good for health 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.920
 action or beautiful reserve with the 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.170
 bleach I do not use the column 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 bleach because also if used in 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.920
 small quantities and better to rinse 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.590
 place because it could stay that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.090
 bad for the taste of bleach 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.939
 mascia when they could then 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.400
 contaminate the beer as already mentioned in 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.100
 other videos so it's still like if you do 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.759
 risk again contaminating the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.770
 beer back to the starting point 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.380
 so maybe I'll get a rinse 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.250
 with hot water and bleach after 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.320
 I rinse many times 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.870
 it rinses so many times after that 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.190
 use water blows with the of 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.460
 ceiling let's say somehow 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.160
 inhibits intelligence we say so of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.930
 contaminations and minimizes while 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.780
 big g has somehow kills 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.360
 just those substances that could 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.860
 contaminate the beer that's the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.570
 this is the reasoning that 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.459
 do those who also say the bdz 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.310
 bleach or you think there is also 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.360
 acetic acid seems to me to be called 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.350
 so that it is used at the level 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.330
 professional 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.880
 the advantage of the bisol figer that not 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.260
 we must rinse it I love you there 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.880
 then again I had no problems 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.190
 I think I will continue to use the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.550
 re- clear clearly if you use more 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.160
 you might find a taste like that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.860
 sulfur in beer after but it is so 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.260
 not least you'll know I 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.580
 heard though because probably that 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.130
 when we go to bottle then 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.709
 clearly we go to saints also to give 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.440
 the bottles if we use too much bisulfite 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.150
 we didn't let it drip well 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.350
 detachment ceiling blows from the bottle 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.709
 could remain neck of the bottle 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.360
 opening 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.190
 so if we drink it especially if there 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.040
 we stick to the bottle will feel in 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.130
 mouth but only then 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.690
 only when we see the first sip 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.700
 then after the beer and very little because 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.799
 especially if we use small 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.750
 amount of bisulphite I first 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.970
 I used to behrami to recommend bar e 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.299
 4 teaspoons per liter of water 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:23.260
 I now use two teaspoons e 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.049
 half then a little more than half so 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.230
 I'm sure, however, this does not detract 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:33.100
 that being quite dangerous 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.500
 in the police don't touch certain parts 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.120
 of the accessories fermenter both 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.549
 however an important thing is 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.160
 important because we search in all 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.680
 ways to minimize contagions 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.300
 it is called so values also because the 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.060
 reasoning that I do the process a 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.150
 noon tube to prepare beer and then 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.370
 after a month or later maybe even worse 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.800
 after a year that maybe I did one 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.630
 beer that takes much longer 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.700
 maturation times of davide agreement 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.160
 looks bad unfortunately it can happen 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.510
 same though if we take many 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.930
 small tricks this then will be a 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.330
 our advantage will minimize i 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.430
 risks of contamination that there 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.870
 we will find our minds unpleasant surprises 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.110
 this is also a bit to answer 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.780
 whoever often tells me he looks is one 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.560
 crap use water blows 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:30.010
 ceiling uses bleach is a 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.640
 personal thing I feel good like that 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.420
 so in this long introduction 60 everyone 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.330
 the accessories 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:43.200
 so the fermenter taps who it was 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.200
 gaskets etc. 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.590
 there is 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.590
 more 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:13.250
 shut up 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.250
 but 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:22.740
 you bubble 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:22.740
 the truth yes yes 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.350
 but up 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.409
 or 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.309
 all 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:36.309
 Christmas
