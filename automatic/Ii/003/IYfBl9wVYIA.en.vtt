also<00:02:59.349> going<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> use<00:02:59.739> four<00:03:00.040> different<00:03:00.159> games

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
also going to use four different games

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.339 
also going to use four different games

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
Just Cause 2 and Sleeping Dogs so some

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.270 
Just Cause 2 and Sleeping Dogs so some
of<00:03:08.049> these<00:03:08.140> games<00:03:08.409> have<00:03:08.739> their<00:03:08.890> own<00:03:08.980> built-in

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
of these games have their own built-in

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.460 
of these games have their own built-in
benchmarking<00:03:10.180> software<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.170> we're<00:03:11.290> going<00:03:11.409> to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
benchmarking software so we're going to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.930 
benchmarking software so we're going to
use<00:03:11.560> those<00:03:11.769> to<00:03:11.950> record<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.370> average<00:03:12.640> frame

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
use those to record the average frame

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.610 
use those to record the average frame
rates<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.420> those<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.049> don't<00:03:14.290> we're<00:03:14.530> going

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:44.860 
rates and those that don't we're going
to<00:03:14.709> use<00:03:14.799> fraps<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.400> record<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:16.090> benchmarking

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.959 

so<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.709> guys<00:03:46.920> have<00:03:47.069> seen<00:03:47.189> the<00:03:47.340> results<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:47.969 
so you guys have seen the results and

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:50.179 
so you guys have seen the results and
you<00:03:48.150> know<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.560> 77070<00:03:49.560> wins<00:03:49.739> four<00:03:50.069> out<00:03:50.159> of

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
you know that 77070 wins four out of

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:53.149 
you know that 77070 wins four out of
five<00:03:50.400> times<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.780> 650<00:03:52.319> is<00:03:52.530> won<00:03:52.680> in<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.920> games

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
five times the 650 is won in the games

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.099 
five times the 650 is won in the games
like<00:03:53.400> Borderlands<00:03:53.819> 2<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.749> really<00:03:54.959> at<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.079> end

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
like Borderlands 2 so really at the end

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.750 
like Borderlands 2 so really at the end
of<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.409> day<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.769> depends<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.459> games

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
of the day it depends on what games

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.250 
of the day it depends on what games
you're<00:03:56.939> playing<00:03:56.969> of<00:03:57.450> how<00:03:57.689> the<00:03:57.749> graphics<00:03:58.170> will

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
you're playing of how the graphics will

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.849 
you're playing of how the graphics will
perform<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.930> clear<00:04:01.170> winner<00:04:01.379> here<00:04:01.469> is<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
perform so the clear winner here is the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.940 
perform so the clear winner here is the
7-7<00:04:02.609> 70<00:04:03.090> but<00:04:03.480> performance<00:04:03.959> may<00:04:04.109> vary<00:04:04.439> join<00:04:04.769> to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
7-7 70 but performance may vary join to

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.619 
7-7 70 but performance may vary join to
what<00:04:05.099> vendor<00:04:05.639> you're<00:04:05.760> going<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:05.969> get<00:04:06.150> some<00:04:06.599> of

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
what vendor you're going to get some of

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.179 
what vendor you're going to get some of
them<00:04:06.780> come<00:04:06.989> factory<00:04:07.439> overclock<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.069> there

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
them come factory overclock so there

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.289 
them come factory overclock so there
might<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.519> slight<00:04:08.879> increase<00:04:09.180> in

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
might be a slight increase in

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.690 
might be a slight increase in
performance<00:04:09.900> rather<00:04:10.319> than<00:04:10.590> that<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.159> 650

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
performance rather than that the 650

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.059 
performance rather than that the 650
wins<00:04:11.909> in<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.780> small<00:04:13.290> majority<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.889> games

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
wins in the small majority of the games

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.249 
wins in the small majority of the games
that<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.340> tested<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.299> some<00:04:15.540> other<00:04:15.629> games<00:04:15.930> might

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
that we tested so some other games might

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.830 
that we tested so some other games might
be<00:04:16.500> very<00:04:16.799> good<00:04:16.979> for<00:04:17.099> the<00:04:17.160> 650<00:04:17.699> as<00:04:17.789> well<00:04:18.030> but<00:04:18.570> for

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
be very good for the 650 as well but for

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.879 
be very good for the 650 as well but for
the<00:04:18.959> majority<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.320> games<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.680> we<00:04:19.769> have

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
the majority of games that we have

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.009 
the majority of games that we have
tested<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.489> 7-7<00:04:21.030> 70<00:04:21.359> is<00:04:21.509> the<00:04:21.630> outright<00:04:21.989> winner

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
tested the 7-7 70 is the outright winner

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.469 
tested the 7-7 70 is the outright winner
it's<00:04:22.710> also<00:04:22.889> cheaper<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:24.030> has<00:04:24.150> better

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
it's also cheaper and it has better

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.570 
it's also cheaper and it has better
performance<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.560> if<00:04:25.650> you're<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.919> budget<00:04:26.130> the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
performance so if you're in a budget the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.870 
performance so if you're in a budget the
77070<00:04:27.419> might<00:04:27.660> be<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:27.990> card<00:04:28.199> for<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.340> GTX

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
77070 might be the card for you the GTX

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.180 
77070 might be the card for you the GTX
650<00:04:30.270> has<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.660> smaller<00:04:31.080> form<00:04:31.470> factor<00:04:31.889> so<00:04:32.039> if

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
650 has a smaller form factor so if

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.439 
650 has a smaller form factor so if
you're<00:04:32.310> planning<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.669> building<00:04:32.820> a<00:04:33.030> mini<00:04:33.270> ITX

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
you're planning on building a mini ITX

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.719 
you're planning on building a mini ITX
build<00:04:34.020> then<00:04:34.470> it<00:04:34.590> should<00:04:34.830> be<00:04:34.860> a<00:04:35.160> lot<00:04:35.520> more

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
build then it should be a lot more

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.810 
build then it should be a lot more
compact<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.479> could<00:04:36.990> be<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.199> card<00:04:37.380> for<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:37.820> so

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
compact and could be the card for you so

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.610 
compact and could be the card for you so
thanks<00:04:39.180> guys<00:04:39.330> for<00:04:39.360> checking<00:04:39.840> out<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.139> GPU
