across my 24 inch monitor and I record

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.370 
across my 24 inch monitor and I record
half-size<00:03:35.930> going<00:03:36.470> 1920<00:03:37.310> x<00:03:37.400> 1080<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:38.380> the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
half-size going 1920 x 1080 and the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.990 
half-size going 1920 x 1080 and the
quality<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:39.680> actually<00:03:39.920> pretty<00:03:40.040> nice<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.549> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
quality is actually pretty nice and the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.020 
quality is actually pretty nice and the
frame<00:03:41.209> rate<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.450> really<00:03:42.080> don't<00:03:42.380> get<00:03:42.500> any<00:03:43.340> lag<00:03:43.880> on

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
frame rate I really don't get any lag on

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.430 
frame rate I really don't get any lag on
the<00:03:44.090> thermite<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.450> I'm<00:03:44.540> able<00:03:44.630> to<00:03:44.810> play<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.200> my

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
the thermite so I'm able to play to my

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.680 
the thermite so I'm able to play to my
full<00:03:46.340> capacity<00:03:46.880> which<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.060> really<00:03:47.299> great<00:03:47.480> and

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
full capacity which is really great and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.800 
full capacity which is really great and
so<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:48.769> is<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> shorter<00:03:49.310> game<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.330> just<00:03:50.660> want

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
so this is a shorter game so I just want

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.020 
so this is a shorter game so I just want
