00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.470
 and hide something else about it 1 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.950
 it's just such a hammer 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.810
 Hammer horny video noted that here 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.610
 also have interest to your person 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.170
 many have asked them understand German 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.420
 yes she understands German because as I said 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.220
 half to half german and it is 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.060
 my cousin lives in america too 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.860
 born and when the family picks up in 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.840
 seattle and she is then for study 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.430
 moved to california and also the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.680
 she also does the job she does now 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.170
 also in california and because of that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.320
 I'll have you there in the summer 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.240
 tried and so it really is one 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.820
 quite a big thing for her is and 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.980
 she has this project incidentally because it 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200
 hold your biggest dream 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.090
 and she did it somehow 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.250
 besides, with the support of friends 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.810
 this project so at least a bit 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.150
 to roll in and come now 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.150
 we get involved and I hope so much 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.250
 on my community are mega mega 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.350
 Hammer horny if you from germany 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.790
 can really support him and he 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.110
 maybe then at some point 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.069
 bring to germany that they stop 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.929
 here might somehow sometimes a 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.160
 So concert culminates even if you have 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.260
 her first single 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 published and the video to the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.300
 song is called time travel as well as that 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.940
 album what then in january 2015 so now 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.130
 comes out in the coming January and there 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.640
 we come into play as a community 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.860
 and that's the way it should be 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.260
 crowdfunding project has started thinking 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.600
 at $ 10 dollars 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.040
 gives 25 dollars so different packages 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.750
 So once you can the song 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.630
 then download the whole album 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.730
 imagine that's just mega because that 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.250
 allows her to keep going if 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.310
 we already preorder the album and me 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.600
 I really do not want gravel on it now 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.310
 force or encourage your pocket money 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.340
 spending is one finds us 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.180
 is and she mega mega cool but if 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.180
 you have no money or do not want to 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.620
 or whatever knows complete 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.270
 Understanding is with me on mr 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.250
 say you buy the essential for you 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.530
 he also calls attention to that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.180
 If possible in your own way 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.760
 is and if he is interested in it 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.710
 but the real thing is that me 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.530
 to access my care community 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.110
 because it's about social 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.270
 media this project and this song and 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.740
 So spread this video 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.120
 crowdfunding there is everything again 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.660
 I explain this link in the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.920
 infobox 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.660
 you can do it all in the infobox 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.950
 I really just read about it 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.959
 that we spread that it 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.940
 as many people as possible see that 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.770
 Video many clicks gets that page 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.240
 this is enough for the clicks 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.430
 even if you have the song if it is you 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.040
 Like the video on the pinboard of 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.989

 instagram supports and so on or 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.470
