and<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> half<00:00:35.010> months<00:00:35.340> away<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.000> quite<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and a half months away that's quite a

and a half months away that's quite a
long<00:00:36.630> time<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.520> the<00:00:38.520> un<00:00:38.850> diplomat<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.420> charge

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
of this whole operation also thinks that

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.299 
of this whole operation also thinks that
it<00:00:42.120> will<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.270> done<00:00:42.510> by<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.750> june<00:00:43.020> thirtieth<00:00:43.530> so

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
will miss it certainly though some of

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
is it is there any way possible you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.369 
is it is there any way possible you
think<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> rebels<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.809> get<00:00:57.960> their<00:00:58.079> hands

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
think for the rebels to get their hands

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.750 
think for the rebels to get their hands
on<00:00:58.590> these<00:00:58.710> chemical<00:00:59.129> weapons<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.640> might

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
on these chemical weapons one might

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
on these chemical weapons one might
imagine<00:00:59.850> armored<00:01:00.600> brigades<00:01:01.039> delivering

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039

these<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> coast<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.120> onto<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.449> ships

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
these to the coast to get onto the ships

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.980 
these to the coast to get onto the ships
might<00:01:04.140> stick<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.830> sore<00:01:04.920> thumb<00:01:05.810> yes<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
might stick out like a sore thumb yes I

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510 
might stick out like a sore thumb yes I
think<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.530> unlucky<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.250> mean<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
think that's very unlucky I mean and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.890 
think that's very unlucky I mean and
they<00:01:08.640> are<00:01:08.760> well<00:01:08.970> guarded<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.780> are

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
they are well guarded but there are

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.300 
they are well guarded but there are
security<00:01:10.229> problems<00:01:10.770> obviously<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
security problems obviously the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.630 
security problems obviously the
country's<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.060> middle<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> civil<00:01:12.689> war<00:01:12.960> so

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640

truly come together well I think it'll

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.770 
truly come together well I think it'll
take<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.340> gradual<00:01:38.700> ization<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.299> both<00:01:39.509> sides

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
take a gradual ization on both sides

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
take a gradual ization on both sides
that<00:01:39.990> there<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.259> no<00:01:40.409> military<00:01:40.560> solution<00:01:40.860> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that there is no military solution that

that there is no military solution that
neither<00:01:41.640> side<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.600> win<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.079> mean<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
neither side can win I mean I think that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
neither side can win I mean I think that
Assad<00:01:44.460> yes<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> any<00:01:44.970> independent<00:01:45.600> observer

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
Assad yes to any independent observer

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
Assad yes to any independent observer
but<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.579> know<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.850> hard<00:01:48.000> four<00:01:48.240> sides<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
but you know it's hard four sides to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
but you know it's hard four sides to
admit<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.170> they've<00:01:49.590> spent<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.220> money

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
admit that they've spent all this money

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.940 
admit that they've spent all this money
and<00:01:50.610> treasure<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.299> lost<00:01:51.509> lives<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.770> not

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and treasure and lost lives for not

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.609 
and treasure and lost lives for not
getting<00:01:53.729> victory<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.570> they<00:01:54.750> still<00:01:55.049> cling

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
getting victory and so they still cling

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.249 
getting victory and so they still cling
to<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.860> hope<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.490> think<00:01:56.780> over<00:01:57.780> time<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
to that hope but I think over time I

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
to that hope but I think over time I
think<00:01:58.680> with<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> UN<00:01:59.250> pressure<00:01:59.790> from<00:02:00.119> la<00:02:00.390> la

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
radicals well I that's one reason why

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
think the future holds for our sad I

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.890 
think the future holds for our sad I
think<00:03:55.889> it's<00:03:56.040> highly<00:03:56.370> dubious<00:03:57.120> it's<00:03:57.510> very<00:03:57.690> hard

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
think it's highly dubious it's very hard

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.349 
think it's highly dubious it's very hard
to<00:03:57.989> know<00:03:58.199> at<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.409> moment<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.970> know<00:04:00.090> there<00:04:00.269> is

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
to know at the moment you know there is

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.330 
to know at the moment you know there is
a<00:04:00.389> civil<00:04:00.720> war<00:04:00.930> much<00:04:01.349> more<00:04:01.560> severe<00:04:02.129> than

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
a civil war much more severe than

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.909 
a civil war much more severe than
anything<00:04:02.879> yep<00:04:03.120> yeah<00:04:03.720> and<00:04:04.169> quite<00:04:04.530> different

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
anything yep yeah and quite different

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.869 
anything yep yeah and quite different
from<00:04:06.409> Iraq<00:04:07.409> so<00:04:08.040> we<00:04:08.250> can't<00:04:08.489> really<00:04:08.549> look<00:04:08.760> at

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
from Iraq so we can't really look at

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.610 
from Iraq so we can't really look at
those<00:04:09.060> parallels<00:04:09.510> no<00:04:09.690> there<00:04:10.260> has<00:04:10.379> to<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.530> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
those parallels no there has to be a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.469 
those parallels no there has to be a
negotiated<00:04:11.159> settlement<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:12.000> idea<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.389> to

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
negotiated settlement the idea is to

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.949 
negotiated settlement the idea is to
have<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.780> transitional<00:04:13.409> government<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.979> then

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
have a transitional government and then

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.509 
have a transitional government and then
maybe<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.109> said<00:04:16.409> will<00:04:16.590> not<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.889> a<00:04:16.919> candidate<00:04:17.370> in

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
maybe I said will not be a candidate in

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.490 
maybe I said will not be a candidate in
the<00:04:17.760> presidential<00:04:18.479> elections<00:04:19.169> or<00:04:19.320> will

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
the presidential elections or will

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.990 
the presidential elections or will
resign<00:04:19.859> at<00:04:20.039> some<00:04:20.220> point<00:04:20.459> but<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.789> crucial

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
resign at some point but the crucial

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300 
resign at some point but the crucial
thing<00:04:21.180> really<00:04:21.539> shouldn't<00:04:22.409> be<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.800> focus<00:04:22.979> on

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
thing really shouldn't be to focus on

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.100 
thing really shouldn't be to focus on
one<00:04:23.550> man<00:04:23.789> and
