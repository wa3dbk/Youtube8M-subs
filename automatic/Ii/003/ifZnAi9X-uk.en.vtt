00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.670
 nights here jochy de reinno tissier o 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.209
 puntocom this is a special report 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.670
 stores in the US or state armories 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.880
 united resort to the rationing of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.130
 bullets so is gun shops around 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.890
 America are turning to a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 bullet rationing the owners 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.740
 of stores say they have never seen the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.840
 shortages of this kind in their lives and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.699
 blaming the big purchases of 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.770
 ammunition by the government 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:43.170
 federal of the USA so it is if you do not know 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.140
 the federal government bought 2 thousand 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.989
 millions of bullets that was not the army 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.170
 that was not the US Navy that was not 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 the air force simply the government 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.379
 federal bought 2 billion bullets and 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.309
 so that they have a perspective of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.980
 how many bullets are those if each person 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.680
 who has the right to use weapons or who 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.480
 is working for the federal government 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.510
 and that you can use a weapon 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.360
 if they will fire 100 bullets daily 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.980
 it would take us 40 years to get those 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.010
 bullets in irak nor in honey on top 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.500
 of the Iraq war and afghanistan the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.650
 government in front of him the government bought 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.860
 so many bullets at that time they were 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.020
 buying 2 to 3 million bullets 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.890
 monthly because the federal government of 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.160
 the us is buying so many bullets is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 who expect something to happen or is it 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.070
 they hope to suppress citizens 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.950
 Americans, I do not know why he's 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.760
 happening but because they bought 2000 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.880
 millions of bullets yo yo and in my family 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.810
 we like to shoot if we like to go 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.329
 To shoot 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.460
 it took me almost a month to be able to 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.909
 get bullets for several of my 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.220
 rifles for me to be able to go with my children and 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.090
 spend a quiet day shooting 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.790
 true to white obviously 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.950
 because the US is doing that because the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.019
 federal government is doing what it is 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.410
 what is happening what is going to 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.590
 happen 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.470
 because they are preparing 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.220
 only time says it is something that 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.440
 I think re newscast has to spread 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.080
 he has to say what is happening 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.120
 because obviously and it is obvious that the 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.090
 media will never talk about this 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.069
 but that is true 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.349
 and it is very alarming 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.090
 well that's why I leave you thanks for watching 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.700
 the newscast this is a story 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.109
 special I am me yes thank you and that god 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.109
