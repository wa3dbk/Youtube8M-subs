down<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.270> as<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.259> back<00:02:10.530> these<00:02:11.039> lemons<00:02:11.459> will

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
down and as we go back these lemons will

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.340 
down and as we go back these lemons will
get

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
get

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.130 
get
short<00:02:12.590> or<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.250> one<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.670> long<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.900> one's

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
short or so this one is long this one's

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.260 
short or so this one is long this one's
a<00:02:15.260> little<00:02:15.410> shorter<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:16.820> one<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.090> the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
a little shorter and this one is the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.050 
a little shorter and this one is the
shortest<00:02:17.870> same<00:02:18.800> thing<00:02:19.040> over<00:02:19.220> here<00:02:19.370> kind<00:02:19.940> of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
shortest same thing over here kind of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.640 
shortest same thing over here kind of
this<00:02:20.210> one's<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.540> little<00:02:20.720> longer<00:02:20.990> it's<00:02:21.380> not<00:02:21.560> as

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
this one's a little longer it's not as

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.960 
this one's a little longer it's not as
long<00:02:21.830> as<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.100> one<00:02:22.310> because<00:02:22.400> it's<00:02:22.670> further

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
long as this one because it's further

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.540 
long as this one because it's further
back<00:02:23.330> than<00:02:24.020> this<00:02:24.470> one<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:24.920> then<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.340> one's

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
back than this one and then this one's

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.270 
back than this one and then this one's
going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.730> be<00:02:26.140> not<00:02:27.140> quite<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.710> same<00:02:27.950> height

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
going to be not quite the same height

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.600 
going to be not quite the same height
and<00:02:28.580> now<00:02:29.450> all<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:29.990> do<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.170> kind<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:30.950> move<00:02:31.130> this

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
and now all you do is kind of move this

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.430 
and now all you do is kind of move this
line<00:02:31.880> down<00:02:32.240> or<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.750> just<00:02:32.960> draw<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.230> line

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
line down or you just draw a line

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.980 
line down or you just draw a line
parallel<00:02:33.710> to<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.480> doesn't<00:02:35.630> have<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.870> be

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
parallel to it and it doesn't have to be

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.720 
parallel to it and it doesn't have to be
perfectly<00:02:36.380> straight<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:37.070> can<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.370> kind<00:02:37.640> of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
perfectly straight it can be kind of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.760 
perfectly straight it can be kind of
wavy<00:02:38.210> but<00:02:38.420> let's<00:02:38.750> see<00:02:38.990> how<00:02:39.080> this<00:02:39.320> one<00:02:39.500> turns

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
wavy but let's see how this one turns

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.640 
wavy but let's see how this one turns
out<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.100> kind<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.520> line<00:02:40.730> going<00:02:41.060> like<00:02:41.330> that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
out just kind of a line going like that

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.200 
out just kind of a line going like that
and<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:43.280> we're<00:02:43.550> just<00:02:43.580> going<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.880> kind<00:02:44.090> of

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
and this one we're just going to kind of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.350 
and this one we're just going to kind of
follow<00:02:44.450> right<00:02:45.020> off<00:02:45.230> this<00:02:45.680> way<00:02:45.940> this<00:02:46.940> will<00:02:47.210> be

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
follow right off this way this will be

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.420 
follow right off this way this will be
kind<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.780> cool<00:02:47.990> because<00:02:48.320> we'll<00:02:48.650> hit<00:02:48.920> here

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
kind of cool because we'll hit here

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
kind of cool because we'll hit here
we'll<00:02:50.180> stop<00:02:50.510> here<00:02:50.750> we're<00:02:50.930> going<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.110> pick<00:02:51.350> it

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
we'll stop here we're going to pick it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.130 
we'll stop here we're going to pick it
up<00:02:51.620> right<00:02:52.100> over<00:02:52.160> there<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:53.570> one's<00:02:53.900> going<00:02:54.080> to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
up right over there this one's going to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.530 
up right over there this one's going to
go<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.530> way<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:57.500> like<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.490> you'll<00:02:59.270> kind<00:02:59.510> of

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
go this way you like that you'll kind of

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.100 
go this way you like that you'll kind of
want<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.750> get<00:02:59.870> it<00:03:00.020> right<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.530> edge<00:03:00.680> there

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
want to get it right to the edge there

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.170 
want to get it right to the edge there
curve<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.320> a<00:03:03.380> little<00:03:03.620> bit<00:03:03.790> this<00:03:04.790> one<00:03:05.000> we're

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
curve it a little bit this one we're

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.610 
curve it a little bit this one we're
going<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.330> start<00:03:05.420> right<00:03:05.750> here<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.290> kind<00:03:06.500> of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
going to start right here and kind of

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.280 
going to start right here and kind of
bring<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.010> up<00:03:07.760> actually<00:03:08.690> well<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.020> can<00:03:09.140> go

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
bring it up actually well you can go

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.960 
bring it up actually well you can go
further<00:03:09.830> up<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.930> Boop<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:13.040> this<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.490> we're

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
further up just Boop and this one we're

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.090 
further up just Boop and this one we're
going<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.120> kind<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.450> go<00:03:14.630> like<00:03:15.200> that<00:03:15.440> now

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
going to kind of go like that now

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.550 
going to kind of go like that now
there's<00:03:16.430> no<00:03:16.700> line<00:03:17.420> really<00:03:17.930> right<00:03:18.080> here<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.440> we

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
there's no line really right here but we

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.250 
there's no line really right here but we
want<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:18.860> make<00:03:19.040> one<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.610> just<00:03:20.450> kind<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.780> shrink

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
want to make one and just kind of shrink

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.350 
want to make one and just kind of shrink
it<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:22.250> it's<00:03:22.430> going<00:03:22.610> off<00:03:22.820> in<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.180> distance

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
it so it's going off in the distance

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.900 
it so it's going off in the distance
that's<00:03:24.350> basically<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.280> little<00:03:25.550> trick<00:03:25.880> here

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
that's basically the little trick here

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.960 
that's basically the little trick here
and<00:03:26.500> now<00:03:27.500> all<00:03:27.710> you<00:03:27.860> need<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.700> need<00:03:28.760> to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
and now all you need is you need to

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.850 
and now all you need is you need to
imagine<00:03:29.150> there's<00:03:29.570> some<00:03:29.840> like<00:03:30.080> liquid<00:03:30.620> going

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
imagine there's some like liquid going

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.800 
imagine there's some like liquid going
through<00:03:31.130> here<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.520> I'll<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.570> other

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
through here and I'll have other

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.090 
through here and I'll have other
tutorials<00:03:33.530> where<00:03:33.680> I'll<00:03:33.740> show<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.980> how<00:03:34.040> to

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
tutorials where I'll show you how to

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.670 
tutorials where I'll show you how to
draw<00:03:34.340> like<00:03:34.520> toxic<00:03:35.000> sludge<00:03:35.270> but<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:36.320> is<00:03:36.500> just

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
draw like toxic sludge but this is just

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.380 
draw like toxic sludge but this is just
going<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.830> be<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:36.980> kind<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.430> really<00:03:37.880> quick<00:03:38.120> one

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
going to be a kind of a really quick one

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.710 
going to be a kind of a really quick one
you<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.350> just<00:03:40.340> getting<00:03:40.610> some<00:03:40.850> wavy<00:03:41.150> lines

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
you and just getting some wavy lines

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.680 
you and just getting some wavy lines
like<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:43.160> know<00:03:43.250> here's<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.610> little<00:03:43.700> thing<00:03:44.150> of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
like you know here's a little thing of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.630 
like you know here's a little thing of
liquid<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.320> then<00:03:45.470> there's<00:03:45.740> another<00:03:45.890> one<00:03:46.400> and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
liquid and then there's another one and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.110 
liquid and then there's another one and
then<00:03:47.300> over<00:03:47.630> here<00:03:48.340> you've<00:03:49.340> got<00:03:49.370> some<00:03:49.790> lines

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
then over here you've got some lines

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.510 
then over here you've got some lines
going<00:03:50.570> across<00:03:50.900> like<00:03:51.020> this<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> line

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
going across like this and the line

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.570 
going across like this and the line
going<00:03:52.820> over<00:03:53.680> your<00:03:54.680> fly<00:03:55.070> down<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.530> you're

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
going over your fly down and you're

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.980 
going over your fly down and you're
coming<00:03:58.580> from<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:58.970> way<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.270> the<00:03:59.450> flow<00:03:59.780> the

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
coming from this way so the flow the

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.560 
coming from this way so the flow the
water<00:04:00.200> is<00:04:00.350> going<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.680> go<00:04:00.770> in<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.100> way<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:01.610> we

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
water is going to go in that way so we

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.210 
water is going to go in that way so we
want<00:04:02.780> to<00:04:02.900> kind<00:04:03.110> of<00:04:03.170> get<00:04:03.380> that<00:04:03.560> idea<00:04:03.980> like

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
want to kind of get that idea like

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.290 
want to kind of get that idea like
little<00:04:04.640> wavy<00:04:04.880> lines<00:04:05.860> going<00:04:06.860> off<00:04:07.190> in<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
little wavy lines going off in the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.810 
little wavy lines going off in the
distance<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:09.290> cuts<00:04:09.650> them<00:04:09.860> off<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.490> makes<00:04:10.640> them

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
distance and cuts them off it makes them

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.260 
distance and cuts them off it makes them
look<00:04:10.970> like<00:04:11.030> they're<00:04:11.270> coming<00:04:11.630> around<00:04:11.750> and

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
look like they're coming around and

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.940 
look like they're coming around and
that's<00:04:14.270> basically<00:04:14.720> it<00:04:14.840> and<00:04:14.990> you<00:04:15.320> cut<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.620> play

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
that's basically it and you cut a play

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.789 
that's basically it and you cut a play
around<00:04:16.160> with<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:17.270> know<00:04:17.299> how<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.049> lines<00:04:18.440> look

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
around with you know how the lines look

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.159 
around with you know how the lines look
you<00:04:19.280> know<00:04:19.400> here<00:04:19.970> we<00:04:20.060> go<00:04:20.180> this<00:04:20.660> is<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.870> good<00:04:21.049> one

way you
a<00:04:24.169> little<00:04:24.800> waviness<00:04:25.249> to<00:04:25.610> them<00:04:25.759> and<00:04:26.620> just<00:04:27.620> kind

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
a little waviness to them and just kind

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.379 
a little waviness to them and just kind
of<00:04:27.949> just<00:04:28.219> keep<00:04:28.430> doing<00:04:28.789> that<00:04:28.909> and<00:04:29.090> you're<00:04:29.210> going

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
you know the lines might make little

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.809 
you know the lines might make little
waves<00:04:36.050> coming<00:04:36.620> around<00:04:36.919> this<00:04:37.159> they<00:04:37.400> might<00:04:37.580> hit

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
waves coming around this they might hit

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.089 
waves coming around this they might hit
here<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.840> again<00:04:39.259> I'll<00:04:39.409> show<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.650> how<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.800> draw

I'm<00:04:56.779> going<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:56.990> color<00:04:57.229> this<00:04:57.469> in<00:04:57.770> you'll<00:04:58.069> see

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
I'm going to color this in you'll see

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.670 
I'm going to color this in you'll see
it'll<00:04:58.520> pop<00:04:58.789> out<00:04:58.969> a<00:04:59.029> little<00:04:59.300> more<00:04:59.539> if<00:05:00.469> you're

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
it'll pop out a little more if you're

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.110 
it'll pop out a little more if you're
not<00:05:00.830> going<00:05:00.979> to<00:05:01.039> color<00:05:01.279> you<00:05:01.580> might<00:05:01.759> want<00:05:02.000> to

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
not going to color you might want to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.070 
not going to color you might want to
just<00:05:02.509> draw<00:05:02.779> shape<00:05:03.710> this<00:05:04.159> lines<00:05:04.879> the<00:05:05.569> light<00:05:05.779> of

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
just draw shape this lines the light of

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.159 
just draw shape this lines the light of
this<00:05:06.409> part<00:05:07.129> going<00:05:07.460> down<00:05:07.639> with<00:05:07.879> lines<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:09.080> know

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
this part going down with lines you know

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.929 
this part going down with lines you know
just<00:05:09.409> going<00:05:09.650> up<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:09.889> down<00:05:09.979> something<00:05:10.520> that

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939 
just going up and down something that

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.540 
just going up and down something that
simple<00:05:11.509> will<00:05:11.689> work<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.199> you'll<00:05:13.189> see<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.520> looks

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
simple will work and you'll see it looks

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.209 
simple will work and you'll see it looks
more<00:05:14.090> like<00:05:14.300> a<00:05:14.330> cliff<00:05:14.750> I'm<00:05:15.650> not<00:05:15.889> going<00:05:16.039> to<00:05:16.099> do

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:16.219 
more like a cliff I'm not going to do

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:17.980 
more like a cliff I'm not going to do
that<00:05:16.339> I'm<00:05:16.460> going<00:05:16.550> to<00:05:16.610> just<00:05:16.819> color<00:05:17.120> that<00:05:17.419> a<00:05:17.449> dark

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
that I'm going to just color that a dark

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.110 
that I'm going to just color that a dark
color<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.250> a<00:05:19.279> little<00:05:19.400> lighter<00:05:19.759> color

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
color and this a little lighter color

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.929 
color and this a little lighter color
and<00:05:20.240> I'll<00:05:20.509> pop<00:05:20.779> out<00:05:20.990> but<00:05:21.740> let<00:05:21.860> me<00:05:21.949> just<00:05:22.159> go<00:05:22.370> very

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
and I'll pop out but let me just go very

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:23.649 
and I'll pop out but let me just go very
quickly

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
quickly

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.390 
quickly
and<00:05:23.749> let's<00:05:24.229> say<00:05:24.409> we<00:05:24.589> want<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.860> make<00:05:24.979> this<00:05:25.189> look

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
and let's say we want to make this look

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.450 
and let's say we want to make this look
like<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.669> little<00:05:25.849> more<00:05:26.449> of<00:05:26.599> a<00:05:27.129> planet<00:05:28.129> so<00:05:28.430> we

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
like a little more of a planet so we

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.399 
like a little more of a planet so we
just<00:05:28.699> some<00:05:29.210> squiggly<00:05:29.539> lines

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
just some squiggly lines

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.179 
just some squiggly lines
eep-eep<00:05:30.979> maybe<00:05:32.050> look<00:05:33.050> at<00:05:33.139> that<00:05:33.319> go<00:05:33.650> easy<00:05:33.919> that

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
eep-eep maybe look at that go easy that

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:37.390 
eep-eep maybe look at that go easy that
is<00:05:34.479> G<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.719> just<00:05:36.500> kind<00:05:36.680> of<00:05:36.770> connect<00:05:37.129> to<00:05:37.279> this

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
is G and just kind of connect to this

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.320 
is G and just kind of connect to this
this<00:05:38.330> flat<00:05:38.659> line<00:05:38.689> the<00:05:39.199> horizon<00:05:39.740> line<00:05:39.919> and<00:05:40.330> we

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
this flat line the horizon line and we

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.290 
this flat line the horizon line and we
can<00:05:41.360> go<00:05:41.689> like<00:05:41.930> crazy<00:05:42.229> maybe<00:05:42.710> it's<00:05:43.120> really<00:05:44.120> we

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
can go like crazy maybe it's really we

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.589 
can go like crazy maybe it's really we
got<00:05:44.389> weird<00:05:44.810> planet<00:05:45.469> or<00:05:45.589> something

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
got weird planet or something

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:50.860 
got weird planet or something
and<00:05:47.949> here's<00:05:48.949> another<00:05:49.099> to<00:05:49.879> some<00:05:50.149> these<00:05:50.539> are<00:05:50.750> in

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
and here's another to some these are in

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.749 
and here's another to some these are in
the<00:05:50.990> distance<00:05:51.469> so<00:05:51.649> they're<00:05:51.830> behind<00:05:52.370> these

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
the distance so they're behind these

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.559 
the distance so they're behind these
lines<00:05:53.949> and<00:05:55.300> doo-doo-doo-doo

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
lines and doo-doo-doo-doo
