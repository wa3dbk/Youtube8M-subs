whole game from start to finish and for
us<00:01:53.140> as<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.409> matter<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.939> sticking<00:01:54.939> with<00:01:55.240> them<00:01:55.479> and

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
us as a matter of sticking with them and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.889 
us as a matter of sticking with them and
sticking<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.740> what<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:57.009> do<00:01:57.219> I<00:01:57.659> don't<00:01:58.659> know<00:01:58.810> if

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
sticking to what we do I don't know if

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.109 
sticking to what we do I don't know if
we<00:01:59.079> can<00:01:59.229> sing<00:01:59.890> about<00:02:00.039> one<00:02:00.280> difference<00:02:00.820> between

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
we can sing about one difference between

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.719 
we can sing about one difference between
the<00:02:01.240> two<00:02:01.420> teams<00:02:01.750> but<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:03.189> know<00:02:03.310> if<00:02:03.399> we<00:02:03.460> can<00:02:03.640> go

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
the two teams but you know if we can go

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.789 
the two teams but you know if we can go
see<00:02:03.969> force<00:02:04.210> if<00:02:04.360> with<00:02:04.750> them<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.229> put<00:02:05.710> ourselves

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
see force if with them and put ourselves

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.130 
see force if with them and put ourselves
in<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.250> position<00:02:06.280> with<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.479> know<00:02:07.570> five<00:02:07.840> ten<00:02:08.050> to

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
in a position with you know five ten to

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.110 
in a position with you know five ten to
go<00:02:08.290> with<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.680> scores<00:02:08.950> near<00:02:09.160> war<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:10.000> know

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
go with the scores near war you know

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.030 
go with the scores near war you know
pretty<00:02:10.510> close<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:11.110> we<00:02:11.230> we<00:02:11.680> back<00:02:11.890> ourselves

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
pretty close that we we back ourselves

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.810 
pretty close that we we back ourselves
towards<00:02:12.960> or<00:02:13.960> for<00:02:14.380> someone<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:14.950> something

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
towards or for someone to do something

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.370 
towards or for someone to do something
good<00:02:15.940> for<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.150> team<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:17.140> that's<00:02:17.290> our

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
good for the team but I think that's our

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.650 
good for the team but I think that's our
biggest<00:02:20.400> thing<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.580> worry<00:02:22.030> about<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.360> what<00:02:22.510> we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
biggest thing to worry about is what we

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.590 
biggest thing to worry about is what we
can<00:02:22.840> do<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:23.290> obviously<00:02:24.300> stick<00:02:25.300> out<00:02:25.450> it

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
can do and that's obviously stick out it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.420 
can do and that's obviously stick out it
for<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.230> whole<00:02:26.410> game<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.650> put

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
for that for the whole game and put

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.590 
for that for the whole game and put
ourselves<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:27.940> position<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.390> take<00:02:28.540> the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
ourselves in the position to take the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.020 
ourselves in the position to take the
win<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:29.020> need<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.730> guess<00:02:30.730> we<00:02:30.850> learned

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
win if we need to I guess we learned

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.450 
win if we need to I guess we learned
from<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.630> game<00:02:32.200> last<00:02:32.500> weekend<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.340> was

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
from the game last weekend that that was

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.950 
from the game last weekend that that was
the<00:02:33.550> case<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.680> guess<00:02:36.490> with<00:02:36.670> any<00:02:37.630> game

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
the case and I guess with any game

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.050 
the case and I guess with any game
against<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.320> good<00:02:38.500> side<00:02:38.730> you're<00:02:39.730> not<00:02:39.790> going<00:02:40.000> to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
against a good side you're not going to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.690 
against a good side you're not going to
win<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.390> first<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:41.440> know<00:02:41.560> ten<00:02:42.430> twenty

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
win in the first you know ten twenty

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.270 
win in the first you know ten twenty
minutes<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.350> can<00:02:44.350> lose<00:02:44.530> games<00:02:44.800> here<00:02:45.010> but<00:02:45.160> you

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
minutes you can lose games here but you

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.550 
minutes you can lose games here but you
can't<00:02:45.490> win<00:02:45.640> them<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.020> for<00:02:47.020> us<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.320> just<00:02:47.410> to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
can't win them and for us it's just to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.490 
can't win them and for us it's just to
put<00:02:47.710> ourselves<00:02:47.800> in<00:02:48.160> a<00:02:48.220> position<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:49.500> come

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
put ourselves in a position that come

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.380 
put ourselves in a position that come
towards<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.980> end<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.250> game<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:51.790> give

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
towards the end of the game that we give

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.410 
towards the end of the game that we give
ourselves<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.780> chance<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.140> win<00:02:53.290> it
