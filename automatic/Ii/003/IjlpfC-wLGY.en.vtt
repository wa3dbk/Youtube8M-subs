hand print loaded into the brush I'm

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.250 
hand print loaded into the brush I'm
going<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.610> store<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.210> up<00:01:13.330> quickly<00:01:13.600> let's<00:01:14.049> go<00:01:14.110> to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
going to store it up quickly let's go to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.060 
going to store it up quickly let's go to
the<00:01:14.470> brush<00:01:15.460> store<00:01:15.909> menu<00:01:16.330> I'm<00:01:17.229> going<00:01:17.290> to<00:01:17.830> use

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
the brush store menu I'm going to use

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
the brush store menu I'm going to use
that<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.640> rotate<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.479> brush<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.720> little<00:01:19.960> bit

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that to rotate the brush a little bit

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.899 
that to rotate the brush a little bit
have<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.210> hand<00:01:22.420> fill<00:01:22.659> up<00:01:22.810> site<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.280> also

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
have the hand fill up site and also

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.800 
have the hand fill up site and also
change<00:01:25.330> its<00:01:25.510> color<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.840> little<00:01:26.200> bit<00:01:26.400> maybe

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
change its color a little bit maybe

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.120 
change its color a little bit maybe
doesn't<00:01:28.810> actually<00:01:28.900> matter<00:01:29.200> for<00:01:29.920> this

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
doesn't actually matter for this

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.310 
doesn't actually matter for this
particular<00:01:30.369> exercise<00:01:30.640> let's<00:01:31.240> just<00:01:31.539> go<00:01:31.689> with

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
particular exercise let's just go with

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.200 
particular exercise let's just go with
this<00:01:33.060> perhaps<00:01:34.060> one<00:01:34.390> more<00:01:35.789> boom<00:01:36.789> that<00:01:37.000> didn't

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
this perhaps one more boom that didn't

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.810 
this perhaps one more boom that didn't
work<00:01:38.640> okay

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
work okay

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.569 
work okay
let's<00:01:40.179> go<00:01:40.479> here<00:01:40.869> well<00:01:41.770> nice<00:01:42.100> thing<00:01:42.280> about<00:01:42.340> the

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
let's go here well nice thing about the

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:44.249 
let's go here well nice thing about the
architecture<00:01:42.999> in<00:01:43.210> dog<00:01:43.420> waffle<00:01:43.810> is<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:44.140> it

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
architecture in dog waffle is that it

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.440 
architecture in dog waffle is that it
runs<00:01:44.469> as<00:01:44.679> an<00:01:44.829> ActiveX<00:01:45.310> server<00:01:45.609> so<00:01:46.030> if<00:01:46.240> there's

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
runs as an ActiveX server so if there's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.090 
runs as an ActiveX server so if there's
a<00:01:46.509> problem<00:01:46.630> if<00:01:46.990> one<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.350> plugins<00:01:47.590> and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
a problem if one of the plugins and

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.279 
a problem if one of the plugins and
remember<00:01:48.549> this<00:01:48.640> is<00:01:48.820> still<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.119> beta<00:01:49.359> if

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
remember this is still the beta if

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.359 
remember this is still the beta if
there's<00:01:50.499> a<00:01:50.590> problem<00:01:50.770> with<00:01:51.009> one<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.189> the

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
there's a problem with one of the

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.120 
there's a problem with one of the
plugins<00:01:51.789> if<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.899> plug-in<00:01:53.200> crashes<00:01:53.799> well<00:01:53.979> it

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
plugins if the plug-in crashes well it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.039 
plugins if the plug-in crashes well it
doesn't<00:01:54.310> take<00:01:54.490> down<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.149> whole<00:01:55.270> program<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
doesn't take down the whole program the

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.440 
doesn't take down the whole program the
program<00:01:56.409> runs<00:01:56.619> in<00:01:56.770> its<00:01:56.859> own<00:01:57.009> memory<00:01:57.609> address

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
program runs in its own memory address

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.929 
program runs in its own memory address
space<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.590> so<00:01:59.950> that's<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.219> nice<00:02:00.369> side<00:02:00.609> effect

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
space and so that's a nice side effect

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.419 
space and so that's a nice side effect
of<00:02:01.149> running<00:02:01.719> it<00:02:02.109> has<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:03.780> ActiveX<00:02:04.780> server<00:02:05.429> and

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
of running it has a ActiveX server and

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:07.889 
of running it has a ActiveX server and
the<00:02:06.609> only<00:02:06.789> thing<00:02:06.969> that<00:02:07.119> will<00:02:07.329> go<00:02:07.479> down<00:02:07.659> if

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
the only thing that will go down if

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.230 
the only thing that will go down if
there's<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.710> bug<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.190> plugin<00:02:09.610> is<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
there's a bug in the plugin is the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.600 
there's a bug in the plugin is the
plugin<00:02:10.590> alright<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.770> one<00:02:12.010> thing<00:02:12.160> I<00:02:12.220> want<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.430> do

has<00:02:36.570> put<00:02:36.810> into<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.350> program<00:02:43.520> let's<00:02:44.520> say<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
has put into the program let's say I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.550 
has put into the program let's say I
want<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> little<00:02:45.480> reddish<00:02:45.960> light<00:02:46.140> source

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
want to do a little reddish light source

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.130 
want to do a little reddish light source
and<00:02:46.710> orange<00:02:47.190> lights<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.580> there<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.120> bring<00:02:49.020> it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
and orange lights is there and bring it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.920 
and orange lights is there and bring it
down<00:02:49.170> close<00:02:49.680> there<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.340> go<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.690> we<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
down close there you go so we have a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.950 
down close there you go so we have a
nice<00:02:52.110> little<00:02:52.470> texture<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.940> some<00:02:54.150> sort<00:02:54.480> created

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
nice little texture of some sort created

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.140 
nice little texture of some sort created
with<00:02:55.110> depth<00:02:55.370> that's<00:02:56.370> one<00:02:56.580> thing<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.850> can<00:02:57.030> do

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
with depth that's one thing you can do

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.520 
with depth that's one thing you can do
with<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.600> then<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> other<00:02:57.990> thing<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.350> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
with it and then the other thing is you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.620 
with it and then the other thing is you
could<00:02:58.680> perhaps<00:02:58.920> map<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.970> on<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.270> inside

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
could perhaps map that on the inside

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.180 
could perhaps map that on the inside
walls<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.260> tunnel<00:03:01.440> that<00:03:01.620> we're<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.070> to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
walls of the tunnel that we're going to

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
walls of the tunnel that we're going to
animate<00:03:02.670> through<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.150> first<00:03:03.420> thing<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:03.630> want<00:03:04.260> to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
animate through so first thing I want to

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.690 
animate through so first thing I want to
do<00:03:04.410> for<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.710> actually<00:03:05.070> make<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.460> square

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
do for that is actually make it a square

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.940 
do for that is actually make it a square
texture<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.330> when<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.540> resample<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.260> right

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
texture and when I resample it right

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.010 
texture and when I resample it right
there<00:03:08.250> let's<00:03:08.520> make<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.820> for<00:03:08.970> instance<00:03:09.240> 512<00:03:09.780> by

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
there let's make the for instance 512 by

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.210 
there let's make the for instance 512 by
512<00:03:11.060> there<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.210> go<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.950> there's<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.040> couple

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
512 there you go and there's a couple

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.980 
512 there you go and there's a couple
this<00:03:14.520> is<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.730> new<00:03:14.940> feature<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.300> was<00:03:15.540> added<00:03:15.600> in

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
this is a new feature that was added in

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.530 
this is a new feature that was added in
version<00:03:16.020> 5<00:03:16.500> for<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.610> quality<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.390> it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
version 5 for the the quality of the it

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.370 
version 5 for the the quality of the it
is<00:03:18.660> moving<00:03:19.020> or<00:03:19.290> later<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:20.060> resampling<00:03:21.380> and

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
is moving or later this resampling and

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.240 
is moving or later this resampling and
perhaps<00:03:22.890> we<00:03:23.100> want<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.370> make<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:25.040> contiguous<00:03:26.040> or

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
perhaps we want to make it contiguous or

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.160 
perhaps we want to make it contiguous or
seamless<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.270> one<00:03:27.480> thing<00:03:27.660> I'll<00:03:27.780> do<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.020> I'll

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
seamless so one thing I'll do is I'll

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.020 
seamless so one thing I'll do is I'll
capture<00:03:28.530> that<00:03:28.620> into<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.070> brush<00:03:29.280> it's<00:03:29.730> now<00:03:29.880> in

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
capture that into the brush it's now in

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.360 
capture that into the brush it's now in
the<00:03:30.120> custom<00:03:30.480> brush<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.170> see<00:03:31.380> here<00:03:31.739> my

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the custom brush as you can see here my

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.720 
the custom brush as you can see here my
current<00:03:32.700> brush<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:34.020> then<00:03:34.230> I'm<00:03:34.380> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.730> make

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
current brush and then I'm going to make

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.080 
current brush and then I'm going to make
it<00:03:35.910> seamless<00:03:36.120> that's<00:03:36.720> working<00:03:37.170> on<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.440> brush

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
it seamless that's working on the brush

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.780 
it seamless that's working on the brush
could<00:03:39.090> perhaps<00:03:39.300> bring<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.930> up<00:03:40.140> like<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.790> or

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
could perhaps bring it up like that or

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.820 
could perhaps bring it up like that or
if<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.090> don't<00:03:42.209> care<00:03:42.450> about<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.930> there's<00:03:43.650> a

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
if you don't care about it there's a

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.830 
if you don't care about it there's a
small<00:03:44.160> transition<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.330> then<00:03:45.420> actually<00:03:45.720> use

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
small transition and then actually use

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.840 
small transition and then actually use
the<00:03:46.020> buffer<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.410> keep<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.010> original<00:03:47.459> size<00:03:47.640> as

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
the buffer and keep the original size as

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.580 
the buffer and keep the original size as
we<00:03:48.000> bring<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.330> back<00:03:48.360> into<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.230> buffer<00:03:49.560> or

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
we bring it back into the buffer or

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.770 
we bring it back into the buffer or
place<00:03:50.040> place<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.910> buffer<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.480> one<00:03:51.630> now

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
place place the buffer so that one now

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.320 
place place the buffer so that one now
it's<00:03:51.989> going<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.320> be<00:03:52.440> seamless<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.100> now<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:53.910> can

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
it's going to be seamless and now I can

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.229 
it's going to be seamless and now I can
say<00:03:54.540> let's<00:03:54.750> go<00:03:54.930> create<00:03:55.200> an<00:03:55.350> animation<00:03:55.680> and

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
say let's go create an animation and

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.670 
say let's go create an animation and
let's<00:03:57.239> say<00:03:57.360> we<00:03:57.510> want<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.840> animation<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.500> last

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
let's say we want that animation to last

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.040 
let's say we want that animation to last
5<00:03:59.070> seconds<00:04:00.830> 5<00:04:01.830> seconds<00:04:02.310> long<00:04:02.489> I'll<00:04:03.000> be<00:04:03.060> 360

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
5 seconds 5 seconds long I'll be 360

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.160 
5 seconds 5 seconds long I'll be 360
frames<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:05.120> one<00:04:06.120> thing<00:04:06.300> I'm<00:04:06.420> gonna<00:04:06.600> need<00:04:06.720> is

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
frames and one thing I'm gonna need is

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.920 
frames and one thing I'm gonna need is
to<00:04:08.100> turn<00:04:08.520> this<00:04:08.730> mr.<00:04:09.120> filter<00:04:09.540> there's<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.810> new

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
to turn this mr. filter there's a new

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.110 
to turn this mr. filter there's a new
filter<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.500> cool

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
filter that the cool

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.850 
filter that the cool
animated<00:04:11.690> we've<00:04:11.840> had<00:04:11.989> this<00:04:12.140> in<00:04:12.319> version<00:04:12.650> 5

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
animated we've had this in version 5

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.710 
animated we've had this in version 5
since<00:04:13.370> version<00:04:13.550> 5<00:04:13.880> is<00:04:13.910> an<00:04:14.270> animated

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
since version 5 is an animated

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.539 
since version 5 is an animated
collection<00:04:15.230> here<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:15.980> once<00:04:16.190> minutes<00:04:16.489> a

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
collection here and once minutes a

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.699

tunnel<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.570> was<00:04:17.720> also<00:04:17.930> introduced<00:04:18.590> in

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
tunnel that was also introduced in

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.400 
tunnel that was also introduced in
version<00:04:18.769> 5<00:04:19.220> what<00:04:20.030> I'm<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.510> do<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:21.019> simply

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
version 5 what I'm going to do is simply

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.020 
version 5 what I'm going to do is simply
reduce<00:04:21.709> a<00:04:21.739> little<00:04:21.919> bit<00:04:22.040> of<00:04:22.220> speed<00:04:22.430> of<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.760> and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
reduce a little bit of speed of that and

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.879 
reduce a little bit of speed of that and
now<00:04:23.270> we<00:04:23.330> render<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.230> what<00:04:24.410> it's<00:04:24.560> doing<00:04:24.590> is

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
now we render that so what it's doing is

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.909 
now we render that so what it's doing is
taking<00:04:24.950> that<00:04:25.370> texture<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.740> plastering<00:04:27.740> it

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
taking that texture and plastering it

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.740 
taking that texture and plastering it
along<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.460> inside<00:04:28.790> wall<00:04:29.030> of<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.389> tunnel<00:04:29.720> that

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
along the inside wall of the tunnel that

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.950 
along the inside wall of the tunnel that
we're<00:04:30.080> flying<00:04:30.440> through<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.389> so<00:04:32.389> it<00:04:32.690> may<00:04:32.810> look

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
we're flying through and so it may look

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.270 
we're flying through and so it may look
a<00:04:33.020> little<00:04:33.080> bit<00:04:33.290> weird<00:04:33.320> at<00:04:33.590> first<00:04:33.620> because<00:04:34.100> as

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
a little bit weird at first because as

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.800 
a little bit weird at first because as
its<00:04:34.490> rendering<00:04:34.820> you<00:04:34.970> see<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.300> old<00:04:35.450> image

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
its rendering you see the old image

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.930 
its rendering you see the old image
replaced<00:04:36.320> with<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.650> new<00:04:36.800> one<00:04:36.830> but<00:04:37.580> once<00:04:37.760> it's

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
replaced with the new one but once it's

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.020 
replaced with the new one but once it's
done<00:04:38.290> you<00:04:39.290> can<00:04:39.320> see<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.680> count<00:04:39.889> up<00:04:40.070> here<00:04:40.400> you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
done you can see the count up here you

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.340 
done you can see the count up here you
probably<00:04:41.240> have<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.540> few<00:04:41.690> more<00:04:41.810> hundred<00:04:41.990> frames

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
probably have a few more hundred frames

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.379 
probably have a few more hundred frames
to<00:04:42.530> go<00:04:42.650> through<00:04:42.889> is<00:04:43.040> working<00:04:43.430> on<00:04:43.490> frame<00:04:43.790> 140

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
to go through is working on frame 140

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.000 
to go through is working on frame 140
right<00:04:44.570> now<00:04:44.720> there<00:04:45.639> once<00:04:46.639> it's<00:04:46.820> done<00:04:47.090> with<00:04:47.330> that

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
right now there once it's done with that

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.430 
right now there once it's done with that
we<00:04:49.010> will<00:04:49.250> see<00:04:49.610> that<00:04:50.030> we<00:04:50.630> have<00:04:50.660> created<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:51.320> nice

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
we will see that we have created a nice

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.219 
we will see that we have created a nice
little<00:04:51.710> animation<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.900> basically<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.960> 3d

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
little animation of a basically a 3d

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.850 
little animation of a basically a 3d
tunnel<00:04:54.740> that<00:04:54.860> you<00:04:54.919> can<00:04:55.130> fly<00:04:55.340> through<00:04:56.860> couple

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
tunnel that you can fly through couple

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:19.580 
tunnel that you can fly through couple
more<00:04:58.040> seconds

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.650
