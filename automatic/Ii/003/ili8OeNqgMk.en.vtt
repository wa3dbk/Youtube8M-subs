we<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> answers<00:00:56.039> but

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
we don't have all the answers but

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.790 
we don't have all the answers but
healing<00:00:57.239> seem<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> take<00:00:58.050> place<00:00:58.289> more<00:00:58.590> often

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.950 
healing seem to be take place more often
in<00:00:59.160> regions<00:00:59.609> that<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.059> greater<00:01:00.449> faith<00:01:00.719> in

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
in regions that have greater faith in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.290 
in regions that have greater faith in
the<00:01:01.680> developing<00:01:02.190> world<00:01:02.399> miracles<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.090> more

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the developing world miracles are more

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
the developing world miracles are more
common<00:01:03.719> than<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> West<00:01:04.379> our<00:01:04.650> level<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
common than in the West our level of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.940 
common than in the West our level of
faith<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> expectation<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.750> lower<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.560> see

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
faith and expectation is lower so we see

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.730 
faith and expectation is lower so we see
fewer<00:01:08.430> miracles<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.840> miracles<00:01:10.200> are<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.470> rare

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
fewer miracles when miracles are so rare

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.950 
fewer miracles when miracles are so rare
we<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.369> never<00:01:11.580> expect<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.600> happen

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we then never expect to see them happen

we then never expect to see them happen
I<00:01:13.110> never<00:01:13.920> saw<00:01:14.100> miracles<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> never<00:01:15.390> expected

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I never saw miracles so I never expected

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.230 
I never saw miracles so I never expected

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.580 
which injured her back when she said yes
I<00:02:08.640> asked<00:02:09.300> if<00:02:09.390> she<00:02:09.539> had<00:02:09.569> ever<00:02:09.840> forgiven<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I asked if she had ever forgiven that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.740 
I asked if she had ever forgiven that
person<00:02:10.950> even<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.489> was<00:02:11.610> herself<00:02:11.940> she<00:02:12.660> had

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
person even if it was herself she had

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.850
