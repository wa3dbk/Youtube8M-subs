00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
California so a lot of our homes in

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.610 
California so a lot of our homes in
California<00:02:03.180> because<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.870> high<00:02:04.170> size<00:02:04.380> similar

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
California because of high size similar

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.610 
California because of high size similar
seismicity<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.910> build<00:02:06.150> them<00:02:06.360> very<00:02:06.660> light<00:02:06.870> so

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
seismicity we build them very light so

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.980 
seismicity we build them very light so
we<00:02:07.770> would<00:02:07.920> we<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.280> wood<00:02:08.520> construction

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
we would we use wood construction

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.120 
we would we use wood construction
because<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.230> way<00:02:10.380> they<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:10.890> light<00:02:11.100> and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
because that way they are very light and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.730 
because that way they are very light and
as<00:02:11.520> weeks<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.390> know<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.600> will<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.170> able<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
as weeks you know we will be able to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.360 
as weeks you know we will be able to
detail<00:02:14.130> them<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.790> know<00:02:14.880> enter<00:02:15.180> them<00:02:15.330> down<00:02:15.570> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
detail them you know enter them down and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.800 
detail them you know enter them down and
they<00:02:17.370> are<00:02:17.490> you<00:02:18.120> know<00:02:18.240> they<00:02:18.480> are<00:02:18.510> their

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
they are you know they are their

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.370 
they are you know they are their
structure<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.260> safe<00:02:20.240> here<00:02:21.240> this<00:02:22.140> would<00:02:22.350> be

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
structure is safe here this would be

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.460 
structure is safe here this would be
great<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:23.130> they<00:02:23.310> had<00:02:23.490> timber<00:02:24.000> here

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
great if they had timber here

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.690 
great if they had timber here
unfortunately<00:02:25.470> they<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.070> have<00:02:26.280> lumber

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
unfortunately they don't have lumber

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.820 
unfortunately they don't have lumber
they<00:02:26.820> never<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.210> trees<00:02:27.480> here<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:28.590> we<00:02:28.740> are

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
they never have trees here what we are

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.100 
they never have trees here what we are
trying<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.190> encourage<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.880> use<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.870> same

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
trying to encourage is use the same

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.200 
trying to encourage is use the same
material<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.590> they<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.100> here<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:32.820> make<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
material that they have here but make it

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.770 
material that they have here but make it
better<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.020> make<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.380> better<00:02:34.410> quality<00:02:35.780> in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
better that make it better quality in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420 
better that make it better quality in
North<00:02:36.990> America<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.830> about<00:02:38.160> eight

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
North America we have about eight

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.520 
North America we have about eight
different<00:02:39.090> types<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.420> cements<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.080> we<00:02:40.410> use

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
different types of cements that we use

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410 
different types of cements that we use
for<00:02:40.710> different<00:02:40.830> constructions<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:42.180> type

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
for different constructions this type

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.360 
for different constructions this type
one<00:02:42.690> they<00:02:42.990> said<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.470> they<00:02:43.680> step<00:02:43.920> three<00:02:44.160> and

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
one they said to they step three and

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.110 
one they said to they step three and
every<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.240> this<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.780> basically<00:02:47.120> blended

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
every one of this is basically blended

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.699 
every one of this is basically blended
so<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.720> for<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.020> particular<00:02:49.200> purpose

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
so that it is for a particular purpose

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.120 
so that it is for a particular purpose
in<00:02:50.490> Haiti<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:50.940> get<00:02:51.180> one<00:02:51.450> type<00:02:51.860> one<00:02:52.860> type<00:02:53.100> of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
in Haiti you get one type one type of

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.910 
in Haiti you get one type one type of
cement<00:02:53.489> for<00:02:53.880> everything<00:02:54.570> we<00:02:55.470> are<00:02:55.500> trying<00:02:55.800> not

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
cement for everything we are trying not

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.400

to<00:02:55.980> import<00:02:56.310> any<00:02:56.580> material<00:02:57.300> but<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.050> are<00:02:58.170> trying

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
to import any material but we are trying

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.050 
to import any material but we are trying
to<00:02:58.560> use<00:02:58.709> everything<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.459> available<00:02:59.670> here

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
how can you build it better so that we

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.840 
how can you build it better so that we
save<00:03:21.209> like<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:22.110> needs<00:03:22.500> all<00:03:22.800> these<00:03:23.370> people<00:03:23.730> know

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850

exactly what we are talking about

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.050 
exactly what we are talking about
somewhere<00:03:26.709> without<00:03:26.860> bothered<00:03:27.159> about<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.610> what

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
somewhere without bothered about it what

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.280 
somewhere without bothered about it what
I<00:03:28.090> heard<00:03:28.239> them<00:03:28.450> talking<00:03:28.719> about<00:03:28.930> were<00:03:29.200> the

of that they talked about the amount to

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.319 
of that they talked about the amount to
use<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:36.069> about<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.400> cement<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.150> lay<00:03:37.299> down

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
use then about the cement to lay down

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.300 
use then about the cement to lay down
the<00:03:37.629> bricks<00:03:37.870> then<00:03:38.590> they<00:03:38.709> talked<00:03:38.950> about<00:03:39.069> the

the<00:03:50.950> eyes<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:53.200> that<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.500> think<00:03:53.709> this<00:03:54.159> way

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
the eyes so and that I think this way

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.640 
the eyes so and that I think this way
MCC<00:03:54.819> comes<00:03:55.090> in<00:03:55.299> because<00:03:55.450> right<00:03:55.780> now<00:03:56.109> you<00:03:56.500> know

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
MCC comes in because right now you know

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.300 
MCC comes in because right now you know
sometimes<00:03:57.659> sometimes<00:03:58.659> like<00:03:59.230> they<00:03:59.409> say<00:03:59.590> if<00:03:59.709> you

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
sometimes sometimes like they say if you

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.259 
sometimes sometimes like they say if you
can<00:04:00.489> solve<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.060> problem<00:04:01.629> during<00:04:02.290> crisis<00:04:02.889> and<00:04:03.269> if

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
can solve a problem during crisis and if

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.520 
can solve a problem during crisis and if
you<00:04:04.359> can<00:04:04.540> do<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:04.870> up<00:04:05.049> because<00:04:05.139> there<00:04:05.409> is<00:04:05.470> a

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
you can do that up because there is a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.949 
you can do that up because there is a
big<00:04:05.739> problem<00:04:05.980> here<00:04:06.299> building<00:04:07.299> codes<00:04:07.569> building

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
big problem here building codes building

big problem here building codes building
standards<00:04:08.409> building<00:04:08.799> materials<00:04:09.310> if<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:09.700> can

solve that now when everybody's aware of
it<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.400> set<00:04:12.970> a<00:04:13.000> goal<00:04:13.359> that<00:04:13.930> okay<00:04:14.200> we<00:04:14.349> can<00:04:14.530> set

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
it and set a goal that okay we can set

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.080

up cranes program here that is
sustainable<00:04:16.989> I<00:04:17.410> think<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:18.009> will<00:04:18.220> go<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.400> long

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
sustainable I think that will go a long

sustainable I think that will go a long
long<00:04:18.639> way<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.180> think<00:04:19.239> MCC<00:04:19.900> stands<00:04:20.169> a<00:04:20.289> very

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
long way and I think MCC stands a very

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.529 
long way and I think MCC stands a very
good<00:04:20.680> chance<00:04:20.949> of<00:04:21.220> doing<00:04:21.340> that<00:04:21.820> with<00:04:22.270> what<00:04:22.419> we

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539
