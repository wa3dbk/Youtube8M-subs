00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
underwater house and I should I think

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.549 
underwater house and I should I think

my<00:01:55.079> first<00:01:55.969> underwater<00:01:56.969> house<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:58.049> we'll<00:01:58.170> see

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
my first underwater house but we'll see

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.190 
my first underwater house but we'll see
how<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.469> goes<00:01:58.590> i'm<00:01:58.890> using<00:01:59.159> sand<00:01:59.460> stone<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
how it goes i'm using sand stone and

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.899 
how it goes i'm using sand stone and
glass<00:02:01.369> mainly<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.950> should<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.460> good<00:02:05.850> i

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
glass mainly and it should be good i

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.320 
glass mainly and it should be good i
will<00:02:06.180> cut<00:02:07.020> too<00:02:07.439> when<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.429> all<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.849> walls

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
will cut too when I have all the walls

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.859 
will cut too when I have all the walls
and<00:02:09.720> ceilings<00:02:10.140> done

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
and ceilings done

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.710 
and ceilings done
which<00:02:11.860> takes<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.549> while<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.209> let's<00:02:13.750> in<00:02:14.049> a<00:02:14.110> bit

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
which takes a while so let's in a bit

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.589 
which takes a while so let's in a bit
all<00:02:16.720> right<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.680> have<00:02:18.459> built<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.909> the<00:02:19.090> walls<00:02:19.269> and

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599

all right I have built up the walls and
ceilings<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.739> course<00:02:21.159> otherwise<00:02:21.849> there'd<00:02:22.150> be

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
ceilings of course otherwise there'd be

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.050 
ceilings of course otherwise there'd be
water<00:02:22.420> everywhere<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:24.700> is<00:02:24.819> what<00:02:24.940> it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
water everywhere and this is what it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.100 
water everywhere and this is what it
looks<00:02:25.209> like<00:02:25.299> from<00:02:25.450> outside<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.959> kind<00:02:26.080> of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
looks like from outside it's kind of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.589 
looks like from outside it's kind of
cool-looking<00:02:26.290> um<00:02:27.659> just<00:02:28.659> a<00:02:28.870> simple<00:02:29.440> design<00:02:29.829> but

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
cool-looking um just a simple design but

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.009 
cool-looking um just a simple design but
underwater<00:02:31.599> houses<00:02:32.049> are<00:02:32.700> interesting<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:34.840> say

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
underwater houses are interesting to say
