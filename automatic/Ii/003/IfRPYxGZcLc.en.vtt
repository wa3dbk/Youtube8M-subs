piece<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.820> want<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.240> divide<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:27.600> now<00:02:28.590> this

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
piece you want to divide it now this

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.460 
piece you want to divide it now this
piece<00:02:29.190> looks<00:02:29.610> pretty<00:02:30.270> thin<00:02:30.720> some<00:02:31.110> pieces<00:02:31.320> were

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
piece looks pretty thin some pieces were

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710 
piece looks pretty thin some pieces were
really<00:02:31.890> thin<00:02:32.160> where<00:02:32.880> I'd<00:02:33.210> only<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.600> to

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
really thin where I'd only have to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720 
really thin where I'd only have to
divide<00:02:33.960> it<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.200> two<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.710> some<00:02:35.310> pieces<00:02:35.490> were

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
divide it in two and some pieces were

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.130 
divide it in two and some pieces were
thick<00:02:35.970> what<00:02:36.150> else<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.420> divided<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.900> three<00:02:37.080> so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
thick what else is divided in three so

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.420 
thick what else is divided in three so
forest<00:02:37.590> this<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.670> pretty<00:02:38.970> thin<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:40.430> you

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
forest this one is pretty thin so you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.700 
forest this one is pretty thin so you
just<00:02:41.580> kind<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.260> put<00:02:43.590> your

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
doing it something I guess you're doing

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.310 
doing it something I guess you're doing
it<00:05:08.680> right<00:05:08.770> when<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.370> came<00:05:09.550> to<00:05:09.760> not<00:05:10.000> it<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.840> damn

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
it right when it came to not it the damn

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.770 
it right when it came to not it the damn
a<00:05:11.349> loop<00:05:11.830> would<00:05:12.160> not<00:05:12.370> stay<00:05:12.729> knotted<00:05:13.210> this<00:05:13.720> is

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
a loop would not stay knotted this is

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.480 
a loop would not stay knotted this is
when<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.050> figured<00:05:14.440> out<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.740> needed<00:05:14.919> to<00:05:15.099> divide

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
when I figured out I needed to divide

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.810 
when I figured out I needed to divide
the<00:05:15.820> hair<00:05:16.060> more<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:18.220> most<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.729> my<00:05:18.880> pieces<00:05:20.820> looks

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
the hair more so most of my pieces looks

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.320 
the hair more so most of my pieces looks
really<00:05:22.510> thin<00:05:22.750> like<00:05:22.990> this<00:05:23.669> but<00:05:24.669> I<00:05:24.700> like<00:05:25.120> that

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
really thin like this but I like that

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.779 
really thin like this but I like that
look<00:05:25.510> you<00:05:25.570> know<00:05:25.720> um<00:05:26.139> I'm<00:05:26.830> not<00:05:27.099> expecting<00:05:27.639> each

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
look you know um I'm not expecting each

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.760 
look you know um I'm not expecting each
curl<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.330> be<00:05:28.450> perfect<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.110> it's<00:05:29.260> all<00:05:29.380> good<00:05:29.620> like

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
it looks really nice and I just think

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.830 
it looks really nice and I just think
it's<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.849> brand<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.270> them<00:05:34.419> so<00:05:34.660> it's<00:05:34.780> really

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
it's the brand of them so it's really

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.219 
it's the brand of them so it's really
good<00:05:35.700> so<00:05:36.700> most<00:05:37.030> of<00:05:37.150> my<00:05:37.210> pieces<00:05:37.479> look<00:05:37.840> like<00:05:38.020> this

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
good so most of my pieces look like this

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.320 
good so most of my pieces look like this
in<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.710> front<00:05:39.039> I<00:05:39.130> had<00:05:39.340> thinner<00:05:39.669> pieces<00:05:40.150> which

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
in the front I had thinner pieces which

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.450 
in the front I had thinner pieces which
would<00:05:40.479> be<00:05:40.599> half<00:05:40.840> of<00:05:40.990> this<00:05:41.139> in<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.979> front<00:05:42.190> cuz

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
would be half of this in the front cuz

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.950 
would be half of this in the front cuz
you<00:05:42.580> want<00:05:42.729> it<00:05:42.789> to<00:05:42.910> be<00:05:43.060> really<00:05:43.510> nice<00:05:43.660> you<00:05:43.840> don't

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
you want it to be really nice you don't

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.560 
you want it to be really nice you don't
want<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.169> be<00:05:44.289> a<00:05:44.320> big<00:05:44.889> bulk<00:05:45.280> of<00:05:45.490> a<00:05:45.639> knot<00:05:46.210> in<00:05:46.419> the

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
want to be a big bulk of a knot in the

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.710 
want to be a big bulk of a knot in the
front<00:05:47.550> but<00:05:48.550> that's<00:05:48.880> how<00:05:49.150> I<00:05:49.180> figured<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.570> out

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
front but that's how I figured it out

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.710 
front but that's how I figured it out
I'm<00:05:49.900> like<00:05:50.050> oh<00:05:50.199> if<00:05:50.320> you<00:05:50.410> make<00:05:50.620> it<00:05:50.770> too<00:05:51.010> big<00:05:51.720> it

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
I'm like oh if you make it too big it

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.920 
I'm like oh if you make it too big it
won't<00:05:53.199> stay<00:05:54.070> knotted<00:05:54.520> so<00:05:55.510> that's<00:05:55.690> when<00:05:55.840> I

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
won't stay knotted so that's when I

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.540 
won't stay knotted so that's when I
decided<00:05:55.960> to<00:05:56.380> go<00:05:56.650> a<00:05:56.680> little<00:05:56.889> bit<00:05:57.099> with<00:05:57.310> smaller

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
decided to go a little bit with smaller

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.010 
decided to go a little bit with smaller
pieces<00:05:57.760> and<00:05:58.000> I<00:05:58.150> think<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.449> smaller<00:05:58.720> pieces

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
pieces and I think the smaller pieces

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.040 
pieces and I think the smaller pieces
helped<00:05:59.740> because<00:05:59.919> it's<00:06:00.400> like<00:06:00.639> it's<00:06:01.510> not<00:06:01.780> heavy

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
helped because it's like it's not heavy

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.570 
helped because it's like it's not heavy
even<00:06:02.380> when<00:06:02.590> I<00:06:02.620> had<00:06:02.860> so<00:06:03.340> much<00:06:03.550> hair<00:06:03.880> on<00:06:04.030> my<00:06:04.150> head

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
even when I had so much hair on my head

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.730 
even when I had so much hair on my head
like<00:06:04.849> a<00:06:04.879> lion<00:06:05.180> the<00:06:05.960> hair<00:06:06.199> was<00:06:06.349> still<00:06:06.560> light

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
like a lion the hair was still light

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.740 
like a lion the hair was still light
because<00:06:07.009> of<00:06:07.039> how<00:06:07.639> many<00:06:07.789> times<00:06:08.000> i<00:06:08.090> divided<00:06:08.479> the

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
because of how many times i divided the

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.929 
because of how many times i divided the
hair<00:06:08.930> you<00:06:09.409> can<00:06:09.560> either<00:06:09.710> divide<00:06:10.069> it<00:06:10.340> in<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:10.669> say

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
hair you can either divide it in I say

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.640
