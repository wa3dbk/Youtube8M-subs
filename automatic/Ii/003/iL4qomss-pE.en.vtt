00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
last minute so I just felt like it so

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.080 
last minute so I just felt like it so
I'm<00:03:31.409> just<00:03:31.620> doing<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.859> big<00:03:32.009> braid<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.609> I'm

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
I'm just doing a big braid and I'm

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.909 
I'm just doing a big braid and I'm
actually<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.569> to<00:03:33.659> pull<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.349> hair<00:03:34.530> apart

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
actually going to pull the hair apart

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.890 
actually going to pull the hair apart
just<00:03:35.759> to<00:03:35.849> make<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.060> bigger<00:03:36.359> because<00:03:36.509> I<00:03:36.659> didn't

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
just to make it bigger because I didn't

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.499 
just to make it bigger because I didn't
want<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.379> be<00:03:37.530> too<00:03:37.560> tidy<00:03:38.159> and<00:03:38.699> then<00:03:39.479> I

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:39.509 
want it to be too tidy and then I

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:40.969 
want it to be too tidy and then I
thought<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:39.900> might<00:03:39.989> wear<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.349> hat<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:40.829> then<00:03:40.949> I

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:40.979 
thought I might wear a hat but then I

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.649 
thought I might wear a hat but then I
decided<00:03:41.310> at<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.609> last<00:03:41.639> second<00:03:42.209> not<00:03:42.329> to<00:03:42.509> wear

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
decided at the last second not to wear

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.689 
decided at the last second not to wear
it<00:03:42.870> so<00:03:43.290> i<00:03:43.590> thought<00:03:43.739> i<00:03:43.799> looked<00:03:43.979> at<00:03:44.129> it<00:03:44.159> to<00:03:44.400> false

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
it so i thought i looked at it to false

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.569 
it so i thought i looked at it to false
