so<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.849> can<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.090> these<00:00:30.240> oxidation<00:00:30.570> reactions

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
so you can see these oxidation reactions

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.630 
so you can see these oxidation reactions
here<00:00:31.230> right<00:00:31.349> solid<00:00:31.710> lithium<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.489> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
zinc and here is copper so what does

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.820 
zinc and here is copper so what does
this<00:01:08.850> mean<00:01:09.119> since<00:01:10.020> zinc<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> higher<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.590> the

copper into the metal right we can

electrons and give them to copper copper

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
electrons and give them to copper copper
then<00:01:37.560> becomes<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> metal<00:01:38.790> metal<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> zinc

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
then becomes the metal metal and zinc

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.179 
then becomes the metal metal and zinc
becomes<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> ion<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.890> happens<00:01:41.159> here

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
becomes the ion so what happens here

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:41.719 
becomes the ion so what happens here
we'll<00:01:41.430> remember

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
we'll remember

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.999 
we'll remember
zinc<00:01:42.060> wants<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.780> become<00:01:43.020> positive<00:01:43.530> more<00:01:43.799> so

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
zinc wants to become positive more so

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.859 
zinc wants to become positive more so
than<00:01:44.159> copper<00:01:44.520> does<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.329> nature<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
than copper does so nature is going to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.690 
than copper does so nature is going to
say<00:01:45.990> well<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.200> more<00:01:46.560> stable<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.250> least<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
say well it's more stable or at least it

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.780 
say well it's more stable or at least it
makes<00:01:48.119> more<00:01:48.450> sense<00:01:48.509> by<00:01:49.020> those<00:01:49.170> rules<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:50.310> have

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
makes more sense by those rules to have

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.040 
makes more sense by those rules to have
zinc<00:01:51.649> spit<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.950> two<00:01:53.070> electrons

as<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.190> this<00:01:58.550> is<00:01:58.670> my<00:01:58.790> oxidation<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:01.000> then<00:02:02.000> to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
as so this is my oxidation and then to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.270 
as so this is my oxidation and then to
have<00:02:02.300> copper<00:02:02.720> take<00:02:03.380> those<00:02:03.560> two<00:02:03.710> electrons<00:02:03.890> and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
have copper take those two electrons and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.060 
have copper take those two electrons and
become<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.640> metal<00:02:04.990> right<00:02:05.990> since<00:02:06.800> this<00:02:06.920> is

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
become the metal right since this is

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.530 
become the metal right since this is
lower<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.490> chart<00:02:07.730> it<00:02:07.940> wants<00:02:08.270> to<00:02:08.360> be<00:02:08.450> the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
lower on the chart it wants to be the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.330 
lower on the chart it wants to be the
metal<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.900> it<00:02:09.020> wants<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.380> be<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> ion<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
metal and it wants to be the ion so that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.040 
metal and it wants to be the ion so that
is<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.700> happen<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.030> indeed<00:02:11.300> zinc<00:02:11.900> metal

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
is going to happen so indeed zinc metal

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.230 
is going to happen so indeed zinc metal
will<00:02:12.380> reduce<00:02:12.740> copper<00:02:13.400> 2<00:02:13.520> plus<00:02:13.550> copper<00:02:14.000> 2<00:02:14.210> plus

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
will reduce copper 2 plus copper 2 plus

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.910 
will reduce copper 2 plus copper 2 plus
will<00:02:14.570> be<00:02:14.600> reduced<00:02:14.990> into<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.500> metal<00:02:15.740> and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
will be reduced into the metal and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.620 
will be reduced into the metal and
copper<00:02:16.580> 2<00:02:16.760> plus<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:17.090> therefore<00:02:17.450> going<00:02:17.570> to

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
copper 2 plus is therefore going to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.080 
copper 2 plus is therefore going to
oxidize<00:02:17.930> zinc<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.740> this<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.130> true<00:02:19.400> from<00:02:20.060> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
oxidize zinc so this is true from the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.850 
oxidize zinc so this is true from the
Activity<00:02:20.600> series<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.020> from<00:02:21.110> our<00:02:21.320> analysis<00:02:21.740> of

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
Activity series and from our analysis of

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.830 
Activity series and from our analysis of
it<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.730> Activity<00:02:23.060> series<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.420> not<00:02:23.540> something

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
it the Activity series is not something

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.090 
it the Activity series is not something
you<00:02:23.900> generally<00:02:24.110> need<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.530> memorize<00:02:24.860> so<00:02:24.980> this

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
you generally need to memorize so this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.310 
you generally need to memorize so this
question<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.430> kind<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.670> tough<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.810> think<00:02:27.230> I

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
question is kind of tough I think I

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.960 
question is kind of tough I think I
would<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:27.500> remember<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.130> main<00:02:28.370> case<00:02:28.670> that

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
would just remember this main case that

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.010 
would just remember this main case that
zinc<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.450> always<00:02:29.690> going<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> oxidize<00:02:30.350> copper

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
zinc is always going to oxidize copper

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
zinc is always going to oxidize copper
or<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.200> think<00:02:33.530> it's<00:02:33.650> going<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:33.800> reduce

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
or so you think it's going to reduce

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.460 
or so you think it's going to reduce
copper<00:02:34.450> also<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.570> next<00:02:35.750> one<00:02:35.870> zinc<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.260> more

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
copper also the next one zinc is a more

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.690 
copper also the next one zinc is a more
active<00:02:36.740> metal<00:02:36.980> than<00:02:37.070> copper<00:02:37.310> yeah<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:37.490> mean

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
active metal than copper yeah I mean

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
active metal than copper yeah I mean
that's<00:02:37.880> what<00:02:38.180> we<00:02:38.240> just<00:02:38.330> talked<00:02:38.540> about<00:02:38.600> right

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
that's what we just talked about right

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
that's what we just talked about right
zinc<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.260> higher<00:02:39.440> on<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.680> list<00:02:39.860> which<00:02:40.040> means

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
zinc is higher on the list which means

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.730 
zinc is higher on the list which means
it's<00:02:40.370> more<00:02:40.550> active<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:41.480> copper<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.260> this

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
it's more active that copper is and this

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.960 
it's more active that copper is and this
is<00:02:42.890> indeed<00:02:43.130> also<00:02:43.310> correct<00:02:43.760> explanation

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
is indeed also correct explanation

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.520 
is indeed also correct explanation
because<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.630> explains<00:02:45.110> it's<00:02:45.350> higher

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
because this explains it's higher

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.160 
because this explains it's higher
activity<00:02:45.890> explains<00:02:46.550> why<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.810> zinc<00:02:48.050> will

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
activity explains why the zinc will

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.500 
activity explains why the zinc will
become<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> ion<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.280> copper<00:02:49.880> ion<00:02:50.330> will

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
become the ion and that copper ion will

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.310 
become the ion and that copper ion will
turn<00:02:50.690> into<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.200> plain<00:02:51.740> old<00:02:51.890> copper
