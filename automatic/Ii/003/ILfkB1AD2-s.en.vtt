get a good crease on that and then go

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.199 
get a good crease on that and then go
ahead<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.340> open<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.390> up<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:21.030> now<00:02:22.030> what

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
of these bottom points and I'm going to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.089 
of these bottom points and I'm going to
fold<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.600> up<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.959> create<00:02:26.110> a<00:02:26.260> triangle<00:02:26.620> by

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
fold it up to create a triangle by

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.790 
fold it up to create a triangle by
lining<00:02:27.459> up<00:02:27.519> one<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.849> those<00:02:27.910> edges<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:28.800> top

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
lining up one of those edges to this top

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.030 
lining up one of those edges to this top
part<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.190> paper<00:02:30.340> here<00:02:31.230> like<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.500> and<00:02:32.830> do

part of the paper here like so and do
the<00:02:33.190> same<00:02:33.370> thing<00:02:33.580> on<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.819> side<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:41.620> you

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
the same thing on this side so you

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.720 
the same thing on this side so you
should<00:02:41.799> have<00:02:41.920> something<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.340> looks<00:02:42.580> like

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
going to go ahead and fold in these

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.600 
going to go ahead and fold in these
sides<00:02:49.569> into<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.380> center<00:02:50.860> crease<00:02:51.130> now<00:02:51.459> there

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
sides into that center crease now there

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.180 
sides into that center crease now there
are<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.760> lot<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.090> layers<00:02:52.390> of<00:02:52.569> paper<00:02:52.780> here<00:02:53.380> so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
are a lot of layers of paper here so

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.240 
are a lot of layers of paper here so
take<00:02:54.400> care<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.000> fold<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:57.190> bring<00:02:57.430> this<00:02:57.700> in

take care as you fold and bring this in

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.520 
take care as you fold and bring this in
and<00:03:00.250> do<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.360> same<00:03:01.569> thing<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:01.989> this<00:03:02.109> side<00:03:02.320> as

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and do the same thing on this side as

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.920 
and do the same thing on this side as
well<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.269> this<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.630> can<00:03:07.660> go<00:03:07.900> ahead

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.910 
a sharp edge so I'm just going to create
a<00:04:56.370> crease<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.060> runs<00:04:57.120> from<00:04:57.690> this<00:04:57.960> point<00:04:58.560> here

going to bring it all the way over to
this<00:05:25.170> right<00:05:25.560> crease<00:05:28.010> now<00:05:29.010> easy<00:05:29.190> do<00:05:29.460> this

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
this right crease now easy do this

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.340 
this right crease now easy do this
you're<00:05:29.820> gonna<00:05:29.910> be<00:05:30.360> creating<00:05:30.780> everything<00:05:31.020> kind

you're gonna be creating everything kind
of<00:05:31.410> three<00:05:31.650> dimensionally<00:05:32.160> so<00:05:32.400> it<00:05:32.550> doesn't

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
of three dimensionally so it doesn't

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.580 
of three dimensionally so it doesn't
need<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.000> be<00:05:33.120> flat<00:05:33.450> just<00:05:34.050> going<00:05:34.230> to<00:05:34.290> bring<00:05:34.440> this
