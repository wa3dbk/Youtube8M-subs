shooting with it so let's talk a little

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.080 
shooting with it so let's talk a little
bit<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.899> guy<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.340> smart

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
bit about this guy this is a smart

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.450 
bit about this guy this is a smart
adapter<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.320> means<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.430> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
adapter which means that there is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
adapter which means that there is
pass-through<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> information

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
pass-through of all of the information

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.040 
pass-through of all of the information
and<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> lens<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.820> still<00:00:51.090> powered<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.690> there

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and the lens is still powered so there

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.990 
and the lens is still powered so there
are<00:00:52.170> plenty<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> adapters<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.430> there<00:00:53.730> there's

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
are plenty of adapters out there there's

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.240 
are plenty of adapters out there there's
some<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.390> cheap<00:00:54.690> ones<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.070> can

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560

when it was trying to focus

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.300 
when it was trying to focus
she<00:04:10.019> thought<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.350> picture<00:04:10.620> was<00:04:10.769> being<00:04:11.130> taken

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
she'd move and as a result got a bunch

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.449 
she'd move and as a result got a bunch
of<00:04:14.430> out-of-focus<00:04:14.940> images<00:04:15.630> just<00:04:16.109> was<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.739> so

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
of out-of-focus images just was so so

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.430 
of out-of-focus images just was so so
slow<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:18.299> got<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.510> watch<00:04:18.630> out<00:04:18.840> for<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.140> it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
slow so you got to watch out for that it

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.339 
slow so you got to watch out for that it
costs<00:04:19.829> 399<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.060> it's<00:04:21.239> not<00:04:21.450> cheap<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.140> if

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
costs 399 so it's not cheap but if

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.409
