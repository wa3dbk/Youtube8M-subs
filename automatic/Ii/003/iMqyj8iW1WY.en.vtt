00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
taken and that's from using the solve

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.000 
taken and that's from using the solve
for<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.269> solve<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.780> powder<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.769> cost

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
for the solve for powder and the cost

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:05.149 
for the solve for powder and the cost
oil<00:03:56.370> mix

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:08.460 

so<00:04:06.159> as<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.400> can<00:04:06.550> see<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:07.330> lot<00:04:07.599> of<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.930> kind<00:04:08.409> of

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
so as you can see a lot of the kind of

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.649 
so as you can see a lot of the kind of
bald<00:04:08.950> patches<00:04:09.129> have<00:04:09.430> grown<00:04:09.670> back<00:04:09.909> there<00:04:10.540> is

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
bald patches have grown back there is

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.170 
bald patches have grown back there is
still<00:04:10.959> some<00:04:11.530> hair<00:04:11.769> loss<00:04:11.980> at<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:12.909> bottom<00:04:13.120> of

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
still some hair loss at the bottom of

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.210 
still some hair loss at the bottom of
her<00:04:13.269> hair<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.690> also<00:04:14.019> in<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.230> temples<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.980> her

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
her hair and also in the temples of her

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.550 
her hair and also in the temples of her
hair<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.750> she<00:04:16.750> felt<00:04:16.930> like<00:04:16.989> those<00:04:17.260> weren't

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
hair and she felt like those weren't

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.050 
hair and she felt like those weren't
growing<00:04:17.769> either<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.459> that's<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.850> next

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
growing either so that's the next

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.599 
growing either so that's the next
picture<00:04:19.479> now<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.290> next<00:04:20.620> thing<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.340> heard

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
castor oil this next picture was

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.710 
castor oil this next picture was
logistic<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.530> with<00:04:29.530> my<00:04:29.680> mom<00:04:30.090> last<00:04:31.090> week<00:04:31.330> and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
logistic and with my mom last week and

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.950 
logistic and with my mom last week and
this<00:04:32.199> is<00:04:32.260> after<00:04:32.800> using<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.810> Jamaican<00:04:34.810> black

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
this is after using the Jamaican black

this is after using the Jamaican black
castor<00:04:35.020> oil<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.620> we<00:04:35.830> haven't<00:04:36.040> even<00:04:36.160> been

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
castor oil and we haven't even been

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.520 
castor oil and we haven't even been
using<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.669> for<00:04:36.789> that<00:04:36.850> long<00:04:37.060> maybe<00:04:37.750> about<00:04:37.990> a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
using it for that long maybe about a

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.640 
using it for that long maybe about a
month<00:04:38.889> so<00:04:39.580> or<00:04:40.060> maybe<00:04:40.419> two<00:04:40.630> months<00:04:40.780> now<00:04:41.080> so

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
month so or maybe two months now so

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.650 
month so or maybe two months now so
within<00:04:42.100> those<00:04:42.310> two<00:04:42.580> months<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:42.970> can<00:04:43.120> see<00:04:43.389> that

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
within those two months you can see that

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.080 
within those two months you can see that
the<00:04:44.650> hair<00:04:44.830> temples<00:04:45.460> are<00:04:45.550> starting<00:04:45.820> to<00:04:45.910> grow

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
the hair temples are starting to grow

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.570 
the hair temples are starting to grow
back<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.600> then<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.780> last<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.470> kind<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.340> bald

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
back and then the last and kind of bald

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.790 
back and then the last and kind of bald
patches<00:04:48.820> in<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.330> back<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.380> her<00:04:50.470> hair<00:04:50.650> they're

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
patches in the back of her hair they're

00:04:50.800 --> 00:05:00.210 
patches in the back of her hair they're
slightly<00:04:50.949> different<00:04:51.039> as<00:04:51.460> well

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.280 

now<00:05:01.220> she<00:05:01.280> herself<00:05:01.700> says<00:05:02.360> that<00:05:02.780> there<00:05:03.140> is<00:05:03.170> you

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
makin black castle is the thing that

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.790 
makin black castle is the thing that
select<00:05:05.390> the<00:05:05.480> best<00:05:05.660> for<00:05:05.870> her<00:05:06.020> she<00:05:06.560> said<00:05:06.680> it's

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
select the best for her she said it's

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.190 
select the best for her she said it's
worked<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.070> fastest<00:05:07.730> and<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.780> is<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.020> stuff

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
worked the fastest and that is the stuff

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.720 
worked the fastest and that is the stuff
she's<00:05:09.380> going<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.620> be<00:05:09.680> using<00:05:10.010> from<00:05:10.160> now<00:05:10.220> on<00:05:10.520> now

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
she's going to be using from now on now

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.730 
she's going to be using from now on now
recently<00:05:11.300> I've<00:05:11.630> decided<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.290> take<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.530> on<00:05:12.620> my

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
recently I've decided to take it on my

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.590 
recently I've decided to take it on my
own<00:05:12.920> back<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.310> make<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.460> few<00:05:13.940> tweaks<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.450> that

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
own back to make a few tweaks to that

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.540 
own back to make a few tweaks to that
because<00:05:14.810> we<00:05:14.870> were<00:05:14.960> just<00:05:15.110> using<00:05:15.320> pure<00:05:15.740> Jamaican

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
because we were just using pure Jamaican

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.910 
because we were just using pure Jamaican

stuff to come from a science background

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.330 
stuff to come from a science background
I<00:05:23.780> read<00:05:23.990> a<00:05:24.020> couple<00:05:24.260> of<00:05:24.410> articles<00:05:24.530> on<00:05:24.920> hair<00:05:25.130> gray

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
I read a couple of articles on hair gray

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.300 
I read a couple of articles on hair gray
and<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.780> effects<00:05:27.260> of<00:05:27.410> essential<00:05:27.860> oils<00:05:28.160> on

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
and the effects of essential oils on

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.030 
and the effects of essential oils on
hair<00:05:28.520> growth<00:05:28.730> so<00:05:29.330> I'll<00:05:29.540> post<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:30.410> references

hair growth so I'll post the references

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.570 
hair growth so I'll post the references
below<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.970> first<00:05:32.300> one<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:33.020> one<00:05:33.230> that<00:05:33.580> actually

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
below the first one is one that actually

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.460 
below the first one is one that actually
I<00:05:35.000> think<00:05:35.240> a<00:05:35.510> lot<00:05:35.600> of<00:05:35.690> people<00:05:35.930> quite<00:05:36.110> know<00:05:36.260> about

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
I think a lot of people quite know about

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.050 
I think a lot of people quite know about
it<00:05:36.590> she<00:05:36.770> quite<00:05:37.340> a<00:05:37.370> lot<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.640> people<00:05:37.880> know<00:05:38.030> about

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
it she quite a lot of people know about

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.900 
it she quite a lot of people know about
and<00:05:38.600> she's<00:05:39.410> in<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.890> mixture<00:05:40.220> of<00:05:40.310> lavender<00:05:40.760> oil

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
and she's in a mixture of lavender oil

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.710 
and she's in a mixture of lavender oil
and<00:05:41.650> I<00:05:42.650> think<00:05:42.950> it's<00:05:43.070> time<00:05:43.480> essential<00:05:44.480> oil

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
and I think it's time essential oil

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.220 
and I think it's time essential oil
along<00:05:45.590> with<00:05:45.650> rosemary<00:05:46.100> and<00:05:46.520> also<00:05:47.480> see<00:05:48.050> the

along with rosemary and also see the

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.260
