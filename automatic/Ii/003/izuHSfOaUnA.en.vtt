00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
non literate person well you know the

non literate person well you know the
the<00:01:20.100> sense<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.060> me<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.080> when

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the sense of this for me is is that when

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.620 
the sense of this for me is is that when
one<00:01:22.439> does<00:01:22.650> look<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> archaeology<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
one does look into the archaeology and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.330 
one does look into the archaeology and
the<00:01:25.549> prehistory<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:27.259> Europe<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.250> Middle

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
the prehistory of Europe and the Middle

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
the prehistory of Europe and the Middle
East<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.299> well<00:01:30.570> known<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> agreed<00:01:31.860> by

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
East it's it's well known and agreed by

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
East it's it's well known and agreed by
scholars<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.030> were<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.210> goddess

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
scholars that these were all goddess

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.649 
scholars that these were all goddess
cultures<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.650> when<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.430> when<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> grew<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
cultures but when we when I grew up and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
cultures but when we when I grew up and
studied<00:01:36.900> history<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:38.450> school<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> was

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
studied history in school was it was

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.350 
studied history in school was it was
never<00:01:40.290> taught<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.130> guess<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.820> reason<00:01:42.180> is

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
never taught and I guess the reason is

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
never taught and I guess the reason is
that<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.960> goddess<00:01:43.320> cultures<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.009> by<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that the the goddess cultures are by and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.090 
that the the goddess cultures are by and
large<00:01:44.490> considered<00:01:45.210> pre<00:01:45.540> historical<00:01:46.320> which<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
large considered pre historical which in

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
large considered pre historical which in
a<00:01:47.310> sense<00:01:47.490> proves<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.090> point<00:01:48.119> because

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
a sense proves your point because

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
a sense proves your point because
history<00:01:49.079> itself<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.740> set<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.130> begin<00:01:50.280> with

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
when you when you communicate let me

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709 
when you when you communicate let me
back<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.130> moment<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.000> basis<00:02:00.479> for

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
back up for a moment that the basis for

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.580 
back up for a moment that the basis for
this<00:02:00.960> idea<00:02:01.530> has<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:02.790> with<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> fact<00:02:03.360> that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
this idea has to do with the fact that

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.029 
this idea has to do with the fact that
we<00:02:04.590> humans<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.759> strange<00:02:06.920> wiring<00:02:07.920> in

and<00:05:34.229> the<00:05:35.100> left<00:05:35.280> hand<00:05:35.520> was<00:05:35.940> essentially<00:05:36.600> a

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
and the left hand was essentially a

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.680 
and the left hand was essentially a
functional<00:05:37.350> in<00:05:37.560> writing<00:05:38.310> I<00:05:38.460> mean<00:05:39.090> if<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:39.419> lost

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
functional in writing I mean if you lost

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.750 
functional in writing I mean if you lost
your<00:05:39.810> left<00:05:40.020> vocal<00:05:40.410> cord<00:05:40.680> you'd<00:05:41.400> have<00:05:41.580> a<00:05:41.610> hard

arm it wouldn't interfere with your

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.060 
arm it wouldn't interfere with your
ability<00:05:46.380> to<00:05:46.830> write<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:48.320> so<00:05:49.320> this<00:05:49.530> is<00:05:49.680> a<00:05:49.710> very

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070
