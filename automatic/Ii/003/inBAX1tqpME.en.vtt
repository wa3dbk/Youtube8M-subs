but it's always entertaining and that's
just<00:01:27.380> as<00:01:27.560> important<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.160> my<00:01:28.250> opinion<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.910> only

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
just as important in my opinion the only

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.570 
just as important in my opinion the only
really<00:01:29.870> negative<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:31.040> sometimes<00:01:31.460> it

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
really negative is that sometimes it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.980 
really negative is that sometimes it
feels<00:01:31.730> like<00:01:31.850> you're<00:01:32.000> jumping<00:01:32.330> around<00:01:32.420> far<00:01:32.780> too

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
feels like you're jumping around far too

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.870 
feels like you're jumping around far too
much<00:01:33.140> in<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:33.380> story<00:01:33.650> similar<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.250> resistance

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
much in the story similar to resistance

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.210 
much in the story similar to resistance
to<00:01:35.180> for<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:35.990> most<00:01:36.170> part<00:01:36.290> though<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.830> keeps<00:01:37.070> you

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
to for the most part though it keeps you

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.640 
to for the most part though it keeps you
pretty<00:01:37.490> good<00:01:37.730> paste<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.420> have<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:39.110> say<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.320> wasn't
