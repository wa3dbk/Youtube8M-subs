 months from the short-term Wartburg 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.699
 they had developed alternatives 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.679
 they had demonstrated blocking the highway 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:35.119
 drove to Bonn 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.519

 Air Races inventory will be over 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.509
 but that is probably more of an issue 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.779
 with its high vertical range of manufacture 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.540

 Most automotive plants were overwhelmed with dismay 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.319
 the crash is 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.729
 but less 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:48.319
 it was crazy 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.179

 Opel will end 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.479
 incomprehensible too is to be expected 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.479
 that a lot of people 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.949
 and worldwide

 Herzens Â»the pope 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.020
