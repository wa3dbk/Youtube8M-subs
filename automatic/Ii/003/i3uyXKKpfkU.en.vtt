Hutchins<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:48.250> creature<00:00:48.489> was<00:00:48.820> around<00:00:49.120> there

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420

you<00:00:49.720> know<00:00:49.780> several<00:00:50.140> people<00:00:50.290> in<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.830> area<00:00:51.100> had

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.570 
seen it I think it had attacks and
cattle<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:55.330> did<00:00:55.660> as<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.900> unique<00:00:59.160> call<00:01:00.160> I<00:01:00.190> guess

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
cattle it did as a unique call I guess

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.250 
cattle it did as a unique call I guess
you<00:01:00.699> would<00:01:00.850> call<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.390> didn't<00:01:01.780> knew<00:01:02.140> it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
you would call it I didn't knew it

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.229 
you would call it I didn't knew it
wasn't<00:01:02.440> the<00:01:02.680> Wolfman<00:01:03.220> it<00:01:03.400> wasn't<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.850> coyote

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
wasn't the Wolfman it wasn't the coyote

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.020 
wasn't the Wolfman it wasn't the coyote
didn't<00:01:04.750> sound<00:01:04.900> like<00:01:05.049> a<00:01:05.140> lion<00:01:05.560> because<00:01:06.549> it<00:01:06.909> was

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
didn't sound like a lion because it was

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.210 
didn't sound like a lion because it was
a<00:01:07.060> screech<00:01:07.420> on<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.900> it's<00:01:08.080> all<00:01:08.229> going<00:01:08.530> was

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
a screech on it it's all going was

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.500 
a screech on it it's all going was
pretty<00:01:09.460> spooky<00:01:09.940> sort<00:01:10.299> of<00:01:10.390> a<00:01:10.479> sound<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
pretty spooky sort of a sound the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.420 
pretty spooky sort of a sound the
hindquarters<00:01:13.510> looked<00:01:14.320> more<00:01:14.530> like<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.770> hyena<00:01:15.070> a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
hindquarters looked more like a hyena a

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.500 
hindquarters looked more like a hyena a
head<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.970> more<00:01:16.869> hyena<00:01:17.409> and<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.970> hair<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.330> quite

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
head is more hyena and the hair is quite

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.680 
head is more hyena and the hair is quite
coarse<00:01:19.990> it's<00:01:20.260> not<00:01:20.440> like<00:01:20.619> wolf<00:01:20.890> hair<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.690> don't

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
coarse it's not like wolf hair I don't

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.219 
coarse it's not like wolf hair I don't
think<00:01:22.930> it's<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.200> species<00:01:24.240> by<00:01:25.240> itself<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.990> think

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
think it's a species by itself I think

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.850 
think it's a species by itself I think
maybe<00:01:26.500> he<00:01:27.250> may<00:01:27.430> be<00:01:27.490> a<00:01:27.640> hybrid<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:29.170> maybe<00:01:29.439> just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
maybe he may be a hybrid or maybe just

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.020 
maybe he may be a hybrid or maybe just
the<00:01:30.150> mutation<00:01:31.710> DNA<00:01:32.710> test<00:01:33.130> would<00:01:33.430> would<00:01:33.790> answer

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
the mutation DNA test would would answer

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.930 
the mutation DNA test would would answer
a<00:01:34.180> lot<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.390> questions<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.290> it<00:01:35.380> should<00:01:35.620> be

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
a lot of questions and it should be

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.760 
a lot of questions and it should be
should<00:01:36.940> be<00:01:36.970> done<00:01:37.330> he<00:01:38.230> needed<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.650> be

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
should be done he needed to be

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
should be done he needed to be
eliminated<00:01:39.400> in<00:01:39.580> order<00:01:39.730> to<00:01:40.000> protect<00:01:40.390> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
eliminated in order to protect the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.920 
eliminated in order to protect the
family<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.610> first<00:01:42.820> time<00:01:43.120> he<00:01:43.270> shot<00:01:43.510> at<00:01:43.750> it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
family and the first time he shot at it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.100 
family and the first time he shot at it
he<00:01:44.080> shot<00:01:44.650> a<00:01:44.680> little<00:01:44.890> high<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.660> he<00:01:46.660> killed<00:01:46.960> his

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
he shot a little high and he killed his

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.040 
he shot a little high and he killed his
milk<00:01:47.320> cow<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.710> other<00:01:47.950> side<00:01:48.280> of<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
milk cow on the other side of the the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.260 
milk cow on the other side of the the
brush<00:01:50.290> he<00:01:50.620> hadn't<00:01:50.980> seen<00:01:51.220> yeah<00:01:51.610> they<00:01:51.820> had<00:01:51.970> small

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
brush he hadn't seen yeah they had small

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.880 
brush he hadn't seen yeah they had small
children<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.870> was<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:53.020> pretty<00:01:53.230> big<00:01:53.410> deal<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.860> be

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
children it was a pretty big deal to be

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.450 
children it was a pretty big deal to be
out<00:01:54.160> of<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.400> milk<00:01:54.640> cow<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.990> they<00:01:56.290> had<00:01:56.530> also<00:01:57.250> had

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
out of a milk cow they they had also had

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.920 
out of a milk cow they they had also had
chickens<00:01:57.910> they<00:01:58.060> were<00:01:58.150> trying<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.450> protect<00:01:58.600> if

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
chickens they were trying to protect if

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.080 
chickens they were trying to protect if
they<00:01:59.050> were<00:01:59.170> nearly<00:01:59.680> as<00:01:59.770> important<00:02:00.250> as<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.520> cow

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
they were nearly as important as the cow

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.260 
they were nearly as important as the cow
I<00:02:02.040> imagine<00:02:03.040> ate<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.430> cow<00:02:03.610> after<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.150> was

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
I imagine ate the cow after it was

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.190 
I imagine ate the cow after it was
killed<00:02:04.540> but<00:02:06.090> shortly<00:02:07.090> thereafter<00:02:07.210> early<00:02:08.110> in

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
killed but shortly thereafter early in

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.749
