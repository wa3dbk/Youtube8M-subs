00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello to all here on our home 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.250
 you miss and bike then today 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.390
 a new tutor so yes 50 years in the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.960
 not done but it's because of the weather 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.150
 wanted to do nothing then in the meantime I 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.230
 bought a 3d we will have improved stuff 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.300
 so you do not see too much training 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 so today a new tutor in 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.410
 bike because we do not admit it 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.420
 ask is how to stay in 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.900
 balance long enough to be able to 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.480
 then added figures on it so 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.879
 to stay long enough in balance 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.969
 on your bike if it will be at home early 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.859
 you go I was going to be like that he's gonna 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.569
 have to turn the wheel to stay in 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.850
 balance what if you stay the art 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:46.819
 like that it's super hot so 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.710
 temaru about 90 degrees by 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:50.569
 report to your calm so you stay 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.920
 in and that's like it's almost 

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:56.839
 your guide have they all played the game 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.069
 you 're like that put you rolling a 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.569
 little in the beginning what are you going to see 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:05.720
 various were relative to rats without 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:08.060
 bubbles and where I want to move you do 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.070
 this exercise there the beginning for where the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.610
 coyotes definitely wanted like that or 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.590
 so I really do not have to stay a 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.980
 tool and when you will arrive less than that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.980
 by far that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.010
 you turn a little forest army or 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.660
 mills at this level when you will have 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.530
 do this well you can invite 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.530
 move by bike 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.030
 so that's it for today 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.560
 so if you want to learn from 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.170
 new things we do again 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.790

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.620
 that you want us to do as for 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.780
 this 8th there and then we will do it 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.240
 in the following as for now the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.710
 time is good and then we learn to change 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.050
 if we are missed on our bike 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.660
