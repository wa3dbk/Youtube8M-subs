00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.989

 I was right here for the pizza 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.050

 are 500 milliliters of lukewarm water 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.970
 So 37 degrees really should not be 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.930
 be hoarse because otherwise of course ours 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.810
 we have 25 milliliters of uneasy 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.520
 then we have right in front of it 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 tablespoon sugar next to it ten grams of salt 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.799
 and for the professionals that the 4 0 5 was 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.520
 the knife cut the first board 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.380
 capture official action from the camera 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.060
 but you have good eyes and see 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.040
 anyway , with e10 salt 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.710
 integrated and mix theme 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.350
 actually that easy again 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.580
 safe at home and can imitate me 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.090
 I can promise will call for it 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.090
 difficult 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.789
 such a small hollow are the power 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:05.860
 our help and crumbs as possible 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:08.250
 small as pure deep relatively reasonable 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.830
 close 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.709
 the university researcher yeast by the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.379
 but so easy in the comments 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.920
 our sugar comes to this yeast now 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.849
 the middle scattered 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.400
 Entrepreneurs half of ours 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.780
 lukewarm water and add level with 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.380
 they are not so terrible about that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.540
 in it speaks so i have about the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.790
 half of it intel to about half 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.110
 for the water and now let the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.269
 whole stand 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.319
 and during the now stands ten minutes 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.940
 ever speaks the pizza ask 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.470
 dough after ten are not detailed 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.489
 has here the gloating by the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.610
 thrown so blow that is active 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:01.690
 Now you can add the rest of the water 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.950
 and of course our oil etc 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.299
 the whole between the cold kitchen 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.069
 I'm different now, the 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.870
 make children by hand and 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.370
 just take it from outside to inside 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.359
 flour and now announces a bit nice 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.359
 dough together 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.790
 Now I have a nice dough clump 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.260
 Smooth dough is called in here now 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.090
 did my wife have i corrected one 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:32.250
 beautiful excellent smooth dough is 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:35.320
 insanely good from june their vote 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.720
 It was always here so groups found 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.960
 pizza weeks, he called the size roll 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.620
 in that flat that you nice that we 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.330
 again such a smooth taiko hear and 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.430
 which divides google shapes and now 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.640
 to a really nice pizza between 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.590
 Now I have to press pizza 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.420
 a little bit more done on my bed 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.100
 now it's about making it flat 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.640
 or best from the inside 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.320
 roses first thumbs to the ball 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.220
 form the end with the fingers 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.900
 to pull that way 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.190
 Here you can see the one from the right 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.130
 to the left that one of both 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.020
 side very well received but could 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.880
 But then the Italians do it 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.010
 the book somehow by hand is so 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.290
 tricks the romandie throws the air 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.660
 the pizza floor and got me a wife 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.990
 occupation prohibited 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.370
 As I said the kitchen looks nice and 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.950
 I had to do so and has none 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.330
 we're going to do it now 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.580
 the variant is getting slow 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.130
 a little bit bigger to turn from others 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:36.060
 side it was because the appropriate 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.290
 so size is the size 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.419
 underbody and do not get into it 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.160
 Series production but awkward acts 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.260
 do this enough for housewife from 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.450
 Now I have the pizza tin or if 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.910
 Her pizza ski is even better and better 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.680
 we use one now and have the 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.590
 big advantage that are afterwards on the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.060
 salt nice slips down and we have 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.430
 the dough extra with a little less 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.140
 salt or seniors has the day extra with 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.390
 We have to think that after that 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.150
 also works like that and then beat 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.940
 Now we have our pizza oli and sandy 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.020
 practically here once it comes here 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.890
 you can open up a bit like that 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.410
 move closer together 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.890
 that as absolutely within the scope of the feasible 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.310
 and a bit around and peter ready 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.210
 close 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.270
 then I'll take a trowel 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.180
 the sauce on top in trowels 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.390
 because they are so beautiful that you can spread the 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.770
 evenly on the pizza hat as possible 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.270
 Watching that was not mind 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.670
 therefore smears the next pizza 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.430
 Hold on to it 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.560
 but that's absolutely not feasible 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.870
 much not too little just as should the 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:49.150
 right dose meeting hotel now 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:51.370
 if our mozzarella x4 mozzarella 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:57.450
 the wiener mozzarella market then still 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:57.450
 seven members 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.610
 Later, it now often foutiert 350 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.430
 pre-heat 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:16.879
 So from 270 works with two buses 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:21.099
 blanket because now within 23 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:25.490
 minutes is ready but watch 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:27.259
 the single Pomeranian so looks explore 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:32.060
 You can get down here now 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:34.009
 Look here a bit so perfect 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.710
 pizza deliverymen look the tension when 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:41.120
 So do not leave now forever 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.690
 slipping down slippers 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.300
 costs 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:47.630
 because the Jew piece is again from below 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.949
 so better not a pizza because mine 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.069
 Everyone comes across the edge 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.349
 not cheesy or so mushy only cheese 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.880
 it is just a beautiful day this 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:59.289
 it grows incredibly so it stops 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.289
 not right down the front so finds 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:07.099
 crispy I would have guessed now that 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:12.020
 the almost bit salty is through the 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:16.370
 ground and that is I think I've 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.180
 calculated on the tongue and must 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.729
 imitate necessarily 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.020
 then I would be totally interested 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.789
 who with what probably prove this pizza 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.740
 or even better I should be based 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.210
 the occupy at chapel recipe and 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.370

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:45.620
