00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.190
 Hello and Oleg Danilov this project 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.190
 see these by force and today we will look at 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.190
 Acad Arch miniature gaming keyboard 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.599
 m 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.140
 but perhaps one of the largest 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.149
 full size keyboard 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:22.699
 conducted by us 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.539
 less reg except aluminum 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.630
 Aktau port 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.699
 it may even seem to work in such 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.359
 conditions uncomfortable but queen quickly get used to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.480
 because the size of the buttons themselves has not changed 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.380
 but sacrificing compactness 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.630
 I had to bring the control unit 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.290
 cursor who are accused of digital 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.570
 such a combination unfortunately doing 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.960
 rolled format unsuitable for 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.130
 left handed players 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.269
 button on the blog 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.510
 here, as well as solid, I would not 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.809
 device edge activists block tv 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:49.780
 keys 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.760
 it is precisely the configuration and due 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.490
 futuristic appearance art 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.710
 echoing from the forums is wide such 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.300
 m 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.520
 button on the blog 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.219
 now has a name year 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.290
 and switches the modes of operation digital 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.160
 keyboard and in baku 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.259
 we are forgery 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.530
 standard colors and actual marks 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.930
 game from big blood cursor and 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.200
 arrows last by the way 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.550
 highlight 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.420
 in game mode and function 5 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.210
 custom macaques but for now 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.560
 three of them are trapezoidal 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.240
 where is located under the thumbs 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.810
 just below the gaps 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.970
 it is convenient even though they seemed 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.490
 it's a little tight there 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.390
 two more macaques cork appeared only shooter 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.080
 branded pack allows 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.170
 configure macros separately enable and 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.340
 turn off the right and left Windows key 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 kapslok stage 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.900
 manage custom 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.890
 profile 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.479
 Krakow Parma dill clearly fixed 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.660
 pressing a big enough chorus 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.980
 it is a pleasure to play on it 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.750
 wide rubber feet on the bottom 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.220
 eliminate slippage 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.400
 metal base increasing 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 structural rigidity 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 m 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.960
 but miniature and very high quality 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 new keyboard 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.840
 but despicable price functionality 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840
 could be higher
