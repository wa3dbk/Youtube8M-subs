00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.660 
through this other top green ring so you
can<00:02:55.940> see<00:02:56.150> how<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.620> kind<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.130> going<00:02:58.370> around

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
can see how it's kind of going around

that eye that top eye then you close
your<00:03:03.650> ring<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.989> what<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
your ring and now you have what is the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.810 
your ring and now you have what is the
beginning<00:03:06.739> of<00:03:07.930> GSG<00:03:08.959> now<00:03:09.830> the<00:03:09.890> beginning<00:03:10.700> is

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
beginning of GSG now the beginning is

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.729 
beginning of GSG now the beginning is
the<00:03:10.940> always<00:03:11.270> the<00:03:11.300> hardest<00:03:11.690> part<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.170> I'll<00:03:12.560> do

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
the always the hardest part and I'll do

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.830 
the always the hardest part and I'll do
it<00:03:12.770> try<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> couple<00:03:13.489> more<00:03:13.700> times<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:14.690> you

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
it try a couple more times just so you

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.080 
it try a couple more times just so you
get<00:03:15.410> it<00:03:19.780> taking<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:20.930> same<00:03:21.230> piece<00:03:22.090> putting

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
get it taking this same piece putting

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.350 
get it taking this same piece putting
another<00:03:23.299> ring<00:03:23.570> through<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.170> eye

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
another ring through the eye

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.460 
another ring through the eye
now<00:03:26.360> if<00:03:26.480> you've<00:03:26.630> made<00:03:26.810> half<00:03:27.019> version<00:03:27.320> three

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
now if you've made half version three

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.960 
now if you've made half version three
and<00:03:27.590> one<00:03:27.709> again<00:03:27.920> you'll<00:03:28.040> be<00:03:28.160> well<00:03:28.670> familiar

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
and one again you'll be well familiar

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.160 
and one again you'll be well familiar
with<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.420> i<00:03:29.780> shape<00:03:31.570> putting<00:03:32.570> two<00:03:32.780> closed

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
with this i shape putting two closed

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:47.500 
with this i shape putting two closed
rings<00:03:33.560> onto<00:03:34.010> this<00:03:34.760> open<00:03:35.120> ring

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.670 

and<00:03:47.599> then<00:03:49.090> take<00:03:50.090> this<00:03:50.269> ring<00:03:50.569> slide<00:03:51.230> it<00:03:51.379> up<00:03:51.500> so

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
and then take this ring slide it up so

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.990 
and then take this ring slide it up so
it's<00:03:51.799> facing<00:03:52.069> kind<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.610> same<00:03:52.760> direction

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
it's facing kind of the same direction

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.220 
it's facing kind of the same direction
as<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.390> other<00:03:53.510> ones<00:03:55.450> turn<00:03:56.450> these<00:03:56.720> two<00:03:56.989> rings

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
as the other ones turn these two rings

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:10.440 
as the other ones turn these two rings
inwards<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:59.239> form<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.989> eye<00:04:00.019> shape<00:04:00.560> again

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.180 

place<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.600> ring<00:04:11.780> through<00:04:12.020> there<00:04:12.880> then<00:04:13.880> go<00:04:14.240> up

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
place the ring through there then go up

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.920 
place the ring through there then go up
through<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.000> closed<00:04:17.300> ring<00:04:17.540> above<00:04:18.260> it<00:04:19.930> over

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
through the closed ring above it over

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.630 
through the closed ring above it over
and<00:04:22.180> through<00:04:23.200> this<00:04:24.200> next<00:04:24.650> ring<00:04:25.070> right<00:04:25.310> beside

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
and through this next ring right beside

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.910 
and through this next ring right beside
the<00:04:25.760> one<00:04:25.880> we<00:04:26.030> just<00:04:26.060> went<00:04:26.390> through<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:27.680> we're

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
the one we just went through so we're

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:38.879 
the one we just went through so we're
going<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.070> go<00:04:28.190> through<00:04:28.430> that

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.390 

and<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.610> is<00:04:40.110> GSG<00:04:41.110> this<00:04:41.889> would<00:04:42.039> be<00:04:42.159> an<00:04:42.250> ideal

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
and that is GSG this would be an ideal

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.520 
and that is GSG this would be an ideal
weave<00:04:43.000> if<00:04:43.330> you<00:04:43.509> wanted<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.870> use<00:04:43.990> neoprene

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
weave if you wanted to use neoprene

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.790 
weave if you wanted to use neoprene
since<00:04:44.949> half<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.189> Rings<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:45.639> use<00:04:45.969> are<00:04:46.800> closed

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
since half the Rings you use are closed

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.249 
since half the Rings you use are closed
already<00:04:48.219> so<00:04:48.909> if<00:04:49.509> you're<00:04:49.719> lucky<00:04:49.930> enough<00:04:50.110> to

already so if you're lucky enough to
have<00:04:50.349> some<00:04:50.800> neoprene<00:04:51.159> rings<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.669> can<00:04:51.819> make<00:04:51.939> a

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
have some neoprene rings you can make a

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.680 

now<00:05:38.960> we're<00:05:39.110> going<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.320> go<00:05:39.410> up<00:05:39.560> just<00:05:39.830> around<00:05:40.690> the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
now we're going to go up just around the

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:50.070 
now we're going to go up just around the
eye<00:05:41.720> shape<00:05:42.200> above<00:05:45.820> and<00:05:46.820> close<00:05:47.240> that<00:05:47.480> ring

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.200 

there<00:05:51.080> you<00:05:51.440> have<00:05:51.680> GSG<00:05:52.340> it's<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:52.970> little

there you have GSG it's a little

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.120 
there you have GSG it's a little
