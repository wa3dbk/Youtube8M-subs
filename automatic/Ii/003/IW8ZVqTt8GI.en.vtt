have licensed and partnered with NASA so

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.069 
have licensed and partnered with NASA so
we<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> huge<00:00:48.180> head<00:00:48.450> start<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.809> terms<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
we have a huge head start in terms of

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.540 
we have a huge head start in terms of
Technology<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> that's<00:00:49.980> how<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> a

very small startup company just 13
people<00:00:53.399> now<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:54.390> already<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:55.079> our

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
people now and actually already have our

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.590 
people now and actually already have our

own space qualify abal lunar lander that
we're<00:00:57.719> developing<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> business

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
we're developing so what is the business

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.150 
we're developing so what is the business
of<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> moon<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.989> we're<00:01:01.829> really<00:01:02.039> in

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
of going to the moon so we're really in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.590 
of going to the moon so we're really in
the<00:01:02.219> early<00:01:02.520> stages<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.300> business<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the early stages of the business that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.450 
the early stages of the business that
going<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> moon<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> there

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
going to the moon I think that there

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.770 
going to the moon I think that there
will<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> business<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:06.630> be

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
will be a lot of the business will be

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.260 
will be a lot of the business will be
resource<00:01:07.140> development<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> moon<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:09.090> may

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
resource development in the moon we may

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.050 
resource development in the moon we may
think<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> moon<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> dead<00:01:10.470> dry<00:01:10.710> rock<00:01:11.060> but

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think of the moon as a dead dry rock but

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
think of the moon as a dead dry rock but
actually<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.900> moon<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:13.740> rich<00:01:13.979> in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
actually the moon is very very rich in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.130 
actually the moon is very very rich in
resources<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:15.360> moon<00:01:15.540> probably<00:01:15.960> has<00:01:16.110> more

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
resources the moon probably has more

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.109 
resources the moon probably has more
platinum<00:01:16.740> than<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.549> all<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> mining

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
platinum than are in all the mining

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
platinum than are in all the mining
reserves<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.570> planet<00:01:18.840> earth<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
reserves of planet earth and that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.050 
reserves of planet earth and that
platinum<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.130> generally<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
platinum is generally just on the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.580 
platinum is generally just on the
surface<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> earth<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.500> been

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
surface of the earth because it's been

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.960 
surface of the earth because it's been
brought<00:01:22.799> by<00:01:22.979> asteroids<00:01:23.369> hitting<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.820> moon

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
brought by asteroids hitting the moon

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
brought by asteroids hitting the moon
all<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.750> time<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.259> millions<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> billions

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
all the time over millions and billions

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.120 
all the time over millions and billions
of<00:01:26.310> years<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.930> out<00:01:28.110> harvest<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
of years so you can go out harvest that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.880 
of years so you can go out harvest that
that<00:01:29.759> platinum<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.810> bring<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> back<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
that platinum and then bring it back the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.319 
that platinum and then bring it back the
another<00:01:32.220> part<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> business<00:01:32.759> another

another part of the business another

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.499 
another part of the business another

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
traveling and living in space is also

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.749 
traveling and living in space is also
the<00:01:40.110> key<00:01:40.350> element<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> rocket<00:01:41.340> fuel<00:01:41.369> hydrogen

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the key element of rocket fuel hydrogen

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.810 
the key element of rocket fuel hydrogen

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.819 
and oxygen form hydrazine the key rocket
fuel<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.420> space<00:01:45.570> shuttle<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.560> know

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
fuel we use in space shuttle we now know

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.880 
fuel we use in space shuttle we now know
that<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.880> water<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.540> moon

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
that there is more water on the moon

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.929 
that there is more water on the moon
there's<00:01:49.890> enough<00:01:50.040> water<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> moon<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
there's enough water on the moon to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
there's enough water on the moon to
power<00:01:51.149> 3<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.409> our<00:01:52.530> us-based<00:01:53.220> shuttle<00:01:53.820> launch

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
power 3 to our us-based shuttle launch

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.819 
power 3 to our us-based shuttle launch
every<00:01:54.509> day<00:01:54.720> for<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> next<00:01:55.079> three<00:01:55.439> thousand

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
every day for the next three thousand

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.069 
every day for the next three thousand
years<00:01:56.070> okay<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> fast<00:01:57.600> amount<00:01:57.960> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
years okay so this is fast amount of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.600 
years okay so this is fast amount of
resources<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.829> get<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.460> can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
resources and if you get that you can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.130 
resources and if you get that you can
bring<00:01:59.759> anything<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.750> back<00:02:00.899> from<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
bring anything you want back from the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.750 
bring anything you want back from the
moon

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
moon

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.680 
moon
actually<00:02:02.000> for<00:02:02.180> free<00:02:02.360> once<00:02:02.600> the

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
actually for free once the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.440 
actually for free once the
infrastructure<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.380> built<00:02:03.530> or<00:02:04.070> you<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:05.030> bring

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
infrastructure is built or you can bring

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.870 
infrastructure is built or you can bring
that<00:02:05.630> back<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.080> low-earth<00:02:06.350> orbit<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:07.040> once

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
that back to low-earth orbit and once

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.580 
that back to low-earth orbit and once
that<00:02:07.970> fuels<00:02:08.330> are<00:02:08.510> the<00:02:08.660> North<00:02:08.869> orbit<00:02:09.170> then<00:02:09.410> it

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
that fuels are the North orbit then it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.960 
that fuels are the North orbit then it
changes<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.010> whole<00:02:10.040> economics<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.760> space

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
changes the whole economics of space

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.640 
changes the whole economics of space
development<00:02:11.510> because<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.320> launch

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
development because you can just launch

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.140 
development because you can just launch
only<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> payload<00:02:13.670> you<00:02:13.760> want<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.030> low-earth

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
only the payload you want to low-earth

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.520 
only the payload you want to low-earth
orbit<00:02:14.510> and<00:02:14.660> then<00:02:14.750> use<00:02:14.870> all<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.110> fuel<00:02:15.320> from

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
orbit and then use all the fuel from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.320 
orbit and then use all the fuel from
there<00:02:15.740> collapse<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.490> economics<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.000> really

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
there collapse the economics so really

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.810 
there collapse the economics so really
this<00:02:17.840> business<00:02:18.290> starts<00:02:18.650> now<00:02:18.890> with<00:02:19.460> being<00:02:19.730> able

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
this business starts now with being able

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.090 
this business starts now with being able
to<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.180> commercial<00:02:20.560> development<00:02:21.560> landing

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
to have a commercial development landing

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.650 
to have a commercial development landing
on<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> moon<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.670> bringing<00:02:23.060> payload<00:02:23.390> for<00:02:23.570> our

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
on the moon and bringing payload for our

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.450 
on the moon and bringing payload for our
customers<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.230> ultimately<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.250> think<00:02:25.400> that

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
customers and ultimately we think that

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.490 
customers and ultimately we think that
will<00:02:25.670> lead<00:02:25.850> over<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.660> next<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.050> know<00:02:27.170> 10<00:02:27.410> to

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
will lead over the next you know 10 to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.220 
will lead over the next you know 10 to
20<00:02:27.770> years<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.300> whole<00:02:29.630> new<00:02:29.810> commercial

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
20 years to a whole new commercial

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.330 
20 years to a whole new commercial
development<00:02:30.680> business<00:02:30.800> based<00:02:31.130> around<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
development business based around the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.890 
development business based around the
myth<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.150> tell<00:02:32.300> us<00:02:32.330> about<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.600> vehicle

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
myth and so tell us about the vehicle

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.210 
myth and so tell us about the vehicle
this<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.170> quarter<00:02:33.530> scale<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.070> version

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
this is a quarter scale to the version

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.830 
this is a quarter scale to the version
of<00:02:34.490> your<00:02:34.640> Lander<00:02:34.940> yeah<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:35.390> quarter<00:02:35.690> scale

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
of your Lander yeah this quarter scale

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.650 
of your Lander yeah this quarter scale
version<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.230> our<00:02:36.320> Lander<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.460> can<00:02:37.670> see<00:02:37.910> the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
version of our Lander you can see the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.680 
version of our Lander you can see the
these<00:02:39.350> are<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> legs<00:02:39.940> okay<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.480> really

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
these are the legs okay and it's really

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.810 
these are the legs okay and it's really
important<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.080> have<00:02:42.230> legs<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:43.490> can

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
important to have legs so you can

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.360 
important to have legs so you can
balance<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:44.480> not<00:02:44.720> fall<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:44.960> tip<00:02:45.200> over

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
balance and not not fall and tip over

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.890 
balance and not not fall and tip over
this<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.550> showing<00:02:46.700> various<00:02:47.090> instruments<00:02:47.480> I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
this is showing various instruments I

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.050 
this is showing various instruments I
don't<00:02:48.470> know<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.430> one<00:02:49.790> if<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:51.730> look<00:02:52.730> under

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
don't know if this one if you look under

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.240 
don't know if this one if you look under
here<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.950> can<00:02:55.100> see<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.610> tank<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.690> bottom

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
here you can see a tank at the bottom

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.400 
here you can see a tank at the bottom
okay<00:02:58.250> um<00:02:58.490> that<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.240> showing<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.780> the<00:02:59.810> main

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
okay um that is showing the the main

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.130 
okay um that is showing the the main
engine<00:03:00.890> for<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.400> lander<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.030> that's<00:03:02.990> the

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
engine for the lander and that's the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.840 
engine for the lander and that's the
thing<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.470> is<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:03.980> as<00:03:04.160> its<00:03:04.370> thrusting<00:03:04.730> out

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
thing that is like as its thrusting out

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.340 
thing that is like as its thrusting out
so<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:05.150> system<00:03:05.450> is<00:03:05.570> losing<00:03:05.870> its<00:03:05.989> feet<00:03:06.170> as<00:03:06.260> it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
so the system is losing its feet as it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.340 
so the system is losing its feet as it
goes<00:03:06.500> down<00:03:06.709> what's<00:03:07.370> not<00:03:07.910> shown<00:03:07.970> on<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:09.140> a

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
goes down what's not shown on this is a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.930 
goes down what's not shown on this is a
whole<00:03:09.590> bunch<00:03:09.800> of<00:03:09.920> little<00:03:10.070> thrusters<00:03:10.580> oh<00:03:10.820> I

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
whole bunch of little thrusters oh I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.430 
whole bunch of little thrusters oh I
guess<00:03:11.209> if<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.390> come<00:03:11.540> over<00:03:11.660> here<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.410> a

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
guess if you come over here this is a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.699 
guess if you come over here this is a
model<00:03:12.709> of<00:03:12.920> 11<00:03:13.850> such<00:03:14.090> thruster<00:03:14.510> so<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.440> system

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
model of 11 such thruster so the system

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:16.990 
model of 11 such thruster so the system
would<00:03:15.830> actually<00:03:16.130> have<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.280> bunch<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.610> thrusters

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
would actually have a bunch of thrusters

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.610 
would actually have a bunch of thrusters
all<00:03:17.209> over<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.600> and<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> thrusters<00:03:18.260> are<00:03:18.380> used

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
all over it and the thrusters are used

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.550 
all over it and the thrusters are used
for<00:03:19.420> stabilizing<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> attitude<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
for stabilizing the attitude so the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.800 
for stabilizing the attitude so the
thing<00:03:21.739> doesn't<00:03:22.130> spin<00:03:22.310> out<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.430> control<00:03:22.810> then

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
thing doesn't spin out of control then

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.090 
thing doesn't spin out of control then
you've<00:03:23.930> got<00:03:24.050> various<00:03:24.320> other<00:03:24.500> instruments<00:03:24.980> and

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
you've got various other instruments and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.500 
you've got various other instruments and
so<00:03:25.220> on<00:03:25.400> one<00:03:25.970> thing<00:03:26.120> we're<00:03:26.209> going<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.390> be

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
so on one thing we're going to be

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.600 
so on one thing we're going to be
showing<00:03:26.750> tonight<00:03:27.260> is<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.980> we've<00:03:28.160> built<00:03:28.430> a

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
showing tonight is that we've built a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.640 
showing tonight is that we've built a
little<00:03:28.820> mini<00:03:29.120> telescope<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.350> go<00:03:30.470> and

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
little mini telescope that can go and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.900 
little mini telescope that can go and
land<00:03:30.769> on<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.980> moon<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.370> start<00:03:31.610> taking

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
land on the moon and start taking

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.880 
land on the moon and start taking
pictures<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.239> anything<00:03:32.810> once<00:03:33.350> it's<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.709> and

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
pictures of anything once it's there and

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.310 
pictures of anything once it's there and
that<00:03:34.880> we<00:03:35.300> have<00:03:35.330> actually<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.750> customer<00:03:36.170> who

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
that we have actually a customer who

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.810 
that we have actually a customer who
would<00:03:36.440> like<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.620> build<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.040> telescope<00:03:37.610> in

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
would like to build that telescope in

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.729 
would like to build that telescope in
larger<00:03:38.209> scale<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:39.050> us<00:03:39.170> deliver<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.590> to

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
larger scale and have us deliver it to

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.320 
larger scale and have us deliver it to
the<00:03:40.010> dark<00:03:40.190> side<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.550> moon<00:03:40.610> or<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.030> far

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
the dark side of the moon or the far

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.270 
the dark side of the moon or the far
side<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.690> moon<00:03:41.900> that's<00:03:42.800> the<00:03:42.920> only<00:03:43.100> place

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
side of the moon that's the only place

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.949 
side of the moon that's the only place
in<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.550> whole<00:03:43.790> universe<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.630> doesn't

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
in the whole universe that doesn't

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.509 
in the whole universe that doesn't
actually<00:03:45.080> see<00:03:45.410> earth<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.070> it<00:03:46.130> doesn't<00:03:46.430> have

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
actually see earth so it doesn't have

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.310 
actually see earth so it doesn't have
any<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.850> the<00:03:46.970> radio<00:03:47.300> or<00:03:47.570> light<00:03:47.750> disturbances

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
any of the radio or light disturbances

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.739 
any of the radio or light disturbances
that<00:03:48.380> come<00:03:48.650> from
