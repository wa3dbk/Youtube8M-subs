00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.730
 e 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.470
 salute here hunters 66 and today 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.100
 we will meet for a new 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.720
 video 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.520
 the Linafoot found themselves thus in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.410
 this room with this magnificent 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.630
 Pikachu 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.270
 it was for gold angling on board 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 more more more more more more 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 today we find ourselves just as 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.530
 well for a mechanism the game this time 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.980
 here we are going to talk about a girl in Aix 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.930
 who carried so much speculation 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.200
 since many youtuber 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.240
 streamer same other people have 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.120
 found and chagny pretty quickly with 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.120
 this method is to us wanted 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.390
 so determine the probability of 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 find a cat or with this method 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:10.100
 so here after several tests having 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.409
 especially the harvest since a figure 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.909
 in the sky is over so that the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.979
 probability of trenches nor to navy 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 d'aix was not scalable based 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.659
 of the chain so like many the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.939
 think no these probabilities do not evolve 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.530
 not according to the chain s probity 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.020
 and fixed why it's the simple one 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.200
 what you need to know is that hang 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.280
 with the radar bouquet if we do 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 several tests to redefine 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 together we have a lot more 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.789
 wave- based chains that the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.479
 figure increases and exceeds 40 and 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:48.689
 that very little chagny falls after 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:51.119
 5 10 hours pokhara chains but this 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.670
 is not the case for david ex for 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.710
 the ship x we see that luck and 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.149
 after who will be able according to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.170
 the evolution of the chain one surrenders 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.509
 account that conceives a how is 9 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.939
 cents there was actually evolution 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.679
 depending on how many channels there were 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.530
 the number of chains east and roughly 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.020
 so we 're going to try to 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.110
 give the nearest value 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.459
 possible of this probability is so 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.450
 can be seen on the graph 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.470
 should be displayed on your screen 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.830
 just in fact what's going on 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 is that we realize that if 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.430
 you look at the camp curves 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.480
 the curve of the chains of the number of 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.900
 channels found there in fact depending on the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:39.420
 figure will increase depending on actually 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.980
 of the curve a day 3 1 so here it is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.450
 it seems that it follows quite easily 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.440
 this curve so for now we have 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.080
 of 107 shining dance in this graph 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.110
 but it would seem so that the figure 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.989
 is pretty good and we're pretty sure and 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.030
 on the occasion asserted that so the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.030
 song life knicks and 1 in 300 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.600
 so here you are, I beg you all 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.070
 watch this video anyone who 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.280
 watch this video so if you 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.860
 want to share this video from 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.150
 sharing is also this information 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.430
 so so that a lot of 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.840
 people can access it and know to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:22.320
 the future so that the chance of a lifetime 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.910
 of aix is ​​about 1 in 300 so here 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.030
 I will leave you here with in this 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.709
 information that I let you mature and 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.170
 I'll see you soon for a 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.739
 next video it's already 66 and we're 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.739
 said very soon
