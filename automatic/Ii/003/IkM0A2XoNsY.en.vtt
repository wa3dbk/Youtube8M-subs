00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.689
 all press i'm magna and this is a new business 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.819
 workshop 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.680
 but before starting it, I would like you 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.710
 tell about your second channel on 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.690
 which comes out almost every display 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.639
 until the day that if he goes to the shooting range 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.139
 the future will be many more interesting 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.830
 games subscribe 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.930
 so in fifth place we have trail 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.630
 on marketing 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.090
 here is frozen well damn in 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 principle on on morphing in general not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.790
 normal sets that I strongly 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.590
 just like the srl blade and 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 with the third with this they will be completely not 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.350
 not fit well if they are still changing 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.340
 keels 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.500
 it will be a very good set for 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.840
 marketing lovers let's see 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 that we are in fourth place but on 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.870
 fourth place we have this strongest 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.449
 teams and the world and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.550
 it's a set of ursus how do you know that 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.320
 logo is more precisely the virtus.pro symbol is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.890
 bear but from close legs they have 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.339
 kura bear and now they have released a set 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 on ursa but here is nothing for me 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.060
 Especially in fact, such a carpet 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.010
 rear curtain 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 Well, damn I do not know, in principle, cool on 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.020
 Ursu ​​is also not particularly multi-sets for 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.200
 diversity comes but maxim is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.119
 fourth place but third place with us 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.960
 already pretty serious work here we are 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.409
 We see the light on the navigator and that I really 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:40.049
 like this how his belt is made and not 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.780
 from behind him now I will show you how you are 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.439
 You can see such a thing. It is also very 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.869
 cool 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.540
 A good addition even if you don’t 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.630
 like let's say hats from this set then 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.579
 you can just take 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.770
 scroll if he will go separately well 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.219
 or 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.560
 completely headless armor but on a very 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:03.320
 bad all for 3 place fit 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.829
 Well Well if earlier it was not for us 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.429
 very usually, but now it appears 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.400
 more and more ready chests 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.430
 here we have a chest but not so to say 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.879
 with things on heroes and with interfaces in 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.670
 cool principle i even think that this 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.860
 the chest can be released but so that it does not 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.160
 became very expensive let's say for 99 cents 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.620
 You can open it several times if 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.049
 I will definitely release a video on it 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:39.530
 so but the first interface is such 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:42.620
 bone here you can see 2 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.340
 the interface is not very clear too some 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.099
 skull bones 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.160
 such a calm color is suitable for those 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:58.129
 who doesn’t really like to change anything 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:02.200
 interface residues and very dark here 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:07.269
 just me so here we have the plot 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.680
 some such green stone ruins 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.430
 something reminds me of skyrim 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.620
 This interface is the fifth 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.639
 glacial price themed and koruna 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:23.349
 some incomprehensible inscriptions principle 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:28.120
 very cool and concludes this set 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:31.549
 golden yellow interface just 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.170
 yellow metal is more precisely golden 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.930
 gold is shorter 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.020
 the interface is cool for an amateur but me 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.060
 I personally liked this one more 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.280
 green which reminds me skyrim 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.280
 well then let's see what we have on 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:52.130
 first place first place us quotes 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.090
 mr dark sir such cosmically even 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.160
 called serov for galaxy on dark sira 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.190
 there are no worthy things at all and this color 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.890
 very good for lovers 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.800
 dark sir i am almost faithful that he 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.769
 changes animation and very seriously 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.630
 change because well I do not know tass this 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.130
 leagues 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.590
 I really liked for some reason no longer 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.660
 flowers for Halloween all the same for all 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.180
 understand that there will be no such shit that 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.570
 fat gay very bad 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:31.010
 I also want to tell you if you yourself 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.540

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.500
 can write in the comments to give 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.850
 I will look at the link and almost sphere 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.330
 probability one hundred percent i will add it 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.560
 in the top may not in the first place but all 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.539

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.450
 because how I want to help 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:52.729
