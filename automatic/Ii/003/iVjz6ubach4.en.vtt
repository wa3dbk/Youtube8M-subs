1957 to 1962

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.560 
1957 to 1962
I<00:00:27.869> had<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> seventeen<00:00:29.130> jewelle<00:00:29.849> wind<00:00:30.060> movement

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
I had a seventeen jewelle wind movement

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.310 
I had a seventeen jewelle wind movement
but<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.830> special<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.000> watch<00:00:33.450> was<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
but was a special about that watch was a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.160 
but was a special about that watch was a
thick<00:00:34.920> mat<00:00:35.250> dial<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> extra<00:00:36.719> magnetic

powerful<00:00:45.690> actual<00:00:46.100> currents<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:48.239> was

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
powerful actual currents and so it was

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
powerful actual currents and so it was
designed<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.649> be<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> thoroughgoing<00:00:50.340> tool

current rail master which was introduced

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.920 
current rail master which was introduced
in<00:01:00.600> 2003<00:01:01.699> they<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.000> stopped<00:01:03.300> production

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
in 2003 they actually stopped production

in 2003 they actually stopped production
of<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> model<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.739> year<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.070> 2010<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.659> was

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
of the model this year in 2010 it was

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.429 
of the model this year in 2010 it was
available<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.229> three<00:01:07.470> sizes<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:09.390> believe<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
available in three sizes I believe it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.670 
available in three sizes I believe it
was<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> 36<00:01:11.490> 39<00:01:13.700> 42<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.560> was

this is a chronometer wash and so the

very successful I think it's probably

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.780 
very successful I think it's probably
going<00:06:18.680> to<00:06:18.740> be<00:06:18.800> a<00:06:18.890> collector's<00:06:19.250> watch<00:06:19.430> just

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
going to be a collector's watch just

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.100 
going to be a collector's watch just
because<00:06:20.030> it's<00:06:20.180> been<00:06:20.240> discontinued<00:06:20.870> it<00:06:20.990> had<00:06:21.080> a

because it's been discontinued it had a

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.110 
because it's been discontinued it had a
very<00:06:21.410> short<00:06:22.220> run<00:06:22.780> and<00:06:24.250> it's<00:06:25.250> definitely<00:06:25.640> a<00:06:25.850> bit

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
very short run and it's definitely a bit

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.809 
very short run and it's definitely a bit
off<00:06:26.270> the<00:06:26.300> beaten<00:06:26.540> path<00:06:26.690> as<00:06:27.050> far<00:06:27.260> as<00:06:27.380> these

this watch is something that's

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.329
