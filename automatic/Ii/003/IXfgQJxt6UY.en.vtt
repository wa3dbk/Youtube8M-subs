00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.000
You were born here, Paris is your territory,
This is where you work, where you live and where you weave your story!

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.000
Your work is hard: An exhausting rythm of life!
(You are an) Able and brilliant young boy, you think of great moments of glory!

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.750
Descended from a beautiful family you have recognized all your opportunities...
You are a pupille of this soil and you feel this intense force!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.750
Free in your choices and your life, you love this strong independence...
That saves your soul and your mind for your future and for France!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:19.250
So you advance without subjecting yourself obediently to anyone!
You live your life without anyone dictate to you what to choose!

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.250
So you advance,
You think of your ideas, trust your conscience!

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.750
You live your life,
You fight for your work and your country!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's the Parisian dream...

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.750
You wonder everyday when you wake up...
You leave your fascinating dreams and you return to action.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.750
We live in a crazy world where humanity is divided.
But you're always alarmed to build your community!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.750
And then with all your friends... those you call comrades,
You fight, you assert and imagine that you restart a crusade!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The reconquest of sacred ground never scared you.
It's better to die and sacrifice rather than continue living this horror.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:55.750
And you dream of a great day, a shot, a drumbeat!
When you wake up, you vomit the system you vomit these vultures!

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:12.000
And you dream a majestic act of love and bravery!
As you wake up, you scream for help. Direct action is needed.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:27.750
It's the Parisian dream...

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.750
Last verse, last chorus for you, your fight and your ideas!
You who are proud to be Parisian, and especially so proud to be French.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.750
Maybe it is time to arm ourselves with weapons and friendship...
For the strength of our continent, the suburbs have already started.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.750
You have put your life to the church or into the city!
This city of the kingdom of France, so loved and so hated!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.750
You, you are never discouraged. You know why you're here.
I will not go further, it's your turn! Confidence is gained already!

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.500
So you decide!
You react in direct action with or without violence!

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:31.750
You laugh and you cry,
A defender of the common good and honour!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.500
So you decide!
You rampage and sometimes you put yourself in a trance!

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:48.000
You laugh and you cry for a victory or a defeat reluctantly!

00:04:48.250 --> 00:05:20.000
It's the Parisian dream...
