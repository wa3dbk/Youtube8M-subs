thing<00:04:18.150> yeah<00:04:18.600> it's<00:04:18.989> very<00:04:19.680> difficult<00:04:20.160> for<00:04:20.400> them

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
thing yeah it's very difficult for them

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.250 
thing yeah it's very difficult for them
to<00:04:20.549> sort<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.000> grasp<00:04:21.299> what's<00:04:21.660> cool<00:04:21.870> while<00:04:22.140> at

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
to sort of grasp what's cool while at

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.730 
to sort of grasp what's cool while at
the<00:04:22.380> same<00:04:22.590> time<00:04:22.830> being<00:04:23.100> family<00:04:23.580> friendly<00:04:23.940> and

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
capitalistic in nature so I mean this is

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.520 
capitalistic in nature so I mean this is
Sonic's<00:04:29.070> fourth<00:04:29.639> or<00:04:29.940> fifth<00:04:30.360> comeback<00:04:30.990> yeah

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.640 
you can say what you want about the
designs<00:04:53.280> but<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.300> remember<00:04:54.570> playing<00:04:54.780> Sonic<00:04:55.500> on

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
designs but I remember playing Sonic on

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.200 
designs but I remember playing Sonic on
Game<00:04:55.889> Gear<00:04:56.130> when<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.430> was<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> little<00:04:56.639> kid<00:04:56.970> and

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
Game Gear when I was a little kid and

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.330 
Game Gear when I was a little kid and
I'm<00:04:57.660> freaking<00:04:58.169> loved<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:58.950> games<00:04:59.160> of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
I'm freaking loved it so the games of

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.520 
I'm freaking loved it so the games of
themselves<00:04:59.820> have<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.570> potential<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.139> be<00:05:01.350> good

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
themselves have the potential to be good

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.770 
themselves have the potential to be good
maybe<00:05:01.800> that's<00:05:02.039> what<00:05:02.160> we<00:05:02.250> should<00:05:02.280> stick<00:05:02.729> with

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
maybe that's what we should stick with

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.080 
maybe that's what we should stick with
yeah<00:05:03.780> and<00:05:04.130> you<00:05:05.130> know<00:05:05.220> every<00:05:05.490> time<00:05:05.639> they<00:05:05.789> try<00:05:06.030> to
