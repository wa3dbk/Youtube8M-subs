I'll<00:00:12.390> be<00:00:12.510> demonstrating<00:00:13.380> how<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.889> make<00:00:14.430> an<00:00:14.850> SSP

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I'll be demonstrating how to make an SSP

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.550 
I'll be demonstrating how to make an SSP
an<00:00:16.049> SSP<00:00:17.040> is<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.550> decreased<00:00:18.210> stitch<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
an SSP is a decreased stitch that is

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.190 
an SSP is a decreased stitch that is
worked<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.490> wrong<00:00:20.820> side<00:00:21.210> or<00:00:21.240> purl<00:00:21.660> side<00:00:21.990> of

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
worked on the wrong side or purl side of

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.890 
worked on the wrong side or purl side of
the<00:00:22.320> fabric<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.950> when<00:00:23.270> viewed<00:00:24.270> from<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the fabric and when viewed from the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.380 
the fabric and when viewed from the
right<00:00:25.140> side<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.770> fabric<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.460> most<00:00:26.910> closely

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
right side of the fabric it most closely

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.609 
right side of the fabric it most closely
mirrors<00:00:28.230> an<00:00:28.610> SSK<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.349> right<00:00:31.560> in

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
mirrors an SSK you can see it right in

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.300 
mirrors an SSK you can see it right in
here

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.310 
here

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.120 
here
here<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.360> an<00:00:33.840> SSP<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.950> definitely

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
here is an SSP and you can definitely

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.750 
here is an SSP and you can definitely
see<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.790> left-leaning<00:00:36.690> stitch<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> let's<00:00:38.489> turn

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
see a left-leaning stitch so let's turn

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.420 
see a left-leaning stitch so let's turn
back<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.329> wrong<00:00:39.630> side<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> fabric<00:00:40.440> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
back to the wrong side of the fabric and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.569 
back to the wrong side of the fabric and
make<00:00:41.660> our<00:00:42.660> stitch<00:00:42.989> I'm<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.949> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> purl<00:00:44.460> a

make our stitch I'm just going to purl a
few<00:00:44.969> stitches<00:00:46.280> before<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.789> work<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
few stitches before we work on the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.169 
few stitches before we work on the
stitch<00:00:50.059> all<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.539> now<00:00:51.719> how<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:53.179> execute

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
stitch all right so now how to execute

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.200 
stitch all right so now how to execute
an<00:00:54.629> SSP<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.429> can<00:00:56.609> just<00:00:56.820> leave<00:00:56.999> your

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
an SSP and you can just leave your

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
an SSP and you can just leave your
working<00:00:57.539> yarn<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> front<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.499> just<00:00:58.530> fine

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
working yarn in the front is just fine

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.939 
working yarn in the front is just fine
we<00:00:59.910> are<00:00:59.999> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.420> slip<00:01:00.870> one<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.920> knit

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
we are going to slip one as if to knit

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.090 
we are going to slip one as if to knit
and<00:01:02.719> slip<00:01:03.719> another<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.860> knit

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and slip another as if to knit

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.600 
and slip another as if to knit
they<00:01:05.940> must<00:01:06.210> be<00:01:06.420> slipped<00:01:06.750> separately<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.610> then

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
they must be slipped separately and then

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
they must be slipped separately and then
you're<00:01:08.760> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.060> return<00:01:09.659> those<00:01:10.110> stitches

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you're going to return those stitches

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.840 
you're going to return those stitches

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
back to the left hand needle and now

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
back to the left hand needle and now
here<00:01:15.090> comes<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.360> tricky<00:01:15.540> part<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:16.649> are<00:01:16.740> going

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
here comes the tricky part we are going

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.160 
here comes the tricky part we are going
to<00:01:17.040> purl<00:01:17.549> these<00:01:18.119> two<00:01:18.509> stitches<00:01:18.930> together

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to purl these two stitches together

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.399 
to purl these two stitches together
through<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.340> back<00:01:20.369> loop<00:01:20.750> so<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> do<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.079> I'm

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
through the back loop so to do that I'm

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.990 
through the back loop so to do that I'm
going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> take<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:22.920> right<00:01:23.159> hand<00:01:23.189> needle<00:01:23.579> it's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
going to take my right hand needle it's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.730 
going to take my right hand needle it's
going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.329> go<00:01:24.450> behind<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:25.140> first<00:01:25.409> stitch

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740

behind<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> second<00:01:27.329> stitch<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.560> going

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
behind the second stitch and I'm going

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.420 
behind the second stitch and I'm going
to<00:01:28.950> enter<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> second<00:01:30.420> stitch<00:01:30.950> from<00:01:31.950> left<00:01:32.280> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
were looking at this side of the fabric

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
were looking at this side of the fabric
how<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.310> look<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.850> go<00:01:39.420> into<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
how it would look you go into that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.600 
how it would look you go into that
second<00:01:40.469> stitch<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.090> first<00:01:42.509> stitch

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.090 
second stitch and then the first stitch
and<00:01:44.610> come<00:01:44.820> out<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.180> way<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> let<00:01:46.710> me<00:01:46.829> turn<00:01:47.039> it

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and come out that way so let me turn it

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.330 
and come out that way so let me turn it
back<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.960> pass<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.770> first<00:01:49.979> stitch

back here so you pass the first stitch

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.929 
back here so you pass the first stitch
the<00:01:50.729> second<00:01:51.180> stitch<00:01:52.340> enter<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> second

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
purl them together and let me just show

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.359 
purl them together and let me just show
you<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.539> more<00:02:06.689> time<00:02:07.039> slip<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.190> if<00:02:08.310> to

stitches to the left hand needle and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.070 
stitches to the left hand needle and
then<00:02:15.510> you're<00:02:15.720> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> purl<00:02:16.320> them<00:02:16.650> together

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
then you're going to purl them together

then you're going to purl them together
through<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.740> back<00:02:19.950> loop

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.960
