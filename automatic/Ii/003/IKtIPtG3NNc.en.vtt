California<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.009> below<00:02:00.400> sea<00:02:00.790> level<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.479> we

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
California is below sea level and we

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.539 
California is below sea level and we
talked<00:02:02.110> about<00:02:02.200> air<00:02:02.470> pressure<00:02:02.710> in<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> school

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
talked about air pressure in the school

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.090 
talked about air pressure in the school
today<00:02:03.790> extra<00:02:04.570> air<00:02:04.930> pressure<00:02:05.290> she<00:02:05.560> get<00:02:05.740> more

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
today extra air pressure she get more

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.490 
today extra air pressure she get more
weight<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.610> get<00:02:06.909> higher<00:02:07.390> pressure<00:02:07.810> squeezing

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
weight you get higher pressure squeezing

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.810 
weight you get higher pressure squeezing
in<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.799> that<00:02:08.890> warms<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> temperature<00:02:09.790> even

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
in and that warms the temperature even

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.850 
in and that warms the temperature even
more<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.479> of<00:02:10.780> course<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:11.380> dry<00:02:11.620> because

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
more and of course it is so dry because

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.740 
more and of course it is so dry because
of<00:02:12.100> that<00:02:12.220> just<00:02:12.459> baguettes<00:02:12.730> more<00:02:12.970> heat<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.390> so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
of that just baguettes more heat and so

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.990 
of that just baguettes more heat and so
134<00:02:14.650> hottest<00:02:14.980> temperature<00:02:15.280> ever<00:02:15.310> recorded<00:02:15.459> on

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
134 hottest temperature ever recorded on

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.400 
134 hottest temperature ever recorded on
the<00:02:16.329> face<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.840> planet

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
the face of the planet

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.770 
the face of the planet
