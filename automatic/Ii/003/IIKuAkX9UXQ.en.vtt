hello<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.510> Chow<00:00:03.929> again<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.040> is

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
hello this is Chow again and this is

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.010 
hello this is Chow again and this is
going<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.490> be<00:00:05.670> a<00:00:05.700> review<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.569> central

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
going to be a review of the central

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.410 
going to be a review of the central
visual<00:00:07.470> pathways<00:00:09.320> okay<00:00:10.610> so<00:00:11.610> right<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.090> we

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
visual pathways okay so right here we

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.070 
visual pathways okay so right here we
have<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> schematic<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:14.179> two<00:00:15.179> eyes<00:00:15.389> your<00:00:15.809> left

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
have a schematic of two eyes your left

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.109 
have a schematic of two eyes your left
and<00:00:16.350> your<00:00:16.500> right<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:17.490> back<00:00:17.730> here<00:00:17.789> is

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and your right and then back here is

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.400 
and your right and then back here is
your<00:00:18.270> occipital<00:00:18.539> lobe<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.170> we'll<00:00:19.320> just

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
your occipital lobe so we'll just

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410 
your occipital lobe so we'll just
pretend<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.220> whole<00:00:20.460> sort<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> area<00:00:21.119> is

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
pretend that this whole sort of area is

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.689 
pretend that this whole sort of area is
a<00:00:22.010> cross-section<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> brain<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.609> you're

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
a cross-section of the brain and you're

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.859 
a cross-section of the brain and you're
looking<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.060> onto<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:26.390> okay<00:00:27.390> if<00:00:27.750> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
looking down onto it okay if you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.620 
looking down onto it okay if you
remember<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.160> lateral<00:00:29.640> geniculate<00:00:29.699> nucleus

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
remember the lateral geniculate nucleus

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.569 
remember the lateral geniculate nucleus
is<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.619> area<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.920> thalamus<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is an area in the thalamus that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
is an area in the thalamus that
processes<00:00:33.390> visual<00:00:33.540> information<00:00:33.899> before<00:00:34.860> it

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
processes visual information before it

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.310 
processes visual information before it
sends<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.309> back<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.730> occipital<00:00:36.000> lobe

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
sends it back to the occipital lobe

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
sends it back to the occipital lobe
which<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> central<00:00:38.010> processing<00:00:38.370> area<00:00:38.790> for

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
which is the central processing area for

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.770 
which is the central processing area for
any<00:00:39.510> visual<00:00:39.899> information<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:41.780> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
any visual information that you have you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.770 
any visual information that you have you
may<00:00:42.899> also<00:00:43.050> remember<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:44.030> visual<00:00:45.030> input<00:00:45.510> from

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
may also remember that visual input from

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
may also remember that visual input from
the<00:00:45.899> left<00:00:46.140> side<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.579> your<00:00:47.850> visual<00:00:48.030> field<00:00:48.300> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
the left side of your visual field is

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
the left side of your visual field is
going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> come<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> actually<00:00:51.079> be

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
going to come back and actually be

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
going to come back and actually be
processed<00:00:52.590> by<00:00:52.829> initially<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
processed by initially the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.340 
processed by initially the
photoreceptors<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.690> retina<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
photoreceptors of your retina on the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.459 
photoreceptors of your retina on the
right<00:00:55.530> side<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:55.980> eyes<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.289> if<00:00:58.289> you're

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
right side of your eyes so if you're

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.310 
right side of your eyes so if you're
just<00:00:58.680> looking<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> left<00:00:59.340> eye<00:00:59.579> alone

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
just looking at the left eye alone

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.479 
just looking at the left eye alone
visual<00:01:01.320> permission<00:01:01.739> from<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> left<00:01:02.280> side<00:01:02.430> of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
visual permission from the left side of

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.579 
visual permission from the left side of
the<00:01:02.550> field<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:03.059> coming<00:01:03.390> back<00:01:03.570> hitting<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the field is coming back hitting the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070 
the field is coming back hitting the
retina<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:05.309> information<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.479> relayed<00:01:06.780> down

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
retina here information is relayed down

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.940 
retina here information is relayed down
the<00:01:07.560> optic<00:01:07.920> nerve<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> chiasm<00:01:09.799> where<00:01:10.799> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
the optic nerve to the chiasm where it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.399 
the optic nerve to the chiasm where it
sends<00:01:11.340> further<00:01:11.700> information<00:01:12.330> back<00:01:12.720> towards

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
sends further information back towards

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.080 
sends further information back towards
the<00:01:13.740> LGN<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.970> here<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:16.220> then<00:01:17.220> finally<00:01:17.700> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the LGN right here and then finally it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
the LGN right here and then finally it
goes<00:01:18.210> along<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> optic<00:01:18.840> radiations<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> help

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
goes along the optic radiations to help

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.350 
goes along the optic radiations to help
stock<00:01:20.189> occipital<00:01:20.520> lobe<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.180> further

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
stock occipital lobe for further

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.740 
stock occipital lobe for further
processing<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> same<00:01:23.970> way<00:01:24.210> over<00:01:24.390> here<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
processing in the same way over here in

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
processing in the same way over here in
the<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:24.990> eye<00:01:25.640> visual<00:01:26.640> input<00:01:26.909> from<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> left

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
the right eye visual input from the left

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.420 
the right eye visual input from the left
side<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> field<00:01:27.840> hits<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> retina<00:01:28.680> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
side of the field hits the retina and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
side of the field hits the retina and
then<00:01:30.180> also<00:01:30.450> shoots<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.439> along<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> optic

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
then also shoots back along the optic

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
then also shoots back along the optic
nerve<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.450> joins<00:01:33.750> fibers<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.439> other

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.090 
side to take the same retro chiasma
pathway<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> LGN<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.829> then<00:01:40.829> joins

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
pathway back to the LGN and then joins

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.280 
pathway back to the LGN and then joins
them<00:01:41.280> again<00:01:41.520> along<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.030> optic<00:01:42.390> radiations<00:01:42.990> to

them again along the optic radiations to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.910 
them again along the optic radiations to
the<00:01:43.409> occipital<00:01:43.680> lobe<00:01:44.270> so<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:45.840> all<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the occipital lobe so in that way all of

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.740 
the occipital lobe so in that way all of
your<00:01:47.040> visual<00:01:47.220> inputs<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.299> coming<00:01:48.540> from

your visual inputs that is coming from
the<00:01:48.899> left<00:01:49.110> side<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.380> your<00:01:49.530> field<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.670> actually

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the left side of your field is actually

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.789 
the left side of your field is actually
a<00:01:51.210> processed<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> right<00:01:52.350> side<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> your

left occipital lobe
all<00:02:06.220> right<00:02:06.870> so<00:02:07.870> you<00:02:07.990> may<00:02:08.229> remember<00:02:08.290> then<00:02:09.100> that

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
all right so you may remember then that

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.110 
all right so you may remember then that
there<00:02:09.760> are<00:02:10.530> visual<00:02:11.530> deficits<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.520> scotoma<00:02:12.940> is

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
there are visual deficits or scotoma is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.140 
there are visual deficits or scotoma is
that<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.480> can<00:02:13.840> expect

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
that you can expect

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.350 
that you can expect
depending<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.270> where<00:02:16.660> along<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.230> pathway

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
depending on where along this pathway

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.950 
depending on where along this pathway
you<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.390> abnormalities<00:02:19.930> or<00:02:20.380> pathology<00:02:21.960> so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
you have abnormalities or pathology so

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.040 
you have abnormalities or pathology so
if<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> remember<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:25.000> some<00:02:25.630> sort<00:02:25.930> of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
if you remember if you have some sort of

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.900 
if you remember if you have some sort of
transaction<00:02:26.950> here<00:02:27.190> or<00:02:27.280> some<00:02:27.460> kind<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.700> issue

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
transaction here or some kind of issue

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.680 
transaction here or some kind of issue
right<00:02:28.330> across<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.900> optic<00:02:29.230> nerve<00:02:30.180> then<00:02:31.180> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
right across the optic nerve then the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.180 
right across the optic nerve then the
person<00:02:32.020> would<00:02:32.110> have<00:02:32.170> a<00:02:32.320> visual<00:02:32.710> deficit

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
person would have a visual deficit

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.000 
person would have a visual deficit
completely<00:02:33.730> in<00:02:33.910> their<00:02:34.090> right<00:02:34.270> eye<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.890> would

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
completely in their right eye they would

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.770 
completely in their right eye they would
see<00:02:36.190> totally<00:02:36.640> normally<00:02:36.970> either<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.270> left<00:02:37.540> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
see totally normally either the left and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.090 
see totally normally either the left and
a<00:02:37.810> lot<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:37.990> these<00:02:38.110> people<00:02:38.350> actually<00:02:38.620> do<00:02:39.070> just

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
a lot of these people actually do just

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.830 
a lot of these people actually do just
fine<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:40.480> because<00:02:40.750> their<00:02:41.110> brain<00:02:41.290> can

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
fine just because their brain can

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.120 
fine just because their brain can
continue<00:02:43.840> just<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.140> ignore<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.920> right<00:02:45.100> eye

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
continue just to ignore the right eye

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.770 
continue just to ignore the right eye
and<00:02:45.280> they<00:02:45.490> just<00:02:45.640> learn<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.970> lose<00:02:46.330> their<00:02:46.540> left

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
and they just learn to lose their left

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.490 
and they just learn to lose their left
eye<00:02:46.930> for<00:02:47.380> vision<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:49.870> have<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> deficit

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
eye for vision if you have a deficit

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.730 
eye for vision if you have a deficit
here<00:02:50.710> right<00:02:50.950> at<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> chiasm<00:02:51.520> which<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.530> prime

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
here right at the chiasm which the prime

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.010 
here right at the chiasm which the prime
example<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.370> with<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> pituitary<00:02:55.150> mass<00:02:55.660> or<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
example is with a pituitary mass or a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.340 
example is with a pituitary mass or a
tumor<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.450> would<00:02:58.630> get<00:02:58.840> what<00:02:59.020> you<00:02:59.110> call

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
tumor then you would get what you call

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.660 
tumor then you would get what you call
by<00:02:59.800> temporal<00:03:00.670> hemianopsia<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:02.620> some<00:03:03.400> sort<00:03:03.550> of

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
by temporal hemianopsia so some sort of

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.130 
by temporal hemianopsia so some sort of
mass<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.060> pushing<00:03:04.450> up<00:03:04.570> from<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.780> pituitary

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
mass is pushing up from the pituitary

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.800 
mass is pushing up from the pituitary
it's<00:03:05.890> hitting<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.520> fibers<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.420> chiasm

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
it's hitting the fibers in the chiasm

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.710 
it's hitting the fibers in the chiasm
and<00:03:08.320> that<00:03:08.470> affects<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.730> our<00:03:09.910> lateral<00:03:10.390> visual

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
and that affects you our lateral visual

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.140 
and that affects you our lateral visual
fields<00:03:11.020> first<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.830> this<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.520> sort<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:12.940> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
fields first and this is sort of the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.490 
fields first and this is sort of the
pattern<00:03:13.450> of<00:03:13.630> vision<00:03:13.900> loss<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.350> might

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
pattern of vision loss that you might

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.150 
pattern of vision loss that you might
see<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.810> third<00:03:16.989> situation<00:03:17.230> is<00:03:17.770> if<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.010> have

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
see the third situation is if you have

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.850 
see the third situation is if you have
something<00:03:18.400> that's<00:03:19.209> going<00:03:20.080> on<00:03:20.290> with<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.680> retro

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
something that's going on with the retro

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.010 
something that's going on with the retro
chiasma<00:03:21.489> pathway<00:03:21.910> right<00:03:22.060> here<00:03:22.360> or<00:03:22.630> even<00:03:22.930> in

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
chiasma pathway right here or even in

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.210 
chiasma pathway right here or even in
the<00:03:23.110> LGN<00:03:23.560> itself<00:03:25.320> then<00:03:26.320> you<00:03:26.950> would<00:03:27.100> basically

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
the LGN itself then you would basically

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.840 
the LGN itself then you would basically
be<00:03:27.580> missing<00:03:28.180> information<00:03:29.459> from<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.610> left

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
be missing information from the left

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.930 
be missing information from the left
side<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.209> your<00:03:31.360> fields<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:33.040> you'd<00:03:33.220> have<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.430> hum

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
side of your fields so you'd have a hum

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.090 
side of your fields so you'd have a hum
minimus<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.470> actually<00:03:35.739> never<00:03:35.890> see<00:03:36.070> that

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
minimus I can actually never see that

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.560 
minimus I can actually never see that

up for the other one and so you sort of

up for the other one and so you sort of
get<00:05:03.160> this<00:05:03.430> pattern<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:04.090> vision<00:05:04.360> loss<00:05:04.540> where

get this pattern of vision loss where

get this pattern of vision loss where
you<00:05:05.140> have<00:05:05.290> kind<00:05:05.470> of<00:05:05.850> vision<00:05:06.850> loss<00:05:07.000> on<00:05:07.240> one<00:05:07.420> half

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
you have kind of vision loss on one half

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.190 
you have kind of vision loss on one half
with<00:05:08.020> like<00:05:08.230> this<00:05:08.800> little<00:05:09.480> central<00:05:10.480> area<00:05:10.870> where

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
with like this little central area where

with like this little central area where
vision<00:05:11.740> is<00:05:12.010> spared<00:05:13.470> hopefully<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.620> was<00:05:14.740> a

vision is spared hopefully that was a

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.590 
vision is spared hopefully that was a
pretty<00:05:14.980> good<00:05:15.130> review<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.820> know<00:05:15.910> I<00:05:16.030> had<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.360> go

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
pretty good review I know I had to go

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.450 
pretty good review I know I had to go
over<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.960> many<00:05:17.200> many<00:05:17.410> many<00:05:17.650> times<00:05:17.950> before<00:05:18.190> I

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
over this many many many times before I

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.050 
over this many many many times before I
had<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:19.360> down<00:05:20.070> but<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.190> idea<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.550> that<00:05:21.700> if<00:05:21.970> you

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
had it down but the idea is that if you

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.490 
had it down but the idea is that if you
have<00:05:22.210> a<00:05:22.240> patient<00:05:22.450> that<00:05:22.690> comes<00:05:22.810> in<00:05:23.050> complaining

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
have a patient that comes in complaining

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.950 
have a patient that comes in complaining
of<00:05:23.710> vision<00:05:24.010> loss<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.220> in<00:05:24.730> any<00:05:25.120> any<00:05:25.570> of<00:05:25.840> these

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
of vision loss and in any any of these

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.810 
of vision loss and in any any of these
sort<00:05:26.200> of<00:05:26.290> patterns<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:27.160> might<00:05:27.490> be<00:05:27.640> able<00:05:27.730> to

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
sort of patterns you might be able to

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.390 
sort of patterns you might be able to
use<00:05:28.030> these<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.480> try<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.720> pinpoint<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.590> track
