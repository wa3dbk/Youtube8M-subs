00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.799
 hi everyone so today we 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.879
 finds himself for the presentation of a 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.610
 new lure in the nash series of 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.340
 the hour so it's going to be a small 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.279
 beast of ilex is sheriff 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.189
 10 and so it's an honor that makes 9 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.450
 points 5 grams for 5 cm and who swim 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.640
 pretty much a khÃ¢gne depth of swimming 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.280
 of 1 m at the color you 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 see it's a perch color rather 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.420
 natural me I really find it very 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.309
 very very very successful if I prick it 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 not going to do it that's really a very 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.770
 beautiful colors here is not too much 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.840
 aggressive that works very well at the level 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.550
 price so that's about it then you 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
 will find between 15 and 17 euros 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.210
 following the sites so made for him 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
 the ex Havre it is correct a high 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 fish level was looking for that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.170
 will address just about any type of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.450
 carnivorous here is the pike of the 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.469
 boom of chub is especially so 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.250
 that there is market at the beginning of the season 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.570
 makes it small 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.860
 when really a carnivore are 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 focused on small prey 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.140
 size so walk that in early 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.789
 season I did a lot of branches and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.070
 a lot of boom with that one because 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.479
 that he's a favorite dude at 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.310
 level of technique 1 classic bat 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.530
 part of the group b of the throwing lancet 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.549
 stop and go linear 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.220
 here is the tapping post but here it is 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.540
 no time it's deep and no and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.100
 particularity of that one really for 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.930
 a notch that it is that it actually holds 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.159
 very fast recoveries 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.409
 usually the screen but when you 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.400
 bring back too quickly he picks up 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.990
 that one I tested you can 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.790
 bring back almost black night thoroughly with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.780
 your twink the big beasts does not pick up 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.540
 almost never to make 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 accelerations it's fine then 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.250
 we will move to the level of benefits and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.590
 disadvantages 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.180
 there will be a lot more so 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.549
 already first advantage I wanted 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.540
 show the color here it is really 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.820
 a color me I really find it 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 Too much too pretty to hold all the colors 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.430
 Czech really will have to be world 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.659
 they do not have much choice of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 colors but I rarely have those who do 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.100
 100 km very pretty second advantage a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 tanning theirs so it's really 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.670
 the time I tell you that slowly 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.960
 quickly by the ouch holds all the 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 swim it really a very good swim 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.780
 with a big rowling ya that's 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.990
 really ass that is offsetting a lot 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.460
 from them then to the level still of 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 advantages of triples that are very 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.700
 prickly so that's it at the level of 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.599
 flint tripe never cut too much 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.540
 worries to do this is always 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.680
 good triple then we will go to 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.129
 disadvantages to call his 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.260
 cons 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.090
 the price after that takes to cool more 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.580
 a 15 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.840
 between 15 and 17 euros me personally 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.810
 it does not bother me too much for a big 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.580
 dwight here is a great master who 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.930
 works very well 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.489
 so here I think after doing the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.629
 tour did not listen right away we 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.629
 left on the hard snow
