00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 you are near the children 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.959
 why we could not possibly wear 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.309
 the whiskey and why the 50 pieces 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.700
 cents are bigger than 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.169
 those of a euro but seriously 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.939
 why are we beautiful and I mean 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:26.349
 let's imagine running a loud evening 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.210
 friendly in Cairo once there 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.480
 after your 14th glass of whiskey you 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.380
 start feeling a little weird 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.000
 afterwards to find yourself in a 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.950
 old street it all rotten you do not 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.910
 could only walk properly 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.129
 disgust your guts and you 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.829
 do not sleep by telling yourself that never 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.089
 his evening never 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.620
 and then the next night you do 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:49.749
 what but why 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.249
 but in fact the alcoholic harvests 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.980
 do not contain a common element 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.730
 ethanol the sky the cause of all to 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.679
 this little 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.329
 because do you see this crap of 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.679
 molecules and very small by 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.449
 compared to others which allows him to 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.460
 getting hurt your system more easily 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.380
 blood that is waiting for him very quickly 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.790
 most of your organs including the brain 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.810
 sorry I wanted to flash eclairs 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.740
 of honor of the you so quickly the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.910
 brain is also for this 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.290
 reason we can feel the effects of 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.810
 alcohol you're there first glass and a 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.010
 Once inside is the same everywhere 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.230
 but before going into details 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.720
 which recalls on the functioning of the 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.130
 good brain though since I am 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.750
 sure it's not going to be passionate all the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.790
 world I'm going to divide the screen in half 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.020
 that's how those who do not care about 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.970
 cum can get distracted in 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.710
 looking at the right side of the video 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.970
 for others the brain is composed 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.200
 billions of neurons that 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 communicate with each other through 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.100
 what are called synapses 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.960
 these are subject to exchange of 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.060
 noro transmitter that are issued by year 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.500
 europe it receives and by the other the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.240
 reception is carried out by small 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.040
 optical prestine receivers that have a 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.270
 little shit form the fat I have 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.620
 feel that nobody listens to me 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.450
 damn good ok I understood to do 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.280
 it's a fucking neural network to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.930
 inside which information under 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 form of electrical signals 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.860
 your brain and when you are talented 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.270
 like this giraffe for example but 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.070
 because why would humans be 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.660
 the only ones to tear their mouths at this 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.010
 moment there the ctom contained in 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.170
 alcohol goes because of its small size 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.360
 clog the receivers noro nojy cut 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.550
 training will move but much more 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.440
 hardly other glitches of the Serbian 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.450
 therefore a good part of your 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.160
 functions are slowed down and so it's up to 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.380
 cause of this cerebral slowdown that 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.190
 your reflections diminish a bit like a 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.720
 computer that dream is now 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.450
 you know why you shit on 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.950
 this cop car last night 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.330
 and as a lady if you too ask yourself 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.560
 a question when like me but you 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.270
 can leave a little comment while 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.510
 also con in the youtube box that at the 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.980
 baule on facebook go to finland 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.450
 comments also the moment I am 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.680
 supposed in league 1 or 2 of the video 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.150
 press and gilding moreover about it 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.470
 I thank you because of the comments 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.060
 there were more than usual I have 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.430
 played several times so the waters and 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.360
 stone his brothel poses you are 2 or 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.430
 finally thank you for your attention 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.110
 friendly you ask us why 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.370
 we have a headache which is welcome 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.810
 but because of migraines are very 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.470
 diverse and varied so difficult to 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.120
 make a video 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.260
 but not that you would be too 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.180
 disappointed I put you the link to a site 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.260
 porn in the description of the video I 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.000
 see if I can help 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.590
 elodie tells us I was in my shower 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.600
 and I thought but why the gels 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.950
 shower my style bordered in a 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.690
 also issue one has only to shower 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 together we go to sea well 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.480
 already makes two jokes about the sex is 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.980
 not very subtle all that I expect 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.540
 catch up with the following comment a 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.610
 perfect jean pierre coffe ask us 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.550
 why life is very simple 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.340
 it's because 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.790
 the pile to life 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.790
 he 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.440
 the villa
