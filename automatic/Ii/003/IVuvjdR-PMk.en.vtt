00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
much battery power you got you see this

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.779 
much battery power you got you see this
little<00:00:15.870> red<00:00:15.960> line<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.680> says<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.580> almost

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
little red line here says it's almost

little red line here says it's almost
full<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:19.199> shows<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> hundred<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.189> sixty<00:00:20.550> volts

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
full it shows a hundred and sixty volts

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.349 
full it shows a hundred and sixty volts
worth<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.990> power<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.400> we've<00:00:23.580> got<00:00:23.609> there<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
worth of power that we've got there that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.570 
worth of power that we've got there that
means<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.960> almost<00:00:25.109> full<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.550> down

means it's almost full and as we go down
the<00:00:27.000> road<00:00:27.150> it'll<00:00:27.480> tell<00:00:27.689> me<00:00:27.869> how<00:00:28.080> many<00:00:28.140> amps<00:00:28.619> I'm

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the road it'll tell me how many amps I'm

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.310 
the road it'll tell me how many amps I'm
pulling<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.369> my<00:00:29.580> battery<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.240> it'll<00:00:31.109> tell

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
me how far I've got left the goal by

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
me how far I've got left the goal by
this<00:00:33.809> sort<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.590> gas<00:00:34.770> gauge<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.340> shows<00:00:35.610> empty

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
this sort of gas gauge which shows empty

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
this sort of gas gauge which shows empty
over<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:38.210> these<00:00:39.210> batteries<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:40.739> going

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
over here so these batteries I'm going

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.560 
over here so these batteries I'm going
to<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.460> down<00:00:41.700> here<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.360> got<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to go down here this has got a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
to go down here this has got a
touchscreen<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:54.530> as<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.039> see<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
touchscreen in it and as you can see it

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.760 
touchscreen in it and as you can see it
goes<00:00:56.610> different<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:58.289> shows<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.739> different

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
goes different it shows you different

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:09.179 
goes different it shows you different
things<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.789> do

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:22.070 

kind<00:01:09.790> of<00:01:09.939> turn<00:01:10.570> left<00:01:10.780> turn<00:01:11.140> the<00:01:11.320> video<00:01:11.860> off

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.609 

bought<00:01:23.080> simple<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:28.180> what<00:01:28.570> we<00:01:28.720> see<00:01:29.020> here<00:01:29.470> is

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
bought simple now what we see here is

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.609 
bought simple now what we see here is
the<00:01:30.460> individual<00:01:31.210> voltage<00:01:31.600> on<00:01:31.810> every<00:01:32.170> battery

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
the individual voltage on every battery

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.219 
the individual voltage on every battery
and<00:01:32.770> then<00:01:32.890> we<00:01:32.950> have<00:01:33.070> 48<00:01:33.490> batteries<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:34.420> there's

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
and then we have 48 batteries so there's

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.580 
and then we have 48 batteries so there's
16<00:01:36.159> here<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.670> then<00:01:36.759> 16<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.960> then<00:01:38.110> if<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:38.350> want

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
16 here and then 16 and then if we want

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.880 
16 here and then 16 and then if we want
we<00:01:38.770> can<00:01:38.890> go<00:01:39.040> to<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.280> last<00:01:39.490> 16<00:01:39.970> and<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:41.740> will

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
we can go to the last 16 and they will

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.210 
we can go to the last 16 and they will
show<00:01:42.130> up<00:01:42.340> here<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.509> we<00:01:43.810> can<00:01:44.049> watch<00:01:44.530> all<00:01:44.950> the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
show up here so we can watch all the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.249 
show up here so we can watch all the
batteries<00:01:45.610> in<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.940> system<00:01:46.479> that's<00:01:47.110> going

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
batteries in the system that's going

00:01:47.259 --> 00:02:01.469 
batteries in the system that's going
through<00:01:47.590> our<00:01:47.950> DCM<00:01:58.289> so<00:01:59.289> now<00:01:59.590> we<00:02:00.280> know<00:02:00.479> we're

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
through our DCM so now we know we're

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.969 
through our DCM so now we know we're
fully<00:02:01.720> charged<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.380> we're<00:02:02.470> ready<00:02:02.679> to<00:02:02.800> go<00:02:02.950> I

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
fully charged and we're ready to go I

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.770 
fully charged and we're ready to go I
think<00:02:03.190> we're<00:02:03.610> ready<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> go<00:02:04.000> take<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.300> ride<00:02:04.569> down

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
think we're ready to go take a ride down

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:34.760 
think we're ready to go take a ride down
the<00:02:04.929> road

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.190 

you<00:02:35.850> might<00:02:36.850> notice<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.569> don't<00:02:37.720> have<00:02:37.870> any

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
you might notice that we don't have any

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.290 
you might notice that we don't have any
