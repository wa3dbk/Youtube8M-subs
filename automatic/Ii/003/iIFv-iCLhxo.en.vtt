00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
notice is that the clause might start to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
notice is that the clause might start to
get<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.170> loose<00:00:28.849> as<00:00:29.849> they<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.510> older<00:00:31.489> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
get a little loose as they get older the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.799 
get a little loose as they get older the
holes<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.350> grips<00:00:34.649> might<00:00:35.489> start<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.120> wallow

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
holes in the grips might start to wallow

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.900 
holes in the grips might start to wallow
out<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.440> bit<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.890> become<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.879> bit

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
out a little bit and become a little bit

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.369 
out a little bit and become a little bit
larger<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.800> the<00:00:40.800> rubber<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:42.149> wires<00:00:42.899> might

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
larger and the rubber on the wires might

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.190 
larger and the rubber on the wires might
start<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.770> break<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.219> little<00:00:44.489> bit<00:00:44.989> get<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
start to break down a little bit get it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.400 
start to break down a little bit get it
get<00:00:46.379> might<00:00:46.710> get<00:00:46.920> compressed<00:00:47.870> by<00:00:48.870> constantly

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
get might get compressed by constantly

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.959 
get might get compressed by constantly
being<00:00:49.620> squeezed<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> resin<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.820> one<00:00:53.820> thing

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
being squeezed by the resin so one thing

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
being squeezed by the resin so one thing
you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> fix<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> take<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you can do to fix that is to take the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:08.140 
you can do to fix that is to take the
grips<00:00:56.820> apart<00:00:57.469> and<00:01:00.199> get<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:02.840> piece<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> sandpaper

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.789 

and<00:01:09.150> what<00:01:09.869> you're<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.619> you're

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and what you're going to do is you're

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.910 
and what you're going to do is you're
just<00:01:10.860> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> sand<00:01:11.490> off<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.150> inside<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
just going to sand off the inside of the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
just going to sand off the inside of the
grip<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.369> bit<00:01:14.659> which<00:01:15.659> will<00:01:15.990> reduce<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
grip a little bit which will reduce the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.539 
grip a little bit which will reduce the
size<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:19.850> holes<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:23.340> wires

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
size of the holes that the the wires

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.090 
size of the holes that the the wires
have<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.970> fit<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:27.350> alright<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.710> one

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
have to fit in alright so you have one

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.490 
have to fit in alright so you have one
half<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.670> grip<00:01:30.140> you're<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.290> going<00:01:31.439> to

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
half of your grip you're just going to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.960 
half of your grip you're just going to
put<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> same<00:01:32.009> paper<00:01:32.250> down<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.790> flat

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
put the same paper down on a flat

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.800 
put the same paper down on a flat
surface<00:01:33.439> grab<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.590> grip<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.810> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
surface grab your grip like that and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.810 
surface grab your grip like that and
sand<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.950> down

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.400 

okay<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.480> it's<00:01:42.630> going<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.840> make<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> little<00:01:43.290> bit

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
okay and it's going to make a little bit

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.190 
okay and it's going to make a little bit
of<00:01:43.440> dust<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.400> course<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.080> both

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
of dust of course and do that to both

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.060 
of dust of course and do that to both
sides<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:47.160> little<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.910> longer<00:01:48.120> than<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:49.070> but

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
sides a little bit longer than I did but

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
sides a little bit longer than I did but
you<00:01:50.190> don't<00:01:50.370> want<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.730> it<00:01:50.880> too<00:01:51.030> much<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you don't want to do it too much if you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.730 
you don't want to do it too much if you
do<00:01:51.660> it<00:01:51.780> too<00:01:51.960> much<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.380> you're<00:01:52.530> going<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.680> have

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
do it too much then you're going to have

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
do it too much then you're going to have
big<00:01:53.070> gaps<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:54.900> your<00:01:54.960> grips<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.800> I<00:01:56.990> don't<00:01:57.990> think

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
big gaps in your grips and I don't think

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
big gaps in your grips and I don't think
that<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.650> would<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.830> too<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.280> you're<00:01:59.520> just

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that that would be too good you're just

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.280 
that that would be too good you're just
trying<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.060> reduce<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.570> size<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.110> holes

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
trying to reduce the size of the holes

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.680 
trying to reduce the size of the holes
just<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.800> little<00:02:02.070> bit<00:02:04.910> and<00:02:05.910> after<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.540> can

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
just a little bit and after that you can

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.450 
just a little bit and after that you can
reassemble<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.410> grips<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:07.890> put<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.250> back

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
reassemble the grips and put that back

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:16.550 
reassemble the grips and put that back
together<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:14.630> of<00:02:15.630> course<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.990> other<00:02:16.290> thing

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
together I of course the other thing

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.590 
together I of course the other thing
that<00:02:16.590> you<00:02:16.770> could<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.160> is<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:18.420> get

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
that you could do is you can get

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.270 
that you could do is you can get
yourself<00:02:19.070> some<00:02:20.180> plasti<00:02:21.180> dip<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:25.070> with<00:02:26.070> that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
yourself some plasti dip and with that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.980 
yourself some plasti dip and with that
it's<00:02:26.550> pretty<00:02:26.760> easy<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:28.200> just<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.709> jar<00:02:29.190> of

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
it's pretty easy it's just a jar of

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:38.510 
it's pretty easy it's just a jar of
liquid<00:02:30.990> rubber<00:02:31.310> inside<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:36.950> just<00:02:37.950> open<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.310> up

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
liquid rubber inside and just open it up

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.100 
liquid rubber inside and just open it up
and<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.530> dip<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.040> wire<00:02:41.250> back<00:02:41.940> inside<00:02:42.480> the

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
and you can dip the wire back inside the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.759 
and you can dip the wire back inside the
plastic<00:02:43.890> dip<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.550> it's<00:02:45.060> already<00:02:45.300> bent<00:02:45.769> which

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
plastic dip if it's already bent which

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.220 
plastic dip if it's already bent which
should<00:02:47.130> be<00:02:47.280> obviously<00:02:47.959> then<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.080> would

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
should be obviously then you would

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.780 
should be obviously then you would
probably<00:02:49.830> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.519> that<00:02:50.550> and

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
probably want to do it like that and

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.570 
probably want to do it like that and
hold<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.590> hold<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.769> claw<00:02:52.980> like<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:55.550> dip<00:02:56.550> it

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
