00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
a lot of fun it's important because

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.170 
a lot of fun it's important because
synergy<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.530> tool<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.340> everyone<00:04:06.670> in<00:04:07.090> the

they break players tape down by the

individual skills offensively and
defensively<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.220> probably<00:04:18.789> at<00:04:19.539> draft<00:04:20.019> time

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289

the<00:04:20.650> most<00:04:20.799> important<00:04:21.340> tool<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.549> we<00:04:21.789> have<00:04:21.820> we

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
the most important tool that we have we

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.240 
the most important tool that we have we
scout<00:04:22.960> players<00:04:23.289> we<00:04:23.590> go<00:04:23.770> out<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:23.979> see<00:04:24.130> them

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
scout players we go out and see them

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.050 
scout players we go out and see them
individually<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.680> we<00:04:26.680> support<00:04:27.280> ourselves<00:04:27.820> by

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.540 

I<00:04:32.990> think<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.139> it's<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.500> very<00:04:34.710> good<00:04:34.919> option<00:04:35.160> in

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
I think it's it's a very good option in

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.939 
I think it's it's a very good option in
that<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.910> eliminates<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:37.260> mystery<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.800> this

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:37.949 
that it eliminates the mystery of this

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.070 
that it eliminates the mystery of this
stuff<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.460> think<00:04:39.030> most<00:04:39.210> people<00:04:39.419> look<00:04:39.750> from<00:04:39.960> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
stuff I think most people look from the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.409 
stuff I think most people look from the
outside<00:04:40.110> in<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.070> maybe<00:04:41.850> say<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.210> themselves

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
outside in and maybe say to themselves

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.689 
outside in and maybe say to themselves
you<00:04:42.810> know<00:04:42.990> how<00:04:43.169> does<00:04:43.350> this<00:04:43.440> work<00:04:43.740> and<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:44.639> is

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
you know how does this work and this is

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.400 
you know how does this work and this is
something<00:04:45.120> I'd<00:04:45.210> always<00:04:45.240> wanted<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:45.900> do<00:04:46.080> and

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
something I'd always wanted to do and

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.730 
something I'd always wanted to do and
yet<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.070> don't<00:04:47.550> have<00:04:47.669> any<00:04:47.910> contact<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.960> know<00:04:49.410> to

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
yet I don't have any contact you know to

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.070 
yet I don't have any contact you know to
get<00:04:49.919> me<00:04:50.070> there<00:04:50.250> so<00:04:50.669> it's<00:04:51.300> not<00:04:51.510> some<00:04:51.720> kind<00:04:51.990> of

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
get me there so it's not some kind of

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.710 
get me there so it's not some kind of
secret<00:04:52.530> society<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:54.000> they<00:04:54.389> cannot

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
secret society that they cannot

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.200 
secret society that they cannot
penetrate<00:04:55.280> so<00:04:56.280> I<00:04:56.310> think<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.790> I<00:04:56.820> think<00:04:56.910> that's

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
penetrate so I think that I think that's

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.260 
penetrate so I think that I think that's
a<00:04:57.300> positive<00:04:57.510> for<00:04:57.810> for<00:04:58.680> anybody<00:04:59.070> there<00:04:59.760> isn't<00:05:00.120> a

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
a positive for for anybody there isn't a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.360 
a positive for for anybody there isn't a
lot<00:05:00.479> out<00:05:00.720> there<00:05:00.960> like<00:05:01.260> this<00:05:01.500> you<00:05:01.830> know<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:01.949> place

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
lot out there like this you know a place

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.860 
lot out there like this you know a place
where<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.699> can<00:05:02.880> go<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.060> learn<00:05:03.330> something<00:05:03.630> like

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
where you can go to learn something like

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.430 
where you can go to learn something like
this<00:05:05.090> whether<00:05:06.090> it's<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.479> synergy<00:05:06.900> course<00:05:07.169> for

know on a broader focus we're talking
solely<00:05:13.800> about<00:05:13.919> basketball<00:05:14.550> but<00:05:14.669> let's<00:05:15.539> face

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
solely about basketball but let's face

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.600 
solely about basketball but let's face
it<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.990> can<00:05:16.139> go<00:05:16.289> into<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.650> cricket<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.220> rugby

it you can go into the cricket the rugby

it you can go into the cricket the rugby
the<00:05:17.639> soccer<00:05:18.090> whatever<00:05:18.690> there's<00:05:19.050> all<00:05:19.289> the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
the soccer whatever there's all the

the soccer whatever there's all the
courses<00:05:19.710> they<00:05:19.889> offer<00:05:19.919> hockey<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.960> then<00:05:22.470> if

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
courses they offer hockey and then if

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.810 
courses they offer hockey and then if
you<00:05:22.710> wanted<00:05:22.979> to<00:05:23.039> be<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.310> agent<00:05:23.669> player

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
you wanted to be the agent player

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.430 
you wanted to be the agent player
representation<00:05:24.570> angle<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:24.990> it<00:05:25.110> you<00:05:25.199> could<00:05:25.320> do

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
representation angle of it you could do

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.230 
representation angle of it you could do
that<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.830> broadcasting<00:05:26.729> I<00:05:26.820> mean<00:05:26.940> there's<00:05:27.060> so

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
that the broadcasting I mean there's so

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.900 
that the broadcasting I mean there's so
many<00:05:27.330> angles<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.710> they<00:05:28.889> really<00:05:29.160> have<00:05:29.340> all

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
many angles and and they really have all

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.790 
many angles and and they really have all
those<00:05:30.120> pieces<00:05:30.330> covered<00:05:30.780> in<00:05:30.930> so<00:05:31.169> it's<00:05:31.470> really<00:05:31.680> a

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
those pieces covered in so it's really a

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.010 
those pieces covered in so it's really a
great<00:05:32.039> program<00:05:32.250> well<00:05:33.210> first<00:05:33.419> of<00:05:33.570> all<00:05:33.720> it's

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
great program well first of all it's

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.620 
great program well first of all it's
very<00:05:34.110> broad-based<00:05:34.560> I<00:05:35.190> mean<00:05:35.789> there's<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.389> lot<00:05:36.510> of

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
very broad-based I mean there's a lot of

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.230 
very broad-based I mean there's a lot of
sports<00:05:36.840> management<00:05:37.520> degree<00:05:38.520> programs<00:05:39.060> and

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
sports management degree programs and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.540 
sports management degree programs and
universities<00:05:39.900> but<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.650> don't<00:05:41.010> think<00:05:41.220> there<00:05:41.520> is

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
universities but I don't think there is

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.770 
universities but I don't think there is
nearly<00:05:42.000> it's<00:05:42.930> broad-based<00:05:43.560> or<00:05:43.889> as<00:05:44.190> specific

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
nearly it's broad-based or as specific

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.930 
nearly it's broad-based or as specific
as<00:05:45.780> sports<00:05:46.200> management<00:05:46.560> worldwide<00:05:47.190> gets<00:05:47.520> it

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
as sports management worldwide gets it

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.089 
as sports management worldwide gets it
covers<00:05:48.300> all<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.510> sports<00:05:48.870> it<00:05:49.139> covers<00:05:49.740> radio

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
covers all the sports it covers radio

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.040 
covers all the sports it covers radio
television<00:05:50.760> that<00:05:51.210> covers<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.660> agent

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
television that covers the agent

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.170 
television that covers the agent
business<00:05:52.200> in<00:05:52.590> all<00:05:53.370> of<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.580> sports<00:05:53.820> so<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.060> think

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
business in all of the sports so I think
