00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 And, um, I'm going to make a video, beauty. 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.070
 now about springfield is a 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:16.920
 legal application is already quite your time 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:19.980
 But it 's cool he 's getting into it, right? 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.050
 takes a little bit because he has to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.119
 to download what he is 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.740
 carrying what he already has 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 I already have a nice little town. 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.289
 put there about 70 thousand 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.289
 per day 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 type guys here is my city 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 these little white houses here is as follows 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.219
 to increase here starting with the city 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.860
 here and now it 's so cute, but 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.120
 Before I did I filled up the little houses. 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.500
 release they will release you the first 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.430
 This little house here is a rosinha 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.700
 then he had released this little pink house 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.500
 and then blue and then white and so on. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.640
 each one gives a little more than 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:23.520
 money and for example from here I'll get 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.530
 She has to give me five minutes. 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.220
 Okay to give me six dollars 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:36.509
 This for you to understand a little 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:38.930
 beauty, that rose picks up one here 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.930
 you will see 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.220
 so she gives me three minutes she gives me 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.930
 $ 75 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.910
 You see that other rose that I also 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:07.520
 I think it's a little roomy after 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:10.670
 You'll understand why she gives me six 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.720
 hours 120 dollars in case 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.460
 after her comes this blue here I do not 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.560
 I've got nothing to catch, there's still one. 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.740
 hour and forty-three thousand 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.260
 How much trouble she has, but I think. 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.620
 18 hours only something like 150 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.050
 dollars right 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.470
 and those whites that at the moment are the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.160
 my most top right 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 I'll show you here 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.610
 there it is already 12 hours in 1,200 dollars 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.430
 so what do you do before any 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.290
 The thing that the game is asking you is for 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.180
 You buy it, buy it here. 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.060
 the game will be everything they will 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.820
 carry on 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.630
 and then you're getting the hang of it, 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.440
 first give the home of the simpsons that 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.910
 here is a good serve was a caring 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.019
 I came back to work because I 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:18.950
 I also explained his house a little until 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:25.820
 3 dollars in 60 seconds 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:27.680
 according to they release the little houses all 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.570
 the ones you already know at springfield 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.239
 even though it's cute here but when 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.860
 I took her she was first part 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.510
 have to think what to make money 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.269
 Then you leave your city. 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:48.250
 cool little urban 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:48.250
 the factory is not invented right? 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 well they have the castles now too 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.270
 It's what they did now you can 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.410
 battling with other people here I 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.080
 I will defend myself 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.120
 and came into my city attacked me and I 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.370
 I get a little hole to attack too. 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.960
 huh 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:15.240
 is that not all at level 13 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.640
 they give me this thesis this little hand here 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.040
 I'm trying to evolve every time 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.080
 The more I win, the more I can evolve. 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.620
 faster than even here is a business 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:32.490
 Here to improve homer, beauty. 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:37.050
 then at level 1616 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:40.680
 is the castle is on level 3 is the market 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.540
 16 is that I have the margin is also 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.430
 cool here I can take revenge myself 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.590
 I can enter the other city after I 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.730
 I show you they also have the 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.070
 running 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:58.650
 for example here I have a bet 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:01.710
 To do it is already two of 13 and 12 in the 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.260
 in case you have a chance in two then 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.470
 It's easier for you to win, huh? 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.070
 only six thousand and so on 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.190
 there are several values you have a chance 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.630
 99 but if you win you win 200 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.630
 a thousand is also a cool 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.510
 that's it, I'll go back 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.290
 according to the clear or I can not forget 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.419
 here is the part here of the beach you 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.810
 platform wins first you win the 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.669
 central platform here 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.190
 Then you start to get square. 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.610
 quadradinho also saves you also 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:49.320
 you pay and you have to 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.760
 waiting to be released and every time 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.140
 getting more expensive 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.140
 mine for now just so with me 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.919

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:06.380
