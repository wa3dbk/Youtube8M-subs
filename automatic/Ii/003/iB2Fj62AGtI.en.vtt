00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.519
 That's it, I'm here today, and today I came. 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.000
 bring you something very interesting 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.910
 google released the lounge its official 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.850
 for everyone there and the smell was coming to 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.670
 Truth comes in the nexus line and now you 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.910
 you can use on your mobile of course by 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.289
 leave download link in description 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.590
 but before you bag 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 this lounge is right here, google is not 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.090
 there a shot 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.739
 the official report of google has passed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.710
 a little bit here 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.190
 so that's a pretty simple batch 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.530
 here are some newspapers that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.020
 you can put it yourself 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.030
 can then customize for example if 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 You put this in a place I put it. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.129
 and normal beauty , the window beat black 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.250
 in case here on my android is the chicken 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.240
 black here is white 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:09.840
 here I come to the menu with all my 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:12.150
 very simple applications with the background 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 transparent very nice 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.509
 let me come back and hear it from the side 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.549
 Left, he comes here. He looks. He's not there. 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 that you can customize your cards 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.770
 so this is a very simple reason not 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.310
 There are a lot of things here. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.159
 google searching for rosa and search for 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.729
 text you choose if you hold the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.299
 attack has the windows being 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.619
 used here below has 11 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.740
 options as background and 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.360
 so you will see who can have background 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.720
 some background fund plans 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.350
 that comes with it to access both the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.630
 funds that come with this report 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.270
 So that's how I said I'll leave the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.579
 The lounge's download link is on the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.550
 description I stand here 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.550
 A big hug and until the next
