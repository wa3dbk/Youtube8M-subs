00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
one bucket time for box is the range of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.350 
one bucket time for box is the range of

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
an enchanted one of equal trade so this

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.219 
an enchanted one of equal trade so this
is<00:01:39.390> potential<00:01:40.939> 110c<00:01:42.710> increases<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:45.020> power<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
is potential 110c increases the power of

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.160 
is potential 110c increases the power of
the<00:01:46.500> one<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.450> one<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.780> will<00:01:48.960> increase

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the one so on this one it will increase

00:01:49.170 --> 00:02:03.320 
the one so on this one it will increase
the<00:01:49.409> range<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:59.690> potential<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:01.250> has<00:02:02.250> five<00:02:02.610> or

books<00:03:24.450> here<00:03:24.720> are<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:27.450> when<00:03:27.629> i<00:03:27.659> change<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.109> box

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
books here are so when i change the box

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:38.000 
books here are so when i change the box
here<00:03:31.220> it<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.489> range<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.500> this<00:03:34.819> or<00:03:35.819> just<00:03:37.010> with

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:52.159 
here it is a range of this or just with
this<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.819> that's<00:03:48.180> how<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.930> one<00:03:49.409> works<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:51.169> now

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
this so that's how the one works and now

many<00:04:13.079> you<00:04:13.440> usually<00:04:13.680> get<00:04:14.010> what<00:04:15.709> you<00:04:16.709> get<00:04:16.859> more

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
many you usually get what you get more

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.030 
many you usually get what you get more

lost lee i'm going to show you are I
think<00:04:24.150> it's<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.420> bug<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:27.560> works<00:04:28.560> with

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
think it's a bug that works with

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.030 
think it's a bug that works with
saplings<00:04:29.780> cactus

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
saplings cactus

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.760 
saplings cactus
and<00:04:32.780> torturous<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:33.990> something<00:04:34.440> else<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:34.710> i

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
and torturous and something else but i

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:47.660 
and torturous and something else but i
recommend<00:04:35.130> saplings

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.920 

firstly<00:04:48.600> we<00:04:48.750> need<00:04:48.930> to<00:04:49.200> put<00:04:49.560> down<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.770> sapling

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.530 

like<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.170> and<00:04:55.440> probably<00:04:56.370> give<00:04:56.700> you<00:04:56.730> some

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
like this and probably give you some

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.220 
like this and probably give you some
more<00:04:57.720> stacks<00:04:58.200> of<00:04:58.350> saplings

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.890 

and<00:05:04.530> we<00:05:04.980> can<00:05:05.160> count<00:05:05.610> it<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.420> it<00:05:06.480> will<00:05:06.720> have<00:05:06.840> a

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
and we can count it so it will have a

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.220 
and we can count it so it will have a
bigger<00:05:07.620> area<00:05:07.770> effect<00:05:11.630> shorten<00:05:12.630> one<00:05:12.750> turns<00:05:13.050> 22

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
bigger area effect shorten one turns 22

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.910 
bigger area effect shorten one turns 22
and<00:05:13.440> treasure<00:05:13.620> too<00:05:13.890> that's<00:05:14.430> a<00:05:14.520> good<00:05:14.640> one<00:05:15.920> and

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
and treasure too that's a good one and

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.550 
and treasure too that's a good one and
now<00:05:17.100> let's<00:05:17.490> show<00:05:17.700> you<00:05:20.810> as<00:05:21.810> you<00:05:22.050> see<00:05:22.260> it's

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
now let's show you as you see it's

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.100 
now let's show you as you see it's
places<00:05:22.950> down<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.730> saplings<00:05:24.210> but<00:05:24.960> the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
places down the saplings but the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:32.930 
places down the saplings but the
saplings<00:05:25.590> count<00:05:26.180> beyond<00:05:28.460> stone<00:05:29.460> or<00:05:31.940> Samsung

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
saplings count beyond stone or Samsung

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.970 
saplings count beyond stone or Samsung
in<00:05:33.120> this<00:05:33.240> case<00:05:33.420> when<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.260> saplings<00:05:34.590> will<00:05:34.740> drop

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
in this case when the saplings will drop

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.810 
in this case when the saplings will drop
down<00:05:35.010> on<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.550> ground<00:05:35.850> again<00:05:37.040> so<00:05:38.040> it's<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.250> super

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
down on the ground again so it's a super

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.120 
down on the ground again so it's a super
fast<00:05:39.060> mining<00:05:39.660> tool<00:05:42.020> it<00:05:43.020> will<00:05:43.380> take<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.890> lot<00:05:44.070> of

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
fast mining tool it will take a lot of

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:52.280 
fast mining tool it will take a lot of
durability<00:05:44.550> on<00:05:45.210> your<00:05:45.780> wand<00:05:50.750> but<00:05:51.750> when<00:05:52.200> you

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
durability on your wand but when you

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.320 
durability on your wand but when you
have<00:05:52.320> played<00:05:52.680> from<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.730> have<00:05:54.090> a<00:05:54.120> lot<00:05:54.270> of

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
have played from it and have a lot of

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.280 
have played from it and have a lot of
resources<00:05:55.730> this<00:05:56.730> method<00:05:56.970> could<00:05:57.240> be<00:05:57.300> used<00:05:57.960> to

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
resources this method could be used to

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.340 
resources this method could be used to
clear<00:05:58.590> out<00:05:58.740> areas<00:05:59.340> or<00:05:59.910> mine<00:06:00.330> quite<00:06:00.720> fast<00:06:02.930> but<00:06:03.930> I

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
clear out areas or mine quite fast but I

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.000 
clear out areas or mine quite fast but I
think<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:04.890> a<00:06:04.980> bug<00:06:05.250> and<00:06:05.670> I<00:06:06.630> think<00:06:07.470> ethanol

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
think it's a bug and I think ethanol

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.870 
think it's a bug and I think ethanol
will<00:06:10.130> do<00:06:11.130> so<00:06:11.310> you<00:06:11.430> can't<00:06:11.640> do<00:06:11.880> it<00:06:12.110> fix<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.200> bug

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 
will do so you can't do it fix a bug

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.330 
will do so you can't do it fix a bug
because<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:15.240> can't<00:06:15.650> do<00:06:16.650> this<00:06:16.770> with<00:06:16.980> sugarcane

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
because you can't do this with sugarcane

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.600 
because you can't do this with sugarcane
and<00:06:17.550> some<00:06:18.030> other<00:06:18.240> materials<00:06:22.160> but<00:06:23.160> if<00:06:23.310> you<00:06:23.430> like

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
and some other materials but if you like

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.080 
and some other materials but if you like
this<00:06:23.790> with<00:06:23.970> you<00:06:24.500> I've<00:06:25.580> hoped<00:06:26.580> you<00:06:26.760> liked<00:06:26.940> the

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
this with you I've hoped you liked the

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.310 
this with you I've hoped you liked the
video<00:06:27.210> and<00:06:28.100> thanks<00:06:29.100> for<00:06:29.160> watching
