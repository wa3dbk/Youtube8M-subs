00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.830
 so hello to all today I'm going 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.650
 show you the following videos for 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.330
 the bogies and gasoline so I 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.950
 pick up my brush with a handkerchief 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.179
 to avoid to study times a 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.740
 little bit the color that could 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.420
 possibly sad and disappointed so I 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.170
 quench my brush directly into the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.890
 sense and I pass with my brush on the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.080
 color i also have cotton swabs 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.260
 like on the other videos to be able to 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:41.489
 better spread the color all over 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:46.289
 we already start with that and then we 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.239
 spread out well be careful sometimes times 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.149
 can we overflow 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.469
 so it's a bit big but it exists 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.180
 also the two little ones fade you I 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.480
 continued i'm showing you with a 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.480
 history 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 no 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:18.830
 so little blur like this one it's 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.830
 a 5 mm so I'll do like that 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.230
 but it's more the same principle that 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.230
 for whole ribs 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.899
 I wanted to go a little bit more 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.890
 quickly because I left sushi and 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:47.200
 in my room it is very hot 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:50.130
 still today 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.130
 sanÃ© it is not 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:02.020
 my costume with the aston it allows 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.590
 to avoid overflowing a report to 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.590
 bankers 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.740
 obviously aged the senses without 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.680
 odors because if I let it go 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.350
 like that open I apply waxed all 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.350
 only the dr ernie really not terrible 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.130
 I made the essence of turpentine 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.630
 once I'm done doing my 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:50.960
 80 drawings will make them to the rule 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.930
 well cut as it takes three and 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.760
 I will make postcards or 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.750
 cards for for christmas things like that 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.930
 because it's not necessarily 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.420
 christmas drawings but it's super cute 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.000
 for children or even to be 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.140
 very big children that when we have the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.020
 family he is not so old 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.070
 no more teens but also they 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.950
 learn it was not the 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.810
 joke obviously you already have 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 it's its size already a little bit 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.030
 pigments and aprilia more than faded 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.440
 it almost gives in effect at trt 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.110
 we can press even more the pencil 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.420
 because here it's a bit clear at 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.650
 middle one can support as much as in more 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.060
 or less as much as you want on my 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.819
 customers as long as it does not matter 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.340
 trace it's finally it's not even 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.099
 really support went more 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.700
 a lot in the same place for subway from 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.700
 wheelbarrow pigment 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.160
 in private several techniques a 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.310
 always I preferred to brush 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.660
 finally it's still a little more 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:44.770
 own with brush than cotton stalk 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.780
 directly on the Thursday the cotton stalk for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.100
 spread once a second time but 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.080
 never throw at a first time 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.080
 first with the brush 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.570
 that's what you want me to 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.730
 so after we finally do as much 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.350
 of colors we want a fair stream 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:39.270
 their attention to that it does not 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:43.430
 more screaming but apart from that there is 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.430
 no rules on colors 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.810
 spent on bottom there is a minimum needed 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.290
 to train but it's also not the 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.290
 dead what 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.270
 to catch on it's like 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.870
 his tee shirt and a little red room so 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.870
 he's a pirate 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:47.360
 we can even make some create in 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.110
 color superimposed colors for in 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.589
 create a 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:54.649
 if you have not there for the hat 

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:59.919
 I had written my color I 

00:06:54.649 --> 00:07:02.919
 superimposed orange with a little red 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:05.719
 a two-wheeled clear game we mean 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.929
 to make a color stack between one and 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.929
 two 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.800
 Then I will show you how 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.950
 how am I going to proceed to create 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:39.050
 melee but carter pushes me away I'll 

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.190
 possibly plasticized but I 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.350
 I'm not sure because it's 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.950
 Grain paper that may make 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:48.610
 air bubbles and so do not make the king 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.610
 very very pretty 

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.130
 here 

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.500
 you can even tried to do when 

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:13.830
 you use only one side of screaming 

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.830
 all sides
