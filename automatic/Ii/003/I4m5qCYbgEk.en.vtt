00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
was obviously going to increase their

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.130 
was obviously going to increase their
prices<00:05:25.010> but<00:05:25.880> being<00:05:26.150> said<00:05:26.480> this<00:05:26.720> was<00:05:26.870> always

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
prices but being said this was always

prices but being said this was always
going<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.800> be<00:05:27.860> an<00:05:28.190> expensive<00:05:28.820> team<00:05:29.180> to<00:05:29.480> build

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
going to be an expensive team to build

going to be an expensive team to build
these<00:05:30.500> players<00:05:30.920> are<00:05:31.040> the<00:05:31.280> Messi's<00:05:31.790> and

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
these players are the Messi's and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.150 
these players are the Messi's and
Ronaldo's<00:05:32.510> of<00:05:32.660> silver<00:05:33.200> cards<00:05:33.530> so<00:05:33.980> it<00:05:34.040> was

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
Ronaldo's of silver cards so it was

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.400 
Ronaldo's of silver cards so it was
never<00:05:34.400> going<00:05:34.640> to<00:05:34.790> be<00:05:35.000> cheap<00:05:35.270> but<00:05:35.570> what

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
never going to be cheap but what

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.080 
never going to be cheap but what
happened<00:05:36.680> was<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.980> created<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.370> bulls<00:05:37.640> between

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
happened was I created a bulls between

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.150 
happened was I created a bulls between
my<00:05:38.240> subscribers<00:05:38.900> order<00:05:39.170> youtubers<00:05:39.770> and<00:05:39.860> their

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
my subscribers order youtubers and their

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.980 
my subscribers order youtubers and their
subscribers<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.850> therefore<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.270> demand<00:05:41.780> for

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
subscribers and therefore a demand for

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.870 
subscribers and therefore a demand for
these<00:05:42.080> players<00:05:42.350> was<00:05:42.680> created<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.310> that's

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
these players was created and that's

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.360 
these players was created and that's
where<00:05:44.060> price<00:05:44.420> fixers<00:05:45.020> messed<00:05:45.800> everything<00:05:45.980> up

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
where price fixers messed everything up

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.670 
where price fixers messed everything up
because<00:05:46.940> there<00:05:47.750> was<00:05:47.900> only<00:05:48.050> a<00:05:48.200> limited<00:05:48.410> number

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
because there was only a limited number

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.500 
because there was only a limited number
of<00:05:48.980> these<00:05:49.160> players<00:05:49.550> on<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.970> market<00:05:50.330> so<00:05:50.420> they

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
of these players on the market so they

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.240 
of these players on the market so they
would<00:05:50.690> buy<00:05:50.900> them<00:05:51.170> put<00:05:51.770> them<00:05:51.920> up<00:05:52.040> for<00:05:52.100> a

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
would buy them put them up for a

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.860 
would buy them put them up for a
ridiculous<00:05:52.760> price<00:05:52.910> and<00:05:53.210> because<00:05:53.390> the<00:05:53.540> demand

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
ridiculous price and because the demand

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.930 
ridiculous price and because the demand
for<00:05:54.080> these<00:05:54.200> players<00:05:54.410> was<00:05:54.620> there<00:05:54.850> people<00:05:55.850> were

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
it was becoming a normal thing for these

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.690 
it was becoming a normal thing for these
players<00:06:26.480> to<00:06:26.630> cause<00:06:26.900> that<00:06:27.110> sort<00:06:27.290> of<00:06:27.320> a<00:06:27.440> price

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
players to cause that sort of a price

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.430 
players to cause that sort of a price
another<00:06:28.700> thing<00:06:28.880> is<00:06:28.910> we<00:06:29.690> as<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.840> community<00:06:30.080> were

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
another thing is we as a community were

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.710 
another thing is we as a community were
not<00:06:30.590> open<00:06:30.740> enough<00:06:31.130> silver<00:06:31.520> packs<00:06:31.880> to<00:06:32.510> get

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
not open enough silver packs to get

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.720 
not open enough silver packs to get
these<00:06:32.930> players<00:06:33.200> so<00:06:33.350> there<00:06:33.470> was<00:06:33.590> very<00:06:34.010> few<00:06:34.280> of

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
these players so there was very few of

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.850 
these players so there was very few of
these<00:06:34.880> players<00:06:35.270> in<00:06:35.570> the<00:06:36.110> market<00:06:36.290> when<00:06:36.740> the

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
these players in the market when the

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.370 
these players in the market when the
demand<00:06:37.040> for<00:06:37.490> these<00:06:37.580> players<00:06:37.820> was<00:06:38.030> created<00:06:38.510> so

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
demand for these players was created so

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.110 
demand for these players was created so
see<00:06:40.530> that's<00:06:40.740> going<00:06:40.920> to<00:06:40.980> add<00:06:41.130> to<00:06:41.460> the<00:06:41.580> price<00:06:41.790> of

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
see that's going to add to the price of

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.480 
see that's going to add to the price of
the<00:06:42.450> players<00:06:42.750> so<00:06:43.650> the<00:06:43.800> whole<00:06:44.010> point<00:06:44.250> of<00:06:44.400> this

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
the players so the whole point of this

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.920 
the players so the whole point of this
