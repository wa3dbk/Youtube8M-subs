at them real quick see this is the side
I<00:04:24.830> still<00:04:25.160> need<00:04:25.340> to<00:04:25.400> finish

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.280 

in<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.750> back<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.350> still<00:04:32.560> need<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.830> finish<00:04:34.290> but

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
in the back I still need to finish but

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.870 
in the back I still need to finish but
once<00:04:35.590> it's<00:04:35.770> done<00:04:35.980> it's<00:04:36.250> supposed<00:04:36.550> to<00:04:36.670> look

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
once it's done it's supposed to look

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.040 
once it's done it's supposed to look
like<00:04:36.940> this<00:04:37.270> side<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.670> then<00:04:39.820> I<00:04:40.360> don't<00:04:40.990> know

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
like this side and then I don't know

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.320 
like this side and then I don't know
what<00:04:41.200> I'm<00:04:41.290> gonna<00:04:41.380> do<00:04:41.560> as<00:04:42.550> far<00:04:42.790> as<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.970> second

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
what I'm gonna do as far as the second

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.510 
what I'm gonna do as far as the second
pattern<00:04:43.660> I'll<00:04:43.780> probably<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.230> do<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.520> sinner's

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
pattern I'll probably just do a sinner's

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.410 
pattern I'll probably just do a sinner's
layer<00:04:45.970> than<00:04:46.270> this<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:48.460> just<00:04:48.760> do<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:48.910> like<00:04:49.030> you

know on the inside the same pattern but

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.830 
know on the inside the same pattern but
like<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.140> real<00:04:53.410> thin<00:04:53.620> layer<00:04:54.450> doctor<00:04:55.450> cranky
