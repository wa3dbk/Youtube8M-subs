00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
got but um and I think it looks better

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
got but um and I think it looks better
like<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.340> least<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
like that at least but this is this is a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.200 
like that at least but this is this is a
fun<00:00:58.410> car<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.059> good

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
fun car it's actually a very good

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.750 
fun car it's actually a very good
handling<00:01:00.840> car<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.680> not<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.920> fastest<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
handling car but it's not the fastest so

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
handling car but it's not the fastest so
a<00:01:02.789> place<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.570> Top<00:01:03.780> Gear<00:01:04.019> it's<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.799> be

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
a place like Top Gear it's not gonna be

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
a place like Top Gear it's not gonna be
one<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> better<00:01:05.640> cars<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:07.320> is

grades<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.610> important<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.240> car<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
grades are important on this car if you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.120 
grades are important on this car if you
get<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.080> his<00:01:16.350> car<00:01:16.560> actually<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
get it because his car actually is a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.490 
get it because his car actually is a
very<00:01:17.369> very<00:01:17.580> solution<00:01:18.090> time

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
very very solution time

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.860 
very very solution time
and<00:01:19.850> really<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.150> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.480> replace<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
and really so you want to replace the

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.310 
and really so you want to replace the
clutch<00:01:22.110> maybe<00:01:22.530> give<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.920> racing<00:01:23.280> gearbox<00:01:23.610> or

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
clutch maybe give it a racing gearbox or

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.500 
clutch maybe give it a racing gearbox or
do<00:01:25.320> any<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.650> those<00:01:25.740> kinds<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.130> things<00:01:26.450> also<00:01:27.450> you

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
do any of those kinds of things also you

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.960 
do any of those kinds of things also you
probably<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.260> up<00:01:28.620> excuse<00:01:29.520> me<00:01:29.550> you<00:01:29.790> also

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
probably want to up excuse me you also

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.490 
probably want to up excuse me you also
probably<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.510> replace<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> camshafts

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
probably want to replace the camshafts

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
probably want to replace the camshafts
so<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> shift<00:01:33.300> as<00:01:33.480> much

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so that you don't have to shift as much

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
so that you don't have to shift as much
you're<00:01:34.170> gonna<00:01:34.290> rev<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> engine<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.460> for

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
you're gonna rev the engine out for

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
you're gonna rev the engine out for
longer<00:01:36.030> which<00:01:36.480> is<00:01:36.630> nice<00:01:36.870> but<00:01:37.560> all<00:01:38.010> of<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.400> was

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
longer which is nice but all of this was

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.330 
longer which is nice but all of this was
able<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.940> allow<00:01:39.150> via<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.900> 370z<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.800> get<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> time

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
able to allow via the 370z to get a time

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.610 
able to allow via the 370z to get a time
of<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.730> minute<00:01:41.760> twenty<00:01:42.270> two<00:01:42.420> point<00:01:42.780> nine<00:01:43.410> one

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
of one minute twenty two point nine one

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.220 
of one minute twenty two point nine one
eight<00:01:43.650> but<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.970> comparison<00:01:45.360> car<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.990> what<00:01:46.200> I

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
eight but the comparison car is what I

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.360 
eight but the comparison car is what I
personally<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> much

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
personally think is a much

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.130 
personally think is a much
better-looking<00:01:47.760> version<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
better-looking version and it's the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
better-looking version and it's the
older<00:01:49.820> 350z<00:01:50.820> fairly<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:52.730> this<00:01:53.730> car<00:01:54.000> pretty

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
older 350z fairly and this car pretty

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.810 
older 350z fairly and this car pretty
much<00:01:54.750> has<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> same<00:01:55.350> profile<00:01:55.860> pretty<00:01:56.670> much

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
much has the same profile pretty much

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.630 
much has the same profile pretty much
looks<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.360> same<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.530> difference<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:59.010> less

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
looks the same the difference is less

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
looks the same the difference is less
spikes<00:02:00.000> much<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.260> think<00:02:01.620> it's<00:02:01.740> much

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
spikes much I just think it's much

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
spikes much I just think it's much
simpler<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.610> much<00:02:02.700> cooler<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.870> think<00:02:04.140> they

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
simpler and much cooler and I think they

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.630 
simpler and much cooler and I think they
went<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.680> over<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.340> top<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> 370z<00:02:06.420> and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
went to over the top of the 370z and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.830 
went to over the top of the 370z and
especially<00:02:08.640> if<00:02:08.820> you've<00:02:08.940> ever<00:02:09.090> seen<00:02:09.360> newer

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
especially if you've ever seen newer

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.450 
especially if you've ever seen newer
models<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.619> car<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> aren't<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
models of this car that aren't the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.240 
models of this car that aren't the
original<00:02:11.880> one<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.930> HID<00:02:13.710> lights<00:02:14.100> of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
original one that have the HID lights of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.790 
original one that have the HID lights of
the<00:02:14.310> front<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> very

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
the front it's just it's just a very

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.260 
the front it's just it's just a very
good<00:02:16.890> looking<00:02:17.220> car<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.490> it's<00:02:17.790> still<00:02:18.000> got<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
good looking car and it's still got the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.450 
good looking car and it's still got the
wheel<00:02:18.450> arches<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.050> it's<00:02:19.560> still<00:02:19.770> got<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
wheel arches and it's still got the the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.340 
wheel arches and it's still got the the
interesting<00:02:20.700> profile<00:02:21.360> but<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.230> think

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
interesting profile but I just think

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.900 
interesting profile but I just think
it's<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.620> much<00:02:22.770> simpler<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.489> cooler<00:02:23.700> version

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it's a much simpler and cooler version

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.210 
it's a much simpler and cooler version
especially<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.900> those<00:02:25.560> reflective

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
especially with the those reflective

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.710 
especially with the those reflective
little<00:02:26.459> lines<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.000> kind<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.209> look<00:02:27.360> like<00:02:27.390> air

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
little lines that kind of look like air

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.390 
little lines that kind of look like air
vents<00:02:28.050> on<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.200> side<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.860> big<00:02:29.040> grille<00:02:29.280> in

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
vents on the side of the big grille in

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.180 
vents on the side of the big grille in
the<00:02:29.430> front<00:02:29.630> but<00:02:30.630> um

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the front but um

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.530 
the front but um
oh<00:02:32.250> well<00:02:32.820> I<00:02:32.850> cut<00:02:33.210> that<00:02:33.360> corner<00:02:33.630> bit<00:02:34.700> anyway

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
oh well I cut that corner bit anyway

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.440 
oh well I cut that corner bit anyway
this<00:02:36.810> car<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:38.250> also<00:02:38.460> pretty<00:02:38.730> good<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.030> think

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
this car it's also pretty good I think

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.270 
this car it's also pretty good I think
at<00:02:39.810> least<00:02:39.990> from<00:02:40.170> what<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.350> found<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.860> shifts<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
at least from what I found it shifts a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.950 
at least from what I found it shifts a
little<00:02:41.700> bit<00:02:41.820> quicker<00:02:42.030> just<00:02:42.210> from<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> updates

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
little bit quicker just from the updates

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.980 
little bit quicker just from the updates
they<00:02:43.110> have<00:02:43.230> very<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:43.770> similar<00:02:44.100> upgrades

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
they have very very similar upgrades

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.180 
they have very very similar upgrades
obviously<00:02:45.990> this<00:02:46.110> one<00:02:46.260> has<00:02:46.410> more<00:02:46.650> because<00:02:47.010> it's

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
obviously this one has more because it's

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.820 
obviously this one has more because it's
a<00:02:47.370> worst<00:02:47.580> car<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.880> start<00:02:48.330> but<00:02:49.170> there's<00:02:49.680> not

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
a worst car to start but there's not

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.000 
a worst car to start but there's not
much<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.010> can<00:02:50.130> really<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.990> it<00:02:52.860> is

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
much you can really do there and it is

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.390 
much you can really do there and it is
fast<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.640> find<00:02:53.880> it<00:02:54.000> more<00:02:54.150> controllable<00:02:54.600> but

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
fast and I find it more controllable but

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.520 
fast and I find it more controllable but
unfortunately<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.640> not<00:02:56.970> as<00:02:57.210> fast<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.320> 30

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
unfortunately it's not as fast as the 30

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.380 
unfortunately it's not as fast as the 30
70<00:02:59.040> even<00:02:59.550> though<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> think<00:02:59.880> it's<00:03:00.180> much<00:03:00.360> more

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
70 even though I think it's much more

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.940 
70 even though I think it's much more
fun<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.720> drive<00:03:00.990> how<00:03:01.140> much<00:03:01.260> cool-looking<00:03:01.800> but

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
fun to drive how much cool-looking but

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.630 
fun to drive how much cool-looking but
the<00:03:02.040> 370<00:03:02.520> got<00:03:02.640> the<00:03:02.730> 122<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:04.170> car<00:03:04.470> was<00:03:05.100> able<00:03:05.430> to

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
the 370 got the 122 this car was able to

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.880 
the 370 got the 122 this car was able to
run<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:06.030> 120<00:03:06.720> 3.49

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
run a 120 3.49

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.310 
run a 120 3.49
it's<00:03:08.100> almost<00:03:08.340> exactly<00:03:08.490> a<00:03:09.450> half<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.990> second

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
it's almost exactly a half a second

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.500 
it's almost exactly a half a second
slower<00:03:10.730> which<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.850> annoying<00:03:12.210> because<00:03:12.330> I<00:03:12.450> think

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
slower which is annoying because I think

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.780 
slower which is annoying because I think
it's<00:03:12.750> better<00:03:12.960> looking<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.980> easier<00:03:14.640> on

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it's better looking and just easier on

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.340 
it's better looking and just easier on
the<00:03:14.910> eyes<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.420> general<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.020> sounds<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.320> very

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
the eyes in general it sounds a very

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.860 
the eyes in general it sounds a very
very<00:03:16.830> stunning<00:03:17.100> in<00:03:17.280> person<00:03:17.610> but<00:03:17.790> anyway<00:03:18.450> if

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
very stunning in person but anyway if
