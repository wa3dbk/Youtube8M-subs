00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
to hear my thoughts on what I think

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.710 
to hear my thoughts on what I think
we'll<00:00:33.680> see<00:00:33.830> him<00:00:33.920> well<00:00:34.300> obviously<00:00:35.300> I<00:00:35.540> don't

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
we'll see him well obviously I don't

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.850 
we'll see him well obviously I don't
think<00:00:35.960> we're<00:00:36.050> going<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.230> see<00:00:36.290> him<00:00:36.500> before<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
think we're going to see him before the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.640 
think we're going to see him before the
mid-season<00:00:37.250> finale<00:00:37.960> so<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.050> won't<00:00:39.260> be<00:00:39.410> anytime

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
mid-season finale so it won't be anytime

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.460 
mid-season finale so it won't be anytime
soon<00:00:39.940> probably<00:00:40.940> but<00:00:41.570> I'm<00:00:41.750> thinking<00:00:42.260> he'll

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
soon probably but I'm thinking he'll

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.049 
soon probably but I'm thinking he'll
probably<00:00:42.769> appear<00:00:43.809> may<00:00:44.809> be<00:00:44.870> near<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.730> tail<00:00:46.730> and

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
probably appear may be near the tail and

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.549 
probably appear may be near the tail and
sort<00:00:47.360> of<00:00:47.390> like<00:00:47.540> what<00:00:47.690> they<00:00:47.780> did<00:00:47.840> with<00:00:47.960> season

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
sort of like what they did with season

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.560 
sort of like what they did with season
three<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:49.190> know<00:00:49.309> where<00:00:49.610> he<00:00:49.850> was<00:00:50.059> unclear

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
three you know where he was unclear

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.930 
three you know where he was unclear
probably<00:00:51.170> some<00:00:51.769> something<00:00:52.339> around<00:00:52.610> there

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
probably some something around there

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.329 
probably some something around there
somewhere<00:00:53.600> around<00:00:53.870> there<00:00:54.229> as<00:00:54.320> well<00:00:54.589> to<00:00:54.949> maybe

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
somewhere around there as well to maybe

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.850 
somewhere around there as well to maybe
around<00:00:55.640> episode<00:00:56.019> tad<00:00:57.019> eleven<00:00:57.589> twelve

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
around episode tad eleven twelve

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.880 
around episode tad eleven twelve
thirteen<00:00:58.360> somewhere<00:00:59.360> around<00:00:59.510> there<00:01:00.320> because

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
thirteen somewhere around there because

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.439 
thirteen somewhere around there because
what<00:01:01.040> I'm<00:01:01.129> thinking<00:01:01.549> is<00:01:01.640> going<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.059> happen

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
what I'm thinking is going to happen

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.240 
what I'm thinking is going to happen
just<00:01:02.600> doing<00:01:03.019> predictions<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.860> I<00:01:03.890> think

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
just doing predictions is that I think

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.710 
just doing predictions is that I think
the<00:01:04.699> governor<00:01:05.030> is<00:01:05.059> going<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.299> attack<00:01:05.510> the

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
the governor is going to attack the

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.570 
the governor is going to attack the
prison<00:01:06.080> Rick<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:07.070> group<00:01:07.250> we're<00:01:07.369> going<00:01:07.490> to

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
prison Rick and the group we're going to

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.280 
prison Rick and the group we're going to
have<00:01:07.700> to<00:01:07.970> run<00:01:08.930> after<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:10.930> you<00:01:11.930> know<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.140> show

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
have to run after that you know the show

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.080 
have to run after that you know the show
will<00:01:12.560> return<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.610> everything<00:01:13.909> like<00:01:14.030> that

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
will return and everything like that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.940 
will return and everything like that
will<00:01:14.390> get<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.540> couple<00:01:14.869> episodes<00:01:15.320> he'll

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
will get a couple episodes he'll

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.039 
will get a couple episodes he'll
probably<00:01:16.220> run<00:01:16.790> into<00:01:17.030> or<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.540> group<00:01:17.720> we<00:01:17.869> run

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
probably run into or the group we run

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.340 
probably run into or the group we run
into<00:01:18.200> Abraham<00:01:18.799> Eugene<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.610> Rosita<00:01:20.600> will

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
into Abraham Eugene and Rosita will

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.320 
into Abraham Eugene and Rosita will
probably<00:01:21.770> get<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.980> few<00:01:22.160> episodes<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.820> know<00:01:23.000> them

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
probably get a few episodes to know them

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.240 
probably get a few episodes to know them
and<00:01:23.660> then<00:01:23.810> when<00:01:23.960> they<00:01:23.990> hit<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.320> road<00:01:24.710> I'm

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
and then when they hit the road I'm

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.060 
and then when they hit the road I'm
thinking<00:01:25.730> they<00:01:26.120> may<00:01:26.390> run<00:01:26.840> into<00:01:26.900> Morgan<00:01:27.890> or

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
thinking they may run into Morgan or

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.900 
thinking they may run into Morgan or
they<00:01:28.160> may<00:01:28.340> stop<00:01:28.670> in<00:01:29.320> Kings<00:01:30.320> County<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:31.340> see<00:01:31.730> him

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
they may stop in Kings County to see him

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.940 
they may stop in Kings County to see him
again<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.870> at<00:01:32.990> least<00:01:33.110> that's<00:01:33.410> what<00:01:33.800> i'm

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
again so at least that's what i'm

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.470 
again so at least that's what i'm
thinking<00:01:34.460> is<00:01:34.580> going<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:34.850> happen<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:35.330> that

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
thinking is going to happen so that

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.110 
thinking is going to happen so that
would<00:01:35.630> probably<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:36.020> around<00:01:36.380> episodes<00:01:37.130> 12<00:01:37.550> 13

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
would probably be around episodes 12 13

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.390 
would probably be around episodes 12 13
14<00:01:38.330> something<00:01:38.900> like<00:01:39.050> that<00:01:39.290> now<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.890> actor

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
14 something like that now the actor

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.460 
14 something like that now the actor
Lennie<00:01:40.640> James<00:01:40.730> he<00:01:41.300> isn't<00:01:41.840> that<00:01:41.990> new<00:01:42.170> show<00:01:42.440> on

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
Lennie James he isn't that new show on

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.750 
Lennie James he isn't that new show on
AMC<00:01:42.860> low<00:01:43.730> winter<00:01:43.940> Sun<00:01:44.980> but<00:01:45.980> I<00:01:46.010> don't<00:01:46.400> know<00:01:46.580> how

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
AMC low winter Sun but I don't know how

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.790 
AMC low winter Sun but I don't know how
that<00:01:46.790> show<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.420> doing<00:01:47.750> right<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:48.320> I'm<00:01:48.560> really

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
that show is doing right now I'm really

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.399 
that show is doing right now I'm really
I<00:01:49.100> checked<00:01:49.670> out<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.880> premiere<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.080> I<00:01:51.200> did<00:01:51.380> a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
I checked out the premiere and I did a

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.190 
I checked out the premiere and I did a
review<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.190> and<00:01:52.490> I<00:01:53.240> don't<00:01:53.750> think<00:01:53.870> it's<00:01:54.050> a

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
review of it and I don't think it's a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.430 
review of it and I don't think it's a
bad<00:01:54.470> show<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.780> don't<00:01:56.960> think<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.290> has

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
bad show but it I don't think it has

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.180 
bad show but it I don't think it has
really<00:01:57.830> enough<00:01:58.430> there<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.960> really<00:02:00.800> grab

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
really enough there to really grab

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.310 
really enough there to really grab
people's<00:02:01.670> attention<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.270> make<00:02:02.450> them<00:02:02.659> want<00:02:03.050> to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
and that kind of stuff they thought it

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.479 
and that kind of stuff they thought it
was<00:02:11.510> good<00:02:11.780> but<00:02:11.989> they<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.800> some<00:02:12.920> reason<00:02:12.980> you

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
was good but they for some reason you

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.250 
was good but they for some reason you

know like it's well done but for some

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.589 
know like it's well done but for some
reason<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.680> just<00:02:15.709> doesn't<00:02:16.280> peak<00:02:17.090> people's

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
reason it just doesn't peak people's

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.270 
reason it just doesn't peak people's
interest<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.200> make<00:02:18.349> them<00:02:18.500> want<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.190> know

return and watch it again which was the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.270 
return and watch it again which was the
case<00:02:21.049> with<00:02:21.230> me<00:02:21.379> i<00:02:21.409> could<00:02:21.739> tell<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:21.950> know<00:02:22.129> it's

some<00:02:25.870> reason<00:02:26.200> didn't<00:02:26.560> have<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.890> much

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
some reason didn't have that much

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.730 
some reason didn't have that much
interest<00:02:27.490> in<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.090> he<00:02:28.300> was<00:02:28.930> working<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.530> that

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
I only saw the first episode and then

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.460 
I only saw the first episode and then
after<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.570> just<00:03:34.720> couldn't<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:35.410> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
after that I just couldn't get the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.740 
after that I just couldn't get the
gumption<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:35.950> go<00:03:36.220> back<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.790> know<00:03:36.940> check

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
gumption to go back and you know check

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.360 
gumption to go back and you know check
out<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.110> episodes<00:03:38.500> afterwards<00:03:39.070> lots<00:03:39.220> of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
out the episodes afterwards lots of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:40.920 
out the episodes afterwards lots of
shows<00:03:39.519> on<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.360> know<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.510> was<00:03:40.600> just<00:03:40.690> one<00:03:40.900> of

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
shows on so you know it was just one of

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.960 
shows on so you know it was just one of
those<00:03:41.110> types<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.530> things<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> hopefully

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
those types of things so hopefully

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.340 
those types of things so hopefully
they'll<00:03:43.150> make<00:03:43.360> him<00:03:43.510> switch<00:03:43.780> over<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.200> though<00:03:44.320> I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
they'll make him switch over in though I

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.660 
they'll make him switch over in though I
should<00:03:44.470> bring<00:03:44.769> him<00:03:44.860> in<00:03:45.010> as<00:03:45.130> a<00:03:45.160> full-on

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670

the other show they probably won't

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.860 
the other show they probably won't

with the television series as well I

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.580 
with the television series as well I
don't<00:04:51.330> think<00:04:51.630> it'll<00:04:51.750> be<00:04:51.870> this<00:04:51.990> season<00:04:52.320> I<00:04:52.410> think

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
don't think it'll be this season I think

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.260 
don't think it'll be this season I think
we'll<00:04:52.710> see<00:04:52.889> him<00:04:52.949> for<00:04:53.160> an<00:04:53.220> episode<00:04:53.490> or<00:04:53.669> two<00:04:53.820> and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
we'll see him for an episode or two and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.730 
we'll see him for an episode or two and
then<00:04:54.690> it'll<00:04:54.840> be<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.080> same<00:04:55.260> kind<00:04:55.500> of<00:04:55.560> thing

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
then it'll be the same kind of thing

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.290 
then it'll be the same kind of thing
I'll<00:04:55.889> leave<00:04:56.070> again<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.610> then<00:04:57.060> hopefully

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
I'll leave again and then hopefully

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.879 
I'll leave again and then hopefully
maybe<00:04:57.810> if<00:04:58.110> flow<00:04:58.260> when<00:04:58.410> her<00:04:58.500> son<00:04:58.680> gets

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
maybe if flow when her son gets

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.250 
maybe if flow when her son gets
cancelled<00:04:59.400> in<00:04:59.550> season<00:04:59.940> five<00:05:00.150> we<00:05:00.870> could<00:05:01.050> see

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
cancelled in season five we could see

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.960

then have him come in as a mainstay

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.830 
then have him come in as a mainstay
character<00:05:11.639> because<00:05:11.820> he's<00:05:12.030> one<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.419> the<00:05:12.810> most

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
character because he's one of the most

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.300

interesting<00:05:13.320> characters<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:14.100> all<00:05:14.190> the

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
interesting characters and all the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.620 
interesting characters and all the
walking<00:05:14.610> dead<00:05:14.729> television<00:05:15.180> series<00:05:15.510> I

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
walking dead television series I

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.870 
walking dead television series I
personally<00:05:16.050> think<00:05:16.410> for<00:05:17.100> me<00:05:17.250> he's<00:05:17.520> right<00:05:17.729> up

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
personally think for me he's right up

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.020 
personally think for me he's right up
there<00:05:17.910> with<00:05:18.300> Rick<00:05:18.800> shame<00:05:19.800> Daryl<00:05:20.550> some<00:05:20.910> of

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
there with Rick shame Daryl some of

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.659 
there with Rick shame Daryl some of
those<00:05:21.120> types<00:05:21.419> of<00:05:21.570> characters<00:05:21.990> maybe<00:05:22.590> even<00:05:23.370> I

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
those types of characters maybe even I

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:24.890 
those types of characters maybe even I
think<00:05:23.760> he's<00:05:24.000> even<00:05:24.270> more<00:05:24.389> interesting<00:05:24.600> than

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
think he's even more interesting than

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.510 
think he's even more interesting than
Glenn<00:05:25.110> I<00:05:25.169> would<00:05:25.350> have<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.620> say<00:05:25.650> Glenn<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.490> a

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
Glenn I would have to say Glenn is a

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.480 
Glenn I would have to say Glenn is a
cool<00:05:26.729> character<00:05:26.940> but<00:05:27.330> I<00:05:27.360> think<00:05:27.720> Morgan<00:05:28.110> is

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
cool character but I think Morgan is

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.860 
cool character but I think Morgan is
he's<00:05:29.490> really<00:05:29.820> strong<00:05:30.120> he's<00:05:30.479> really<00:05:30.720> because

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
he's really strong he's really because

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.840 
he's really strong he's really because
he's<00:05:30.990> been<00:05:31.139> on<00:05:31.260> his<00:05:31.289> own<00:05:31.470> for<00:05:31.530> so<00:05:31.919> long<00:05:32.100> really

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
he's been on his own for so long really

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.300 
he's been on his own for so long really
cool<00:05:33.060> character<00:05:33.539> so<00:05:33.780> I<00:05:34.050> don't<00:05:35.010> think<00:05:35.160> they

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
cool character so I don't think they

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.589 
cool character so I don't think they
would<00:05:35.430> bring<00:05:35.580> him<00:05:35.729> in<00:05:35.820> as<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.060> same<00:05:36.240> time<00:05:36.450> as

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
would bring him in as the same time as

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.510 
would bring him in as the same time as
they<00:05:36.720> have<00:05:36.840> Tyrese<00:05:37.289> in<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.530> show<00:05:37.680> or<00:05:37.950> you<00:05:38.400> know

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
they have Tyrese in the show or you know

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.370 
they have Tyrese in the show or you know
some<00:05:39.120> of<00:05:39.150> those<00:05:39.270> other<00:05:39.419> newer<00:05:39.660> characters<00:05:40.229> I

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
some of those other newer characters I

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.350 
some of those other newer characters I
think<00:05:40.950> they<00:05:41.039> wait<00:05:41.280> until<00:05:41.310> after<00:05:41.610> that<00:05:42.090> and

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
think they wait until after that and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.640 
think they wait until after that and
then<00:05:42.479> they<00:05:42.630> would<00:05:42.780> bring<00:05:42.930> them<00:05:43.080> in<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.500> know

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
then they would bring them in you know

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.070 
then they would bring them in you know
when<00:05:43.860> they've<00:05:44.070> if<00:05:44.940> Tyrese<00:05:45.419> gets<00:05:45.660> killed<00:05:45.840> off

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
when they've if Tyrese gets killed off

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.690 
when they've if Tyrese gets killed off
or<00:05:46.320> whatever<00:05:46.470> the<00:05:46.590> case<00:05:46.620> may<00:05:46.979> be<00:05:47.010> so<00:05:47.370> I<00:05:47.639> think

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
or whatever the case may be so I think

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.879 
or whatever the case may be so I think
that's<00:05:48.030> still<00:05:48.389> at<00:05:48.960> least<00:05:49.139> a<00:05:49.349> season<00:05:49.740> or<00:05:49.860> two

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
that's still at least a season or two

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:51.860 
that's still at least a season or two
away<00:05:50.160> for<00:05:50.610> him<00:05:50.700> to<00:05:50.820> come<00:05:50.940> back<00:05:51.000> as<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.330> mainstay

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
away for him to come back as a mainstay

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.230 
away for him to come back as a mainstay
character<00:05:52.349> but<00:05:52.919> I<00:05:53.340> do<00:05:53.610> think<00:05:53.880> we're<00:05:54.030> going<00:05:54.150> to

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
character but I do think we're going to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.469 
character but I do think we're going to
see<00:05:54.270> them<00:05:54.510> around<00:05:54.630> episodes<00:05:55.289> maybe<00:05:55.950> 12<00:05:56.820> 13<00:05:57.300> 14

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
see them around episodes maybe 12 13 14

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:58.790 
see them around episodes maybe 12 13 14
somewhere<00:05:58.020> around<00:05:58.229> there<00:05:58.500> and<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:58.620> look

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800
