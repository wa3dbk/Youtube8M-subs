00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
didn't do that much with all idea was

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.990 
didn't do that much with all idea was
put<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.610> piece<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.960> golden<00:01:06.979> plastic<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
put a piece of golden plastic in the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.850 
put a piece of golden plastic in the
place<00:01:09.330> where<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> had<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.020> slit<00:01:10.350> cut<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
place where I had that slit cut for the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.500 
place where I had that slit cut for the
visor<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.610> decided<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
visor because I decided I'm not going to

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.940 
visor because I decided I'm not going to
put<00:01:12.630> visors<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.200> any<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.470> these<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.799> I'm

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
now I'm just moving so the way all the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.929 
now I'm just moving so the way all the
way<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.299> got<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:31.220> little<00:01:32.220> bullets<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.800 
think it just looks quite cool it's kind
of<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:37.979> gives<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.850> halo<00:01:39.150> reach<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
of like gives it a halo reach kind of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
of like gives it a halo reach kind of
thing<00:01:39.990> they<00:01:40.229> tend<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.650> put<00:01:40.860> bullets<00:01:41.369> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
thing they tend to put bullets on

put take that much time to put the face
on<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:06.930> afraid<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.290> after<00:02:07.590> i

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
on there and I was afraid that after i

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
on there and I was afraid that after i
put<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> face<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> front<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.300> visor

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
put the face on the front of the visor

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.119

that<00:02:09.660> wit<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.289> look<00:02:10.440> right<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.920> probably

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that wit and look right and I probably

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.220

rifle<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.769> thing<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:57.019> huge<00:02:58.459> turn<00:02:59.459> this

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
rifle the thing is huge turn this

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.900 
rifle the thing is huge turn this
background<00:02:59.879> that<00:03:00.890> little<00:03:01.890> stick<00:03:02.579> that<00:03:02.790> you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
background that little stick that you

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.220 
background that little stick that you
see<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.359> right<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.200> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
see to the right of it that is a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.140 
see to the right of it that is a
yardstick<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:05.609> see<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> thing<00:03:06.120> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
easily about twice that size so it's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.300 
easily about twice that size so it's
about<00:03:08.250> six<00:03:08.579> feet<00:03:08.760> tall<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:10.140> thing<00:03:10.410> is<00:03:10.440> huge

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
about six feet tall the thing is huge

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.699 
about six feet tall the thing is huge
and<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:12.180> ain't<00:03:12.359> it's<00:03:13.019> not<00:03:13.200> completely<00:03:13.500> done

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
and it ain't it's not completely done

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.550 
and it ain't it's not completely done
yet<00:03:14.329> still<00:03:15.329> need<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.629> sand<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.049> a<00:03:16.140> little<00:03:16.319> bit

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
yet still need to sand it a little bit

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.520 
yet still need to sand it a little bit
painted<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.430> course<00:03:17.669> the<00:03:18.510> clip<00:03:18.840> actually

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
painted of course the clip actually

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.860 
painted of course the clip actually
comes<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.250> it's<00:03:20.459> pretty<00:03:20.579> cool<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.329> of<00:03:21.840> course

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
comes out it's pretty cool and of course

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.789 
comes out it's pretty cool and of course
you<00:03:22.109> got<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.440> huge<00:03:22.769> barrel<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.669> I<00:03:24.739> don't<00:03:25.739> know

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
you got the huge barrel and I don't know

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.080 
you got the huge barrel and I don't know
I<00:03:25.829> thought<00:03:26.130> it<00:03:26.220> would<00:03:26.280> be<00:03:26.400> pretty<00:03:26.579> fun<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.970> make

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I thought it would be pretty fun to make

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.309 
I thought it would be pretty fun to make
this<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.569> was<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.410> it's<00:03:29.310> pretty<00:03:29.519> big<00:03:30.319> I'm

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
this it was but it's pretty big I'm

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.110 
this it was but it's pretty big I'm
guessing<00:03:31.739> that's<00:03:31.829> actually<00:03:32.370> probably<00:03:32.579> actual

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
guessing that's actually probably actual

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.830 
guessing that's actually probably actual
size<00:03:33.359> but<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:33.930> huge<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:36.150> I'm<00:03:36.569> going<00:03:36.660> to

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
size but it's huge so I'm going to

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.659 
size but it's huge so I'm going to
probably<00:03:37.049> end<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.410> putting<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.069> on<00:03:38.250> my<00:03:38.430> wall

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
probably end up putting this on my wall

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.240 
probably end up putting this on my wall
underneath<00:03:39.239> my<00:03:39.810> helmets<00:03:40.230> or<00:03:40.560> above<00:03:40.799> them<00:03:41.040> or

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
underneath my helmets or above them or

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.650 
underneath my helmets or above them or
something<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.760> i'll<00:03:41.880> have<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> whole<00:03:42.359> wall

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
something so i'll have a whole wall

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.559
