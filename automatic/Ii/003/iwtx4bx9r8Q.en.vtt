00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to make sure this doesn't happen again

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.429

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
the timing here had a lot more to do
with<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:07.290> didn't<00:02:07.619> get<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.860> done<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.099> we

that<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.280> hundred<00:03:48.489> percent<00:03:48.729> I'd<00:03:49.540> go<00:03:50.260> back<00:03:50.440> and

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
that a hundred percent I'd go back and

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.890 
that a hundred percent I'd go back and
say<00:03:50.949> I<00:03:51.190> think<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.699> more<00:03:51.849> relevant<00:03:52.120> comparison

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
say I think the more relevant comparison

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.610 
say I think the more relevant comparison
there<00:03:53.319> is<00:03:53.549> he's<00:03:54.549> Messiah<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.409> like<00:03:56.409> we've

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
there is he's Messiah and like we've

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.649 
there is he's Messiah and like we've
done<00:03:56.829> with<00:03:56.979> the<00:03:57.069> Raptors<00:03:57.489> and<00:03:57.729> i<00:03:58.120> believe<00:03:58.479> the

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
done with the Raptors and i believe the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.689 
done with the Raptors and i believe the
success<00:03:59.109> that<00:03:59.139> we've<00:03:59.470> had<00:03:59.500> because<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.579> that

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:00.699

the only thing I find comparable there

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.849 
the only thing I find comparable there
is<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:15.220> fact<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.579> like<00:04:16.440> Messiah<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.620> done

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
is the fact that like Messiah is done
