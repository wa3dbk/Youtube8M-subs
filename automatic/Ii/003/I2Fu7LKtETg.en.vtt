00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.990 

I've<00:00:35.650> got<00:00:35.830> this<00:00:36.010> heating<00:00:36.250> element<00:00:36.640> you<00:00:36.820> might

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
I've got this heating element you might

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.880 
I've got this heating element you might
remember<00:00:37.180> from<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.630> heated<00:00:37.900> base<00:00:38.080> let's<00:00:38.710> try

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
remember from the heated base let's try

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.470 
remember from the heated base let's try
it<00:00:39.010> on<00:00:39.130> the<00:00:39.310> top<00:00:39.550> and<00:00:39.580> see<00:00:39.970> if<00:00:40.060> we<00:00:40.150> can<00:00:40.270> heat<00:00:40.450> it

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
it on the top and see if we can heat it

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.420 
it on the top and see if we can heat it
up<00:00:40.600> hot<00:00:40.810> enough<00:00:41.080> to<00:00:41.230> make<00:00:41.500> ourselves<00:00:41.650> some

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
up hot enough to make ourselves some

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.360 
up hot enough to make ourselves some
pancakes<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.870> we<00:00:46.960> have<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:47.340> sublimate<00:00:48.340> a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
pancakes so we have this sublimate a

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.970 
pancakes so we have this sublimate a
bowl<00:00:48.750> aluminum<00:00:49.750> see<00:00:50.320> if<00:00:50.410> we<00:00:50.500> can<00:00:50.650> get<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.860> to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
bowl aluminum see if we can get it to

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.070 
bowl aluminum see if we can get it to
heat<00:00:51.129> up<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:53.379> not<00:00:53.500> an<00:00:53.650> iron<00:00:53.860> but<00:00:54.340> it's<00:00:54.489> hot

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
heat up it's not an iron but it's hot

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.560 
heat up it's not an iron but it's hot
super<00:00:56.080> hot<00:00:56.550> graphic<00:00:57.550> just<00:00:57.580> finished<00:00:58.150> we

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
super hot graphic just finished we

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.180 
super hot graphic just finished we
printed<00:00:58.840> out<00:00:58.930> two<00:00:59.170> top<00:00:59.410> sheets<00:00:59.680> so<00:00:59.920> we<00:01:00.070> could

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
printed out two top sheets so we could

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.630 
printed out two top sheets so we could
sublimate<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.670> top<00:01:00.940> sheet<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.160> we<00:01:03.520> can

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
sublimate a top sheet and we can

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.859 
sublimate a top sheet and we can
sublimate<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.150> metal<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.510> will<00:01:04.600> go<00:01:04.750> in

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
sublimate the metal that will go in

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.100 
sublimate the metal that will go in
between<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.199> bindings<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.850> only<00:01:10.119> thing<00:01:10.450> I'm

we got a new heating element we're gonna
install<00:02:27.100> that<00:02:27.340> into<00:02:27.640> this<00:02:27.730> board<00:02:28.030> today<00:02:28.590> I'm

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
install that into this board today I'm

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.900 
install that into this board today I'm
gonna<00:02:29.739> put<00:02:29.920> two<00:02:30.070> inserts<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.640> core<00:02:30.880> that

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
gonna put two inserts in the core that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.460 
gonna put two inserts in the core that
will<00:02:31.180> hold<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.540> heating<00:02:31.870> element<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.410> it
