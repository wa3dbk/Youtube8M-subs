00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
in any next-gen Matt way better that is

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.600 
in any next-gen Matt way better that is
an<00:02:00.939> NC<00:02:01.270> double-a<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:03.100> I'm<00:02:03.189> going<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.369> cycle

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
eliminate the can animation and last but

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.620 
eliminate the can animation and last but
not<00:02:43.060> least<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:45.250> know<00:02:45.370> keep<00:02:45.819> continuing<00:02:46.450> to

improve on player awareness now take a

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.259 
improve on player awareness now take a
look<00:02:52.030> at<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.390> look<00:02:52.750> at<00:02:52.840> him<00:02:52.959> in<00:02:53.049> 63<00:02:54.090> yes<00:02:55.090> he

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
look at this look at him in 63 yes he

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.170 
look at this look at him in 63 yes he
does<00:02:55.480> more<00:02:55.810> through<00:02:56.079> 71<00:02:56.650> a<00:02:56.680> bit<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:58.060> that's

does more through 71 a bit but that's

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.910 
does more through 71 a bit but that's
gonna<00:02:58.390> happen<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.900> any<00:02:59.049> game<00:02:59.260> i<00:02:59.320> haven't<00:02:59.769> seen

he didn't shift over to that guy that he
was<00:03:05.980> blocking<00:03:06.190> he<00:03:06.549> actually<00:03:06.579> had<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.150> take

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
was blocking he actually had to take

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.960 
was blocking he actually had to take
steps<00:03:07.660> that's<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.739> good<00:03:08.920> thing<00:03:08.980> very<00:03:09.730> good

still needs those things like i said
proper<00:03:21.430> running<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.940> animations<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:24.220> know

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
proper running and animations you know

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.449 
proper running and animations you know
getting<00:03:25.540> rid<00:03:25.780> of<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.930> can<00:03:26.200> animation<00:03:26.920> because

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
i think that will help with some of the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.199 
i think that will help with some of the
problems<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.430> we<00:03:30.609> see<00:03:30.639> in<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:30.970> game<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:33.069> the

problems that we see in the game and the
proper<00:03:34.209> AI<00:03:35.790> we<00:03:36.790> can<00:03:36.910> get<00:03:37.060> those<00:03:37.239> things

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
proper AI we can get those things

proper AI we can get those things
this<00:03:39.769> game<00:03:40.040> would<00:03:40.189> be<00:03:40.250> good<00:03:40.579> so<00:03:40.640> right<00:03:41.060> now<00:03:41.120> my

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
this game would be good so right now my

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.179 
this game would be good so right now my
verdict<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.110> game<00:03:42.469> has<00:03:42.739> definitely

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
verdict is a game has definitely

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.940 
verdict is a game has definitely
improved<00:03:43.450> I'm<00:03:44.450> gonna<00:03:44.629> take<00:03:44.870> some<00:03:45.019> time<00:03:45.079> play
