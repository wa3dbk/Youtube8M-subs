00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.710 
but then lose all their training when
they<00:05:14.300> finally<00:05:14.660> have<00:05:14.990> to<00:05:15.139> face<00:05:15.380> off<00:05:15.710> against<00:05:16.280> me

they finally have to face off against me

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:24.040 
they finally have to face off against me
stop<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:21.760> this<00:05:22.760> is<00:05:22.940> the<00:05:23.090> part<00:05:23.270> that<00:05:23.389> just

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
stop it this is the part that just

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.800 
stop it this is the part that just
completely<00:05:24.320> destroyed<00:05:25.250> me<00:05:25.490> I<00:05:25.669> had<00:05:25.940> I<00:05:26.389> had<00:05:26.480> to

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
completely destroyed me I had I had to

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.050 
completely destroyed me I had I had to
chase<00:05:27.050> after<00:05:27.290> him<00:05:27.560> over<00:05:27.919> and<00:05:27.980> over<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:28.850> not

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
chase after him over and over and not

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.570 
chase after him over and over and not
because<00:05:29.389> I<00:05:29.510> I<00:05:29.780> guess<00:05:30.110> it<00:05:30.290> comes<00:05:30.830> down<00:05:30.980> to<00:05:31.250> skill

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
because I I guess it comes down to skill

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.370 
because I I guess it comes down to skill
but<00:05:32.120> I<00:05:32.240> was<00:05:32.330> doing<00:05:32.540> stupid<00:05:32.900> things<00:05:33.080> like

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
but I was doing stupid things like

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.170 
but I was doing stupid things like
climbing<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:34.010> tree<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.460> not<00:05:34.639> knowing<00:05:34.940> how<00:05:35.150> to

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
climbing a tree and not knowing how to

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.719 
climbing a tree and not knowing how to
jump<00:05:35.300> out<00:05:35.630> of<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.840> so<00:05:36.590> hopefully<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:37.220> don't<00:05:37.340> have

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
jump out of it so hopefully I don't have

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.640 
jump out of it so hopefully I don't have
