alright<00:00:00.719> so<00:00:01.079> here<00:00:01.410> we<00:00:01.560> got<00:00:01.770> test<00:00:02.250> one<00:00:02.959> on<00:00:03.959> this

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
alright so here we got test one on this

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.680 
alright so here we got test one on this
smaller<00:00:05.040> ducted<00:00:05.609> fan<00:00:05.879> machine<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.569> I'm

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
smaller ducted fan machine that I'm

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.629 
smaller ducted fan machine that I'm
using<00:00:06.960> as<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> test<00:00:07.680> setup<00:00:08.099> for<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> bigger

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
using as a test setup for the bigger

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.959 
using as a test setup for the bigger
Terminator<00:00:09.330> project<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.950> got<00:00:11.160> three<00:00:11.519> edf's

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
Terminator project you got three edf's

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.620 
Terminator project you got three edf's
here<00:00:12.920> rudder<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> controlled<00:00:14.759> by<00:00:14.940> these<00:00:15.120> two

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
here rudder is controlled by these two

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.779 
here rudder is controlled by these two
so<00:00:15.990> no<00:00:16.230> y'all<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.859> back<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.340> all<00:00:17.490> done<00:00:17.670> in

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
so no y'all in the back it's all done in

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.340 
so no y'all in the back it's all done in
the<00:00:17.880> front<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.300> we<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:18.630> elevator<00:00:19.109> that

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the front and we have elevator that

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.010 
the front and we have elevator that
moves<00:00:19.560> back<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:19.920> forth<00:00:20.010> here<00:00:21.020> biggest

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
moves back and forth here biggest

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.870 
moves back and forth here biggest
problem<00:00:22.410> I'm<00:00:22.529> dealing<00:00:22.560> with<00:00:22.920> right<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
problem I'm dealing with right now is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
problem I'm dealing with right now is
the<00:00:24.300> flight<00:00:24.510> control<00:00:24.900> board<00:00:25.170> will<00:00:25.470> only<00:00:25.710> power

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the flight control board will only power

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.089 
the flight control board will only power
the<00:00:26.189> motors<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.910> no<00:00:27.060> actually<00:00:27.510> arm<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the motors and no actually arm if the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.659 
the motors and no actually arm if the
board<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.550> set<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.029> arm<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.900> time<00:00:31.460> most<00:00:32.460> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
board is set to arm all the time most of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.630 
board is set to arm all the time most of
the<00:00:32.759> time<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.420> sit<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the time you sit there and you use the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
the time you sit there and you use the
left<00:00:35.880> rudder<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.510> arm<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.140> right<00:00:37.559> rudder

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
left rudder to arm it or a right rudder

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
left rudder to arm it or a right rudder
with<00:00:38.070> zero<00:00:38.309> throttle<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> arm<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.840> do

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
with zero throttle to arm it but if I do

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.569 
with zero throttle to arm it but if I do
that<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> set<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that and have it set like that in the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.110 
that and have it set like that in the
control<00:00:41.850> board<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:43.140> will<00:00:43.440> never<00:00:43.590> arm<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.250> don't

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
control board it will never arm I don't

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.580 
control board it will never arm I don't
know<00:00:45.239> why<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.469> another

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
know why that is but I have another

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
know why that is but I have another
board<00:00:47.250> exactly<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.149> one<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.570> works

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
board exactly like this one and it works

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229 
board exactly like this one and it works
just<00:00:48.930> fine<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.530> another<00:00:49.800> machine<00:00:50.239> anyways

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just fine and another machine anyways

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.959 
just fine and another machine anyways
here's<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.719> small<00:00:52.020> test<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.820> can

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
here's a small test for you here you can

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.920 
here's a small test for you here you can
see<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> elevator<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:55.110> back<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> forth

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
see the elevator going back and forth

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
see the elevator going back and forth
but<00:00:57.930> rudder<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.710> any<00:00:59.039> other<00:00:59.219> control<00:00:59.670> does<00:00:59.879> not

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
but rudder or any other control does not

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.610 
but rudder or any other control does not
work<00:01:00.239> unless<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.809> motor<00:01:01.020> power<00:01:01.260> applied

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
work unless there's motor power applied

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.200 
work unless there's motor power applied
I<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.940> that's<00:01:03.120> normal<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> here<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.180> have

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
I think that's normal so here we have

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.969 
I think that's normal so here we have
some<00:01:06.630> motor<00:01:06.840> power<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
some motor power now you can see that

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:35.790 
some motor power now you can see that
can<00:01:08.340> movies

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.220 

well<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:38.060> biggest<00:01:38.300> issue<00:01:38.600> i'm<00:01:38.900> dealing<00:01:39.200> with

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
well the biggest issue i'm dealing with

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.440 
well the biggest issue i'm dealing with
sides<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.830> arming<00:01:40.190> issue<00:01:40.370> is<00:01:40.760> one<00:01:41.210> of<00:01:41.240> the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
sides the arming issue is one of the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.850 
sides the arming issue is one of the
motors<00:01:41.780> will<00:01:41.990> cut<00:01:42.200> out<00:01:42.380> when<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.710> voltage

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
motors will cut out when the voltage

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.740 
motors will cut out when the voltage
gets<00:01:43.340> too<00:01:43.550> high<00:01:43.730> and<00:01:44.030> that's<00:01:44.210> what<00:01:44.390> happened

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
gets too high and that's what happened

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.150 
gets too high and that's what happened
and<00:01:44.840> that's<00:01:44.990> why<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.350> side<00:01:45.650> lift<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.040> up

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
and that's why that side lift it up

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.300 
and that's why that side lift it up
because<00:01:46.370> that<00:01:46.550> side<00:01:46.910> stopped<00:01:47.240> working<00:01:47.630> at<00:01:47.750> me

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
because that side stopped working at me

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.010 
because that side stopped working at me
now<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.340> had<00:01:49.730> a<00:01:49.760> different<00:01:50.360> battery<00:01:50.540> on<00:01:50.810> here

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
now I had a different battery on here

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.860 
now I had a different battery on here
earlier<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:51.980> thing<00:01:52.210> actually<00:01:53.210> lifted

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
earlier and the thing actually lifted

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.070 
earlier and the thing actually lifted
off<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.200> ground<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.970> an<00:01:56.270> inch<00:01:56.480> or<00:01:56.660> so<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:56.990> I

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
off the ground about an inch or so and I

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.630 
off the ground about an inch or so and I
was<00:01:57.230> able<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.530> do<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.770> little<00:01:58.010> bit<00:01:58.190> controlling

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
was able to do a little bit controlling

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.770 
was able to do a little bit controlling
it<00:01:59.860> but<00:02:00.860> I'm<00:02:01.610> still<00:02:02.120> trying<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.450> figure<00:02:02.630> out

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
it but I'm still trying to figure out

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.500 
it but I'm still trying to figure out
why<00:02:03.230> these<00:02:03.860> two<00:02:03.920> motors<00:02:04.670> are<00:02:04.880> hunting<00:02:05.270> back

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
why these two motors are hunting back

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.490 
why these two motors are hunting back
and<00:02:05.780> forth<00:02:06.050> as<00:02:06.260> far<00:02:06.500> as<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.890> rudders<00:02:07.340> concern

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
and forth as far as the rudders concern

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.730 
and forth as far as the rudders concern
just<00:02:09.500> without<00:02:10.160> me<00:02:10.460> doing<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:11.590> see<00:02:12.590> they

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
just without me doing it see they

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.170 
just without me doing it see they
started<00:02:13.130> out<00:02:13.250> straight<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:15.850> now<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.910> can<00:02:17.150> see

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
started out straight and now you can see

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.320 
started out straight and now you can see
that<00:02:17.510> they're<00:02:17.660> kind<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.930> turning<00:02:19.060> balance<00:02:20.060> tip

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that they're kind of turning balance tip

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.990 
that they're kind of turning balance tip
it<00:02:20.510> forward<00:02:20.750> not<00:02:21.170> when<00:02:21.350> tilted<00:02:21.740> backwards<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
it forward not when tilted backwards and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:52.630 
it forward not when tilted backwards and
I<00:02:23.209> haven't<00:02:23.480> touched<00:02:23.720> to<00:02:23.900> flip<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.200> all

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.890 

at<00:02:53.640> least<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.150> gives<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.540> demonstration

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
at least that gives you a demonstration

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.030 
at least that gives you a demonstration
that<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.800> front<00:02:56.069> two<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.780> rudder<00:02:58.020> or<00:02:58.500> yaw

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that the front two on the rudder or yaw

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.850 
that the front two on the rudder or yaw
control<00:02:59.750> actually<00:03:00.750> works<00:03:01.020> instead<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.680> just

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
control actually works instead of just

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.040 
control actually works instead of just
having<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.520> one<00:03:03.209> back<00:03:03.480> here<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:03.930> then

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
having to have one back here and then

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.220 
having to have one back here and then
being<00:03:04.260> static<00:03:04.670> now<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.240> second<00:03:06.720> test

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
being static now on that second test

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.720 
being static now on that second test
right<00:03:07.530> there<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.890> we<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.160> saw<00:03:08.400> out<00:03:08.580> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
right there that we just saw out the

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.930 
right there that we just saw out the
back<00:03:08.940> elevator<00:03:09.590> this<00:03:10.590> fan<00:03:10.920> wasn't<00:03:11.459> working

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
back elevator this fan wasn't working

whatsoever so looks like I'm going to

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.580 
whatsoever so looks like I'm going to
need<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.020> use<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.530> hefty<00:03:17.220> amount<00:03:17.580> of<00:03:17.760> sea

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
need to use a hefty amount of sea

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.410

the<00:03:21.540> battery<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.170> some<00:03:22.410> pretty<00:03:22.650> good

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the battery and some pretty good

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
the battery and some pretty good
milliamps<00:03:23.700> since<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.050> these<00:03:25.380> motors<00:03:26.000> seem

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
milliamps since all of these motors seem

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.650 
milliamps since all of these motors seem
to<00:03:27.150> be<00:03:27.269> pretty<00:03:27.750> am<00:03:27.989> hungry<00:03:28.880> these<00:03:29.880> two<00:03:30.180> forward

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
to be pretty am hungry these two forward

to be pretty am hungry these two forward
ones<00:03:30.930> here<00:03:31.260> are<00:03:31.310> jet<00:03:32.310> screamer<00:03:32.750> 1400s<00:03:33.750> for<00:03:34.080> 70

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980

ones here are jet screamer 1400s for 70
millimeter<00:03:35.370> fans<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.000> this<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.050> back<00:03:37.230> here<00:03:37.590> I

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
millimeter fans and this one back here I

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.590 
millimeter fans and this one back here I
don't<00:03:37.980> remember<00:03:38.130> exactly<00:03:38.550> what<00:03:39.030> motor<00:03:39.330> this

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
don't remember exactly what motor this

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.820 
don't remember exactly what motor this
is<00:03:39.810> but<00:03:40.080> it<00:03:40.170> came<00:03:40.319> out<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.590> an<00:03:40.830> f-18<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:43.620> also

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
is but it came out of an f-18 it's also

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.330 
is but it came out of an f-18 it's also
70<00:03:44.370> millimeters<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.530> anyways<00:03:46.530> that's<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.160> for

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
70 millimeters so anyways that's it for

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.319 
70 millimeters so anyways that's it for
now<00:03:47.930> casing<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.140> more
