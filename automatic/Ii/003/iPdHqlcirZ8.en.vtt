00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.769
 good we will explain how the bird that peru works 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.639
 to open we are going to do it and tevez we put vs t instruments yaya 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.539
 we select the option there that klum 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the admit trump window that just came out if we click on each 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 one of the icons will sound to the instrument that is selected 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.340
 as we see but the table in the square where we can move the parents to 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.350
 have more sounds 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.150
 of each of the instruments 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.520
 let's see how the sounds just go directly to the main output of the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.730
 distinction if we want it to go because of the tracks separately those that do not 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.440
 has created 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.550
 we have to push the criticism below each channel 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 it said we have separate areas for each of the instruments 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.950
 this goes well because we can apply effects to the track we wish you as a defendant 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.060
 of concession 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.520
 others fancy 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.160
 in each of the battery icons are loans in the tab below 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 We have various options that we can change the type of boxes 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 this crazy we can customize the battery 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060
 august each thing independently 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 an egg if we tighten the tie to two goals with others to loose and in the part 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.400
 up stronger 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 we go for the type of sound that it has depends on the intensity 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.570
 we also have the factory prices where we can change the sound of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 Battery 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 now we are going to see the functions that the edit module has 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.190
 here we can avoid the avid of each part of the battery 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.270
 we have several options the volume in which we can choose the intensity of the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.090
 attack beverly suspended the PRI was very sheltered by the mud of the type 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 of sound we want more powerful or less powerful 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960
 They do not agree with the tent either because of how they see how the cars 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 we are doing 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.999
 in this net sale that we can change the click that is the tone for 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 to join by massa there was later 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.030
 really me 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.750
 your task is compressor for the lid would use an opposite in the track of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.849
 output of that channel 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
 now each four as you want 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.409
 It also has a small module to add a bit and saturation for 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 the network experiment with the sound 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.319
 then we have a small three-gang peace sutel counter to give you a 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 light touch or more to our liking 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.449
 We also have two shipments aspects to which little to say the level that covers 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.449
 default 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.879
 those flaws are two reverberations in which we can choose the type of 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.879
 reverberation the intensity of each 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.159
 the latest imabis modules that are already made drum rhythms because 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.099
 we are not very skilled doing it because we already have it 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.339
 they are separated by the style of music at tempo i compass 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:56.309
 we add them to the window on the right what we want for sale right now 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.369
 there we give it to the prepared set pace to see if we like 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.840
 and then once we have the ones we like there because we crawl from 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.529
 favorites 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.069
 to the main window of the tracks 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.059
 will automatically create a track measured in which we can drag the 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.059
 rest of rhythms that we want from the battery 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.479
 now that we have a small setback that more than one labor 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.870
 although now of head 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.910
 is that we give the lawsuit and the battery does not sound what we have to do is 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.830
 open the side panel 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.669
 the spine the sighting and put the saltiness that goes by admitting questions 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.349
 then the area 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.210
 Now, as I said before, we can be in charge of the pitas and for the effect 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.260
 is usable behind Italy as if it were a normal diet 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.970
 if we double-click on the region it's a thousand 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.020
 we can avoid it 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.020
 add cited modify the instruments 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.270
 what we want is to create the sounds or the region lives since we were the 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.830
 frog the piece 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.139
 hideo kojima region 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.440
 we started again the double facemos cursor 10 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.440
 and we can edit the disk 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.080
 As the press shows about a note, it asks us to shout for an instrument 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 it corresponds if it is a cut-off bonbon 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.840
 now let's see what I call the experimental trip 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.270
 or my nephew playing the drums 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.270
 6 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.879
 I hope you liked the tutorial is a bit basic but it was only for 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.139
 start in the vi what to pronounce we have others more advanced later 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.919
 and nothing we'll see
