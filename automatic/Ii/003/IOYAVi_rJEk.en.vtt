00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
you know the type of twin pregnancy then

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
you know the type of twin pregnancy then
it<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:54.899> help<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.980> deliver<00:00:56.309> at<00:00:56.820> what

it will help you to deliver at what

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.900 
it will help you to deliver at what
appropriate<00:00:57.840> week<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.559> gestation<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.730> that's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
appropriate week of gestation so that's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
appropriate week of gestation so that's
why<00:01:00.059> we<00:01:00.210> should<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.510> whether<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
why we should know whether it's a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.770 
why we should know whether it's a
diabetic<00:01:01.399> twins<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:02.760> monozygotic<00:01:03.359> twins

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
diabetic twins or monozygotic twins

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.520 
diabetic twins or monozygotic twins
right<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.420> know<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.900> let<00:01:07.110> me<00:01:07.260> brief<00:01:07.500> you

right so you know just let me brief you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
right so you know just let me brief you
with<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> classification<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.939> twins<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
with the classification of the twins the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
with the classification of the twins the
multiple<00:01:10.380> pregnancies<00:01:10.979> they<00:01:11.189> are<00:01:11.280> classified

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
multiple pregnancies they are classified

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
multiple pregnancies they are classified
depending<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> number<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> fetuses<00:01:13.430> okay

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
depending on the number of fetuses okay

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
depending on the number of fetuses okay
like<00:01:14.970> twin<00:01:15.299> triplets<00:01:15.990> quadruplets<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
like twin triplets quadruplets right and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
like twin triplets quadruplets right and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
number of placenta koreana s'ti and then

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
number of placenta koreana s'ti and then
we<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.970> number<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> amniotic<00:01:24.720> cavities<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
we have number of amniotic cavities that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.450 
we have number of amniotic cavities that
is<00:01:25.650> am<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.520> city<00:01:26.880> right<00:01:27.560> i'm<00:01:28.560> yun<00:01:28.950> city<00:01:29.189> right

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
is am your city right i'm yun city right

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
is am your city right i'm yun city right
so<00:01:30.000> let's<00:01:30.630> talk<00:01:30.840> about<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.200> does<00:01:31.380> dizygotic

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
so let's talk about the does dizygotic

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.969 
so let's talk about the does dizygotic
twins<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.119> definitive<00:01:33.540> twins<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.799> call

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
twins the definitive twins what you call

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.999 
twins the definitive twins what you call
these<00:01:35.329> arises<00:01:36.329> spontaneously<00:01:36.869> from<00:01:37.799> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
these arises spontaneously from the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.850 
these arises spontaneously from the
release<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.520> two<00:01:39.000> eggs<00:01:39.900> two<00:01:41.810> eggs<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
release of two eggs two eggs at the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.179 
release of two eggs two eggs at the
Ovation<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.329> at<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> Ovation<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.649> x

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
Ovation so at the Ovation if the two x

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.240 
Ovation so at the Ovation if the two x
are<00:01:47.729> released<00:01:48.149> then<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.560> result<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.009> a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
are released then this will result in a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.480 
are released then this will result in a
die<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.490> gated<00:01:50.970> twins<00:01:51.689> right<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.340> be

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
die so gated twins right so it can be

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
die so gated twins right so it can be
either<00:01:53.610> familial<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:55.079> be<00:01:55.290> racial<00:01:55.799> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
either familial it can be racial in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
either familial it can be racial in
origin<00:01:56.520> or<00:01:57.110> increasing<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.380> maternal

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
origin or increasing with the maternal

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.289 
origin or increasing with the maternal
age<00:01:59.130> okay<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:01.020> even<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> IVF<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:03.119> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
age okay and even with the IVF you can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.729 
age okay and even with the IVF you can
see<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.890> dizygotic<00:02:04.890> twins

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.979 

so<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:09.399> is<00:02:09.580> regarding<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.450> dizygotic

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
so this is regarding that dizygotic

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.290 
so this is regarding that dizygotic
twins<00:02:11.530> right<00:02:14.160> monozygotic<00:02:15.160> twins<00:02:15.640> we<00:02:15.970> have<00:02:16.269> a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
twins right monozygotic twins we have a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.259 
twins right monozygotic twins we have a
mono<00:02:19.319> monozygotic<00:02:22.380> monozygotic<00:02:23.380> twins

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
mono monozygotic monozygotic twins

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.430 
mono monozygotic monozygotic twins
monozygotic<00:02:25.269> twins<00:02:25.660> arise<00:02:25.989> from<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.410> single

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
monozygotic twins arise from a single

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.420 
monozygotic twins arise from a single
fertilized<00:02:27.310> oh<00:02:27.900> okay<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.500> single

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
fertilized oh okay this is a single

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.839 
fertilized oh okay this is a single
fertilized<00:02:30.910> ohm<00:02:31.450> but<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.799> splits<00:02:33.220> into<00:02:33.489> two

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
fertilized ohm but that splits into two

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.690 
fertilized ohm but that splits into two
identical<00:02:34.140> structures<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.890> splits<00:02:36.280> into<00:02:36.489> two

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
identical structures it splits into two

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.900 
identical structures it splits into two
identical<00:02:36.959> structures<00:02:37.959> okay<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.640> type<00:02:39.880> of

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
identical structures okay so the type of

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.140 
identical structures okay so the type of
monozygotic<00:02:40.630> twins<00:02:41.110> depends<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:41.880> how<00:02:42.880> long

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
monozygotic twins depends on how long

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.050 
monozygotic twins depends on how long
after<00:02:43.380> contraception<00:02:44.380> or<00:02:44.530> conception<00:02:45.370> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
after contraception or conception the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.289 
after contraception or conception the
split<00:02:46.360> occurs<00:02:46.840> okay<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.880> monozygotic<00:02:48.880> twins

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
split occurs okay so monozygotic twins

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.180 
split occurs okay so monozygotic twins
we<00:02:49.599> have<00:02:49.840> different<00:02:50.230> types<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.709> would<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.069> to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
we have different types I would like to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.990 
we have different types I would like to
tell<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.579> so<00:02:52.299> remember<00:02:52.810> monozygotic<00:02:53.440> twins

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
tell you so remember monozygotic twins

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.240 
tell you so remember monozygotic twins
they<00:02:55.000> arise<00:02:55.420> from<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.840> single<00:02:56.349> fertilized<00:02:56.769> ovum

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
they arise from a single fertilized ovum

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.449 
they arise from a single fertilized ovum
that<00:02:57.640> splits<00:02:58.090> into<00:02:58.269> two<00:02:58.720> identical

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
that splits into two identical

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.870 
that splits into two identical
structures<00:03:00.459> right<00:03:01.360> so<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:03.190> example<00:03:03.610> this<00:03:03.760> is

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
structures right so for example this is

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.220 
structures right so for example this is
a<00:03:03.910> timing<00:03:04.360> for<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.599> that<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.200> should

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
a timing for that that you should

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.080 
a timing for that that you should
remember<00:03:05.560> because<00:03:06.190> this<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.579> be<00:03:06.730> asking

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
remember because this can be asking

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.509 
remember because this can be asking
Oscars<00:03:07.630> okay<00:03:08.380> um<00:03:09.780> three<00:03:10.780> days<00:03:11.019> if<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.340> when

Oscars okay um three days if the when

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.640 
Oscars okay um three days if the when
the<00:03:12.639> split<00:03:12.940> occurs<00:03:13.690> within<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.200> three<00:03:14.440> days

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
the split occurs within the three days

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.340 
the split occurs within the three days
okay<00:03:15.069> within<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.489> three<00:03:15.760> days<00:03:15.970> of<00:03:16.350> conception

results<00:04:34.509> in<00:04:34.659> conjoined<00:04:35.259> twins<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.190> so<00:04:36.460> you

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
results in conjoined twins and so you

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.170 
results in conjoined twins and so you
have<00:04:37.860> seen<00:04:38.860> these<00:04:39.539> conjoined<00:04:41.099> twins<00:04:42.099> okay
