 Well guys, it's already Monday and 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.800
 we come back with new applications and 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.470
 games that we have been searching for 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.470

 we start 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.310
 despite its antiquity the game of 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.369
 chess is still a claim between the 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.470
 more adult population also ends 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.200
 engaging the young people who dedicate 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.680
 a time to their learning because it's a 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.989
 game really good well good for 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.050
 to play chess do not need 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.390
 buy a board pieces also does not 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.390
 lack of a flesh and blood rival 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.550
 although it's always better since thank you 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.220
 to the artificial intelligence system 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.680
 that introduce digital games one 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.840
 You can carry out more games 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.840
 interesting with just your ipad 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.280
 mastersoft chest is one of the many 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.060
 games that are in the appstore about 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 chess in relation to the game itself 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.860
 mastersoft jets have nothing that the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.229
 others do not offer however that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.060
 You can beat the competition with a 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.220
 lots of extras options 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.530
 customizing the color board 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:27.439
 types of figure etcetera mastersoft 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.229
 chest also offers more complex data 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.810
 for chess lovers since it is 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.270
 able to generate in real time a 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.640
 note the movements made by 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.729
 each of the players storing 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.440
 those in the history tab we can 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.030
 also configure the level of 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.520
 animations that we want to see in each 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.500
 move around the board e 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.869
 even for those who are learning 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.649
 a retrograde movements for 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.649
 rectify errors 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.920
 thinking about giving a little emotion to the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.340
 quiet and subtle games for ipad and 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.860
 iphone 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.470
 the red bull guys have created a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.840
 motorcycle game full of acrobatics lights 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.120
 and tension to more not to be able at least so it is 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.830
 as they sell it in the appstore without 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.900
 However, although in a first 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.450
 moment everything seems to indicate that it is a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.310
 I play once we get down to 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.620
 the work and we started to make the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.410
 motorbike jump and try to do 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.670
 cartwheels we see how the gameplay does not 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.280
 is as good as we thought redbull xf 12 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.160
 is a game that promises action and maximum 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.260
 fun although the gameplay is not 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.209
 so good yes it is true that once 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.630
 that we take the roll to its controls 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:49.180
 we can do some little things more and it's 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.180
 which are the controls what 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.530
 that fail to work by 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.080
 sliders what makes them 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.300
 inaccurate and do not execute well 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.200
 operations 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.720
 otherwise redbull x f 12 is a game 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.360
 of motorcycles for a very specific public and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.840
 with lots of circuits and pilots 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.450
 in reais its price is affordable so 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.530
 If you wish, you can try and decide 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.530
 for yourselves 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.820
 we already know that our ipad can 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.890
 replace a good amount of 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.010
 appliances whenever we have the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.440
 proper application well well today 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.170
 we are going to teach one that will replace 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.250
 once and for all to your alarm clock 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.430
 of bed 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.260
 it's called the handy h pro and it's 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.260
 considered one of the best 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.330
 alarm clocks for ipad and the truth is 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.310
 that does not offer as many things as other 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.610
 but what you have is placed 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.730
 implemented correctly in 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.980
 highland and hd pro we have a screen 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.290
 main where we see the time in a 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.230
 pretty readable and stylish 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.120
 digital we can also see in it the 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.320
 ambient temperature of our city 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.970
 the GPS coordinates the day of the week 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.860
 there's prof handy h 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.410
 allows us to set the color that 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.870
 have the digits on this screen 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.480
 so we can customize the style 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.550
 of it by clicking on the icon 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.430
 information will open the panel 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.650
 configuration where the manager is 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.420
 alarms since friends we can create 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.450
 how many we want 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.610
 the best thing is that this alarm clock not only 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.620
 allows us to use sounds by 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.780
 defect but we can also choose 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.310
 a song from the library and 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.980
 set it as an alarm melody 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.310
 if you look jce you will see that there is handy hd 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.830
 pro offers many other options that without 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.910
 get to saturate the essential enriches 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.910
 a lot of experience 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:02.020
 on more than one occasion we have wanted 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.780
 be able to access a specific page without 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.580
 internet connection save a ticket a 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.460
 article that we like about wikipedia 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.280
 a recipe make a screenshot 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.740
 with the ipad only serves to save the 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.750
 piece of screen that looks but if 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.790
 we want to save the whole screen of the 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.860
 page then we have to go to 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.800
 applications like url vd efe 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.379
 this application is as simple as 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.080
 we can find but I assure you it is 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.860
 enough to save web pages like 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.349
 pdf its function is that to convert a 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.599
 url address that we indicate in a 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.090
 pdf document that we can later 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.419
 open in ivoox or any other 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.370
 compatible application for it the only thing 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.830
 what we have to do is paste the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.409
 URL address of the web that we want 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.900
 convert to pdf that we have previously 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:57.270
 copied from safari and wait for 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.050
 seconds until you get the conversion in 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.659
 pdf after this simple process we can 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.449
 choose with what application to open it and 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:09.060
 have it ready on our ipad as a paste 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.580
 we would have liked to url your pdf 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.580
 would have included its own search engine to 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.039
 not have to go sticking urls but still 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.849
 well worth having for moments 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.849
 concrete 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.660
 Well, good friends, up to here, our 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.330
