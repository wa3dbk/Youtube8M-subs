the day there is the possibility that

the same time there is also the

the attacks themselves both
possibilities<00:02:27.270> are<00:02:27.720> plausible<00:02:28.020> first<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:29.010> all

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
possibilities are plausible first of all

possibilities are plausible first of all
the<00:02:29.280> lizard<00:02:29.580> squad<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:30.000> certainly<00:02:30.330> proven

other hand Facebook themselves have in

other hand Facebook themselves have in
fact<00:02:38.220> experienced<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.000> number<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.450> issues<00:02:39.810> over

website being down a number of times so
both<00:02:44.610> possibilities<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.480> questionable<00:02:46.200> but

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
both possibilities are questionable but
