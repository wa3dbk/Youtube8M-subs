00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.010
 hello Polynesians today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.290
 make santoses compresses for these 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.420
 dates is super father this idea the 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.630
 snacks that you can give a meeting and 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.910
 do and are also too tender 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.180
 santaclÃ³s babies let's see how it is that 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.180
 be 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.930
 let's first make our fill 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.419
 let's buy a cream called 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.150
 cream of lincoln cream to beat that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.290
 it has to be cool before 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.860
 let's do it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860
 and we are going to take 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.690
 let's use icing sugar 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.320
 and we're going to throw him here to do even the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 there are no columns let's take for 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.100
 this amount 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.580
 now we are going to be first very 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.090
 fast when you see that it is more 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.670
 Thick the mixture beats a little slower 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.659
 this is benet and we were not going to hydrate it 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.390
 with cold water 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.939
 so that we are going to take grenetina for 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.979
 that when our cream is already in the 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.890
 santacloses no problem and do not start 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.590
 to melt or to beat 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.720
 I put some whipped cream with the big 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.920
 entity stirred it up a bit and I went back to 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.920
 throw the rest of the cream 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.890
 while our cream cools we're going to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 from our strawberries 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.229
 and we will remove when we cut ourselves there 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.480
 that cut him to the right so he 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.670
 can stop 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.330
 look for the heaviest strawberries you can see 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.330
 at the supermarket 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.480
 now let's grab our strawberry and 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.870
 let's break the tip as if it were 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.870
 the little hat 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.810
 now let's use a manga 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.970
 this is to throw the cream and with a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.970
 palita or a spoonful we are going to 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.140
 let's make us cry to practice 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.520
 how are we going to put the shortcuts 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.520
 and we are going to do it here 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.820
 the movements have to be small 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 you saw ok now let's do the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.970
 things 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.640
 approached 2 with which one has a lot 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.660
 now we are going to put in each hat 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.660
 one 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.130
 now with chocolate sparks we 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.700
 can be found in supermarkets 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.810
 they call sparks confetti are very small 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.209
 let's put them for the eyes 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.870
 Be careful when you put your eyes on 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.870
 chocolate 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.099
 and it is and so we are going to put them in all 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.260
 and remember that you have to do it 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.189
 fast because the cream has to be 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.189
 always cold 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.510
 now with this I'm going to put your 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.510
 buttons 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.780
 in his men 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.569
 and well we're done and that's it 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.620
 our santa claus is 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.340
 babies to eat 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.509
 aspect and I obviously deserve one 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.509
