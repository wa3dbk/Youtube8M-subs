curry style
you<00:02:57.500> always<00:02:57.739> put<00:02:58.159> excess<00:02:58.819> of<00:02:59.030> everything

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
especially the good stuff yeah I think

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.069 
especially the good stuff yeah I think
we're<00:03:02.060> gonna<00:03:02.150> have<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.420> fold<00:03:02.629> it<00:03:02.780> this<00:03:02.870> time

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
we're gonna have to fold it this time

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:12.369 
we're gonna have to fold it this time
and<00:03:03.290> really<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.829> taco<00:03:09.579> there<00:03:10.579> you<00:03:10.730> go<00:03:11.379> open

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
and really get a taco there you go open

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.460 
and really get a taco there you go open
it

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
it

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.159 
it
so<00:03:15.470> they<00:03:16.370> have<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.639> be<00:03:16.790> eaten<00:03:16.900> kind<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.959> fresh

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
so they have to be eaten kind of fresh

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.199 
so they have to be eaten kind of fresh
like<00:03:18.379> right<00:03:18.590> when<00:03:18.859> you<00:03:19.010> warm<00:03:19.669> your<00:03:19.849> tortilla

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
like right when you warm your tortilla

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.939 
like right when you warm your tortilla
you<00:03:20.480> should<00:03:20.930> eat<00:03:21.139> it<00:03:21.260> pretty<00:03:21.680> quickly

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
you should eat it pretty quickly

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.500 
you should eat it pretty quickly
otherwise<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.639> tortilla<00:03:23.000> tends<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:23.329> get<00:03:23.449> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
otherwise the tortilla tends to get a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.720 
otherwise the tortilla tends to get a
little<00:03:23.629> chewy<00:03:23.900> right<00:03:24.349> I<00:03:24.620> think<00:03:24.829> the<00:03:25.400> best<00:03:25.549> way

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
little chewy right I think the best way

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.819 
little chewy right I think the best way
to<00:03:25.760> do<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.120> has<00:03:26.419> have<00:03:26.720> all<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.139> condiments<00:03:27.530> out

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
to do it has have all the condiments out

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.400 
to do it has have all the condiments out
sit<00:03:28.790> down<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.030> nine<00:03:29.209> table<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:29.900> heat<00:03:30.079> up<00:03:30.109> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
sit down the nine table just heat up the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.949 
sit down the nine table just heat up the
tortillas<00:03:31.220> put<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.879> in<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.090> little<00:03:32.359> hot<00:03:32.690> case

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
tortillas put it in a little hot case

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.659 
tortillas put it in a little hot case
take<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.680> out<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.949> so<00:03:34.069> that<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.370> can<00:03:34.519> just

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
take it out and so that you can just

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:36.759 
take it out and so that you can just
keep<00:03:34.819> making<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.629> keep<00:03:35.780> eating<00:03:36.169> it<00:03:36.290> and

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
keep making it and keep eating it and

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.140 
keep making it and keep eating it and
that's<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.190> best<00:03:37.489> way<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.639> have<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:37.940> because

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
that's the best way to have it because

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.729 
that's the best way to have it because
you<00:03:38.239> don't<00:03:38.419> want<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.690> 30<00:03:39.019> years<00:03:39.139> to<00:03:39.230> get<00:03:39.349> soggy

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739
