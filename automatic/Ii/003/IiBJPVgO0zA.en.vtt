proximal radioulnar joint very good so
with<00:00:06.620> the<00:00:06.740> proximal<00:00:07.340> radioulnar<00:00:07.870> the<00:00:08.870> radius

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
with the proximal radioulnar the radius

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.119 
with the proximal radioulnar the radius
to<00:00:10.099> the<00:00:10.129> ulna<00:00:10.549> we<00:00:10.759> we<00:00:11.150> have<00:00:11.330> a<00:00:11.360> convex<00:00:12.129> outer

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129 
to the ulna we we have a convex outer

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.970 
to the ulna we we have a convex outer
Ridge<00:00:13.610> of<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.200> radial<00:00:15.200> head<00:00:15.410> that's<00:00:15.709> going<00:00:15.799> to

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
Ridge of the radial head that's going to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.210 
Ridge of the radial head that's going to
be<00:00:16.100> going<00:00:16.430> and<00:00:16.640> mobile<00:00:17.390> in<00:00:17.920> articulating<00:00:18.920> with

be going and mobile in articulating with
a<00:00:19.550> concave<00:00:20.420> ulna<00:00:21.349> so<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.340> convex<00:00:22.820> concave

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
a concave ulna so the convex concave

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.339 
a concave ulna so the convex concave
rule<00:00:23.720> comes<00:00:23.990> into<00:00:24.230> place<00:00:24.580> when<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.359> forearm

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
rule comes into place when the forearm

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.519 
rule comes into place when the forearm
goes<00:00:27.589> into<00:00:27.890> supination<00:00:28.689> we<00:00:29.689> also<00:00:29.900> have<00:00:30.289> a

goes into supination we also have a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.040 
goes into supination we also have a
ventral<00:00:31.189> glide<00:00:31.490> along<00:00:32.090> with<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.450> rotation

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
ventral glide along with the rotation

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.930 
ventral glide along with the rotation
that<00:00:33.170> takes<00:00:33.410> place<00:00:33.680> so<00:00:34.219> to<00:00:34.399> enhance

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
that takes place so to enhance

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.330 
that takes place so to enhance
supination<00:00:35.539> I'm<00:00:36.110> going<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.469> do<00:00:36.649> a<00:00:36.680> ventral

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
supination I'm going to do a ventral

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.590

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
glide of radius on all and that takes

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.290 
glide of radius on all and that takes
place<00:00:41.899> by<00:00:42.110> getting<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.590> patient's<00:00:43.300> humeral

should say ventral Glide going in this

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.999 
should say ventral Glide going in this
