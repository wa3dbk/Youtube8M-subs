00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
three or four spaces and so you'll move

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
many spaces there are some shortcuts

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.410 
many spaces there are some shortcuts
along<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.250> way<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> one<00:03:00.120> thing<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.390> really

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
along the way and one thing I really

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.630 
along the way and one thing I really
liked<00:03:00.900> is<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.860> side<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> board<00:03:02.519> you

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
liked is on this side of the board you

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
liked is on this side of the board you
shouldn't<00:03:03.090> take<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:04.140> obviously

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
shouldn't take it because it obviously

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.110 
shouldn't take it because it obviously
is<00:03:04.830> not<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.980> good<00:03:05.130> idea<00:03:05.220> there's<00:03:05.519> no<00:03:05.640> shortcuts

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
is not a good idea there's no shortcuts

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
is not a good idea there's no shortcuts
on<00:03:06.269> this<00:03:06.780> side<00:03:07.050> there<00:03:07.500> are<00:03:07.769> shortcuts<00:03:08.400> there

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
on this side there are shortcuts there

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.729 
on this side there are shortcuts there
are<00:03:08.970> two<00:03:09.390> shortcuts<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.050> eventually<00:03:10.470> children

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
are two shortcuts so eventually children

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.860 
are two shortcuts so eventually children
will<00:03:11.160> learn<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.760> hey<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.180> should<00:03:12.269> take<00:03:12.600> this

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
will learn that hey I should take this

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.390 
will learn that hey I should take this
side<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> board<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.860> that's<00:03:14.040> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.280> be

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
side of the board and that's going to be

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.039 
side of the board and that's going to be
really<00:03:14.610> neat<00:03:14.850> when<00:03:15.090> your<00:03:15.239> child<00:03:15.540> figures<00:03:15.900> out

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
really neat when your child figures out

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.360 
really neat when your child figures out
that<00:03:16.079> hey<00:03:16.350> there's<00:03:16.590> two<00:03:16.739> shortcuts<00:03:17.040> over

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
that hey there's two shortcuts over

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.440 
that hey there's two shortcuts over
there<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.670> should<00:03:17.850> probably<00:03:17.970> go<00:03:18.209> over<00:03:18.329> this

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
there I should probably go over this

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.229 
there I should probably go over this
stuff<00:03:18.570> but<00:03:19.230> anywho<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.890> can<00:03:20.070> move<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:21.209> can

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
stuff but anywho you can move you can

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.810 
stuff but anywho you can move you can
roll<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.320> green<00:03:22.530> which<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.920> pigs<00:03:23.220> each<00:03:23.459> spin

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
roll the green which is pigs each spin

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.880 
roll the green which is pigs each spin
again<00:03:24.090> this<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.540> bad<00:03:24.810> one<00:03:25.079> when<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.440> land

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
again this is the bad one when you land

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.490 
again this is the bad one when you land
on<00:03:26.010> pigs<00:03:26.370> eat<00:03:26.610> one<00:03:27.390> piece<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.870> your<00:03:27.959> picnic<00:03:28.350> is

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.160 
on pigs eat one piece of your picnic is

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
gone the pig's head binge date it might

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.449 
gone the pig's head binge date it might
be<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> watermelon<00:03:31.709> might<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.070> whatever<00:03:32.340> you

be a watermelon might be whatever you
decide<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.820> take<00:03:32.970> out<00:03:33.120> but<00:03:33.660> once<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.769> pigs<00:03:34.980> eat

to flip over the sand timer and then
boom<00:04:13.980> you<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.579> long<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.060> try<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.540> find

boom you have that long to try and find
sand<00:04:16.079> timers<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.890> when<00:04:17.039> a<00:04:17.070> kid<00:04:17.220> finds<00:04:17.519> us<00:04:17.579> in

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
sand timers so when a kid finds us in

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.340 
sand timers so when a kid finds us in
our<00:04:18.030> tribe<00:04:18.450> McConnell<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.810> like<00:04:18.959> hey<00:04:19.079> there's

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
our tribe McConnell be like hey there's

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.659 
our tribe McConnell be like hey there's
a<00:04:19.410> traffic<00:04:19.620> cone<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.130> he'll<00:04:20.280> set<00:04:20.549> his

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
a traffic cone and he'll set his

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.940 
a traffic cone and he'll set his
magnifying<00:04:20.970> glass<00:04:21.390> down<00:04:21.599> there<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.410> we'll

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
magnifying glass down there so we'll

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.030 
magnifying glass down there so we'll
just<00:04:23.190> pretend<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.669> we

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
just pretend that we

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.390 
just pretend that we
three<00:04:24.850> traffic<00:04:25.330> cones<00:04:26.070> before<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.190> sand

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
three traffic cones before the sand

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.190 
three traffic cones before the sand
timer<00:04:27.610> ran<00:04:28.000> out<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.390> what<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.720> means<00:04:28.990> is

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
timer ran out so what that means is

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.910 
timer ran out so what that means is
everybody<00:04:30.160> gets<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.670> move<00:04:30.910> three<00:04:31.690> spaces<00:04:32.560> this

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
everybody gets to move three spaces this

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.950 
everybody gets to move three spaces this
game<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.340> really<00:04:33.760> hard<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.240> lose<00:04:34.360> because<00:04:34.720> I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
game is really hard to lose because I

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.780 
game is really hard to lose because I
don't<00:04:35.140> know<00:04:35.200> how<00:04:35.410> they<00:04:35.620> rigged<00:04:35.980> this<00:04:36.340> this
