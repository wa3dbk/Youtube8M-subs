that they have started work on one but

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
that they have started work on one but
to<00:01:21.450> update<00:01:21.750> now<00:01:22.200> things<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.619> changed<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
already but um yeah I think 1.2

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
already but um yeah I think 1.2
as<00:02:05.579> well<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.329> will<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.450> coming<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.960> about

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
as well that will be coming in about

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130 
as well that will be coming in about
April<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:09.149> there's<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:10.020> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
April so because there's so much in it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.450 
April so because there's so much in it
and<00:02:10.370> that<00:02:11.370> yeah<00:02:11.640> since<00:02:12.180> there's<00:02:12.480> about

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and that yeah since there's about

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.620 
and that yeah since there's about
the<00:02:13.550> 1.9<00:02:14.120> compared<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.840> 1.8<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.560> about<00:02:16.060> 3/4<00:02:17.060> as

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
the 1.9 compared to 1.8 is about 3/4 as

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.740 
the 1.9 compared to 1.8 is about 3/4 as
much<00:02:17.990> or<00:02:18.350> two-thirds<00:02:18.860> as<00:02:19.040> much<00:02:19.280> as<00:02:19.610> what<00:02:20.540> was

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
much or two-thirds as much as what was

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.430 
much or two-thirds as much as what was
in<00:02:20.950> 1.8<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.400> know<00:02:22.520> compared<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:24.230> I'd<00:02:24.380> say

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
in 1.8 you know compared and so I'd say

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.650 
in 1.8 you know compared and so I'd say
cool<00:02:24.980> at<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.220> time<00:02:25.460> yeah<00:02:25.730> two<00:02:26.120> months<00:02:26.300> and

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
cool at the time yeah two months and

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.890 
cool at the time yeah two months and
they<00:02:27.230> started<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.740> about<00:02:28.130> a<00:02:28.160> month<00:02:28.340> ago<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:29.300> you

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
they started it about a month ago so you

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.310 
they started it about a month ago so you
know<00:02:30.020> January<00:02:30.980> profitably<00:02:31.700> or<00:02:32.090> February<00:02:32.870> so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
know January profitably or February so

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.440 
know January profitably or February so
if<00:02:33.410> you<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.680> what<00:02:33.830> I'm<00:02:33.950> trying<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.550> say<00:02:34.820> that's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
if you see what I'm trying to say that's

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.070 
if you see what I'm trying to say that's
pretty<00:02:35.810> good<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.590> think<00:02:36.980> so<00:02:37.430> um<00:02:37.730> yeah<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.840> guess

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
pretty good I think so um yeah I guess

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.990 
pretty good I think so um yeah I guess
that<00:02:39.500> seems<00:02:39.680> video<00:02:40.100> there<00:02:40.280> isn't<00:02:40.460> much<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.850> say

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that seems video there isn't much to say

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.030 
that seems video there isn't much to say
about<00:02:41.150> issues<00:02:41.720> what<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.960> think<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.560> how<00:02:42.800> long

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
about issues what I think and how long

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.520 
about issues what I think and how long
and<00:02:43.340> why<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.240> think<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:45.020> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.230> take<00:02:45.350> that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
and why I think it's going to take that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.980 
and why I think it's going to take that
long<00:02:45.770> so<00:02:46.250> yeah<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.210> if<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.420> did<00:02:47.600> enjoy<00:02:47.870> the
