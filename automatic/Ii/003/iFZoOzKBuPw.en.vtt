particular model with the day hatch

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.490 
particular model with the day hatch
there<00:00:58.550> are<00:00:58.610> three<00:00:58.790> bulkheads<00:00:59.239> one<00:00:59.960> forward

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
went immediately behind the cockpit one

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.140 
went immediately behind the cockpit one
behind<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.800> day<00:01:03.950> hatch<00:01:04.160> each<00:01:04.489> of<00:01:04.699> these<00:01:04.820> is

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
behind the day hatch each of these is

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.240 
behind the day hatch each of these is
glued<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:06.560> if<00:01:06.830> any<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.130> these<00:01:07.190> are

glued in so if any of these are

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.249 
glued in so if any of these are
compromised<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.060> boat<00:01:08.240> still<00:01:08.540> has<00:01:08.720> flotation

capability

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.270 

I<00:01:18.570> think<00:01:19.230> there<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.950> key

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I think there are two key

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.190 
I think there are two key
differentiators<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.270> design<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.870> set

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
differentiators in this design that set

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.590 
differentiators in this design that set
it<00:01:22.290> apart<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.680> its<00:01:22.950> competition<00:01:23.270> first<00:01:24.270> off

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it apart from its competition first off

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.640 
it apart from its competition first off
is<00:01:24.870> the<00:01:25.670> aggressive<00:01:26.670> chine<00:01:26.940> on<00:01:27.210> each<00:01:28.170> side<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
is the aggressive chine on each side of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
is the aggressive chine on each side of
the<00:01:28.710> hull<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.370> gives<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.380> biting

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the hull this gives it a lot of biting

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
the hull this gives it a lot of biting
ability<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.430> healing<00:01:32.850> from<00:01:32.970> side<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
ability as you're healing from side to

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.930 
ability as you're healing from side to
side<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.840> maneuvering<00:01:34.230> around<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.710> chop<00:01:34.950> and

side and maneuvering around the chop and

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.630 
side and maneuvering around the chop and
the<00:01:36.030> second<00:01:36.390> differentiator<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.640> carbon

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the second differentiator is a carbon

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.930 
the second differentiator is a carbon
foiled<00:01:39.030> skinning<00:01:39.420> blade<00:01:39.830> which<00:01:40.830> is<00:01:41.130> shaped

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
foiled skinning blade which is shaped

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.970 
foiled skinning blade which is shaped
like<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.480> windsurfing<00:01:42.930> blade<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.500> penetrates

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
like a windsurfing blade and penetrates

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.590 
like a windsurfing blade and penetrates
much<00:01:44.160> deeper<00:01:44.580> into<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> water<00:01:44.970> then

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
much deeper into the water then

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.900 
much deeper into the water then
competitive<00:01:46.500> skins<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.400> gives<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.760> lot

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
competitive skins this gives you a lot

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.020 
competitive skins this gives you a lot
