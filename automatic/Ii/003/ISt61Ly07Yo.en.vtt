very<00:02:32.859> nice<00:02:33.249> it<00:02:33.639> is<00:02:33.689> made<00:02:34.689> out<00:02:34.719> of<00:02:34.870> plastic<00:02:35.370> for

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
very nice it is made out of plastic for

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.179 
very nice it is made out of plastic for
most<00:02:36.579> part<00:02:36.939> except<00:02:37.359> for<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:37.810> metal<00:02:38.620> mount<00:02:38.889> and

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
most part except for the metal mount and

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.849 
most part except for the metal mount and
there<00:02:39.969> should<00:02:40.299> be<00:02:40.540> metal<00:02:41.230> construction<00:02:41.769> on

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:41.859 
there should be metal construction on

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.119 
there should be metal construction on
the<00:02:41.950> inside<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.930> can't<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:44.650> open<00:02:44.889> up

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
the inside but I can't really open up

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.569 
the inside but I can't really open up
this<00:02:45.250> lens<00:02:45.519> now<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:47.200> benefits<00:02:47.680> of<00:02:47.799> this<00:02:48.250> lens

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
this lens now the benefits of this lens

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.879 
this lens now the benefits of this lens
is<00:02:50.370> one<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.519> has<00:02:51.639> a<00:02:51.669> huge<00:02:52.120> aperture<00:02:52.689> at<00:02:52.840> 1.4<00:02:53.709> so

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
is one it has a huge aperture at 1.4 so

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:55.860 
is one it has a huge aperture at 1.4 so
it's<00:02:54.010> gonna<00:02:54.159> let<00:02:54.430> in<00:02:54.609> tons<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.299> tons<00:02:55.329> of<00:02:55.629> light

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
it's gonna let in tons and tons of light

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.199 
it's gonna let in tons and tons of light
so<00:02:56.469> I<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.560> get<00:02:56.799> some<00:02:56.980> great<00:02:57.159> low-light<00:02:57.730> shots

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
so I can get some great low-light shots

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.379 
so I can get some great low-light shots
and<00:02:58.629> I<00:02:58.719> can<00:02:58.870> get<00:02:58.989> great<00:02:59.290> bouquet<00:03:00.209> which<00:03:01.209> I

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
the out-of-focus parts are but here is

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.949 
the out-of-focus parts are but here is

this lens moves except for the manual
focus<00:03:25.389> ring<00:03:25.509> which<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:25.930> have<00:03:26.169> plenty<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
focus ring which you have plenty of

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.080 
focus ring which you have plenty of
sweet<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.489> mean<00:03:27.939> you're<00:03:28.090> almost<00:03:28.299> you're<00:03:30.090> almost

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
sweet I mean you're almost you're almost

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.659 
sweet I mean you're almost you're almost
at<00:03:31.509> like<00:03:31.659> 120<00:03:32.379> degrees<00:03:32.680> sweet<00:03:32.979> I'm<00:03:33.189> sure<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.400> can

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
at like 120 degrees sweet I'm sure I can

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.360 
at like 120 degrees sweet I'm sure I can
find<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:34.060> specs<00:03:34.359> but<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> decent<00:03:36.310> amount

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
find the specs but it is a decent amount

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.849 
find the specs but it is a decent amount
and<00:03:36.729> then<00:03:36.849> you<00:03:37.000> have<00:03:37.180> manual<00:03:38.079> control<00:03:38.139> over

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
and then you have manual control over

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.369 
and then you have manual control over
your<00:03:39.479> aperture<00:03:40.479> setting<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.079> it's<00:03:41.199> pretty

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
your aperture setting so it's pretty

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.069 
your aperture setting so it's pretty
nice<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.709> tell<00:03:42.159> and<00:03:42.430> each<00:03:42.970> aperture<00:03:43.659> setting

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
nice to tell and each aperture setting

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.219 
nice to tell and each aperture setting
here<00:03:44.379> is<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:45.430> click<00:03:45.790> so<00:03:46.030> that's<00:03:46.209> 1.4<00:03:46.479> I<00:03:46.959> believe

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
here is a click so that's 1.4 I believe

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:53.569 
here is a click so that's 1.4 I believe
that's<00:03:47.609> 1.8<00:03:48.609> no<00:03:49.030> that's<00:03:49.409> 1.4<00:03:50.409> I'm<00:03:51.069> assuming<00:03:51.549> -

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
that's 1.8 no that's 1.4 I'm assuming -

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.429 
that's 1.8 no that's 1.4 I'm assuming -
probably<00:03:54.750> 2.2<00:03:55.750> or<00:03:55.930> 2.4<00:03:56.500> then<00:03:57.099> 2.8<00:03:57.939> and<00:03:58.449> then

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
probably 2.2 or 2.4 then 2.8 and then

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.050 
probably 2.2 or 2.4 then 2.8 and then
I'm<00:03:59.590> not<00:03:59.620> sure<00:03:59.769> what<00:04:00.129> all<00:04:00.310> these<00:04:00.459> have<00:04:00.729> stops

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
I'm not sure what all these have stops

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.539 
I'm not sure what all these have stops
are<00:04:01.269> but<00:04:01.419> that's<00:04:01.540> for<00:04:02.009> 5.6<00:04:03.239> 811<00:04:04.239> 16<00:04:05.229> and<00:04:05.650> 22<00:04:06.189> is

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
are but that's for 5.6 811 16 and 22 is

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.330 
are but that's for 5.6 811 16 and 22 is
your<00:04:06.729> smallest<00:04:07.409> though<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:08.439> probably<00:04:09.069> will

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
your smallest though I probably will

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.649 
your smallest though I probably will
never<00:04:09.669> be<00:04:09.879> shooting<00:04:10.359> anything<00:04:10.989> under<00:04:11.469> 2.8

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
never be shooting anything under 2.8

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.759 
never be shooting anything under 2.8
because<00:04:13.659> that's<00:04:13.900> not<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.199> purpose<00:04:14.409> of<00:04:14.620> this

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769
