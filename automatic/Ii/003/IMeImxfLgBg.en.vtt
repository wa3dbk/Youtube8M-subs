waterboxx<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.430> cooled<00:00:35.730> by<00:00:36.110> so<00:00:37.110> only

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
waterboxx that it's cooled by so only

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.330 
waterboxx that it's cooled by so only
the<00:00:37.559> cpu<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> being<00:00:38.399> cool<00:00:39.739> water<00:00:40.739> block<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.190> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
for more details on this hardware it's a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
for more details on this hardware it's a
beast<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:57.690> box<00:00:57.899> total<00:00:58.739> overkill<00:00:58.980> for

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
beast of a water box total overkill for

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.750 
beast of a water box total overkill for
the<00:00:59.370> cpu<00:01:00.500> anyways<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.770> i've<00:01:02.039> managed<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.579> reach

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the cpu anyways so i've managed to reach

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.230 
the cpu anyways so i've managed to reach
five<00:01:03.030> point<00:01:03.329> three<00:01:03.769> gigahertz<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> i<00:01:08.210> made<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
five point three gigahertz so i made a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.899 
five point three gigahertz so i made a
video<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.960> i<00:01:09.990> reach<00:01:10.200> five<00:01:10.590> gigahertz<00:01:11.010> but

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
video when i reach five gigahertz but

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.990 
video when i reach five gigahertz but
i've<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.180> five<00:01:12.479> gigahertz<00:01:13.369> 24-7<00:01:14.689> stable<00:01:17.000> so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
i've got five gigahertz 24-7 stable so

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
i've got five gigahertz 24-7 stable so
prime95<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.290> links<00:01:19.740> stable<00:01:21.409> basically

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
prime95 and links stable basically

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020 
prime95 and links stable basically
whatever<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.860> throw<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> perfectly

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
whatever you throw at it perfectly

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.820 
whatever you throw at it perfectly
stable<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> temps<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:25.259> maxing<00:01:25.650> out<00:01:25.770> at

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
stable and the temps we're maxing out at

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.190 
stable and the temps we're maxing out at
like<00:01:26.070> 85<00:01:26.759> degrees<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.540> we're<00:01:27.960> still

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
like 85 degrees so we're still

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.069 
like 85 degrees so we're still
acceptable<00:01:28.680> temperatures<00:01:29.869> now<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.049> about

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
acceptable temperatures now what about

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.560 
acceptable temperatures now what about
to<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.560> increase<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> cpu<00:01:32.850> core<00:01:33.060> bodies<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
to do is increase the cpu core bodies to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.560 
to do is increase the cpu core bodies to
one<00:01:33.750> point<00:01:33.960> 6<00:01:34.290> volts<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> memory<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.329> at<00:01:36.450> one

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
one point 6 volts so memory is at one

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
one point 6 volts so memory is at one
point<00:01:36.780> six<00:01:36.990> five<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.560> I've<00:01:37.799> increased<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
point six five and I've increased the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.980 
point six five and I've increased the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
PLL 21.85 temperature is my barrier at

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.310 
PLL 21.85 temperature is my barrier at
5.3<00:01:43.829> gigahertz<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.640> cannot<00:01:45.540> go<00:01:45.720> any<00:01:46.020> further

5.3 gigahertz I cannot go any further

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
5.3 gigahertz I cannot go any further
because<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.490> getting<00:01:47.670> too<00:01:47.759> hot<00:01:48.240> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
because it's just getting too hot it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
because it's just getting too hot it's

Link<00:01:56.969> stable<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.930> run<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> couple<00:01:58.409> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
Link stable but I can run a couple of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:06.080 
Link stable but I can run a couple of
benchmarks<00:01:59.630> including<00:02:00.770> super<00:02:01.770> pie<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.969> if<00:02:05.969> i

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
benchmarks including super pie so if i

benchmarks including super pie so if i
round<00:02:06.299> 32<00:02:06.780> megabytes<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.799> six<00:02:08.129> minutes

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
round 32 megabytes and got six minutes

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.529 
round 32 megabytes and got six minutes

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539

almost<00:02:10.989> 48<00:02:11.439> seconds<00:02:12.569> which<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.599> pretty<00:02:13.900> insane

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
almost 48 seconds which is pretty insane

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.830 
almost 48 seconds which is pretty insane
and<00:02:14.920> I'll<00:02:15.280> just<00:02:15.519> run<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.760> sign<00:02:19.060> bench<00:02:19.359> as<00:02:19.569> well

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
and I'll just run the sign bench as well

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.759 
and I'll just run the sign bench as well
just<00:02:20.469> to<00:02:20.650> show<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.159> it's<00:02:21.489> stable<00:02:22.769> well

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
just to show you that it's stable well

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.660 
just to show you that it's stable well
reasonably<00:02:24.549> stable<00:02:26.760> basically<00:02:27.760> prime95<00:02:28.359> and

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
reasonably stable basically prime95 and

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.479 
reasonably stable basically prime95 and
and<00:02:30.670> links<00:02:31.120> just<00:02:31.329> yeah<00:02:32.290> make<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.709> CPU<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.220> hide

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
and links just yeah make the CPU to hide

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.849 
and links just yeah make the CPU to hide
it<00:02:33.640> goes<00:02:33.790> over<00:02:34.060> 95<00:02:34.659> degrees<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.739> is

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
it goes over 95 degrees and that is

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.309 
it goes over 95 degrees and that is
unacceptable<00:02:36.689> many<00:02:37.689> temps<00:02:38.170> over<00:02:38.500> 85<00:02:39.010> degrees

unacceptable many temps over 85 degrees

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.500 
unacceptable many temps over 85 degrees
is<00:02:41.319> risky<00:02:41.909> so<00:02:42.909> do<00:02:43.389> not<00:02:43.510> do<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.049> your<00:02:44.139> CPU

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
is risky so do not do this to your CPU

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.610

unless you're willing to risk your
hardware<00:02:49.139> so<00:02:50.139> i'll<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.319> show<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.680> there<00:02:51.340> it

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
hardware so i'll just show you there it

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.780 
hardware so i'll just show you there it
is<00:02:51.629> 5.3<00:02:52.629> 53<00:02:53.379> x<00:02:53.650> 100<00:02:54.930> very<00:02:55.930> simple<00:02:56.859> to<00:02:57.129> over<00:02:57.549> flop

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.780 
the Sandy Bridge platform the k-series

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
we're on the super pie again to get it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:47.720 
we're on the super pie again to get it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.809 

sorry<00:03:48.540> just

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.839 

just<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.390> sec<00:03:51.719> there<00:03:51.930> we<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.499> 5.3<00:03:53.310> as<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.700> can

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
just a sec there we go so 5.3 as you can

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.849 
just a sec there we go so 5.3 as you can
see<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.299> just<00:03:54.390> went<00:03:54.689> up<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:55.019> one<00:03:55.379> point<00:03:55.650> 6

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
see it just went up there one point 6

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.759 
see it just went up there one point 6
volts<00:03:56.599> and<00:03:57.599> I'll<00:03:57.749> just<00:03:57.870> show<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.079> AI<00:03:58.260> suite

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
volts and I'll just show you AI suite

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:05.449 
volts and I'll just show you AI suite
too<00:03:59.069> just<00:03:59.549> to<00:04:01.549> confirm<00:04:02.549> it

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.740 

so<00:04:06.459> you<00:04:06.519> see<00:04:06.849> a<00:04:06.879> lot<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.060> people<00:04:07.390> out<00:04:07.510> there

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
so you see a lot of people out there

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.750 
so you see a lot of people out there
that<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:07.989> reached<00:04:08.170> these<00:04:08.530> clocks<00:04:08.859> even<00:04:09.640> on

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
that have reached these clocks even on

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.459 
that have reached these clocks even on
air<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.480> thing<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.719> you<00:04:13.959> don't<00:04:14.079> see<00:04:14.349> them

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
air but the thing is you don't see them

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:15.869 
air but the thing is you don't see them
running<00:04:14.709> benchmarks<00:04:15.400> you<00:04:15.489> just<00:04:15.700> see<00:04:15.819> them

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
running benchmarks you just see them

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.840 
running benchmarks you just see them
booting<00:04:16.269> into<00:04:16.389> windows<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:17.019> that's<00:04:17.199> it<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
booting into windows and that's it and

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.949 
booting into windows and that's it and
that's<00:04:18.850> because<00:04:19.120> if<00:04:19.449> they<00:04:19.570> did<00:04:19.630> run

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
that's because if they did run

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.960 
that's because if they did run
benchmarks<00:04:20.199> that<00:04:21.660> cpu<00:04:22.660> would<00:04:22.810> be<00:04:22.930> overheating

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
benchmarks that cpu would be overheating

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.219 
benchmarks that cpu would be overheating
because<00:04:24.970> even<00:04:25.419> on<00:04:25.539> a<00:04:25.570> water-cooling<00:04:26.080> system

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
because even on a water-cooling system

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.670 
because even on a water-cooling system
like<00:04:26.770> I've<00:04:27.009> got<00:04:27.310> which<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:27.910> total<00:04:28.300> overkill<00:04:28.680> at

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
like I've got which is total overkill at

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.950 
like I've got which is total overkill at
five<00:04:29.949> points<00:04:30.130> from<00:04:30.430> 3<00:04:30.910> i'm<00:04:31.180> reaching<00:04:31.419> 100

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
five points from 3 i'm reaching 100

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.070 
five points from 3 i'm reaching 100
degrees<00:04:32.259> Celsius<00:04:32.289> on<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.949> CPU<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.789> if<00:04:34.780> I<00:04:34.930> want

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
degrees Celsius on the CPU so if I want

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.029 
degrees Celsius on the CPU so if I want
to<00:04:35.199> go<00:04:35.320> any<00:04:35.500> further<00:04:35.740> than<00:04:36.039> 5.3<00:04:37.590> I'm<00:04:38.590> sorry<00:04:38.919> I'm

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
to go any further than 5.3 I'm sorry I'm

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.300 
to go any further than 5.3 I'm sorry I'm
running<00:04:39.190> 1.6<00:04:39.789> two<00:04:40.360> balls<00:04:40.830> yeah<00:04:41.830> any<00:04:42.039> further

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
running 1.6 two balls yeah any further

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.860 
running 1.6 two balls yeah any further
than<00:04:42.580> five<00:04:42.820> points<00:04:43.180> free<00:04:43.449> and<00:04:43.599> I'm<00:04:43.690> going<00:04:43.840> to

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
than five points free and I'm going to

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.180 
than five points free and I'm going to
have<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.050> go<00:04:44.199> something<00:04:44.620> better<00:04:44.800> than<00:04:44.979> water

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
have to go something better than water

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.510 
have to go something better than water
cooling<00:04:45.550> for<00:04:46.419> example<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.169> liquid<00:04:47.500> nitrogen

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.180 

so<00:04:51.520> basically<00:04:51.970> heat<00:04:52.509> is<00:04:52.630> my<00:04:52.780> barrier<00:04:53.229> and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
so basically heat is my barrier and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.260 
so basically heat is my barrier and
nothing<00:04:54.729> else<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.009> AI<00:04:57.280> suite<00:04:57.729> 2<00:04:58.000> and

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
nothing else so this is AI suite 2 and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.360 
nothing else so this is AI suite 2 and
they've<00:04:58.360> integrated<00:04:58.570> all<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.229> Aces<00:04:59.919> software

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
they've integrated all the Aces software

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.710 
they've integrated all the Aces software
into<00:05:00.550> one<00:05:00.759> app<00:05:00.970> which<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.270> really<00:05:01.630> cool<00:05:03.720> so

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
into one app which is really cool so

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.320 
into one app which is really cool so
I've<00:05:04.990> also<00:05:05.199> got<00:05:05.590> all<00:05:05.710> my<00:05:05.919> vrm<00:05:06.669> settings<00:05:07.060> to<00:05:07.240> the

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
I've also got all my vrm settings to the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.700 
I've also got all my vrm settings to the
absolute<00:05:07.750> maximum<00:05:09.810> so<00:05:10.810> basically<00:05:11.229> settings

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
absolute maximum so basically settings

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.990 
absolute maximum so basically settings
I've<00:05:11.830> changed<00:05:12.099> is<00:05:12.520> vehicle<00:05:13.180> PLL<00:05:14.099> drm<00:05:15.099> voltages

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
I've changed is vehicle PLL drm voltages

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.760 
I've changed is vehicle PLL drm voltages
CPU<00:05:19.000> multiplier<00:05:19.710> 253<00:05:22.169> I've<00:05:23.169> disabled

CPU multiplier 253 I've disabled

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.719 
CPU multiplier 253 I've disabled
Sydney's<00:05:24.250> spread<00:05:24.669> spectrum<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.630> I've

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
Sydney's spread spectrum and I've

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.610 
Sydney's spread spectrum and I've
increased<00:05:27.729> all<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.419> vrm<00:05:28.960> settings<00:05:29.349> to<00:05:29.530> the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
increased all the vrm settings to the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.250 
increased all the vrm settings to the
absolute<00:05:29.979> maximum<00:05:30.659> so<00:05:31.659> five<00:05:31.930> point<00:05:32.199> three

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260

gigahertz if I progress any further than
this<00:05:34.659> I'll<00:05:35.110> make<00:05:36.070> another<00:05:36.310> video<00:05:36.550> I<00:05:36.909> think<00:05:37.840> the

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
this I'll make another video I think the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.870 
this I'll make another video I think the
maximum<00:05:38.560> that<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:38.800> could<00:05:39.009> boot<00:05:39.220> into<00:05:39.430> windows
