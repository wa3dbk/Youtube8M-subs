00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi, people are going to make a video of a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.850
 recipe very easy this recipe in 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.740
 It's true of my cousin that he taught 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.540
 for my mother and my mother did it once 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.580
 here at home and it was very good 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 So I asked to teach how to do it too. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 He did not pass the prescription for whatsapp 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.430
 even then it is quite easy to do so 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 few ingredients were there several times 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.710
 here on the internet all were well 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.330
 complicated to do separate strike 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.310
 This is very easy but if you are the most 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.800
 New you can do it too. 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.449
 It's very easy so let's learn and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 Thank you, my trio, for being 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.050
 shared in recipes for things 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 I like that you will need milk. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.559
 condensed biscuit masena cream 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.420
 milk in the funchal and a little milk in the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.750
 The first step my cousin taught was 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 water the cracker in the milk and in the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.940
 I will only do the experiment that 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.160
 I look only at the river-are first axis was 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.290
 put a layer of sour cream to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.310
 I beat you the most time. 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.410
 but rest 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.870
 [Music] 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.729
 Japan wants a layer of biscuit 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:14.620
 Now I'm going to add another layer of bread. 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:16.420
 of milk plus a layer of discussing the 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.320
 people are doing this until you 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.180
 your fort 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.770
 then people after mounting a layer 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.350
 a layer of cream 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.550
 here in case my cookie ended then 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.530
 I could not finish 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.690
 I recommend that you use two packages 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.430
 to get quite a half pack 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.360
 will also depend on the size of your 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.250
 not right 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.050
 and now we're going to do the part of the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.550
 chocolate filling that will be a 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.200
 common brigadier 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.270
 the common brigadeiro only a little more 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.310
 I put a spoonful of 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.610
 margarine not to stick to the bottom you 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.070
 panel live on people will only tinker up 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 why become a brigadeiro myself? 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.369
 I used countries that can use any 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.960
 chocolate, right? 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.210
 so I think everybody brigadeiro 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.250
 know how I'm going to skip the video now 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.350
 because I'm filming as the monica and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.350
 messing with the other and coming back 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.629
 [Music] 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.299
 such people I left from day to day 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.700
 another is ready to face him not 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.739
 got the best because chocolate 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.200
 It was burning so I had to take it. 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.200
 it was very soft the chocolate came down 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.090
 only the taste in August to really provide 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.400
 as if they had been the one to see 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.290
 with his voice with hours doing but was 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.700
 very quick to do and I can guarantee 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.590
 that was very good 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.180
 is not it a people you try to do in 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.069
 home that you do not forget to 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.870
 comments under the things of a 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.340
 way to do a little different 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.560
 comment below how do you 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.799
 make a kiss for the game and until the next 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.799
 video
