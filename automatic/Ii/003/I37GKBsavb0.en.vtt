of September there was an issue about
management<00:00:16.680> matters<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.160> which<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.460> were

management matters in which we were

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.939 
management matters in which we were

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
and this is sort of where we've got to

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.640 
and this is sort of where we've got to
really<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> Missouri<00:00:24.840> creamy<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.240 

and<00:00:38.420> what<00:00:39.290> you<00:00:39.350> can<00:00:39.530> see<00:00:39.710> it<00:00:39.860> doesn't<00:00:40.040> look<00:00:40.190> a

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
and what you can see it doesn't look a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610 
and what you can see it doesn't look a
little<00:00:40.370> bit<00:00:40.580> odd<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:41.110> somebody<00:00:42.110> who's<00:00:42.260> used<00:00:42.500> to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
little bit odd to somebody who's used to

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.950 
little bit odd to somebody who's used to
seeing<00:00:42.860> very<00:00:43.130> nice<00:00:43.310> flat<00:00:43.610> fields<00:00:44.030> but<00:00:44.720> as<00:00:44.840> you

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
seeing very nice flat fields but as you

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.490 
seeing very nice flat fields but as you
get<00:00:45.140> down<00:00:45.410> in<00:00:45.770> amongst<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:47.440> amongst<00:00:48.440> the

get down in amongst the amongst the

get down in amongst the amongst the
tilth<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:49.040> can<00:00:49.220> see<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.640> there<00:00:49.790> is<00:00:49.910> very

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
tilth you can see that there is very

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.479 
tilth you can see that there is very
little<00:00:50.300> trash<00:00:50.840> sort<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.800> where<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.040> seeds<00:00:52.309> are

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
little trash sort of where the seeds are

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.650 
little trash sort of where the seeds are
going<00:00:52.580> to<00:00:52.670> come<00:00:52.850> up<00:00:52.970> through<00:00:53.150> in<00:00:53.330> this<00:00:53.450> sort<00:00:53.630> of

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
going to come up through in this sort of

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.790 
going to come up through in this sort of
band<00:00:54.020> zone<00:00:54.440> area<00:00:55.960> all<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.110> trash<00:00:57.350> seems<00:00:57.620> have

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
band zone area all the trash seems have

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.140 
band zone area all the trash seems have
been<00:00:57.950> parted<00:00:58.430> into<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.760> top<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.090> these

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
been parted into the top of these

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.880 
been parted into the top of these
bridges<00:01:00.970> whether<00:01:01.970> that's<00:01:02.180> good<00:01:02.390> or<00:01:02.510> bad<00:01:02.890> I've

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
bridges whether that's good or bad I've

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.130 
bridges whether that's good or bad I've
yet<00:01:04.190> to<00:01:04.220> see<00:01:04.400> Martin<00:01:04.820> says<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:05.930> good

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
yet to see Martin says that it's good

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.590 
yet to see Martin says that it's good
because<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.010> know<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:08.000> trash<00:01:08.270> has<00:01:08.450> been

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
because you know the trash has been

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.200 
because you know the trash has been
removed<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.350> seed<00:01:10.090> hasn't<00:01:11.090> got

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
removed so the seed hasn't got

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.719 
removed so the seed hasn't got
competition<00:01:11.840> as<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:11.990> comes<00:01:12.290> through<00:01:12.729> you

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
competition as it comes through you

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.490 
competition as it comes through you
could<00:01:13.910> also<00:01:14.030> argue<00:01:14.270> on<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.930> other<00:01:15.050> side<00:01:15.290> that

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
could also argue on the other side that

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.760 
could also argue on the other side that
that<00:01:15.530> is<00:01:15.860> a<00:01:15.890> haven<00:01:16.430> for<00:01:16.840> slugs<00:01:17.840> especially<00:01:18.500> if

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
that is a haven for slugs especially if

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.380 
that is a haven for slugs especially if
we're<00:01:19.130> going<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.430> well<00:01:19.729> if<00:01:19.759> we<00:01:19.910> don't<00:01:20.119> roll<00:01:20.330> it

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
we're going to well if we don't roll it

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.010 
we're going to well if we don't roll it
I<00:01:20.690> think<00:01:20.869> we<00:01:20.960> probably<00:01:21.200> will<00:01:21.500> roll<00:01:21.800> it<00:01:23.020> but

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
I think we probably will roll it but

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.770 
I think we probably will roll it but
whether<00:01:24.140> we<00:01:24.229> can<00:01:24.470> get<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.710> consolidation<00:01:25.780> to

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
whether we can get the consolidation to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.859 
whether we can get the consolidation to
reduce<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.320> slugs<00:01:27.619> mobility<00:01:28.690> with<00:01:29.690> these

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
reduce the slugs mobility with these

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.780 
reduce the slugs mobility with these
ridges<00:01:30.290> actually<00:01:30.649> kind<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.310> holding<00:01:31.670> the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
ridges actually kind of holding the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.520 
ridges actually kind of holding the
rolls<00:01:32.000> up<00:01:32.270> from<00:01:32.509> where<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.810> seed<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.200> actually

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
rolls up from where the seed is actually

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.760 
rolls up from where the seed is actually
in<00:01:33.619> contact<00:01:33.830> with<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.310> soil<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:36.229> we<00:01:36.619> shall

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
in contact with the soil so we shall

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.260 
in contact with the soil so we shall
wait<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.070> see<00:01:37.160> how<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.640> develops<00:01:40.120> but<00:01:41.120> other

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
wait and see how that develops but other

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.170 
wait and see how that develops but other
than<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:42.100> yeah<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:43.280> looking<00:01:43.610> quite<00:01:44.150> good

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
than that yeah it's looking quite good

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.940 
than that yeah it's looking quite good
the<00:01:44.780> other<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.200> other<00:01:45.320> part<00:01:45.530> of<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:45.740> field

the other the other part of the field
which<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:46.970> actually<00:01:47.060> drilled<00:01:47.450> probably<00:01:47.930> 10

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
which we actually drilled probably 10

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.420 
which we actually drilled probably 10
days<00:01:48.350> ago<00:01:48.620> it's<00:01:48.920> just<00:01:48.950> starting<00:01:49.520> to<00:01:49.549> emerge

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
days ago it's just starting to emerge

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.250 
days ago it's just starting to emerge
this<00:01:52.430> whole<00:01:52.670> field<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.060> filled<00:01:53.630> by<00:01:54.200> the

this whole field is filled by the

this whole field is filled by the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
headland which we sort of cultivated

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.109 
headland which we sort of cultivated
with<00:01:56.720> the<00:01:56.810> top<00:01:56.990> down<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:57.790> then<00:01:58.790> drilled

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
with the top down and then drilled

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.370 
with the top down and then drilled
straight<00:01:59.240> into<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.560> middle<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.010> field

straight into it the middle of the field
has<00:02:03.380> just<00:02:03.590> had<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.799> rape<00:02:04.010> stubble<00:02:04.280> topped<00:02:04.729> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
has just had the rape stubble topped and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.420 
has just had the rape stubble topped and
we<00:02:05.960> pulled<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.290> rake<00:02:06.470> over<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.070> try<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
we pulled the rake over it to try and
