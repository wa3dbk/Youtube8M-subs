00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.029
 welcome ladies and gentlemen this is a new one 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 video and I want to say a few things quickly 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.469
 to you want a few come over you 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.240
 price structure of that co-sponsor 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.620
 I passed that on 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.210
 I said Jewish people of this 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.020
 not a little too expensive maybe something 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.400
 better 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.070
 I passed that on 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.420
 having to say that if there is something 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.180
 keep on giving someone I would 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.140
 twitter that it was sewn if you didn't 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.789
 get right 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.410
 Keep that in mind 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.820
 probably within 12 hours 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 what you don't worry about the crotch 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 delivery that will come 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 and if you go to those 12 you are not yet with him 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.059
 marieke says especially to me at the same time 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.770
 pass along 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.180
 well what I am surprised this is by the way 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 deemed ass looks is my idea for this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.879
 problem also some this is what i play 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.410
 or screen 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.090
 for people asking you stuff all that yes 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.620
 of course because what's our point of it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 currier man of such you all simulate 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.950
 I don't think that would be interesting 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 ca n't do it yet 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.059
 let me put it that way 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.219
 I would like to ask is I 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.020
 anyway so i upload this kind of videos 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.589
 more often and I often keep it ultimate 10 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.830
 june i would like in the comments and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.799
 girls see what you at my 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.409
 channel still want to see and what i left 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.350
 must do because i prefer what i am 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.479
 evidence speaks to one or two series 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 that are really good quality and 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.619
 what people like to watch because of me 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.270
 really throw out a lot of nonsense 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.700
 that just isn't worth it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.479
 because I don't want a video just like that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.640
 upload 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.320
 of which i think oh god yes i have one 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
 video uploaded i'm done i'm ready 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 wants to feel that people are the to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.000
 want to watch 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.170
 I think that's important so I want 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.409
 like to know what you do 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.909
 want to see what is not and what i might be 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.340
 has to change 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.799
 do me a favor and think carefully about it 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.740
 because I also always have a pair 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.299
 so people who were really well-founded could 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.670
 leave behind and I can do more with that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.079
 because I know what people want 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.719
 see and what not 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.060
 or what else needs to be done about something and what 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.439
 is all right 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.119
 I can do something with that you can 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.640
 then the long term of course also something 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 and yes I want that clear 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.680
 to have 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.479
 I also hope you like this kind of videos 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.540
 and how can i appreciate me 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.550
 this time want to use it for 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.170
 this kind of comment is " 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.670
 next time I would also have a play with 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.860
 but do I now this shows 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.150
 how thieme stands and the like 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.100

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.740
 but well let us know through one 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.480
 response if this video can have 100 likes 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.720
 pick it up so this chill are the reason that 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.510
 I ask because I see that 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.340
 as a sign of its constancy of 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.260
 if three jodocus is good and what is not 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.210

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.580
