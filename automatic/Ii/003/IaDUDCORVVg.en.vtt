00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
time ago and I didn't take it out of the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.060 
time ago and I didn't take it out of the
package<00:00:39.149> until<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.510> month<00:00:39.719> or<00:00:39.989> two<00:00:40.170> ago<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.710> have

liked it a lot actually
I<00:00:42.719> hate<00:00:43.290> coiling<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.890> hose<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.850> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I hate coiling a hose up I don't know if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
I hate coiling a hose up I don't know if
I'm<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.149> bad<00:00:45.329> at<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:45.840> what<00:00:46.079> what<00:00:46.379> about

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
those things that actually roll a hose

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.260 
those things that actually roll a hose
up<00:00:49.050> for<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.590> oh<00:00:49.800> yeah<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.730> used<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.120> one

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
up for you oh yeah we used to have one

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.029 
up for you oh yeah we used to have one
of<00:00:51.300> those<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.930> would<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.649> didn't<00:00:52.890> seem<00:00:52.980> to

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
of those but it would it didn't seem to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
of those but it would it didn't seem to
roll<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> up<00:00:53.730> very<00:00:54.000> nice<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.420> would<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
roll it up very nice it would get you

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.779 
roll it up very nice it would get you
get<00:00:55.110> kinks<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.890> stuff<00:00:56.100> like<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.520> okay

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
get kinks in it and stuff like that okay

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.400 
get kinks in it and stuff like that okay
since<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.449> didn't<00:00:57.750> like<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.870> either

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
since I didn't like that either

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.709 
since I didn't like that either
but<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.609> don't<00:00:59.730> have<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.180> little

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
but this you don't have all that little

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
but this you don't have all that little
all<00:01:01.199> those<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.559> kinks<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.039> spinny<00:01:02.430> things

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
all those little kinks and spinny things

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.060 
all those little kinks and spinny things
in<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.629> kind<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.899> pull<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.860> up

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
in it so you just kind of pull it up

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.250 
in it so you just kind of pull it up
like<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> rope<00:01:05.489> basically<00:01:06.119> mm-hmm<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.110> lot

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
like a rope basically mm-hmm it's a lot

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
like a rope basically mm-hmm it's a lot
shorter<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.189> expands<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> get

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
shorter because it expands when you get

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.850 
shorter because it expands when you get
water<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.200> once<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> turn<00:01:10.710> it

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
water in there and then once you turn it

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.359 
water in there and then once you turn it
off<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.689> coils<00:01:13.470> itself<00:01:13.590> back<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.189> like

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
off it the coils itself back up like

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.249 
off it the coils itself back up like
this<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.729> scrunches<00:01:15.150> up<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.869> forces

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
this and scrunches up and that forces

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
this and scrunches up and that forces
most<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.830> water<00:01:17.009> out<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.670> have

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
most of the water out so you don't have

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.760 
most of the water out so you don't have
to<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.240> drain<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> Hosemann<00:01:19.049> very<00:01:19.530> much

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to actually drain the Hosemann very much

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.770 
to actually drain the Hosemann very much
when<00:01:19.950> you're<00:01:20.070> done<00:01:20.189> either<00:01:20.420> interesting<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
when you're done either interesting it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.190 
when you're done either interesting it
comes<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.170> plastic<00:01:23.000> ends<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> which

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
comes with plastic ends on it which

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.950 
comes with plastic ends on it which
might<00:01:25.770> probably<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:27.000> some<00:01:27.299> durability

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
might probably have some durability

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.679 
might probably have some durability
issues<00:01:28.080> down<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> line<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.270> far<00:01:30.479> they've

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
issues down the line but so far they've

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480 
issues down the line but so far they've
held<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> water<00:01:31.350> they've<00:01:31.710> sealed<00:01:32.100> really

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
held the water they've sealed really

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.340 
held the water they've sealed really
well<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.939> there's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> little<00:01:33.750> valve<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
well and there's a little valve on the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.969 
well and there's a little valve on the
end<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.860> okay<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.630> close<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
end of it okay that you can close it

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.649 
end of it okay that you can close it
turn<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> water<00:01:38.250> off<00:01:38.400> from<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> business<00:01:39.450> end

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
turn the water off from the business end

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.889 
turn the water off from the business end
of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.840> hose<00:01:40.460> business<00:01:41.460> end<00:01:41.700> okay<00:01:42.180> several

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
of the hose business end okay several

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.560 
of the hose business end okay several
times<00:01:43.340> I've<00:01:44.340> used<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.610> with<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> power<00:01:44.939> washer

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
times I've used it with a power washer

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
times I've used it with a power washer
and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.110> used<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.740> doing<00:01:46.979> all

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and then just used it for like doing all

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.370 
and then just used it for like doing all
you<00:01:47.310> stuff<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you stuff and it's it's really good so

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.710 
you stuff and it's it's really good so
much<00:01:49.500> easier<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.130> away<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:51.270> out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
much easier to put away and take out

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.020 
much easier to put away and take out
then<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> big<00:01:52.740> hose<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.399> storage

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
then then a big hose and just storage

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.490 
then then a big hose and just storage
space<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.509> mean<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.990> takes<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.350> almost

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
space I mean this thing takes up almost
