and I'll show you how to do that in a
second<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.420> also<00:01:15.689> repositionable<00:01:16.640> over

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
second it's also repositionable over

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.249 
second it's also repositionable over
time<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.479> reason<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.140> to

Wally back on so let me show you how to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.240 
Wally back on so let me show you how to
go<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.579> my<00:01:33.360> perception<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.680> adding

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
go from my perception to adding

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
go from my perception to adding
alternities<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.329> feel<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.840> need

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
alternities it if you feel like you need

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
alternities it if you feel like you need
to<00:01:37.020> use<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.560> most<00:01:37.950> people<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.340> fine

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
to use this most people will be fine

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
to use this most people will be fine
with<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> mic<00:01:39.030> reception<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:40.320> really<00:01:40.590> easy

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
with the mic reception it's really easy

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
with the mic reception it's really easy
to<00:01:40.979> add<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:42.000> only<00:01:42.240> goes<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:43.110> because

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
to add it only goes on one way because

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
to add it only goes on one way because
of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.799> shape<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.820> not<00:01:45.240> right<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.780> is

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
of the shape this is not right this is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.069 
of the shape this is not right this is
correct<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.490> remove<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:47.880> clear<00:01:48.780> layer

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
correct you just remove that clear layer

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.190 
correct you just remove that clear layer
from<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.500> micro<00:01:49.890> section<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.600> then<00:01:51.600> remove

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
from the micro section and then remove

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.350 
from the micro section and then remove
the<00:01:52.439> backing<00:01:52.649> from<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> alternative<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
the backing from the alternative and
