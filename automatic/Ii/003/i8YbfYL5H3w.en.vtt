want to let your lips relax into the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
want to let your lips relax into the
center<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> product<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.359> make<00:00:31.109> sure<00:00:31.289> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
center of the product and make sure that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.959 
center of the product and make sure that
they're<00:00:31.619> not<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:32.160> around<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.640> solid

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
they're not just around the solid

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.709 
they're not just around the solid
surface<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> today<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> technique<00:00:36.480> I'll<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
surface so today the technique I'll be

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.410 
surface so today the technique I'll be
using<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> essentially<00:00:37.920> get<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.399> suction<00:00:39.000> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
using is I essentially get a suction and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.840 
using is I essentially get a suction and
hold<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.350> approximately<00:00:41.280> twenty<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
hold it for approximately twenty to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.709 
hold it for approximately twenty to
thirty<00:00:42.090> seconds

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
thirty seconds

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
thirty seconds
and<00:00:42.809> then<00:00:43.649> along<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.070> way<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.610> stop<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and then along the way you can stop and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.029 
and then along the way you can stop and
spot<00:00:45.510> check<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.500> reach<00:00:46.770> desired

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
spot check to see if you reach desired

00:00:47.039 --> 00:02:16.350 
spot check to see if you reach desired
fullness<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.210> I'll<00:00:48.510> show<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.719> now

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.809 

okay<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.659> I<00:02:17.930> would<00:02:18.500> maybe<00:02:18.860> normally<00:02:19.489> let<00:02:19.670> this

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
okay so I would maybe normally let this

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.360 
okay so I would maybe normally let this
go<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.060> maybe<00:02:20.450> five<00:02:20.840> more<00:02:21.080> seconds<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.159> just

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
go for maybe five more seconds but just

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.130 
go for maybe five more seconds but just
for<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.610> video<00:02:22.879> I'll<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.750> start<00:02:23.989> this

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
for the video I'll just start this

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.850 
for the video I'll just start this
process<00:02:24.500> now<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:26.659> now<00:02:26.840> I'm<00:02:27.080> going<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.349> use<00:02:27.560> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
process now so now I'm going to use the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.280 
process now so now I'm going to use the
small<00:02:28.190> oval<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:28.760> target<00:02:29.209> specific<00:02:29.299> areas<00:02:30.019> I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290

like to give myself a bit more of a
cupid<00:02:33.080> upper<00:02:33.440> lip<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:34.580> what<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> do<00:02:35.180> for<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.569> is

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
cupid upper lip so what I do for that is

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.809 
cupid upper lip so what I do for that is
I<00:02:35.930> take<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.319> small<00:02:36.560> oval<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.129> I<00:02:37.549> turn<00:02:37.790> it

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
I take the small oval and I turn it

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.270 
I take the small oval and I turn it
vertically<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.660> then<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.349> try<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.650> target<00:02:39.920> just

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
vertically and then I try to target just

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.289 
vertically and then I try to target just
the<00:02:40.430> center<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.239> my<00:02:41.510> top<00:02:41.780> lip<00:02:42.049> like<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.620> I

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
the center of my top lip like this so I

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.509 
the center of my top lip like this so I
try<00:02:47.299> to<00:02:47.360> get<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.780> bottom<00:02:48.560> lip<00:02:48.739> just<00:02:49.190> slightly

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
try to get my bottom lip just slightly

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.839 
try to get my bottom lip just slightly
around<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.569> bottom<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.110> that<00:02:51.920> only<00:02:52.190> my<00:02:52.549> top

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
around the bottom so that only my top

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.720 
around the bottom so that only my top
lip<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.390> lightly<00:02:53.980> within<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.099> center<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.609> the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
lip is lightly within the center of the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:38.650 
lip is lightly within the center of the
product<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.239> this

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.540 

and<00:03:38.840> as<00:03:39.320> you<00:03:39.470> look<00:03:39.710> if<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.040> think<00:03:40.340> that

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
and as you look if you think that

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.310 
and as you look if you think that
they're<00:03:40.700> just<00:03:41.000> still<00:03:41.300> not<00:03:41.480> exactly<00:03:41.690> what<00:03:42.200> you

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
they're just still not exactly what you

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.560 
they're just still not exactly what you
want<00:03:42.560> you<00:03:43.160> can<00:03:43.310> take<00:03:43.460> the<00:03:43.640> same<00:03:43.850> small<00:03:44.180> oval

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
want you can take the same small oval

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.110 
want you can take the same small oval
and<00:03:44.780> then<00:03:45.350> also<00:03:45.650> do<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.010> horizontally<00:03:46.640> like

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and then also do it horizontally like

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:57.220 
and then also do it horizontally like
this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.780 

so<00:03:58.230> this<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.620> probably<00:03:58.950> about<00:03:59.280> where<00:03:59.490> I<00:03:59.550> would

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
so this is probably about where I would

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.230 
so this is probably about where I would
stop<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.900> then<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.790> normally<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:02.940> put<00:04:03.120> on<00:04:03.210> a

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
stop and then I normally just put on a

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.480 
stop and then I normally just put on a
bit<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.480> chapstick<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:06.560> I'm<00:04:07.560> good<00:04:07.920> to<00:04:07.950> go<00:04:08.070> for

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
bit of chapstick and I'm good to go for

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.510 
bit of chapstick and I'm good to go for
a<00:04:09.360> couple<00:04:09.930> hours

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.370 

so<00:04:15.000> like<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.270> said<00:04:15.450> before<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:15.960> the<00:04:16.080> sake<00:04:16.260> of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
so like I said before for the sake of

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.750 
so like I said before for the sake of
the<00:04:16.500> video<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:17.010> didn't<00:04:17.220> want<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.400> let<00:04:17.520> it<00:04:17.610> run

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
the video I didn't want to let it run

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.400 
the video I didn't want to let it run
the<00:04:17.880> whole<00:04:18.000> time<00:04:18.210> but<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.020> you're<00:04:19.170> curious

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
the whole time but if you're curious

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.830 
the whole time but if you're curious
I'll<00:04:19.890> show<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.160> just<00:04:20.580> using<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.240> for<00:04:21.270> maybe<00:04:21.540> a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
I'll show you just using it for maybe a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:05:47.440 
I'll show you just using it for maybe a
minute<00:04:22.230> how<00:04:22.410> big<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.710> can<00:04:22.890> get<00:04:22.980> my<00:04:23.100> lips

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.460 

so<00:05:47.930> I<00:05:47.960> think<00:05:48.080> it's<00:05:48.590> been<00:05:48.770> about<00:05:49.070> a<00:05:49.130> minute<00:05:49.550> now

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
so I think it's been about a minute now

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.470 
so I think it's been about a minute now
so<00:05:51.470> now<00:05:51.650> I'm<00:05:51.860> going<00:05:51.980> to<00:05:52.070> use<00:05:52.100> my<00:05:52.340> little<00:05:52.820> tiny

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
so now I'm going to use my little tiny

00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:48.729 
so now I'm going to use my little tiny
small<00:05:53.660> oval<00:05:54.200> and<00:05:54.530> go<00:05:55.220> like<00:05:55.340> this

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:48.739 

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:51.429 

so<00:06:49.739> this<00:06:49.979> is<00:06:50.129> probably<00:06:50.459> as<00:06:50.580> big<00:06:50.789> as<00:06:50.879> I<00:06:50.969> would<00:06:51.149> go

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:51.439 
so this is probably as big as I would go

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:55.309 
so this is probably as big as I would go
just<00:06:52.439> out<00:06:52.619> of<00:06:52.649> personal<00:06:52.979> preference<00:06:53.580> um<00:06:54.319> but

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
just out of personal preference um but

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.079 
just out of personal preference um but
like<00:06:55.559> I<00:06:55.709> said<00:06:55.769> play<00:06:56.309> around<00:06:56.549> with<00:06:56.699> it<00:06:56.849> and<00:06:57.029> see

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.089 
like I said play around with it and see
