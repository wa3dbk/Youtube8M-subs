 master this time I come to you 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.160
 bringing a new part of how 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.320
 accelerate internet to the maximum and without 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.880
 programs I hope you like it and that what 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.420
 enjoy 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.420
 Y 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 to increase the speed of access to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.850
 http servers and display the pages 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.100
 faster web we can modify 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 some values in the editor of the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.300
 record that correspond to the number of 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.579
 simultaneous demands for access to a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 server for it the first thing we go 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.780
 to do is to inform the description 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.670
 of the video where you can find a 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.460
 link to download winrar file 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.380
 that they can find through 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.290
 media parents or post and files you 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.580
 download it from wherever you prefer 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.410
 once you have downloaded it as 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.600
 see disappear this file winrar 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.190
 compressed in which you are going to click 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 right and extract here and as we will see no 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.600
 will leave this notebook in which 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.820
 contains all the instructions that 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.619
 we will follow step by step once having 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.020
 the notebook what we are going to do is 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.720
 press the windows key 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 agr and as we will see, the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.310
 window to run here we go 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.880
 to write repeat 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.649
 and we will accept if we see a 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.350
 window we will give ketty to give permissions 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.149
 of administrator once the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.659
 registry editor what are we going to do 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:58.289
 is to display the key current folder 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.479
 user and we are going to look for the folder of 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.460
 software once we have it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.130
 unfolded we are going to select the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.360
 microsoft folder as we will see here 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.149
 is and we are going to look for the folder called 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.980
 windows 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 once we have found the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.510
 we are going to deploy and we are going to deploy the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.310
 first folder called runs in 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.950
 version where we are going to look for the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.420
 folder called internet settings a 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.189
 once we have selected it as 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.470
 we will see next we will appear all the 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.709
 values ​​that have what we are going to do 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.560
 us is to right click on a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.670
 blank space and we will select 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.549
 new and word value 32 bits does not matter 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.270
 that your operating system is 32 or 64 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.280
 bits should always select 32 bits 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.040
 and as we will see, a new 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.580
 value what we are going to do is go to 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.970
 notebook and copy the first name 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.770
 called more connection per server once 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.230
 that we have copied it, let's give it 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.870
 Right click on the value that we have created and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.330
 change name and we're going to click on 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.040
 where it says hit and we are going to give to accept 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.560
 once we have created what we are going 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.410
 to do is double- click on it and go to 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.800
 select the final base and 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.440
 we will write the value 20 once done 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.390
 this how to click on accept now what 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.640
 What we are going to do is click again 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.470
 in a blank space and we will give new 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.810
 the words 32 bits again and we'll go 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.790
 new to the notebook and we will copy the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.970
 second name we have here called 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.190
 max connection per server and then click 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.710
 right and copy once we have 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.569
 copied, let's change the name to 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.459
 new value that we create 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.049
 and we will accept once we have 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.840
 created the second value what we're going to 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.760
 do is open it and we will select 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.439
 again the decimal base and 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.349
 we will write 20 and we will accept 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.120
 Once all this is done we can access with 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.579
 greater speed to the servers 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.659
 http and we will be able to visualize the pages 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.659
 web faster than before 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.250
 another method to accelerate internet is 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.800
 use some commands to execute 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.530
 the ip release and clean records 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.720
 since we have saved for 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.150
 what we are going to do is click 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.580
 right on the desk and we're going to 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:26.350
 select new and text document 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.720
 Once the text document created as 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.290
 what we are going to do is open it and here 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:38.790
 we will write ipconfig slack space 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.790
 read 6 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.210
 with this command we can 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.580
 execute the ip release on the 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.690
 Internet protocol configuration 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.640
 version 6 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.100
 now let's give an enter and 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:55.650
 we will write down again again type 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:57.320
 confine flash space and we will write 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.400
 flowing 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.400
 from ene efe 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.250
 and with this command we can eliminate the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.010
 dns records that we have saved 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.830
 in our computer these commands 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.320
 you can find in the blog notes that 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.290
 I have left them to download as 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.590
 we will see here is and will have a 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.240
 brief description next side once 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.670
 we have written all commands what 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.100
 let's do is give it where it says 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.100
 file and save as 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.970
 and here we will put the name that 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.620
 we want in this case I'm going to put 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.620
 accelerate internet 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.820
 and at the end we will write dot bat 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.000
 It is important that you fix and put the 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.900
 extension next to the name they have 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 written you 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.590
 Once this is done, what they are going to do is 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.880
 give them clicks where it says save 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.470
 and you can close this notebook 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.390
 once they have closed the notebook 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.610
 notes as we will see below we 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.610
 will appear the dot bat file that we have 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.820
 created in which we what 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.500
 we must do is double click and as 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.650
 we will see the window of 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.730
 smd and it will close automatically 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.560
 eliminating tns records that 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.890
 we had saved and running the 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.920
 ip release over configuration of 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.200
 internet protocol version 6 this 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.780
 they should do it every time they feel that 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.400
 your inmate is becoming slow 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.500
 using this will accelerate it 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.950
 automatically I also recommend 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.740
 that this method is also used 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:43.540
 with the method of reflex and p that we have 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.070
 created in the third part of how 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.520
 accelerate internet to the maximum and without 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.710
 programs 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.650
 the video will be appearing on the screen 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.810
 and let him see very well once done 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.900
 all these changes in the editor 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:59.030
 record and having created the file 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.039
 dot bat what they should do now is 

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.919
 restart your computer so that 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.710
 changes emerge good effect that was it 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.819
