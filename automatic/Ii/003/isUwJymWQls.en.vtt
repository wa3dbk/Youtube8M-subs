hi Greg Kihn what's wrong I really want

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.910 
hi Greg Kihn what's wrong I really want
to<00:00:09.059> stay<00:00:09.240> in<00:00:09.270> the<00:00:09.420> brain<00:00:09.660> but<00:00:10.350> the<00:00:10.380> equipment's

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
to stay in the brain but the equipment's

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.709 
to stay in the brain but the equipment's
just<00:00:11.040> too<00:00:11.190> expensive<00:00:11.430> how<00:00:12.030> much<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.270> costume

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
just too expensive how much the costume

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.020 
just too expensive how much the costume
I'm<00:00:13.350> getting<00:00:13.620> cost<00:00:14.010> estimates<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.639> thirty<00:00:14.879> to

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I'm getting cost estimates of thirty to

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.970 
I'm getting cost estimates of thirty to
forty<00:00:15.299> thousand<00:00:15.690> dollars<00:00:15.990> do<00:00:16.230> my<00:00:16.350> report<00:00:16.500> hand

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
forty thousand dollars do my report hand

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.860 
forty thousand dollars do my report hand
you<00:00:17.220> can't<00:00:17.550> afford<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.030> I<00:00:18.360> can't<00:00:18.750> afford

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
you can't afford that I can't afford

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.190 
you can't afford that I can't afford
that<00:00:19.140> as<00:00:19.440> a<00:00:19.470> scientist<00:00:20.100> hey<00:00:20.250> well<00:00:21.120> you<00:00:21.930> tried

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
that as a scientist hey well you tried

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.030 
that as a scientist hey well you tried
this<00:00:22.790> what<00:00:23.790> is<00:00:23.940> that<00:00:24.120> it's<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.170> SpikerBox<00:00:25.560> Tim

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
this what is that it's the SpikerBox Tim

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.610 
this what is that it's the SpikerBox Tim
but<00:00:26.490> how<00:00:26.640> does<00:00:26.700> it<00:00:26.880> work<00:00:27.030> well<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:28.440> you<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.590> a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:28.620 
but how does it work well do you have a

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.470 
but how does it work well do you have a
half-caff<00:00:28.770> a<00:00:29.010> cockroach<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.730> by

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
half-caff a cockroach on you by

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.920 
half-caff a cockroach on you by
coincidence<00:00:30.810> i<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.730> we<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.879> two<00:00:33.149> American

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
coincidence i do we have two American

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.049 
coincidence i do we have two American
cockroaches<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:34.770> here<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.940> to

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
cockroaches right here so all we have to

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.509 
cockroaches right here so all we have to
do<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.629> remove<00:00:36.960> one<00:00:37.199> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> legs<00:00:37.530> uh-huh<00:00:38.219> and

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519 
do you remove one of the legs uh-huh and

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.029 
do you remove one of the legs uh-huh and
you<00:00:38.820> place<00:00:39.089> it<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.449> SpikerBox<00:00:39.929> and<00:00:40.440> then

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
you place it on the SpikerBox and then

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.299 
you place it on the SpikerBox and then
one<00:00:41.249> just<00:00:41.699> stick<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.269> and<00:00:42.420> forget<00:00:43.289> it<00:00:43.350> stick<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
one just stick it and forget it stick it

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.220 
one just stick it and forget it stick it
and<00:00:44.460> forget<00:00:44.909> it<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.480> how<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.809> know<00:00:45.899> you're

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
and forget it but how do I know you're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.599 
and forget it but how do I know you're
not<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.589> saying<00:00:46.859> you're<00:00:47.010> gonna<00:00:47.100> build<00:00:47.460> this

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
not just saying you're gonna build this

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.790 
not just saying you're gonna build this
well<00:00:47.940> Jim<00:00:48.120> let<00:00:48.300> me<00:00:48.390> show<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:49.440> actually

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
well Jim let me show you this actually

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.559 
well Jim let me show you this actually
the<00:00:49.890> functioning<00:00:50.460> prototype<00:00:50.699> come<00:00:51.210> on<00:00:51.329> let's

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:51.569 
the functioning prototype come on let's

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.880 
the functioning prototype come on let's
listen<00:00:53.510> sounds<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.569> spy<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.929> me<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.679> maybe

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
listen sounds like spy to me but maybe

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.889 
listen sounds like spy to me but maybe
it's<00:00:56.129> just<00:00:56.280> noise<00:00:56.640> well<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.300> tim<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.659> way

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it's just noise well this tim is a way

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.119 
it's just noise well this tim is a way
to<00:00:57.960> find<00:00:58.260> out<00:00:58.409> because<00:00:58.559> these<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.949> special

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to find out because these are special

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.549 
to find out because these are special
neurons<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.059> were<00:01:00.210> recording<00:01:00.690> from<00:01:00.899> these

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
neurons that were recording from these

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.259 
neurons that were recording from these
are<00:01:01.769> sensory<00:01:02.280> neurons<00:01:02.639> that<00:01:02.760> are<00:01:02.850> trying<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
are sensory neurons that are trying to

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.640 
are sensory neurons that are trying to
detect<00:01:03.539> wing<00:01:03.899> on<00:01:04.110> their<00:01:04.260> little<00:01:04.409> wind

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
detect wing on their little wind

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.649 
detect wing on their little wind
receptors<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.640> cockroach<00:01:06.000> leg<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
receptors on the cockroach leg so you

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
receptors on the cockroach leg so you
think<00:01:06.780> saying<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:07.740> maybe<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.250> blow<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
think saying that if maybe I blow on it

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.209 
think saying that if maybe I blow on it
I<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.689> hear<00:01:09.869> evoke<00:01:10.200> discharge<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
I can hear evoke discharge of you that

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.010 
I can hear evoke discharge of you that
is<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> great<00:01:11.640> experiment<00:01:12.090> let's<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:14.899> what<00:01:15.899> did

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
is a great experiment let's see what did

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.139 
is a great experiment let's see what did
you<00:01:16.140> notice<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.649> noticed<00:01:17.340> what<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.579> blew<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
you notice I noticed what I blew on the

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.730 
you notice I noticed what I blew on the
leg<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.600> rate<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> electrical<00:01:19.320> discharge

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
leg the rate of electrical discharge

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.740 
leg the rate of electrical discharge
increase<00:01:20.189> Tim<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.180> something<00:01:21.630> known

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
increase Tim this is a something known

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.139 
increase Tim this is a something known
as<00:01:21.780> great<00:01:22.380> coding<00:01:22.860> rate<00:01:23.189> coding<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.969> just

as great coding rate coding we just

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.670 
as great coding rate coding we just
discovered<00:01:24.450> rate<00:01:24.689> coding<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.350> much<00:01:25.530> did

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
discovered rate coding and how much did

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.100 
discovered rate coding and how much did
it<00:01:25.740> cost<00:01:25.799> us<00:01:26.280> Tim<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.090> SpikerBox<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.869> less

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it cost us Tim the SpikerBox is less

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
it cost us Tim the SpikerBox is less
than<00:01:28.289> one<00:01:28.530> hundred<00:01:28.799> dollars<00:01:29.369> less<00:01:29.880> than<00:01:30.090> a
