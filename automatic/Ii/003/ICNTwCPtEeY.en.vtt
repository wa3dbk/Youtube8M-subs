 sold out of the most and now I'm 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.170
 crawling in this universe of games and 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.440
 and I feel it is a market that is 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.290
 really destroying any kind of 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.630
 Media does not have the growth that 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.030

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.979

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.710

 Brazilian teams around the need to 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.060
 to excel in the tournament 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.340
 I think Brazil is okay. 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.400
 positioned today in a scenario within 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.530

 differentiated for those personnel who want 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.239
 content that is not only informative 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.670

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.459

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.480
 can greatly help the people who 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.920
 content 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.169
 I think it 's an important part of 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.069
 population of the world and we are 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.739

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.549

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:07.469
 that make content for us 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.480
 very personal influences then it is 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.670
 important and we are always 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.090

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.120
 stage of the super cool event in london 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.310

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 that the game is already there open beta rolando 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.719

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.129
 being very well closed by everybody 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.530
 because for the issue of marketing fight 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.959
 of action from the start of 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.489
 The team reacted very well and the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.769
 result was very good here in Brazil 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.989
 just like whip on 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.919
 I'm bad that jewelry is already in the rule 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.560
 already tested are you confused if you drank too much 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.530
 because, as a child, there is nothing 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.750
 arrogance do not talk I do blogs 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:02.819

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.310
 joaquim minecraft is and will drop 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.379
 little darling of heroes of widened not 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.989
 I'm already making highs 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.030
 Only you do not have to drop the game. 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.340
 memory type 10 minutes 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.570
 is in the qe of the laos and plays a match of 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.259
 two tone very khasawneh type is fast 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.110
 satisfactory 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:27.630
 Sex conquered in a little bal 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.060
 connected to the powder in placing a special 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.930
 blizzard puts the feet and dancing pi 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.449
 I spit now, I'm sorry for the fires. 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.970
 example in playing here we play game 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:44.330
 extended to us is not the ballads 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:48.810
 the ballad song does not understand the game 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.759
 I threw a land and you 're already doing 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.130
 content for the channel already heroes 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:54.539
 created in which you released a video do not know if 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.789
 threw more to the goal but I saw that it was 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.120
 making a medium of a guide by playing the 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.320
 I'm game I have a script including 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.070
 The kiss is not ready because I came. 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.030
 here 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.560
 the ballad youtube 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.230
 And like that, it's because the game is very 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.230
 different from other doodle modes 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.360
 of the others I do not know the name sorry 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.180
 Truth is, keep trying to remember. 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.550
 He who breaks the abbreviation yesterday, she tries 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.680
 remember this is very different 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.740
 so I do not get angry playing 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.190
 that being that the new staff was normal 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.590
 I do not know what it is that 's what the show is about. 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.960
 a half basic tutorial so half 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.940
 comprehensive when staff start 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.880
 to play already knowing brigade is already more 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.980
 quiet good'm playing more than hour 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.500
 You leave this event today. 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.860
 although a man car is not 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:55.120

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.120
