00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
here this is my red laser it's about 300

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.540 
here this is my red laser it's about 300
millivolts<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:40.960> built<00:03:41.960> it<00:03:42.110> up<00:03:42.230> all<00:03:42.710> myself

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
millivolts I built it up all myself

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
millivolts I built it up all myself
this<00:03:44.210> one<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.350> lenses<00:03:45.980> everything<00:03:46.580> and<00:03:46.820> a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
this one the lenses everything and a

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.490 
this one the lenses everything and a
word<00:03:47.810> up<00:03:49.360> connected<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.480> my<00:03:50.750> board

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
word up connected to my board

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.220 
word up connected to my board
I'm<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:52.400> regulating<00:03:53.330> my<00:03:53.600> current<00:03:54.110> here<00:03:54.530> and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
I'm just regulating my current here and

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.050 
I'm just regulating my current here and
I've<00:03:57.230> got<00:03:57.290> a<00:03:57.440> switch<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.250> temporary<00:03:58.670> switch

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
I've got a switch and a temporary switch

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.540 
I've got a switch and a temporary switch
so<00:03:59.240> I<00:03:59.300> can<00:03:59.480> turn<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.780> on<00:03:59.900> and<00:04:00.110> off<00:04:00.260> just<00:04:00.590> by

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
so I can turn it on and off just by

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.800 
so I can turn it on and off just by
holding<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:02.240> down<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:03.820> I'm<00:04:04.820> powering<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:05.570> with

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
holding it down I I'm powering it with

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.910 
holding it down I I'm powering it with
my<00:04:06.020> USB<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.660> cut<00:04:08.900> off<00:04:09.020> a<00:04:09.050> USB<00:04:09.380> from

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
my USB and just cut off a USB from

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.830 
my USB and just cut off a USB from
something<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.610> connected<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.480> it

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
something and connected to it

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.599 
something and connected to it
two<00:04:11.930> wires<00:04:12.200> 5<00:04:12.860> volt<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:14.000> enough<00:04:14.270> for<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:15.609> it's

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
two wires 5 volt it's enough for it it's

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.580 
two wires 5 volt it's enough for it it's
not<00:04:16.790> as<00:04:16.940> powerful<00:04:17.120> as<00:04:17.780> this<00:04:18.049> one<00:04:18.260> but<00:04:18.440> it's

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
not as powerful as this one but it's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.070 
not as powerful as this one but it's
beautiful<00:04:18.830> I<00:04:19.340> mean<00:04:19.390> it's<00:04:20.390> just<00:04:20.480> turning<00:04:20.930> on

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
beautiful I mean it's just turning on

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.490 
beautiful I mean it's just turning on
and<00:04:21.380> there<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.400> have<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.600> let<00:04:23.600> me<00:04:23.630> put<00:04:24.170> on<00:04:24.200> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
and there we have it let me put on the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.330 
and there we have it let me put on the
right<00:04:24.710> goggles<00:04:25.220> because<00:04:25.580> I've<00:04:25.700> got<00:04:27.250> there<00:04:28.250> we

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
right goggles because I've got there we

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.709 
right goggles because I've got there we
go<00:04:28.460> ok<00:04:29.360> so

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:31.719 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:38.249 

as<00:04:32.649> you<00:04:33.009> may<00:04:33.219> see<00:04:33.279> it's<00:04:33.939> burning<00:04:34.689> the<00:04:37.019> it's<00:04:38.019> out

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
as you may see it's burning the it's out

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.459 
as you may see it's burning the it's out
of<00:04:38.289> focus<00:04:38.649> actually<00:04:39.809> okay<00:04:40.809> there<00:04:40.989> we<00:04:41.110> go<00:04:41.229> it's

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:41.469 
of focus actually okay there we go it's

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:48.929 
of focus actually okay there we go it's
burning<00:04:41.949> to<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:45.329> to<00:04:46.329> the<00:04:46.449> case<00:04:47.699> should<00:04:48.699> put<00:04:48.909> a

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:48.939 
burning to the to the case should put a

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:54.749 
burning to the to the case should put a
metro<00:04:50.039> and<00:04:51.899> III<00:04:52.899> think<00:04:53.229> it<00:04:53.739> it<00:04:54.189> doesn't<00:04:54.610> burn

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
metro and III think it it doesn't burn

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:57.979 
metro and III think it it doesn't burn
the<00:04:54.819> stick<00:04:55.299> actually<00:04:55.779> because<00:04:56.409> it's<00:04:57.039> too<00:04:57.279> low

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:57.989 
the stick actually because it's too low

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:01.169 
the stick actually because it's too low
it<00:04:58.989> may<00:04:59.259> heat<00:05:00.039> it<00:05:00.159> up<00:05:00.249> a<00:05:00.399> little<00:05:00.519> bit<00:05:00.789> but<00:05:00.999> not<00:05:01.119> a

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:01.179 
it may heat it up a little bit but not a

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:06.389 
it may heat it up a little bit but not a
lot<00:05:01.449> but<00:05:01.929> if<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.229> put<00:05:02.469> in<00:05:02.889> front<00:05:04.919> at<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:05.949> top<00:05:06.069> of

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:06.399 
lot but if I put in front at the top of

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:27.629 
lot but if I put in front at the top of
it<00:05:06.629> up<00:05:26.429> okay

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
it up okay

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.569 
it up okay
wait<00:05:28.179> I've<00:05:29.169> got<00:05:29.439> a<00:05:29.469> solution<00:05:29.769> for<00:05:30.099> this<00:05:30.219> hold

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:30.579 
wait I've got a solution for this hold

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:31.159 
wait I've got a solution for this hold
on

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
on

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.469 
on
okay<00:05:32.169> so<00:05:32.649> we've<00:05:33.309> got<00:05:33.339> the<00:05:33.579> match<00:05:33.729> and<00:05:34.029> we've

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
okay so we've got the match and we've

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.929 
okay so we've got the match and we've
got<00:05:34.659> a<00:05:34.689> black<00:05:35.139> marker<00:05:35.679> let's<00:05:36.429> just<00:05:36.729> put

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939 
got a black marker let's just put

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:43.739 
got a black marker let's just put
something<00:05:37.449> on<00:05:37.719> it<00:05:37.749> and<00:05:42.179> this<00:05:43.179> should<00:05:43.449> do<00:05:43.629> the

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:43.749 
something on it and this should do the

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.079 
something on it and this should do the
job

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
job

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:58.009 
job
let's<00:05:46.089> try<00:05:46.389> it<00:05:46.449> out<00:05:47.099> so<00:05:48.099> turn<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.639> on<00:05:54.360> fine<00:05:55.360> and

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:58.019 

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:06.540 

put<00:05:59.019> it<00:05:59.169> on<00:05:59.289> the<00:05:59.469> right<00:06:01.529> place<00:06:04.439> and<00:06:05.439> there<00:06:06.429> we

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
put it on the right place and there we

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.869 
put it on the right place and there we
go

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:06.879 
go

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:12.149 
go
you<00:06:07.089> see<00:06:08.669> that's<00:06:09.669> because<00:06:10.059> the<00:06:10.589> the<00:06:11.589> match<00:06:11.829> was

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
you see that's because the the match was

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:15.149 
you see that's because the the match was
red<00:06:12.429> as<00:06:12.909> you<00:06:13.059> may<00:06:13.179> see<00:06:13.239> here<00:06:13.360> and<00:06:14.229> the<00:06:14.559> light<00:06:14.769> is

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
red as you may see here and the light is

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:20.549 
red as you may see here and the light is
also<00:06:15.729> red<00:06:16.149> and<00:06:16.599> what<00:06:17.259> happens<00:06:17.589> is<00:06:17.919> that<00:06:19.559> the

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:20.559 
also red and what happens is that the

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:25.069 
also red and what happens is that the
red<00:06:20.769> is<00:06:21.039> all<00:06:21.309> reflected<00:06:22.029> and<00:06:23.189> no<00:06:24.189> heat<00:06:24.909> is

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:25.079 
red is all reflected and no heat is
