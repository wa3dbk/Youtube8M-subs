pay-as-you-go<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.560> dual<00:00:16.949> SIM<00:00:17.310> card<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.150> when

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
pay-as-you-go a dual SIM card so when

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.960 
pay-as-you-go a dual SIM card so when
you<00:00:18.510> order<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> free<00:00:20.100> when<00:00:20.850> you

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
you order it this is a free when you

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.679 
you order it this is a free when you
order<00:00:21.410> you<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.650> SIM<00:00:23.519> card<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.269> kind<00:00:24.600> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
order you get a SIM card so this kind of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.920 
order you get a SIM card so this kind of
SIM<00:00:24.990> card<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.070> regular<00:00:26.609> type<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.599> like

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
SIM card is the regular type is like

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
SIM card is the regular type is like
this<00:00:28.260> type<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> center<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.330> called<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
this type but in the center is called a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.709 
this type but in the center is called a
micro<00:00:31.170> SIM<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.070> if<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.969> computer<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
micro SIM so you if you computer the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.870 
micro SIM so you if you computer the
micro<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:34.680> cut<00:00:34.890> off<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.340> part<00:00:35.399> or

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
micro see it just cut off this part or

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.209 
micro see it just cut off this part or
others<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.350> bigger<00:00:37.590> one

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
others is the bigger one

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.400 
others is the bigger one
the<00:00:38.520> normal<00:00:38.969> sim<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.629> big<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.170> Mike

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the normal sim is this big and Mike

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.500 
the normal sim is this big and Mike
Racine<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> smaller<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.300> already

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
Racine is smaller but this is already

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.619 
Racine is smaller but this is already
pre-cut<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> order<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.000> normal<00:00:45.390> one

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
pre-cut so when you order the normal one

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
pre-cut so when you order the normal one
you<00:00:45.989> get<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.379> either<00:00:46.890> way<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.489> will<00:00:47.610> work

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
you get this either way it will work

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.779 
you get this either way it will work
what<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.780> advantage<00:00:49.020> let's<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.219> they

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
what is the advantage let's see they

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.080 
what is the advantage let's see they
currently<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.539> some<00:00:51.780> promotion<00:00:52.590> $19<00:00:53.520> months

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
currently have some promotion $19 months

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.660 
currently have some promotion $19 months
but<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.719> only<00:00:54.930> until<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> end<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.039> April

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
but this is only until the end of April

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.119 
but this is only until the end of April
so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> should<00:00:57.660> ignore<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.320> just<00:00:58.620> look<00:00:58.980> at

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so you should ignore that just look at

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.180 
so you should ignore that just look at
the<00:00:59.309> regular<00:01:00.059> price<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.930> those<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.890> price

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the regular price so those are the price

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.000 
the regular price so those are the price
not<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.879> much<00:01:03.239> advantage<00:01:03.930> over<00:01:04.350> others

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
not that much advantage over others

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.359 
not that much advantage over others
similar<00:01:05.850> competitors<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
similar competitors but this I think is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
similar competitors but this I think is
pretty<00:01:08.520> good<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.420> good<00:01:09.780> reason<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.380> will

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
pretty good for good reason I will

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.870 
pretty good for good reason I will
discuss<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.520> their

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
discuss a little bit more their

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.630 
discuss a little bit more their
pay-as-you-go

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640

2008 for sensitize success per megabytes

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.840 
2008 for sensitize success per megabytes
this<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.740> pretty<00:01:20.009> good<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.549> I'll

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
this will be a pretty good one I'll

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.929 
this will be a pretty good one I'll
discuss<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> let's<00:01:22.110> focus<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:23.220> one<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
discuss that let's focus on one of the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.249 
discuss that let's focus on one of the
key<00:01:24.479> advantage<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> plan<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
key advantage one of the plan is

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.260 
key advantage one of the plan is
pay-as-you-go<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.100> two<00:01:29.369> cents<00:01:29.700> per<00:01:30.030> minute

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
pay-as-you-go so two cents per minute

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530 
pay-as-you-go so two cents per minute
for<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.960> voice<00:01:31.229> first<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.909> texts<00:01:33.390> and

six and for per megabyte this is the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.380 
six and for per megabyte this is the
cheapest<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> prepaid<00:01:38.009> market<00:01:38.579> compared

cheapest in the prepaid market compared
to<00:01:39.570> others<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.439> could<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.100> 5<00:01:41.700> cents<00:01:42.119> per

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
to others are could be 5 cents per

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.929 
to others are could be 5 cents per
minute<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:43.079> are<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.530> situation<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.670> good

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
minute what are the situation is good

minute what are the situation is good
for<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:45.720> example<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> really

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
for you for example you have a really

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.520 
for you for example you have a really
young<00:01:47.070> kids<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.060> school<00:01:48.570> after<00:01:48.810> their

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
young kids there in school after their

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.550 
young kids there in school after their
they<00:01:50.009> finish<00:01:50.430> school<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:51.180> call<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.049> to

they finish school they call you to to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.950 
they finish school they call you to to
arrange<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.220> pickup<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> call

arrange a pickup they just make a call
say<00:01:55.170> 1<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.530> 2<00:01:55.950> minutes<00:01:56.430> now<00:01:57.090> we'll<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> tooling

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
say 1 or 2 minutes now we'll the tooling

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
say 1 or 2 minutes now we'll the tooling
will<00:01:58.079> cost<00:01:58.320> two<00:01:58.829> cents<00:01:59.280> per<00:01:59.670> minutes<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.420> that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
will cost two cents per minutes so that
