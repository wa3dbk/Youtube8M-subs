00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.860
 the letter of a soldier 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 it's from the story of a soldier who 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.600
 will return home after having 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.380
 fought in vietnam called his parents 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.150
 please I would like to take a friend 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.540

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.850
 I would love to meet you but there is something that 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.480
 they should know he has been strongly 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 injured in combat he tripped over a mine and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.820
 he lost an arm and a leg and he has no 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.090
 where to go and I want him to go live with 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.230
 we 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.460
 it hurts us to open his son 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.850
 possibly we can find some 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.340
 Where can I live? 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.000
 have you understood I want you to live with 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.670
 our son said you do not know what you're 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.890
 asking someone with a problem like that 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.410
 It could be a terrible hindrance to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.990
 we have to live our 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.630
 lives we can not allow something 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.370
 interfere with them and especially now 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.380
 that you have returned 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.900
 I think you should come home and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.780
 forget that young man will find the 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.619
 way to get ahead parents never 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.810
 they heard nothing from him yet 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.810
 some days later they received a 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.880
 call from the police of san francisco 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.090
 his son had died when falling from a 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.180
 building the police concluded that it 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.340
 it was about a suicide the confused and 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.740
 frightened parents came to san 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.479
 francisco and they were led to the 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.750
 morgue to identify the corpse 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:08.360
 it was indeed his son but for his 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.500
 horror they discovered something they did not know 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.140
 his son his beloved son just had a 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.910
