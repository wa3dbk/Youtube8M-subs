00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 so here are the following tutorials 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.330
 now we will see the bridge is at 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.090
 say the bridge may 10 jean noria the couple 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 and the chorus and the bridge and for better 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.120
 locate it first I'll sing you 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.929
 first a chorus and chained on the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.929
 bridge what will give 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.160
 the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 does it more 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.800
 yab where i am using 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.800
 to kill me 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.820
 e 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.820
 goals m 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.510
 e 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.510
 absent from the authors 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.260
 a finger 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.260
 m 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.730
 so what are the new 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.400
 chords look for the bridge for the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.790
 bridge there is the major C we've already seen 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.119
 their major is already seen and the ground 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.130
 Belgian 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.580
 we have already seen it so in fact the only 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.740
 new agreement it's a b it's 6/1 6/7 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.300
 like that it's an agreement we use 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.920
 frequently so it's better that you 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.080
 learn it if you do not know it 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.930
 so the agreement of the duo we do not touch 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.299
 be part of the agreement then 5th box 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.270
 from the simple forgiveness second box of the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.179
 fifth string first box fourth 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 strings second fourth box third 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:38.250
 rope and then second box of the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 bottom rope this is then for what 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.689
 is the duration of agreement each time 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.259
 they will make two strokes of time to 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.640
 down so twice these two times 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 the twice the soil and twice the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.149
 bessette and the only variant so it's ok 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.679
 to be each time for each glass 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.590
 like that and the only variant is at the 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.539
 end on the way to be one we will do 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.759
 lure their backs to theirs and two times 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.439
 each and the final floor will make him 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.599
 four shots down before 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.549
 to follow on the new chorus 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:10.170
 so what I propose to you here is 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.640
 put these words into place by doing 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.230
 just the costs down so I 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.530
 advise you not to sing just 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:22.810
 you hit the costs down 3,4 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.530
 I do not know how to kill myself 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.780
 1 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.340
 no 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.620
 can we get wayne men 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.660
 he 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:41.620
 at robson 2 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:44.099
 John Dow 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 3 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.180
 4 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.840
 and then I follow on the new 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:54.950
 couple and late here is so listen on 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.519

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.790
 do lyrics 3,4 I know it to me 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.790
 kill 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.940
 we would like ivory well 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.970
 absent from 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.110
 youth 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.110
 we 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110
 we 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.100
 in law 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.100
 every night 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.080
 that's it then I'll call you back 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.360
 we sing it without a capo here a 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.700
 way low enough for the voice of which 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.170
 use a capo on the one hand if 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.569
 you want to sing with the original with 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.610
 john lennon and then on the other hand if this 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.140
 author does not fit your tessitura 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.660
 of voice change it you put a 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.400
 buyer who suits you best here 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.959
 so there the same way we had 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.640
 view for each other we can also do the 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.360
 same arpeggio that is to say on four 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.360
 ropes like that 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:03.889
 I go back a little what gives 3 4 I get 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.889

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.560
 time we once did this art fishing and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.480
 in the end when we get to the ground that he 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.010
 lasts four strokes four strokes to the 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.070
 down will have to do twice his land 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.950

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.540
 low and for the b767 iem there it's 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.190

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:41.400
 record of 4 3 2 we will do it once 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.850
 a fishing art like that 3 4 I use to 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.850
 to kill me 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.510
 the time to have 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.460

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.710
 couple and the chorus and the bridge I you 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.559
 wish to work well and I think 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.879
 that I'm doing a last little tutorial where I 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.889
 am going to chain a multiple all that for 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.240
 that we can be like that 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.710
 little synthesis and that it is more 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.419
 convenient to work 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.419
