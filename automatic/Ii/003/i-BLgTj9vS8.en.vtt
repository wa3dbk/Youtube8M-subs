00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.690
 Hi everyone, how are you? Summer is fine. 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.850
 approaching it's time for us to begin 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.680
 think about cold desserts 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.940
 That's why we 're going to go back now. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.770
 of plum 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.170
 I already have here in the half blender 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.699
 can condensed milk here in the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.759
 blender Caó 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.580
 I already had a way here I'll add 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:34.830
 then to condensed milk half a cup of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.130
 tea and black plum without some heat 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.000
 vanilla droplets essence of 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.480
 vanilla 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.820
 but if you guys are good, here I am 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.600
 I have a can of sour cream and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.600
 cold 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.790
 so do not forget that she had 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:05.700
 half a can and milk blender 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:07.740
 condensed and here I have two spoons 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.850
 rum soup 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.920
 if you do not have 11, no problem 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.880
 will buy something only to face is 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 now I'm going to hit the blender 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.060
 about 15 minutes and then I 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.220
 I'll take it to the freezer is more or less. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.920
 A couple of hours later we 'll go 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 beating again and come back with it i 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.640
 I sparked for another five hours. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 so the first step we're going to hit 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.000
 for five minutes 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.479
 good so after you hit the river if you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.390
 do not want too much pricked black plum 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.909
 you do not need to get well 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.040
 now we are going to put the packages 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.260
 put on talking about us even looked like 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.700
 with those ice cream pots but the ideal 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.890
 is that you have your own ice cream pot 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.440
 and even if you have it in your house 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.680
 So you use it, well, I'll bring it. 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.450
 change is in this package and people 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.369
 go then I'll try 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.600
 We 'll take the freezer for two 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.960
 good hours we stayed 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.460
 approximately two hours in the freezer 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:19.040
 daughter and now we're going to hit 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:22.970
 again in the blender does not 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.580
 totally thick duret but the fan 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.040
 Let's knock another four times. 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.230
 Five days later we'll go back with him. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.400
 in the freezer for more or less 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.590
 five hours before serving good 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.410
 will probably show it to you 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.210
 only tomorrow because it is already 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.990
 late night 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.990
 I 'm going to hit now and I'll let it go. 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.480
 Very well. 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:13.010
 now we'll go back with him the same 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:16.340
 packing then 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.070
 simple so hi hi guys then we 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.860
 will continue to have no prescription 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.200
 of plum ice cream and had begun to 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.370
 to prepare last night i'm super happy 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.360
 easy to do 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.730
 Look at the day as in the language of Jan Domingão. 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.700
 dessert so here we see the two 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:41.810
 service ports and roger 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.490
 Look here, look, we're going to turn the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:50.780
 It seems to make a good ball. 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:57.500
 round also is one of the ways 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:59.150
 You see, you put it there. 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.450
 You can put good things on yourself. 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.350
 Do you want to be logical? 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.350
 and will spice it up here 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.980
 the plum okay I 'll give you some 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:16.709
 For you, and fond of decorating your 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.200
 good tactic brings other ways 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:27.870
 the other way that I think well 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:29.760
 too cute here in readiness is the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.510
 Ice cream topping is good chocolate 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.750
 is can have flavor you want is here 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.310
 O 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.870
 I'll put a little bit here with the 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.050
 help of a spoon 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:48.120
 We'll do it if we can. 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.070
 stretched 'pulled' or also trinity in the 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.850
 dish 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:58.560
 then we come here still make a ball 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.490
 very nice that ty writing already leaves neither 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.490
 round 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:18.340
 Look how nice we can here. 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:22.000
 complement the same stir 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.870
 Look who's getting pretty here, the pass. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.320
 well my wish we will pull the acne or 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.370
 if he already did and makes me that will cover 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.370
 with a little more 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.550
 Okay , it's the heart that I like. 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.950

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.270
