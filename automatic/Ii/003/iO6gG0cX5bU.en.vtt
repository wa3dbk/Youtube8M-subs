00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
discussion about the need to do it I was

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
discussion about the need to do it I was
on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> conservative<00:00:43.710> side<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.550> there

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
on the conservative side you know there

on the conservative side you know there
was<00:00:44.850> talk<00:00:45.090> about<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.570> whole<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:46.050> more<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
was talk about a whole lot more of a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.389 
was talk about a whole lot more of a
price<00:00:47.070> increase<00:00:47.309> than<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:48.059> absolutely<00:00:48.450> did<00:00:49.440> we

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
price increase than we absolutely did we

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.400 
price increase than we absolutely did we
think<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.820> tough<00:00:51.059> economy<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.960> don't<00:00:52.199> like

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
think it's a tough economy we don't like

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
think it's a tough economy we don't like
the<00:00:52.559> idea<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.949> raising<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.579> price<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.000> think

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the idea of raising the price we think

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.520 
the idea of raising the price we think
it's<00:00:54.329> important<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.199> we've

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it's important to do it we've

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's important to do it we've
communicated<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.969> very<00:00:57.030> well<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.870> our

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020

that<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.700> modest<00:01:09.390> increase<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:10.110> light<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
that it's a modest increase in light of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.859 
that it's a modest increase in light of
the<00:01:10.619> value<00:01:11.010> proposition<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:11.939> offer<00:01:12.240> but

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
the value proposition that we offer but

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.960 
the value proposition that we offer but
we<00:01:12.930> recognize<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.590> it's<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.189> concern<00:01:14.670> we

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we recognize that it's a concern we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.160 
we recognize that it's a concern we
don't<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> idea<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.720> raising<00:01:15.869> our

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
don't like the idea of raising our

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
don't like the idea of raising our
prices<00:01:16.500> at<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:16.950> when<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.640> economy<00:01:17.670> is

prices at a time when the economy is
tough<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.750> could<00:01:18.930> certainly<00:01:19.080> help<00:01:19.320> boost<00:01:19.799> your

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
tough it could certainly help boost your

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
the merger that we've had so I don't

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.030 
the merger that we've had so I don't
think<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.330> subscriber<00:02:59.140> growth<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.680> really

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
think that subscriber growth is really

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.100 
think that subscriber growth is really
you<00:03:00.670> know<00:03:00.790> an<00:03:00.910> issue<00:03:01.060> for<00:03:01.180> us<00:03:01.420> we're<00:03:01.750> really

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
you know an issue for us we're really

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.920 
you know an issue for us we're really
enjoying<00:03:02.320> that<00:03:02.910> subscribe<00:03:03.910> growth<00:03:04.090> assuming

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
enjoying that subscribe growth assuming

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.360 
enjoying that subscribe growth assuming
that<00:03:05.050> we're<00:03:05.170> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> hit<00:03:05.440> our<00:03:05.590> guidance<00:03:06.040> I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
that we're going to hit our guidance I

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.640 
that we're going to hit our guidance I
think<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.150> our<00:03:07.300> growth<00:03:07.660> rate<00:03:08.019> is<00:03:08.290> going<00:03:08.500> to

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
think that our growth rate is going to

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.860 
think that our growth rate is going to
be<00:03:08.769> well<00:03:09.040> over<00:03:09.070> twenty<00:03:09.550> five<00:03:09.700> percent<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:10.300> the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
be well over twenty five percent in the

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.870 
be well over twenty five percent in the
quarter<00:03:11.200> of<00:03:11.530> over<00:03:12.010> last<00:03:12.220> year<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.700> think

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
quarter of over last year and I think

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.340 
quarter of over last year and I think
that<00:03:13.030> considering<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> economy<00:03:13.989> and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
that considering the economy and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.140 
that considering the economy and
considering<00:03:14.860> all<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.250> competition<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:15.940> think

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
considering all the competition I think

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.820 
considering all the competition I think
that<00:03:16.300> that's<00:03:16.390> pretty<00:03:16.720> good<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.140> where<00:03:17.680> our

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
that that's pretty good and where our

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.380 
that that's pretty good and where our
future<00:03:17.980> growth<00:03:18.280> is<00:03:18.550> going<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.730> come<00:03:18.910> from<00:03:19.090> is

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
future growth is going to come from is

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.810 
future growth is going to come from is
