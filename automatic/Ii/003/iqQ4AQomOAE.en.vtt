which actually exists in the file select

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.819 
which actually exists in the file select
screen<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> touch<00:00:57.570> screen<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.500> rhotic

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
screen on the touch screen is a rhotic

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.610

part<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.579> castle<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.379> there<00:01:01.590> but

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
part of the castle you see it there but

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.410 
part of the castle you see it there but
you<00:01:01.920> don't<00:01:02.070> actually<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.210> real<00:01:03.390> game

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you don't actually see in the real game

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.960 
you don't actually see in the real game
and<00:01:03.979> people<00:01:04.979> say<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.280> need<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> look<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and people say they need to look at it

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.960 
and people say they need to look at it
at<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.390> exact<00:01:06.840> same<00:01:07.200> angle<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:07.950> picture<00:01:08.340> but

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
at the exact same angle as a picture but

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.120 
at the exact same angle as a picture but
that's<00:01:09.360> impossible<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.890> water

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that's impossible because the water

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's impossible because the water
level<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> look<00:01:12.479> at<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> from<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
level you need to look at it from the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.499 
level you need to look at it from the
room<00:01:13.320> link<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.369> water<00:01:14.610> level<00:01:14.700> doesn't

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
room link so the water level doesn't

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.620 
room link so the water level doesn't
actually<00:01:16.130> let<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.479> it's

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
actually let you do that so it's

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.490 
actually let you do that so it's
impossible<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.659> you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> break<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
impossible and you have to break it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.469 
impossible and you have to break it
that's<00:01:22.979> what<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> says<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.060> break<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that's what it says you have to break it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.330 
that's what it says you have to break it
then<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> go<00:01:25.320> through<00:01:25.650> Princess

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
then you have to go through Princess

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.770 
then you have to go through Princess
Peach's<00:01:27.290> picture<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.590> friendly<00:01:28.979> castle<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
Peach's picture and friendly castle and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.929 
Peach's picture and friendly castle and
then<00:01:30.780> you'll<00:01:30.990> find<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.560> room<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.040> exactly

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
then you'll find a room that exactly

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.710 
then you'll find a room that exactly
like<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> second<00:01:34.740> floor<00:01:35.720> with

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
like the one in the second floor with

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.800 
like the one in the second floor with
the<00:01:36.900> mirror<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.189> into<00:01:38.780> waluigi<00:01:39.780> x'

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the mirror then you go into waluigi x'

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.670 
the mirror then you go into waluigi x'
picture<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.700> then<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.939> fight<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.689> huge<00:01:43.320> plant

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
picture and then you fight a huge plant

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.280 
picture and then you fight a huge plant
then<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> key<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> go<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
then you get a key then you go to the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.130 
then you get a key then you go to the
fourth<00:01:46.619> door<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> church<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.149> select<00:01:48.509> room

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and there you go but it's all false

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.889 
and there you go but it's all false
since<00:01:53.130> while<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.700> not<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> game<00:01:54.360> i

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
since while we just not in the game i

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.740 
since while we just not in the game i
can<00:01:55.829> say<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.310> there's<00:01:56.490> no<00:01:56.850> luigi<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.630> the
