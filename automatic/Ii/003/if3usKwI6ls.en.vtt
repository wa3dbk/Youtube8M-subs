00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
like a lot of stuff I thought it's just

a<00:01:47.580> thin<00:01:47.850> single<00:01:48.690> it's<00:01:48.840> very<00:01:49.049> thin<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:50.039> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
a thin single it's very thin so that you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.380 
a thin single it's very thin so that you

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.390 
I think the color scheme and the general
works<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.360> think<00:02:43.629> it<00:02:44.019> what<00:02:44.500> was<00:02:44.650> my<00:02:44.829> style<00:02:45.040> just

that<00:02:45.849> I'll<00:02:46.090> never<00:02:46.599> wear<00:02:46.810> white<00:02:46.959> shoes<00:02:47.200> I'm<00:02:47.799> off

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
that I'll never wear white shoes I'm off

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.920 
that I'll never wear white shoes I'm off
like<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> leather<00:02:48.700> shoe<00:02:49.000> collector<00:02:50.069> okay<00:02:51.930> we

like if they own promises then you just

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.180 
like if they own promises then you just
buy<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.849> rest<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.329> all<00:03:01.930> if<00:03:02.319> you<00:03:02.470> want<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:03.010> can

service<00:04:08.720> or<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.050> think<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.349> material<00:04:09.470> is<00:04:09.890> very

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
service or I think the material is very

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.280 
service or I think the material is very
unique<00:04:10.430> it's<00:04:10.790> not<00:04:11.000> very<00:04:11.360> common<00:04:11.690> there's<00:04:12.110> like

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
unique it's not very common there's like

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.530 
unique it's not very common there's like
this<00:04:12.440> elbow<00:04:13.190> casing<00:04:13.580> she<00:04:14.000> stands<00:04:14.239> up<00:04:14.360> quite

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
this elbow casing she stands up quite

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.940 
this elbow casing she stands up quite
because<00:04:14.780> it's<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:15.019> lighter<00:04:15.170> color<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.650> lighting

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
because it's a lighter color in lighting

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.069 
because it's a lighter color in lighting
a<00:04:16.190> teacher<00:04:16.790> thought<00:04:17.180> it<00:04:17.540> was<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.690> pocket<00:04:17.959> square

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
a teacher thought it was a pocket square

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.840 
a teacher thought it was a pocket square
but<00:04:18.440> you<00:04:18.889> put<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.130> focus<00:04:19.370> on<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.519> makes<00:04:19.700> you

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
but you put the focus on it makes you

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.379 
but you put the focus on it makes you
beat<00:04:19.970> defenses<00:04:20.389> or<00:04:20.510> outfit<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:29.000> it's<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.210> wrap

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389
