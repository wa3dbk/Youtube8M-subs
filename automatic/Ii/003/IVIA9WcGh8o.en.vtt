00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.879
 hello youtube friends today I'm going to ride 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.519
 an introduction to a song that 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:13.070
 call me with me 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.539
 sings the teacher Miguel Morales no 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.099
 I know who is the one to coordinate the 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.890
 I truly believe that Juan David Herrera 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.900
 vÃ­ctor y reyes 6 the person who recorded 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.020
 that accordion accordion really plays 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.060
 too much is I think it has a lot 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.399
 scroll has a lot of fingering 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.910
 also has an interesting talk is 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:35.360
 recorded in F sharp senior who was 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.460
 sharp greater half finger accordion 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.829
 sharp sharp and natural known 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.829
 popularly as rain in colombia 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 so 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 two 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.469
 goes to the fifth the sixth here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840
 it would be like 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.869
 it really is fifth 6th chord 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.869
 that situation 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.050
 and that usually resolves here but 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.580
 here is a substitution and there is another type 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.510
 of cadence then the fifth the fifth 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.510
 and then to the fifth 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.190
 is the fifth of the fifth grade but in 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.930
 second impression second impression 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 because the bass from the fifth of the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.630
 cut 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.630
 but with that car with the three 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.730
 yes 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.599
 so 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.599
 but the person who recorded it touches 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.599
 as 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.010
 ah 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.000
 if it's an interesting song because 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.580
 has lots of harmony it has all inter 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.459
 dominant the fifth the sixth and then 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.470
 happens to the 5th the fifth then interesting 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.569
 a greeting is sent to my friends from 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.880
 chile to my friends from Peru that I 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.890
 they write also and already those of venezuela 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.610
