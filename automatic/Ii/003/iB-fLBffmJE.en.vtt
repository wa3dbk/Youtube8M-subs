that pulls off it's actually this is the
stand<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:32.329> detaches<00:00:33.329> from<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.719> like<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
stand that detaches from it like that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.830

and that's the stand so that can clip on
so<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.020> make<00:00:40.260> sure<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> stand<00:00:40.829> goes<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so just make sure the stand goes on the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.069 
so just make sure the stand goes on the
right<00:00:41.280> way<00:00:41.489> around<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.329> clip<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:43.160> by

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
now you'll notice there's the set

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.609 
now you'll notice there's the set
starting<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> come<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.130> now<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.900> also<00:01:25.200> has

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
starting to come on now and it also has

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.130 
starting to come on now and it also has
DV<00:01:27.229> DV<00:01:28.229> B<00:01:28.560> radio<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.430> digital<00:01:29.729> radio<00:01:31.670> so

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
DV DV B radio which is digital radio so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.390 
DV DV B radio which is digital radio so
as<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.590> can't<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.759> TV<00:01:36.420> now

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
as you know you can't get a TV now

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.550 
as you know you can't get a TV now
without<00:01:38.400> digital<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.630> has<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> be<00:01:40.079> digital

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
without digital so it has to be digital

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.950 
without digital so it has to be digital
so<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.000> into<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> setting<00:01:43.520> DVD<00:01:44.520> TV

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
so if we go into the setting DVD TV

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.319 
so if we go into the setting DVD TV
which<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> digital<00:01:46.470> channels<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.369> we've

do that
unfortunately<00:03:32.970> however<00:03:34.049> just<00:03:35.049> give<00:03:35.319> a<00:03:35.440> very

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
unfortunately however just give a very

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.590 
unfortunately however just give a very
very<00:03:36.010> good<00:03:36.489> picture<00:03:36.730> very<00:03:37.510> good<00:03:37.840> picture<00:03:38.049> and

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
very good picture very good picture and

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:49.490 
very good picture very good picture and
just<00:03:40.600> alter<00:03:41.170> the

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.030 

absolutely

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
absolutely

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.220 
absolutely
nobly<00:03:51.819> cracking<00:03:52.750> little<00:03:54.209> as<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.420> say<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
nobly cracking little as I say the

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.430 
nobly cracking little as I say the
the<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:57.670> volume<00:03:57.819> control<00:03:59.040> is<00:04:01.260> across<00:04:02.260> the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
the the volume control is across the

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.059 
the the volume control is across the
front<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:04.150> you've<00:04:04.330> got<00:04:04.569> the<00:04:04.840> volume<00:04:05.500> control

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
front so you've got the volume control

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.059 
front so you've got the volume control
there<00:04:06.310> which<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.120> an<00:04:07.270> indicator<00:04:07.959> on<00:04:08.410> the

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
there which is an indicator on the

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.210 
there which is an indicator on the
volume<00:04:09.400> control<00:04:09.880> lock<00:04:10.120> as<00:04:10.330> comes<00:04:10.900> up<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:12.130> it

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
volume control lock as comes up so it

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.540 
volume control lock as comes up so it
slows<00:04:12.489> it<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:13.060> high<00:04:13.239> is<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:15.100> that's<00:04:15.340> it

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
slows it the high is it and that's it

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.520 
slows it the high is it and that's it
really<00:04:17.609> very<00:04:18.609> good<00:04:18.880> power<00:04:19.209> supply<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.169> it

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
really very good power supply and it

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.180 
really very good power supply and it
will<00:04:21.100> run<00:04:21.310> for<00:04:21.519> three<00:04:21.790> hours<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:23.650> will<00:04:23.830> run<00:04:23.950> for

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
will run for three hours it will run for

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.740 
will run for three hours it will run for
three<00:04:24.400> hours<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:25.540> a<00:04:26.260> charge<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:28.300> you<00:04:28.360> plug<00:04:28.570> that

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
three hours on a charge so you plug that

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.500 
three hours on a charge so you plug that
in<00:04:29.400> charge<00:04:30.400> it<00:04:30.550> up<00:04:30.700> for<00:04:30.850> three<00:04:31.030> that<00:04:31.210> well

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
in charge it up for three that well

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.140 
in charge it up for three that well
charge<00:04:32.080> charge<00:04:32.200> it'll<00:04:32.710> fall<00:04:32.950> initially<00:04:33.669> about

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
charge charge it'll fall initially about

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.790 
charge charge it'll fall initially about
ten<00:04:34.480> hours<00:04:34.510> but<00:04:35.020> you<00:04:35.200> get<00:04:35.380> a<00:04:35.410> three<00:04:35.650> hour

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
ten hours but you get a three hour

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.670 
ten hours but you get a three hour
charge<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:40.210> it's<00:04:40.510> very<00:04:40.600> very<00:04:41.020> handy<00:04:41.169> you

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680
