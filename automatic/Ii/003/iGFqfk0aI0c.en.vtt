00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.029 
what's a swirl bit generator you ask
well<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.689> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> like<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.380> dimples<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
well it's kind of like the dimples on a

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.699 
well it's kind of like the dimples on a
golf<00:02:08.099> ball<00:02:08.640> or<00:02:08.910> on<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> set<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.720> Zipp<00:02:10.110> wheels<00:02:10.319> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
golf ball or on a set of Zipp wheels it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.850 
golf ball or on a set of Zipp wheels it
creates<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.310> small<00:02:12.120> layer<00:02:12.450> of<00:02:12.780> turbulent<00:02:13.379> air

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
creates a small layer of turbulent air

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
creates a small layer of turbulent air
for<00:02:14.130> smoother<00:02:14.550> air<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.270> flow<00:02:15.450> over<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.200> that

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
for smoother air to flow over and that

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.450 
for smoother air to flow over and that
makes<00:02:16.800> them<00:02:16.920> faster

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
makes them faster

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.300 
makes them faster
it<00:02:17.730> also<00:02:18.020> diffuses<00:02:19.020> wind<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.710> hits<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.160> rim

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it also diffuses wind that hits the rim

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.460 
it also diffuses wind that hits the rim
at<00:02:20.580> an<00:02:20.670> angle<00:02:21.210> which<00:02:21.630> makes<00:02:21.900> these<00:02:22.110> wheels

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
at an angle which makes these wheels

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.650 
at an angle which makes these wheels
super<00:02:23.340> easy<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.760> handle<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.240> windy<00:02:24.630> conditions

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
super easy to handle in windy conditions

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.400 
super easy to handle in windy conditions
oh<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.710> did<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.280> mention<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.690> tubular

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
oh and did I mention that the tubular

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.250 
oh and did I mention that the tubular
version<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.250> RZR<00:02:29.940> wheel<00:02:30.150> set<00:02:30.480> weighs<00:02:30.780> less

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
version of the RZR wheel set weighs less

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.150 
version of the RZR wheel set weighs less
than<00:02:32.090> 900<00:02:33.090> grams<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.810> think<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> one<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.100> of

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
than 900 grams I think that one kind of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.610 
than 900 grams I think that one kind of
speaks<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.520> itself<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:37.050> you're<00:02:37.290> shopping

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
speaks for itself so if you're shopping

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.610 
speaks for itself so if you're shopping
for<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> supercar<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.300> bike<00:02:39.570> wheels<00:02:39.870> then<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
for the supercar of bike wheels then the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.460 
for the supercar of bike wheels then the
46<00:02:41.160> millimeter<00:02:41.580> RZR<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.990> latest<00:02:43.320> and

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
46 millimeter RZR is the latest and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.230 
46 millimeter RZR is the latest and
