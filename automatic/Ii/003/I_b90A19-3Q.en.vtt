one<00:04:44.599> thing<00:04:44.990> we<00:04:45.139> made<00:04:45.320> larger<00:04:45.919> was<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.310> battery

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
one thing we made larger was the battery

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.689 
one thing we made larger was the battery
in<00:04:47.000> fact<00:04:47.539> iphone<00:04:48.110> 4<00:04:48.410> delivers<00:04:48.919> up<00:04:49.099> to<00:04:49.160> forty

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
in fact iphone 4 delivers up to forty

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
percent more talk time the we started

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.950

with completely opposing goals and we

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.320 
with completely opposing goals and we

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
wanted to make this iphone more capable

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.170 
wanted to make this iphone more capable
we<00:04:59.599> wanted<00:04:59.900> to<00:04:59.930> add<00:05:00.139> more<00:05:00.410> feature<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.280> yet<00:05:02.090> at

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
we wanted to add more feature and yet at

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.760 
we wanted to add more feature and yet at
the<00:05:02.240> same<00:05:02.300> time<00:05:02.509> we<00:05:03.199> wanted<00:05:03.470> to<00:05:03.500> make<00:05:03.620> it

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
the same time we wanted to make it

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.520 
the same time we wanted to make it
smaller<00:05:04.009> an<00:05:04.460> even<00:05:04.729> thinner<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:06.169> lets<00:05:06.380> us

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
smaller an even thinner and that lets us

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.150 
smaller an even thinner and that lets us
some<00:05:06.710> really<00:05:07.130> surprising<00:05:07.280> innovation<00:05:09.160> we

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
some really surprising innovation we

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.950 
some really surprising innovation we
developed<00:05:10.610> an<00:05:10.699> entirely<00:05:11.240> new<00:05:11.419> grade

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
developed an entirely new grade

giving us more internal volume we also

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.520 
giving us more internal volume we also
developed<00:05:29.180> a<00:05:29.270> custom<00:05:29.659> glass<00:05:29.840> that's
