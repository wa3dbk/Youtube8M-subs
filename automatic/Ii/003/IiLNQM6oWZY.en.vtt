in 2013 I'm gonna be trying to build
myself<00:00:07.500> up<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.890> cross<00:00:08.130> bike<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> go

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
myself up a cross bike and have a go

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.549 
myself up a cross bike and have a go
across<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.960> look<00:00:10.110> sir

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
across it look sir

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.730 
across it look sir
expect<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.210> I'm<00:00:12.630> most<00:00:13.410> looking<00:00:13.590> forward

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740

out<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.740> at<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:16.949> moment<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.670> I

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
out and about at the moment but I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.120 
out and about at the moment but I
suppose<00:00:17.970> over<00:00:18.230> in<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> next<00:00:19.650> year<00:00:19.949> they're

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
suppose over in the next year they're

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.470 
suppose over in the next year they're
going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> become<00:00:20.400> more<00:00:20.550> prevalent<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.359> they

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
going to become more prevalent as they

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
going to become more prevalent as they
are<00:00:21.710> potentially<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.800> road<00:00:22.980> bags<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
are potentially on road bags so the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.460 
are potentially on road bags so the
product<00:00:24.449> I'm<00:00:24.510> most<00:00:24.720> looking<00:00:24.869> forward<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.320> in

next year the reason for that for me is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.510 
next year the reason for that for me is
that<00:01:20.600> rim<00:01:21.600> brakes<00:01:21.840> still<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.799> me<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:23.130> good<00:01:23.369> as

of female pros and they're not all of
them<00:02:17.140> British<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.130> I<00:02:18.160> think<00:02:18.250> it'd<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:18.550> really
