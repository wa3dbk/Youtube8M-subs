also<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.589> nicer<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
also but this one much nicer if it's a

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.170 
also but this one much nicer if it's a
lot<00:01:05.729> better<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.920> perfect<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.610> versus

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
lot better so it's perfect there versus

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.590 
lot better so it's perfect there versus
this<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.020> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> got<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.100> use

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
this one which is kind of got out of use

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
this one which is kind of got out of use
but<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.869> really<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> black<00:01:13.650> case<00:01:14.090> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
but I like really like the black case it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.420 
but I like really like the black case it
looks<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.229> titanium<00:01:17.220> gray

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
