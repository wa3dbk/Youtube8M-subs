00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.690
 how are these cutlets useful in the first 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.310

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.770
 physical chicken meat plus everything 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.100

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 semi that is, they do not have the mass and all 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.130
 overheated the heat 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.110
 for cooking these newspaper me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.180
 need a double boiler you won't believe on 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.750
 my household still does not have a steamer 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.360
 for some reason, probably soon and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.790

 I love to use a white bun 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.070
 for these cats because burgers 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.760

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.700
 soak a roll in cream 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 so that it is completely there once painted 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.860
 also need to be sure to bow 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.490
 no cutlets without sound 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.500

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.909
 celery leaves eggs sea salt 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.130

 one egg is prepared 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 then tell the boss 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.560
 now we start cooking 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.890
 the stuffing itself 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.890
 chop the onion 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:18.849
 chop onion very finely crumble his will 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.300
 spill onions 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.300
 minced now garlic 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.220
 and send the page at home 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:03:22.769

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:32.310
 the fire is ready and the egg and set it 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:38.060
 cool down feces year filled 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.829
 water one third we need a colander 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.629
 Drushlag need to pick up such that he 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.030
 did not reach the bottom of the pot that is 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.829
 so that it is a little less in length and for 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.280
 so that the burgers do not dive 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:53.819
 in the water steamed and now 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.260
 we start to roll some kind of 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.090
 can be done at will 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.590
 there is a misfortune that is the size 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.299
 big ones make big ones like that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.209
 small ones do small and 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.799
 we put everything in drushlag 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.870
 for saying forgot to warn that the egg 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.549
 will be needed for those who have kids 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.819
 because kids how to eat 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.859
 very bad and they would need to be than 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.500
 something to lure because we will hide 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.150
 for the egg in the chop and add task 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.070

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.650
 cutlet stand plus all u 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.000
 extra protein and protein now we 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.699
 divided in half and another quarter 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.180
 innochki now we do the following we 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:41.990
 take the stuffing is not very much so grown 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.680
 his layer to them and take one quarter 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.699
 we put a cutlet 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.699
 and wrap 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.960
 Well, that is sealed there is all such 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.730
 cutlet will be an exciting task for 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.310
 that is, we give some 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.590

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.280
 interesting we put colander 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.200
 and so some of the water we have is captivating 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.040
 flirt preparing let's close 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.340
 cover so they have us in Tamil here 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.570
 so this whole structure looks like 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.460
 a small part of the stuffing I decided all the same 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.020
 fire to show you 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.380
 differences in that year will look like 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.480
 cutlets options to issue cutlets mass 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.550
 For example, you can pre-divide 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.090
 bun in two and fry it in 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.350
 toaster 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.450
 so we start to decorate our dishes like me 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.570
 already said one of the options is toast 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.430

 a slice of tomato can be planted onions 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.360
 cut into rings 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:52.729
 and a pickled gherkin that you have there 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.639
 have an au pair 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:58.829
 now put the burgers on top 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:04.829
 incidentally added more eye sauce and I 

00:05:58.829 --> 00:06:09.839
 This sauce is very like and cover 

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:13.259
 second half more diet is 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:15.329
 just using different vegetables 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:21.199
 here you can make such cups 

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:29.219
 here and lettuce again decorate with tomato 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:39.319

 salt and place the chops in the house 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:46.289
