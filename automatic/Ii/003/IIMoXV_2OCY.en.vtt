of<00:00:26.820> placing<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.390> farm<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.990> slimes<00:00:28.890> only

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369

spawn<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.789> certain<00:00:30.119> chunks<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.660> don't<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:31.589 
spawn in certain chunks I don't want to

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:33.590 
spawn in certain chunks I don't want to
get<00:00:31.679> into<00:00:31.890> details<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.640> math<00:00:32.940> regarding<00:00:33.450> this

get into details or math regarding this

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600 
get into details or math regarding this
so<00:00:33.960> here's<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.380> apply<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.800> rule<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> farm

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
so here's how we apply this rule to farm

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
so here's how we apply this rule to farm
placement<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.990> way<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> choose<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> spot<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.070> by

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
placement one way to choose a spot is by

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
placement one way to choose a spot is by
running<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.700> round<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.090> deep<00:00:39.240> caves<00:00:39.510> until<00:00:39.780> you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
running a round of deep caves until you

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.780 
running a round of deep caves until you
see<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> slime<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.710> then<00:00:40.980> build<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.310> farm<00:00:41.580> in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
see a slime and then build your farm in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.270 
see a slime and then build your farm in
that<00:00:41.970> spot<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.720> said<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.380> slimes<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.980> spawn

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
that spot it said that slimes can spawn

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.550 
that spot it said that slimes can spawn
in<00:00:44.490> nine<00:00:44.700> by<00:00:44.880> nine<00:00:45.060> by<00:00:45.090> four<00:00:45.510> boxes<00:00:46.020> but<00:00:46.380> these

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
in nine by nine by four boxes but these

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.630 
in nine by nine by four boxes but these
small<00:00:46.830> boxes

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
small boxes

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.360 
small boxes
do<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.240> mind<00:00:48.650> never<00:00:49.650> seem<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.920> work<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.310> me

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
do you mind never seem to work for me

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.610 
do you mind never seem to work for me
and<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.910> takes<00:00:51.120> ages<00:00:51.330> to<00:00:51.810> find<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:52.080> wild<00:00:52.260> slime

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and it takes ages to find a wild slime

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
and it takes ages to find a wild slime
so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.040> propose<00:00:53.520> this<00:00:53.790> just<00:00:54.720> start<00:00:54.900> digging<00:00:55.080> in

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so I propose this just start digging in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.230 
so I propose this just start digging in
a<00:00:55.440> random<00:00:55.770> spot<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.310> as<00:00:56.520> long<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:57.030> farm

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
a random spot and as long as your farm

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.060 
a random spot and as long as your farm
is<00:00:57.360> big<00:00:57.540> enough<00:00:57.720> you'll<00:00:58.320> open<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> slime

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
is big enough you'll open up a slime

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.450 
is big enough you'll open up a slime
spawning<00:00:59.460> chunk<00:00:59.820> eventually<00:01:00.830> also<00:01:01.830> your<00:01:02.220> room

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
spawning chunk eventually also your room

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.299 
spawning chunk eventually also your room

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
about 50 by 50 and took almost two hours

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.289 
about 50 by 50 and took almost two hours
to<00:01:08.700> dig<00:01:08.820> out

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.620 
to dig out
I<00:01:09.590> saw<00:01:10.590> slime<00:01:10.950> early<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> 100<00:01:12.270> by<00:01:12.390> 100
