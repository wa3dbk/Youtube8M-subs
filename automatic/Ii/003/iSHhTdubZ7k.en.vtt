well<00:03:26.090> he<00:03:26.390> is<00:03:26.510> attached<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.140> this<00:03:27.319> place<00:03:27.500> tan<00:03:27.769> so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
well he is attached to this place tan so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.900 
well he is attached to this place tan so
he<00:03:27.980> can't<00:03:28.280> remove<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:28.970> piece<00:03:29.209> he<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:29.989> affixed

he can't remove the piece he is affixed
but<00:03:31.910> really<00:03:32.150> I<00:03:32.330> mean<00:03:32.660> even<00:03:32.989> if<00:03:33.110> he<00:03:33.230> was<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> loose

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
but really I mean even if he was a loose

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.110 
but really I mean even if he was a loose
piece<00:03:33.860> he<00:03:34.130> wouldn't<00:03:34.370> be<00:03:34.430> able<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.670> likely<00:03:35.090> be

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
piece he wouldn't be able to likely be

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.300 
piece he wouldn't be able to likely be
able<00:03:35.390> to<00:03:35.450> stand<00:03:35.720> up<00:03:35.900> on<00:03:36.019> his<00:03:36.170> own<00:03:36.290> so<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.100> fact

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
able to stand up on his own so the fact

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.800 
able to stand up on his own so the fact
that<00:03:37.400> he<00:03:37.519> is<00:03:37.640> attached<00:03:37.970> to<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.269> display<00:03:38.569> stand

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
that he is attached to the display stand

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.670 
that he is attached to the display stand
