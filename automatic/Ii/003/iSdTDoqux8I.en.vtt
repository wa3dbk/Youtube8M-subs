00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.820
 i 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.809
 Y 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.400
 hello today we will make a 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.650
 plastic skirt or perfect becoming 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.960
 for this winter and for this we are going to 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.880
 need half a meter of vinyl cloth or 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.500
 synthetic skin in this case I'm 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.660
 using a white fabric having a 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.460
 small holes you can find it 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.070
 list or maybe they find it with 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.960
 some draft or some good pattern 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.780
 let's use half a meter of this for the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.820
 lining we're going to need half a meter already 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.400
 It can be magaly or some house that 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 have a little bit of spandex since 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.290
 our our vinyl cloth is not no 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.629
 it's stress but if you do not stretch a 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.229
 little bit then you must also use 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.519
 the lining that is the same as it stretches 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:00.890
 matter that it is not the color me in this 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.229
 case is skin color but to make it look 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.900
 like he's simulating the skin 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.150
 can use the same tone or if you have 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.880
 some draft can be used that fits 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.220
 in contrast we are going to need also 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.220
 A thread of color scissors 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.700
 Measuring tape and a closing measures 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.220
 that we are going to need are the contour of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.590
 The waist contour of the hip and long 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.590
 skirt now if we start 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.469
 let's start folding our fabric to 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.299
 half on the reverse we're going to mark the 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.939
 length of our skirt in this case of 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.189
 long with the I have 35 plus three 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.679
 centimeters of hemline let's mark 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:46.280
 a rectangle and a centimeter in the 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:48.740
 top will be 39 centimeters 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.439
 I'm going to do 40 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.409
 and we're going to mark a rectangle of the 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.350
 fourth hip 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.880
 25 for what's been and now in the 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.470
 top part we will mark the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.350
 quarter waist 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.290
 and we went down to whoever this side 18 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.980
 centimeters and here we vanish our 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.980
 waist 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.890
 and if you want them to stay I'm not 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.120
 leaving seam allowance they realize 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.459
 that's for us to stay a little bit 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.090
 fitted as the fabric stretches a little 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.030
 let's mark our clamp and we're going 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.180
 9 centimeters and one and a half and one and 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.440
 medium and long 12 centimeters long 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.050
 defending 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.000
 this is to sew it here in the part of 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.220
 here more than quarter of waist if 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.630
 they want them to be not very tight in 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.300
 We're going to give the three of you the waist 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.890
 centimeters for the clamp that we are 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.250
 reducing here if you want them to be left 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.260
 more acintado we will not remove it and 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.670
 I'm going to leave it like this I'm not going to give you the 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.560
 three centimeters of the clamp since 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.120
 I want me to stay a little in carved and 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 in the bottom part I'm going to get two 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.070
 centimeters nothing more 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.420
 and we vanish now if we cut 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.420
 our back skirt 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.190
 here we have 3 cm to 3 centimeters 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.500
 for our closure now yes we are going to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.080
 cut the front 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.370
 we doubled it so we can stay halfway 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.370
 we mount our 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.400
 our back pattern and what are we going to 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.000
 do and I'll leave an inch here 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.070
 also so I did not tell him about the closure 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.960
 and leave like that if they left the three 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.850
 Closing feelings you have to cross 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.890
 the three centimeters here that we do not 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.480
 I'm going to leave behind in this case 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.200
 well because they do not leave much space 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:47.000
 for my saw 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.000
 and now if we look 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.180
 the same and here on the top in 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.430
 instead of leaving it like this we are going to download a 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.970
 centimeter more than we stayed a little 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.580
 more abajito 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.490
 the front part the butt was more 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.680
 high and now if we cut do not leave 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.680
 margins we cut equal 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.510
 we already have the two pieces a mosquito 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.400
 in the middle and the lining is going to cut 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.400
 same with the same stockings 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.160
 well here we have already cut in the 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.080
 part of the liner that is cut like 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.010
 only that we are going to cut about 4 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.010
 centimeters shorter 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:13.330
 and we're going to make it to mark our clamps 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.699
 back 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.870
 we have made our pizzas now 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.599
 what we are going to do is put our 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.699
 close this closure as it is made of metal 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.759
 what will we make of adornment we will let 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.400
 you look around here on the outside we're going to 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.900
 simply ride to see us all 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.940
 our teeth 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.139
 and now we have our closing 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.449
 Now what we are going to do is win 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.410
 Our skirts are going to be put together 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.419
 sides and we passed our sewing and 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:45.490
 let's make our once 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.490
 we can make it by hand 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.180
 this skirt does not lead to works and goes to 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.529
 stay and you do not have to iron the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.079
 we can chicharra 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:02.329
 now for the forum then put it like this 

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:02.329
 on the reverse we put it 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.979
 so we left this liners by 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.770
 inside and what we're going to do is grab 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:14.900
 those on the sides we flipped 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.660
 and we are going to start 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.540
 pin and I walk everything we spend our 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:25.720
 pinzas our sides and we passed a 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.720
 Seam to join lining with right 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.940
 ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.389
 Hahaha 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.319
 do not 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:07.779
 ah 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.729
 we have almost finished our skirt 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:45.340
 in the top part once it was and 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:47.319
 what is being stuck a and the lining 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.479
 with the right after I turned it over and 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:51.550
 I passed a seam turning the lining that 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.620
 we stay more involved this is so that 

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.819
 we are leaving the forum apart from 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.400
 that we must also cover our 

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:59.139
 close and finally we're going to put a 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.659
 hook in the part above here 

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:04.169
 so that we are not opening the 

00:08:01.659 --> 00:08:04.169
 closing
