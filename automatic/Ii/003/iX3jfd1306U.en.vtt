00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.340
 let's surely go eat no 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:13.809
 do n't expect any right 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:18.850
 repair if you don't even expect you or 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.940
 to the museum or where to go to the cinema 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.250
 what is it still given to us when 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.280
 you start dating and he already 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:34.390
 dream though you'll have a pen there yet what 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:35.859
 something like this in advance because it is the beginning and that's 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.620
 sitting in front of each other 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:42.819
 from the inside and how you see will go for 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.190
 beginning it seems to me that it is not on 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:47.409
 relax where man rules he 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.569
 when there is he can not be controlled 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.760
 emotions him hard he opens himself up with 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.949
 this then there are those who have emotions 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.289
 she can usually hide her if he 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.850
 there is and in time is it become what 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.829
 asks him emotions will be difficult 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.519
 control of it may have in this 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.519
 some sense 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.460
 I'm here where before there was such feature 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.189
 rewrite 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 Well, here it is for them 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.530
 strictly 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.440
 making them registered 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.290
 even as culturally 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.710
 it means yes and yes, although in principle older 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.220
 generation does not shy away from burping 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.220
 last 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:02.470

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.349
 no one can see that here is a hat 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.959
 because strong car accident may not be the same 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.870

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.950
 tank so it may not be ashamed to 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.599
 watch with a black man so binary code for him 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.599
 it was a shock u could not really understand what u 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:51.359
 we have our etiquette and now probably 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:53.000
 approach more than this 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.560
 quality room

 but again and yes you can add that 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.209
 very important in corporate 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.640
