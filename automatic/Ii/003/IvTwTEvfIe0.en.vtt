00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.620
 if anything, he continues to renew his own 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.950
 targets 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:22.359
 today in the contemporary series we have the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:25.900
 the handyman zoom 18 200 mm fire 356 e 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.660
 3 totally renewed compared to 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.860
 previous series both as regards 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.680
 the constructive material that the tsc uno 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.930
 special synthesis material that you 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.870
 mates very well with the parts 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.020
 metallic and in the optical scheme a 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.890
 new optical scheme that includes lenses 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.239
 aspherical and optical glass lenses a 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.879
 very low dispersion these per 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:00.280
 decrease or even eliminate any 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:01.600
 optical aberrations new in the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.789
 this goal 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.810
 and also the stabilization system 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:12.030
 that an optical stabilization system 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:17.020
 sim owner who promises he can 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.299
 take free hand shots both at 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.790
 close distances 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.240
 in fact this goal is also the goal 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.360
 for macrophotography indeed better for 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.930
 close-up photography and 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.720
 also allows this system to 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.149
 optical stabilization to resume 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.439
 at maximum maximum focal length 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:45.840
 focal excursion which is 200 mm which 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:49.659
 equals the full format at a 300 mm 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.790
 we have used this lens as 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.430
 always in real conditions the use e 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.789
 always freehand just to test 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 in a particular way what it promises 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:04.500
 the optical stabilization system 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.500
 let's see the result
