um still can get the good hooks acts as

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.760 
um still can get the good hooks acts as
the<00:06:28.740> backbone<00:06:29.180> the<00:06:30.180> real<00:06:30.480> I<00:06:30.810> was<00:06:31.200> using<00:06:31.350> is

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
the backbone the real I was using is

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.570 
the backbone the real I was using is
just<00:06:31.980> a<00:06:32.040> regular<00:06:32.370> Revo<00:06:32.700> STX<00:06:33.210> I'm<00:06:34.080> 7<00:06:34.500> 1<00:06:34.530> ratio<00:06:34.950> so

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
just a regular Revo STX I'm 7 1 ratio so

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.220 
just a regular Revo STX I'm 7 1 ratio so
you<00:06:35.670> can<00:06:35.790> still<00:06:36.000> slow<00:06:36.210> roll<00:06:36.450> and<00:06:36.630> speed<00:06:36.990> it<00:06:37.110> up

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
you can still slow roll and speed it up

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.000 
you can still slow roll and speed it up
if<00:06:37.380> you<00:06:37.410> like<00:06:39.290> when<00:06:40.290> I'm<00:06:40.410> fishing<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.980> fish

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
if you like when I'm fishing the fish

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.360 
if you like when I'm fishing the fish
had<00:06:41.340> spin<00:06:41.670> I<00:06:41.970> also<00:06:42.480> like<00:06:42.890> to<00:06:43.890> twitch<00:06:44.130> it<00:06:44.310> a

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
had spin I also like to twitch it a

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.920 
had spin I also like to twitch it a
little<00:06:44.550> bit<00:06:44.730> so<00:06:44.970> it's<00:06:45.120> hopping<00:06:45.270> just<00:06:45.660> in<00:06:45.780> case

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
little bit so it's hopping just in case

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.550 
little bit so it's hopping just in case
the<00:06:46.080> fish

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
the fish

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.010
