thing is I'm gonna start like playing on
here<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.880> pro<00:01:51.509> MC<00:01:51.840> games<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.170> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
here more and that pro MC games I really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
here more and that pro MC games I really
like<00:01:52.530> their<00:01:52.710> server<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.520> they're<00:01:53.640> certain

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
like their server but they're certain

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
like their server but they're certain
keeps<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.210> down<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.840> because<00:01:54.990> they're

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
keeps going down I think because they're

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.039 
keeps going down I think because they're
like<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> smaller<00:01:56.640> ish<00:01:56.939> server<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.719> i'm<00:01:57.840> pretty

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
like a smaller ish server and i'm pretty

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.499 
like a smaller ish server and i'm pretty
sure<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.820> they're<00:01:59.820> just<00:01:59.850> trying<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.180> figure

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
sure that they're just trying to figure

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.609 
sure that they're just trying to figure
out<00:02:00.630> stuff<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.170> i<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.290> they're<00:02:01.469> trying

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
out stuff because i know they're trying

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.889 
out stuff because i know they're trying
to<00:02:01.649> fix<00:02:01.829> bugs<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> stuff<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:03.270> i<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.780> like

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
to fix bugs and stuff but i really like

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.209 
to fix bugs and stuff but i really like
that<00:02:04.049> server<00:02:04.290> i<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.560> that's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.799> good<00:02:04.829> server

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that server i think that's a good server

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.940 
that server i think that's a good server
to<00:02:05.759> play<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:07.110> i'll<00:02:07.200> probably<00:02:07.380> alternate

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to play on but i'll probably alternate

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
don't drop that i'll probably alternate

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.949 
don't drop that i'll probably alternate
between<00:02:11.970> those<00:02:12.239> two<00:02:12.360> because<00:02:12.540> i<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.780> like

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
that much just because sometimes they're

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.060 
that much just because sometimes they're

feel like I had to talk about this
because<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.680> important<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:45.270> it's

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
because it's really important and it's

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.300 
because it's really important and it's
been<00:02:45.690> affecting<00:02:46.110> me<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.320> lot<00:02:46.680> recently<00:02:46.920> and

been affecting me a lot recently and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.070 
been affecting me a lot recently and
that<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.460> don't<00:02:50.460> even<00:02:50.670> say<00:02:50.880> it<00:02:51.080> it's

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
that in it is a don't even say it it's

that in it is a don't even say it it's
practically<00:02:52.590> thing<00:02:53.250> called<00:02:53.459> food<00:02:53.790> it's<00:02:54.510> got<00:02:55.440> a

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
practically thing called food it's got a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.130 
practically thing called food it's got a
way<00:02:55.830> too<00:02:55.890> much<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.630> it's

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
way too much of it and it's a it's

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.440 
way too much of it and it's a it's
honestly<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.520> becoming<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.940> habit<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.300> mine

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
honestly it's becoming a habit of mine

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.480 
honestly it's becoming a habit of mine
to<00:03:00.600> eat<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:01.140> three<00:03:01.650> things<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.190> every<00:03:02.459> day

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
to eat like three things of it every day

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.000 
to eat like three things of it every day
and<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.480> honestly<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.200> good<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.709> me<00:03:04.830> I

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
and it's honestly not good for me I

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.949 
and it's honestly not good for me I
should<00:03:05.580> probably<00:03:05.700> cut<00:03:06.030> back<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
should probably cut back on it but I

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.430 
should probably cut back on it but I
don't<00:03:07.290> anyway<00:03:07.800> and<00:03:08.070> I<00:03:08.940> think<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:10.170> bad

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
don't anyway and I think it's really bad

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.120 
don't anyway and I think it's really bad
I<00:03:11.430> honestly<00:03:12.320> don't<00:03:13.320> even<00:03:13.440> like<00:03:13.650> talking<00:03:13.920> about

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
I honestly don't even like talking about

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
out here we gotta go find that beacon

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.480 
out here we gotta go find that beacon
those<00:04:57.160> supply<00:04:57.430> drops<00:04:57.700> are<00:04:57.850> loopy<00:04:58.740> wap<00:04:59.740> bay<00:05:00.070> and
