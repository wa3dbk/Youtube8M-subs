in<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.670> section<00:00:08.880> we're<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.330> talk

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
in this section we're going to talk

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.060 
in this section we're going to talk
about<00:00:09.750> smart<00:00:10.050> crates<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.679> we're<00:00:10.889> going<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
about smart crates and we're going to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.190 
about smart crates and we're going to
talk<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.370> how<00:00:11.670> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:12.030> use<00:00:12.059> these<00:00:12.450> to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
talk about how you can use these to

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.140 
talk about how you can use these to
organize<00:00:14.040> your<00:00:14.219> library<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.700> interesting

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
organize your library and interesting

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.609 
organize your library and interesting
ways<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:15.780> we're<00:00:15.900> also<00:00:16.080> going<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> talk<00:00:16.500> about

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
ways but we're also going to talk about

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.710 
ways but we're also going to talk about
how<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:16.980> can<00:00:17.190> use<00:00:17.400> these<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> tool<00:00:18.690> for

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
how you can use these as a tool for

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.269 
how you can use these as a tool for
discovering<00:00:19.350> music<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.859> your<00:00:19.949> Serato<00:00:20.189> DJ

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
discovering music and your Serato DJ

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.269 
discovering music and your Serato DJ
library<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.480> we've<00:00:21.720> got<00:00:21.920> three<00:00:22.920> three

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
library so we've got three three

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.240 
library so we've got three three
different<00:00:23.670> little<00:00:24.150> ways<00:00:24.269> we've<00:00:24.510> seen<00:00:24.720> our

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
different little ways we've seen our

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.380 
different little ways we've seen our
community<00:00:26.250> users<00:00:26.519> smart<00:00:26.939> create<00:00:27.119> some<00:00:27.269> really

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
community users smart create some really

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.609 
community users smart create some really
interesting<00:00:27.480> ways<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.470> share

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
interesting ways that we want to share

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.209 
interesting ways that we want to share
so<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> first<00:00:29.550> way<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.800> basically<00:00:31.800> sitting<00:00:32.099> up

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
so the first way is basically sitting up

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.979 
so the first way is basically sitting up
a<00:00:32.309> smart<00:00:32.579> crate<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.910> pull<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.239> recent<00:00:33.750> tracks

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
a smart crate to pull in recent tracks

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.780 
a smart crate to pull in recent tracks
you've<00:00:34.230> added<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.649> library<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.550> if

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
you've added to your library so if

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.459 
you've added to your library so if
you've<00:00:35.910> got<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> smart<00:00:36.329> great<00:00:36.540> setup<00:00:36.840> basically

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
you've got a smart great setup basically

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.410 
you've got a smart great setup basically
we've<00:00:37.770> got<00:00:37.800> some<00:00:38.100> setup<00:00:38.370> already<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.270> can

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
we've got some setup already but you can

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.940 
we've got some setup already but you can
easily<00:00:39.570> add<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:39.899> with<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.440> smart<00:00:40.710> create

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
easily add them with the smart create

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.069 
easily add them with the smart create
Add<00:00:41.160> button<00:00:41.190> which<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.790> up<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.540> then

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Add button which is up there and then

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
Add button which is up there and then
when<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:43.890> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.070> edit<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
when you do this we're going to edit now

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.580 
when you do this we're going to edit now
to<00:00:44.940> edit<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> smoke<00:00:45.600> rate<00:00:45.780> rule<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.200> it'll

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
to edit the smoke rate rule but it'll

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
to edit the smoke rate rule but it'll
bring<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.129> box<00:00:47.370> where<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.730> select

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
bring up this box where you can select

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
bring up this box where you can select
different<00:00:48.570> rules<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> smart<00:00:49.860> crate<00:00:50.129> will

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
different rules so a smart crate will

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
different rules so a smart crate will
basically<00:00:50.430> pull<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.210> tracks<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.660> your

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
basically pull in tracks from your

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.200 
basically pull in tracks from your
library<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.289> meet<00:00:52.500> any<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.920> criteria

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
library that meet any of these criteria

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.819 
library that meet any of these criteria
so<00:00:54.210> we've<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> setup<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.170> pull<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.500> tracks

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so we've got the setup to pull in tracks

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.299 
so we've got the setup to pull in tracks
that<00:00:55.920> were<00:00:56.010> added<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:57.180> after<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.559> date

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that were added and then after a date

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
that were added and then after a date
last<00:00:59.489> month<00:00:59.789> so<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.329> quickly<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.289> our

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
last month so we can quickly see in our

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.590 
last month so we can quickly see in our
library<00:01:01.890> everything<00:01:02.699> we've<00:01:02.879> added<00:01:03.059> since

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
library everything we've added since

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.320 
library everything we've added since
that<00:01:03.780> point<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.739> do<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
that point and we can do that

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.630 
that point and we can do that
retrospectively<00:01:06.380> as<00:01:07.380> well<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.369> find

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
retrospectively as well we can find

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.280 
retrospectively as well we can find
tracks<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.090> played<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.540> had<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.810> our<00:01:09.900> library<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
tracks we played we had in our library a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.190 
tracks we played we had in our library a
year<00:01:10.590> ago<00:01:10.799> between<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.310> year<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> two<00:01:12.180> years<00:01:12.510> so

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
year ago between a year and two years so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
year ago between a year and two years so
it's<00:01:13.409> an<00:01:13.500> interesting<00:01:13.680> way<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:13.979> maybe<00:01:14.490> not

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it's an interesting way of maybe not

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
it's an interesting way of maybe not
necessarily<00:01:15.350> for<00:01:16.350> organization<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.189> for

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
necessarily for organization but for

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
necessarily for organization but for
track<00:01:17.580> discovery<00:01:18.030> sometimes<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> figure

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
track discovery sometimes just to figure

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.359 
track discovery sometimes just to figure
out<00:01:19.259> what<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> were<00:01:19.710> playing<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> certain

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
out what you were playing at a certain

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.390 
out what you were playing at a certain
time<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.229> second<00:01:22.229> crate<00:01:23.100> we're<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
time the second crate we're going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.490 
time the second crate we're going to
look<00:01:23.549> at<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> creating<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:25.250> smart<00:01:26.250> crate<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
look at is creating a smart crate to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.560 
look at is creating a smart crate to
have<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> look<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.770> harmonic<00:01:29.189> mixing<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.090> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
have a look at harmonic mixing so if you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
have a look at harmonic mixing so if you
use<00:01:30.750> mixed<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.170> key<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> analyze<00:01:31.770> your<00:01:31.920> files

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
use mixed in key to analyze your files

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.859 
use mixed in key to analyze your files
and<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.299> used<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.290> camelot<00:01:35.159> system<00:01:35.579> of

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
and you used to the camelot system of

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.660 
and you used to the camelot system of
harmonic<00:01:36.869> mixing<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.799> have<00:01:38.130> certain<00:01:38.430> keys

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
harmonic mixing we have certain keys

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.240 
harmonic mixing we have certain keys
that<00:01:38.939> go<00:01:39.119> together<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:40.079> neighboring<00:01:41.040> keys

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
that go together with neighboring keys

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.870 
that go together with neighboring keys
and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:41.759> simply<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.659> semitone<00:01:42.930> up<00:01:43.880> there's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
and then simply one semitone up there's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.090 
and then simply one semitone up there's
different<00:01:45.240> rules<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:46.409> set<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.829> smart

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
different rules so we can set up a smart

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.310 
different rules so we can set up a smart
crate<00:01:47.369> that's<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.119> pull<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.960> for

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
crate that's going to pull in so for

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.429 
crate that's going to pull in so for
this<00:01:49.439> example<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:50.100> looking<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> is

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
this example we're looking at one a is

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
this example we're looking at one a is
being<00:01:52.710> our<00:01:52.829> base<00:01:53.009> key<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:54.000> we're<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.270> set

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
being our base key so we're going to set

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.590 
being our base key so we're going to set
up<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.630> crate<00:01:54.869> Det<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.030> mixed<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.420> key

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
up a crate Det so with mixed in key

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200 
up a crate Det so with mixed in key
we've<00:01:57.810> made<00:01:58.110> our<00:01:58.920> comment<00:01:59.369> field<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
we've made our comment field have the

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.480 
we've made our comment field have the
key<00:02:00.509> tag<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:02.009> writing<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.460> all

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
key tag in it so that's writing out all

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.039 
key tag in it so that's writing out all
the<00:02:02.790> key<00:02:02.939> information<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> comment<00:02:03.869> field

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the key information to the comment field

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.569 
the key information to the comment field
and<00:02:04.290> then<00:02:04.710> we're<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> set<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.369> rule

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and then we're going to set up a rule

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.900 
and then we're going to set up a rule
where<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.420> comment<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.990> 1a<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.550> we're

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
where the comment is 1a and then we're

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
where the comment is 1a and then we're
also<00:02:09.060> going<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.420> set<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.780> secondary<00:02:10.770> rules

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
also going to set up secondary rules

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.700 
also going to set up secondary rules
where<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.879> comments<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> 12

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
where the comments going to be to a 12

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.370 
where the comments going to be to a 12
in<00:02:13.800> 1b<00:02:14.250> which<00:02:14.940> neighboring<00:02:15.750> keys<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.230> will

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
in 1b which neighboring keys that will

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.110 
in 1b which neighboring keys that will
work<00:02:16.560> well<00:02:16.830> with<00:02:16.860> anything<00:02:17.370> at<00:02:17.580> 1a<00:02:17.760> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
work well with anything at 1a and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.880 
work well with anything at 1a and
they're<00:02:18.840> also<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.410> set<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.740> another

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
they're also going to set up another

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.310 
they're also going to set up another
rule<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.580> pull<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.330> tracks<00:02:21.510> at<00:02:21.660> 1/8<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> which

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
rule to pull and tracks at 1/8 a which

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.450 
rule to pull and tracks at 1/8 a which
is<00:02:22.470> 1<00:02:22.650> semitone<00:02:23.010> above<00:02:23.780> 1a<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.770> all<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.340> know

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
is 1 semitone above 1a so all we know

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490 
is 1 semitone above 1a so all we know
when<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.420> crate<00:02:27.690> everything<00:02:28.380> and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
when we have this crate everything and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.480 
when we have this crate everything and
that<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.710> going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> sound<00:02:29.130> pretty<00:02:29.250> good

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
that is going to sound pretty good

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.550 
that is going to sound pretty good
together<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.900> pull<00:02:31.110> in<00:02:31.140> all<00:02:31.380> of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
together so it's going to pull in all of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.400 
together so it's going to pull in all of
that<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.820> we<00:02:33.480> can<00:02:33.660> now<00:02:33.780> just<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> look

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
that and we can now just have a look

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.160 
that and we can now just have a look
through<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.830> find<00:02:35.040> songs<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.540> know<00:02:36.660> we

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
through and find songs that you know we

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.630 
through and find songs that you know we
might<00:02:37.350> not<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.560> known<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.250> work<00:02:38.460> well

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
might not have known that we work well

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.010 
might not have known that we work well
together<00:02:38.850> that<00:02:39.150> will<00:02:39.300> work<00:02:39.390> well<00:02:39.660> together<00:02:39.870> so

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
together that will work well together so

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.540 
together that will work well together so
it's<00:02:40.260> another<00:02:40.410> good<00:02:40.590> discovery<00:02:40.950> tool<00:02:41.310> in<00:02:41.490> your

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
it's another good discovery tool in your

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.820 
it's another good discovery tool in your
library<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.090> you've<00:02:42.210> got<00:02:42.330> tons<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.990> music<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
library if you've got tons of music and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
library if you've got tons of music and
you<00:02:43.890> don't<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> time<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.730> just

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
you don't have the time to actually just

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.420 
you don't have the time to actually just
go<00:02:45.810> through<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.200> next<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> find<00:02:47.160> those<00:02:47.310> good

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
go through and next to find those good

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.410 
go through and next to find those good
ones<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.410> final<00:02:49.970> smart<00:02:50.970> code<00:02:51.150> we'll<00:02:51.270> talk

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
ones and the final smart code we'll talk

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.440 
ones and the final smart code we'll talk
about<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.840> just<00:02:51.870> arranging<00:02:52.410> by<00:02:52.560> BPM<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.940> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
about is just arranging by BPM so you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.910 
about is just arranging by BPM so you
can<00:02:54.600> arrange<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:54.990> BPM<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.560> library

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
can arrange my BPM in the library

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.220 
can arrange my BPM in the library
already<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.850> by<00:02:56.970> sorting<00:02:57.360> by<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.570> BPM<00:02:57.990> field

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
already just by sorting by the BPM field

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.410 
already just by sorting by the BPM field
but<00:02:58.830> what<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.400> with<00:02:59.670> smart<00:03:00.060> crates<00:03:00.270> as

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
but what you can do with smart crates as

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.390 
but what you can do with smart crates as
you<00:03:00.540> can<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.960> ranges<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.070> can<00:03:02.220> make

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
you can see that ranges so you can make

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.300 
you can see that ranges so you can make
a<00:03:02.430> crate<00:03:02.850> with<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.780> your<00:03:03.960> tracks<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.560> are

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
a crate with all your tracks that are

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.460 
a crate with all your tracks that are
greater<00:03:05.640> than<00:03:05.730> or<00:03:05.910> equal<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.210> 60<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.720> less

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
greater than or equal to 60 and less

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
greater than or equal to 60 and less
than<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:07.740> equal<00:03:07.860> were<00:03:08.070> 70<00:03:08.550> so<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.210> can<00:03:09.330> access

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
than or equal were 70 so you can access

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.360 
than or equal were 70 so you can access
that<00:03:09.810> really<00:03:10.050> quickly<00:03:10.290> and<00:03:10.650> then<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.130> can

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that really quickly and then you can

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.730 
that really quickly and then you can
make<00:03:11.490> another<00:03:11.520> crate<00:03:12.120> with<00:03:12.990> tracks<00:03:13.530> between

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
make another crate with tracks between

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.860 
make another crate with tracks between
120<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.550> 140<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.210> you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.390> quickly<00:03:15.600> switch

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
120 and 140 so you can quickly switch

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.600 
120 and 140 so you can quickly switch
between<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.770> two<00:03:16.800> if<00:03:17.130> you're<00:03:17.250> doing<00:03:17.460> some

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
between the two if you're doing some

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.110 
between the two if you're doing some
halftime<00:03:18.030> doubles<00:03:18.390> home<00:03:18.560> mixes<00:03:19.940> that's<00:03:20.940> just

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
halftime doubles home mixes that's just

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.540 
halftime doubles home mixes that's just
a<00:03:21.210> really<00:03:21.420> handy<00:03:21.540> way<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.840> segmenting<00:03:22.650> bpms

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
a really handy way of segmenting bpms

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.670 
a really handy way of segmenting bpms
and<00:03:23.670> making<00:03:24.180> rules<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:25.290> have<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.560> keep

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and making rules so you have to keep
