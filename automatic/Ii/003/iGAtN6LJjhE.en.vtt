hello roll mythril here once again let's

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.530 
hello roll mythril here once again let's
see<00:00:05.400> if<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.580> can't<00:00:05.819> get<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> halfway<00:00:06.330> point

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
see if we can't get to the halfway point

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.790 
see if we can't get to the halfway point
here<00:00:06.950> time<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.069> go<00:00:08.160> after<00:00:08.280> wave<00:00:08.610> man<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.800> stage

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
here time to go after wave man a stage

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200 
here time to go after wave man a stage
I'm<00:00:11.040> worrying<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.519> for<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.030> particular

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
I'm worrying about for one particular

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.150 
I'm worrying about for one particular
reason<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.080> one<00:00:13.530> only<00:00:13.920> really<00:00:15.740> the<00:00:16.740> wave<00:00:16.920> man

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
reason and one only really the wave man

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.830 
reason and one only really the wave man
himself<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.640> pretty<00:00:17.850> tricky<00:00:18.150> too<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.539> that's

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
himself is pretty tricky too but that's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.849 
himself is pretty tricky too but that's
not<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> problem<00:00:20.810> okay<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.650> new

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
not the problem okay here we have a new

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.470 
not the problem okay here we have a new
trap<00:00:23.130> type<00:00:23.400> pendulum<00:00:24.060> press<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.600> also<00:00:25.140> gas

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
trap type pendulum press and also gas

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.580 
trap type pendulum press and also gas
once<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> stand<00:00:27.930> next<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.380> these

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
once you stand next to one of these

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.980 
once you stand next to one of these
cracks<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> walls<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.240> gas<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.750> erupt

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
cracks in the walls the gas will erupt

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.319 
cracks in the walls the gas will erupt
from<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.579> point<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.969> basically

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
from it at that point it's basically

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
from it at that point it's basically
just<00:00:33.420> timing<00:00:33.809> getting<00:00:34.140> past<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:34.800> no<00:00:35.070> real

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
just timing getting past it but no real

problem the pendulum presses of course
cannot<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.739> damaged<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:42.680> can't<00:00:43.680> tell<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.920> how

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
cannot be damaged I can't tell you how

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.729 
cannot be damaged I can't tell you how
many<00:00:44.100> times<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.670> failed<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> notice<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.739> gas

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
many times I failed to notice that gas

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.990 
many times I failed to notice that gas
guys<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.219> there<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.640> gone<00:00:47.789> right<00:00:47.940> for

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
guys are there and just gone right for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.420 
guys are there and just gone right for
the<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.329> up<00:00:48.590> cogs<00:00:49.590> are<00:00:49.739> back<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:49.920> don't<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.219> I

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the one up cogs are back I don't think I

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.250 
the one up cogs are back I don't think I
demonstrated<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.149> last<00:00:51.360> time<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> cannot

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
demonstrated it last time but you cannot

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.700 
demonstrated it last time but you cannot
hurt<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.160> Mega<00:00:53.370> Buster<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.500> they

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
hurt them with the Mega Buster so they

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.490 
hurt them with the Mega Buster so they
too<00:00:55.770> were<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.430> timing

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000 

so<00:01:05.130> now<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> ride<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.940> bubbles

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
so now we have to ride these bubbles

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.520 
so now we have to ride these bubbles
quite<00:01:08.010> amusingly<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.020> setup<00:01:10.020> pretty<00:01:10.350> much

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
quite amusingly this setup pretty much

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.430 
quite amusingly this setup pretty much
in<00:01:10.680> its<00:01:10.830> entirety<00:01:11.460> would<00:01:12.390> reappear<00:01:12.780> later<00:01:13.200> in

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
in its entirety would reappear later in

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.830 
in its entirety would reappear later in
splash<00:01:13.770> woman's<00:01:14.190> stage<00:01:14.550> except<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
splash woman's stage except there the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.600 
splash woman's stage except there the
entire<00:01:16.110> thing<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.500> submerged<00:01:16.980> under<00:01:17.370> water

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
entire thing is submerged under water

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.350 
entire thing is submerged under water
and<00:01:18.020> also<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.230> have<00:01:19.440> to<00:01:19.470> worry<00:01:19.740> about<00:01:19.940> I'm<00:01:20.940> not

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and also you have to worry about I'm not

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.490 
and also you have to worry about I'm not
sure<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.720> they're<00:01:21.870> called<00:01:22.080> right<00:01:22.200> at<00:01:22.410> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
sure what they're called right at the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.170 
sure what they're called right at the
moment<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.830> these<00:01:23.070> torpedo<00:01:23.520> fish<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.090> would

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
moment but these torpedo fish that would

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600 
moment but these torpedo fish that would
just<00:01:24.420> blast<00:01:25.260> through<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> sides<00:01:26.160> that

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
just blast through from the sides that

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
just blast through from the sides that
made<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.940> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.180> trickier<00:01:28.850> also<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
made it a little trickier also for a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.730 
made it a little trickier also for a
water<00:01:30.270> stage<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.930> place<00:01:31.140> doesn't<00:01:31.350> have<00:01:31.530> too

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
water stage this place doesn't have too

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.950 
water stage this place doesn't have too
many<00:01:31.950> dead<00:01:32.190> spikes<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.480> water<00:01:33.660> stage

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
many dead spikes also for a water stage

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.070 
many dead spikes also for a water stage
there's<00:01:34.260> an<00:01:34.410> amazing<00:01:34.620> lack<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.430> water<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
there's an amazing lack of water and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.109 
there's an amazing lack of water and
water<00:01:37.080> physics<00:01:37.410> aren't<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.190> at<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.729> guess

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
water physics aren't here at all I guess

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.570 
water physics aren't here at all I guess
Starman<00:01:40.020> took<00:01:40.260> em<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.130> here's<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> part

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
Starman took em all and here's the part

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.109 
Starman took em all and here's the part
of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.760> stage<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.180> hate<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.110> jetski<00:01:43.440> section

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
of the stage I hate the jetski section

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.050 
of the stage I hate the jetski section
okay<00:01:45.119> these<00:01:45.360> are<00:01:45.680> V's<00:01:46.680> or<00:01:47.070> boys<00:01:47.369> however

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
okay these are V's or boys however

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700 
okay these are V's or boys however
you're<00:01:48.150> supposed<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> pronounce<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.960> best<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you're supposed to pronounce it best to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
you're supposed to pronounce it best to
just<00:01:49.740> jump<00:01:50.070> over<00:01:50.250> them<00:01:50.520> there<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.910> get<00:01:51.150> their

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
just jump over them there to get their

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.530 
just jump over them there to get their
durable<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.140> kill<00:01:52.560> them<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.040> no<00:01:54.000> real

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
durable you can kill them but no real

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
durable you can kill them but no real
not<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.500> point<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:55.920> also<00:01:56.580> we

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
not really much of a point to it also we

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.160 
not really much of a point to it also we
have<00:01:57.150> to<00:01:57.270> worry<00:01:57.420> about<00:01:57.540> rider<00:01:57.990> joes<00:01:58.470> and

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
have to worry about rider joes and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.310 
have to worry about rider joes and
dolphins

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
dolphins

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.430 
dolphins
I<00:02:02.180> kept<00:02:03.180> thinking<00:02:03.300> those<00:02:03.660> were<00:02:03.810> fish<00:02:04.020> until<00:02:04.380> I

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
I kept thinking those were fish until I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.340 
I kept thinking those were fish until I
looked<00:02:04.650> it<00:02:04.770> up<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:09.149> all<00:02:09.300> adds<00:02:09.750> together<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
looked it up it all adds together to

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.240 
three but not a two go figure
with<00:04:31.800> us<00:04:31.980> given<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.610> water<00:04:33.000> wave<00:04:33.270> a

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
with us given the water wave a

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.280 
with us given the water wave a
ground-based<00:04:35.250> attack<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:35.910> makes<00:04:36.290> sweeping

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
ground-based attack that makes sweeping

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.720 
ground-based attack that makes sweeping
waves<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.710> water<00:04:37.890> which<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.190> actually<00:04:38.520> pretty

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
waves of water which is actually pretty

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.990 
waves of water which is actually pretty
useful<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.770> think<00:04:40.980> gets<00:04:41.190> three<00:04:41.460> hits<00:04:41.640> before

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
useful it I think gets three hits before

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.340 
useful it I think gets three hits before
it<00:04:42.090> dissipates<00:04:42.540> pretty<00:04:42.810> nice<00:04:44.990> ok<00:04:45.990> with<00:04:46.320> that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
it dissipates pretty nice ok with that

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.480 
it dissipates pretty nice ok with that
we've<00:04:46.740> reached<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.130> halfway<00:04:47.160> point

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
we've reached the halfway point

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.240 
we've reached the halfway point
thankfully<00:04:48.860> four<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:49.980> go<00:04:50.840> yeah<00:04:52.040> from<00:04:53.040> what<00:04:53.190> I

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 
get wave man a six out of ten

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.620 
get wave man a six out of ten
mainly<00:07:08.100> that's<00:07:08.250> due<00:07:08.520> to<00:07:08.640> the<00:07:08.669> jetski<00:07:09.090> portion

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
mainly that's due to the jetski portion

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.600 
mainly that's due to the jetski portion
of<00:07:09.750> his<00:07:09.870> stage<00:07:10.140> even<00:07:10.950> if<00:07:11.100> you<00:07:11.220> really<00:07:11.460> know

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
of his stage even if you really know

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.130 
of his stage even if you really know
where<00:07:11.850> to<00:07:11.880> position<00:07:12.390> yourself<00:07:12.750> to<00:07:12.810> have<00:07:12.990> the

where to position yourself to have the
easiest<00:07:13.410> time<00:07:13.710> that's<00:07:13.950> still<00:07:14.160> a<00:07:14.190> pain<00:07:14.460> in<00:07:14.580> the

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
easiest time that's still a pain in the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.730 
easiest time that's still a pain in the
tail<00:07:14.880> as<00:07:15.120> you<00:07:15.780> can<00:07:15.930> see<00:07:16.110> those<00:07:16.290> two<00:07:16.500> dolphins

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
tail as you can see those two dolphins

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.830 
tail as you can see those two dolphins
toward<00:07:17.250> the<00:07:17.340> end<00:07:17.490> they<00:07:17.700> still<00:07:17.940> almost<00:07:18.330> puts<00:07:18.630> me

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
toward the end they still almost puts me

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.380 
toward the end they still almost puts me
I<00:07:19.169> just<00:07:20.070> I<00:07:20.250> couldn't<00:07:20.520> get<00:07:20.669> a<00:07:20.700> good<00:07:20.850> beat<00:07:21.090> on<00:07:21.240> him

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:21.390 
I just I couldn't get a good beat on him

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:22.909 
I just I couldn't get a good beat on him
and<00:07:21.480> shoot<00:07:21.690> him<00:07:21.720> down<00:07:22.020> so<00:07:22.350> I<00:07:22.380> had<00:07:22.650> to<00:07:22.770> dodge

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
and shoot him down so I had to dodge

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.300 
and shoot him down so I had to dodge
between<00:07:23.370> them<00:07:23.630> wave<00:07:24.630> men<00:07:24.930> himself<00:07:25.440> he<00:07:25.950> isn't

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
between them wave men himself he isn't

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.700 
between them wave men himself he isn't
that<00:07:26.460> big<00:07:26.610> a<00:07:26.669> problem<00:07:26.940> if<00:07:27.240> you<00:07:27.390> don't<00:07:27.540> panic<00:07:28.140> if

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710 
that big a problem if you don't panic if

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.740 
that big a problem if you don't panic if
you<00:07:28.860> do<00:07:29.010> panic<00:07:29.460> he<00:07:29.669> will<00:07:29.820> sometimes<00:07:30.360> fell

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:30.750 
you do panic he will sometimes fell

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.750 
you do panic he will sometimes fell
through<00:07:30.990> water<00:07:31.530> wave<00:07:31.800> up<00:07:32.010> right<00:07:32.280> under<00:07:32.610> you

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:32.760 
through water wave up right under you

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.219 
through water wave up right under you
where<00:07:33.030> you<00:07:33.120> don't<00:07:33.240> have<00:07:33.450> time<00:07:33.660> to<00:07:33.810> dodge<00:07:34.020> it

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229 
where you don't have time to dodge it

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.300 
where you don't have time to dodge it
but<00:07:34.580> normally<00:07:35.580> it<00:07:35.940> isn't<00:07:36.300> that<00:07:36.330> bad

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:37.310 
but normally it isn't that bad

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.680 
but normally it isn't that bad
fighting<00:07:38.310> him<00:07:38.520> like<00:07:38.850> pretty<00:07:39.090> much<00:07:39.150> most<00:07:39.540> of

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:39.690 
fighting him like pretty much most of

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.710 
fighting him like pretty much most of
his<00:07:39.840> stage<00:07:40.050> is<00:07:40.229> all<00:07:40.350> about<00:07:40.560> timing<00:07:40.890> really

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 
his stage is all about timing really

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.180 
his stage is all about timing really
other<00:07:42.720> than<00:07:42.870> the<00:07:43.080> jetski<00:07:43.410> portion<00:07:43.890> I<00:07:43.979> think

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:44.190 
other than the jetski portion I think

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.890 
other than the jetski portion I think
the<00:07:44.340> only<00:07:44.580> enemy<00:07:44.880> that<00:07:44.910> you<00:07:45.060> really<00:07:45.360> were<00:07:45.720> able

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 
the only enemy that you really were able

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.630 
the only enemy that you really were able
to<00:07:46.080> fight<00:07:46.350> is<00:07:46.530> that<00:07:46.680> twin<00:07:46.979> cannon<00:07:47.370> right<00:07:47.490> in

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:47.640 
to fight is that twin cannon right in

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.250 
to fight is that twin cannon right in
front<00:07:47.790> of<00:07:47.880> a<00:07:48.000> Germans<00:07:48.330> gate<00:07:48.630> but<00:07:48.870> that's<00:07:49.050> about

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:49.260 
front of a Germans gate but that's about

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:49.610 
front of a Germans gate but that's about
it

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:49.620 
it

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.710 
it
the<00:07:50.310> rest<00:07:50.490> of<00:07:50.640> its<00:07:50.790> just<00:07:50.880> pretty<00:07:51.270> easy<00:07:51.479> to

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:51.720 
the rest of its just pretty easy to

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.590 
the rest of its just pretty easy to
dodge<00:07:51.870> traps<00:07:52.520> the<00:07:53.520> jetski<00:07:53.880> portion<00:07:54.330> that's

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:54.600 
dodge traps the jetski portion that's

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.390 
dodge traps the jetski portion that's
what<00:07:54.810> really<00:07:54.990> pushes<00:07:55.290> up<00:07:55.560> the<00:07:55.590> difficulty<00:07:56.280> on

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 
what really pushes up the difficulty on

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.670 
what really pushes up the difficulty on
that<00:07:56.430> one<00:07:56.790> it's<00:07:57.510> a<00:07:57.600> pretty<00:07:57.810> frantic<00:07:58.140> area

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 
that one it's a pretty frantic area

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.950 
that one it's a pretty frantic area
really

00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960
