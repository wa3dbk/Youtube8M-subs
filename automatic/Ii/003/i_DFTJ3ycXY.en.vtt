video walkthrough this is the boss fight
with<00:00:22.420> copperhead<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:24.010> a<00:00:24.160> tricky<00:00:24.460> one

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
with copperhead it's a tricky one

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.580 
with copperhead it's a tricky one
because<00:00:24.939> if<00:00:25.630> you're<00:00:25.840> going<00:00:25.960> to<00:00:26.080> be<00:00:26.140> using<00:00:26.290> the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
because if you're going to be using the

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.170 
because if you're going to be using the
counters<00:00:26.980> which<00:00:27.220> is<00:00:27.400> sometimes<00:00:27.610> the<00:00:27.939> only<00:00:28.060> way

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
counters which is sometimes the only way

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.170 
counters which is sometimes the only way
to<00:00:28.300> stop<00:00:28.570> taking<00:00:28.840> damage<00:00:29.579> it's<00:00:30.579> really<00:00:30.910> hard

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
to stop taking damage it's really hard

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.670 
to stop taking damage it's really hard
to<00:00:31.300> see<00:00:31.480> because<00:00:31.630> of<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.900> visual<00:00:32.169> effect<00:00:32.500> that

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
to see because of the visual effect that

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.819 
to see because of the visual effect that
happens<00:00:33.040> on<00:00:33.220> the<00:00:33.340> clones<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.970> copperhead<00:00:34.829> but

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
happens on the clones of copperhead but

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:36.960 
happens on the clones of copperhead but
you're<00:00:35.950> gonna<00:00:36.040> see<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.310> good<00:00:36.489> example<00:00:36.880> of<00:00:36.910> that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
you're gonna see a good example of that

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.290 
you're gonna see a good example of that
in<00:00:37.239> a<00:00:37.300> moment<00:00:37.420> when<00:00:37.750> we<00:00:37.960> start<00:00:38.200> fighting<00:00:38.970> so<00:00:39.970> I

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
in a moment when we start fighting so I

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.660 
in a moment when we start fighting so I
tried<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.140> out<00:00:41.380> striker<00:00:41.739> I<00:00:41.920> tried<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.310> find<00:00:42.520> the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
tried to out striker I tried to find the

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.640 
tried to out striker I tried to find the
clone<00:00:42.970> and<00:00:43.210> then<00:00:43.300> beat<00:00:43.540> her<00:00:43.690> up<00:00:43.900> while<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
clone and then beat her up while the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.290 
clone and then beat her up while the
clothes<00:00:44.860> were<00:00:45.040> still<00:00:45.190> intact<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:45.700> tried<00:00:46.000> a<00:00:46.030> lot

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
clothes were still intact I tried a lot

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000 
clothes were still intact I tried a lot
of<00:00:46.390> things<00:00:46.570> none<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.260> them<00:00:47.380> worked<00:00:47.590> that<00:00:47.830> well

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
of things none of them worked that well

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.810 
of things none of them worked that well
so<00:00:48.280> instead<00:00:48.580> I<00:00:48.820> use<00:00:49.120> explosive<00:00:50.020> gel<00:00:50.290> a<00:00:50.470> lot<00:00:50.860> so

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
so instead I use explosive gel a lot so

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.210 
so instead I use explosive gel a lot so
the<00:00:51.910> strategy<00:00:52.120> is<00:00:52.420> pretty<00:00:52.630> simple<00:00:52.870> just<00:00:53.220> spam

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
the strategy is pretty simple just spam

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.340 
the strategy is pretty simple just spam
the<00:00:54.250> explosive<00:00:54.940> gel<00:00:55.210> it's<00:00:55.690> gonna<00:00:55.930> get<00:00:56.110> rid<00:00:56.320> of

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
the explosive gel it's gonna get rid of

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.530 
the explosive gel it's gonna get rid of
the<00:00:56.680> clones<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.370> knock<00:00:57.760> them<00:00:57.970> out<00:00:58.120> for<00:00:58.390> good

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
the clones and knock them out for good

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.420 
the clones and knock them out for good
it's<00:00:59.080> gonna<00:00:59.260> eventually<00:00:59.470> get<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.040> down<00:01:00.250> to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
it's gonna eventually get you down to

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.730 
it's gonna eventually get you down to
just<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:01.180> Copperhead<00:01:01.720> and<00:01:01.870> if<00:01:02.470> you<00:01:02.560> hit

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
just you and Copperhead and if you hit

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.049 
just you and Copperhead and if you hit
Copperhead<00:01:03.190> with<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.490> it's<00:01:03.610> going<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.790> stun

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
Copperhead with it it's going to stun

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
Copperhead with it it's going to stun
her<00:01:04.239> so<00:01:04.390> it'll<00:01:04.600> stop<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.960> from<00:01:05.049> doing<00:01:05.110> anything

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
her so it'll stop it from doing anything

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.530 
her so it'll stop it from doing anything
what<00:01:06.549> you<00:01:06.610> want<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:06.850> do<00:01:06.939> is<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.090> want<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.360> try

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
what you want to do is you want to try

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.749 
what you want to do is you want to try
and<00:01:07.689> get<00:01:07.810> Copperhead<00:01:08.290> into<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:08.799> state<00:01:09.520> of

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
and get Copperhead into a state of

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.630 
and get Copperhead into a state of
constant<00:01:10.060> stun<00:01:10.930> while<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.710> dwindle<00:01:12.189> away<00:01:12.280> all

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
constant stun while you dwindle away all

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.130 
constant stun while you dwindle away all
the<00:01:12.790> clones<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.329> then<00:01:13.659> when<00:01:13.780> it's<00:01:13.869> just<00:01:13.990> you

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
the clones and then when it's just you

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.080 
the clones and then when it's just you
and<00:01:14.320> her<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.950> can<00:01:15.100> feel<00:01:15.280> free<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.610> beat<00:01:15.790> her<00:01:15.909> up

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
and her you can feel free to beat her up

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.270 
and her you can feel free to beat her up
and<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.659> cool<00:01:16.840> thing<00:01:16.870> is<00:01:17.050> every<00:01:17.830> time<00:01:18.010> you<00:01:18.130> hit

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
and the cool thing is every time you hit

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.800 
and the cool thing is every time you hit
her<00:01:18.430> with<00:01:18.640> the<00:01:18.670> gel<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.210> takes<00:01:19.510> a<00:01:19.600> little<00:01:19.690> bit

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
her with the gel it takes a little bit

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.170 
her with the gel it takes a little bit
of<00:01:19.870> life<00:01:20.080> off<00:01:20.350> so<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:21.790> know<00:01:21.880> it's<00:01:22.030> not<00:01:22.120> like

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
of life off so you know it's not like

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.610 
of life off so you know it's not like
you're<00:01:22.420> just<00:01:22.540> wasting<00:01:22.930> time<00:01:22.960> getting<00:01:23.470> rid<00:01:23.500> of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
you're just wasting time getting rid of

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.220 
you're just wasting time getting rid of
the<00:01:23.710> clones<00:01:24.010> it<00:01:24.250> just<00:01:24.430> makes<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.700> much<00:01:24.850> safer

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
the clones it just makes it much safer

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.719 
the clones it just makes it much safer
and<00:01:26.230> you'll<00:01:26.860> notice<00:01:27.040> I<00:01:27.250> did<00:01:27.400> take<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:27.550> little

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
and you'll notice I did take a little

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.880 
and you'll notice I did take a little
bit<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.909> damage<00:01:28.090> off<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.540> clones<00:01:28.780> but<00:01:29.440> it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
bit of damage off the clones but it's

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.410 
bit of damage off the clones but it's
not<00:01:30.100> near<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.490> same<00:01:30.670> amount<00:01:30.909> of<00:01:30.940> damage<00:01:31.270> your

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
not near the same amount of damage your

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.270 
not near the same amount of damage your
tick<00:01:31.690> if<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:31.990> try<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.260> fight<00:01:32.950> them<00:01:32.979> all

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
tick if you try to fight them all

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.130 
tick if you try to fight them all
head-on<00:01:33.700> unless<00:01:34.060> you're<00:01:34.270> extremely<00:01:34.360> good<00:01:34.930> and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
head-on unless you're extremely good and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.440 
head-on unless you're extremely good and
you<00:01:35.590> know<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:35.979> tells<00:01:36.190> that<00:01:36.400> went<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:37.000> counter

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
you know the tells that went to counter

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.660 
you know the tells that went to counter
which<00:01:37.630> as<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:37.900> can<00:01:37.930> see<00:01:38.310> Batman's<00:01:39.310> visions

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
which as you can see Batman's visions

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.370 
which as you can see Batman's visions
not<00:01:39.909> great<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:40.510> really<00:01:40.690> washy<00:01:41.080> and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
not great and it's really washy and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.350 
not great and it's really washy and
almost<00:01:41.620> Gaussian<00:01:42.250> blur<00:01:42.400> at<00:01:42.729> time<00:01:42.970> so<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.270> can

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
almost Gaussian blur at time so it can

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.730 
almost Gaussian blur at time so it can
be<00:01:43.420> very<00:01:43.479> challenging<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:44.320> see<00:01:44.470> what<00:01:44.620> they're

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
be very challenging to see what they're

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
into the beatdown mode so i can do some

and i think i forgot

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.920 
and i think i forgot
I<00:02:19.160> think<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.880> final<00:02:20.270> fairs<00:02:20.570> where

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
I think this is the final fairs where

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.870 
I think this is the final fairs where
she<00:02:21.590> vanishes<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.130> as<00:02:22.220> soon<00:02:22.340> as<00:02:22.460> she<00:02:22.580> makes<00:02:22.730> a

looks<00:02:57.560> all<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:58.010> impressive<00:02:58.400> and<00:03:00.010> I'd<00:03:01.010> be

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
looks all that impressive and I'd be

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.190 
looks all that impressive and I'd be
curious<00:03:01.310> to<00:03:01.520> see<00:03:01.730> what<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> batman<00:03:02.720> game<00:03:02.900> looked

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
curious to see what a batman game looked

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.230 
curious to see what a batman game looked
like<00:03:03.380> if<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.520> took<00:03:04.670> half<00:03:04.910> your<00:03:04.940> life

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
like if you know it took half your life

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.240 
like if you know it took half your life
off<00:03:05.450> because<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.380> had<00:03:06.470> definitely<00:03:06.830> teach<00:03:07.100> you

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
off because it had definitely teach you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.100 
off because it had definitely teach you
not<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.400> ever<00:03:07.760> fuck<00:03:08.300> up<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> event<00:03:08.840> on<00:03:08.930> that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
not to ever fuck up the event on that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.340 
not to ever fuck up the event on that
attack<00:03:09.820> else<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.000> game<00:03:11.180> over<00:03:11.210> but<00:03:12.170> then<00:03:12.320> I

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
attack else it's game over but then I

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.570 
attack else it's game over but then I
think<00:03:12.620> they<00:03:12.680> would<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:12.980> check<00:03:13.280> point<00:03:13.490> the

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
think they would have to check point the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.370 
think they would have to check point the
fight<00:03:13.820> better<00:03:14.030> because<00:03:14.300> if<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.510> die<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:15.110> it

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
fight better because if you die here it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.290 
fight better because if you die here it
doesn't<00:03:15.740> restart<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.220> from<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.550> this<00:03:16.910> last

doesn't restart you from this this last

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.730 
doesn't restart you from this this last
phase<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.840> restarts<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.350> from<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> very

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
phase it restarts you from the very
