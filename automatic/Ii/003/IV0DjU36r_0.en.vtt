00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.990
 a pleasure to greet you back into 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.530
 the basic pastry techniques 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.330
 I present the preparation of pasta and mushrooms 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.600
 this recipe goes with special dedication 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.360
 for lizbeth hernandez will launch 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.010
 subscriber number 100 of my channel in a 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.539
 bowl of the blender place the 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.539
 margarine and butter 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.100
 we will beat to cream at high speed 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.100
 for 5 minutes 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.670
 After this time we went down the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.520
 speed and we started to incorporate that 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.010
 the sugar little by little 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.460
 we increase the speed of the blender 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.930
 to the maximum and we continue creating during 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.930
 5 more minutes 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:54.559
 we turn off and it is important that with the 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.219
 help from a spatula let's get down from the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.500
 sides of the bowl to allow it to be 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.150
 believe me perfectly the butter 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.020
 margarine and sugar 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.980
 while they are burning, we serve the flour 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.340
 we continue beating 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.570
 at medium speed and we incorporate the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.479
 eggs one to one 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.750
 likewise we incorporate the two 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.930
 teaspoons of vanilla we increase the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.680
 speed and we will beat for 10 minutes 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.680
 plus 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.350
 remember that it is important to lower the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.350
 side of the bowl from time to time 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.510
 here we appreciate how creamy 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.840
 our preparation 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.190
 after 20 minutes we have cremated 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.620
 the ingredients clean the shovel well 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.920
 we incorporate the flour and with the help of 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.250
 a spatula we will mix gently in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.100
 enveloping form to incorporate the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.810
 flour to the rest of the ingredients to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.290
 get a soft paste do not beat more than 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.380
 one minute we put the pasta in a 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.980
 manga with duya and we started to form 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:19.260
 pills if you like they can place a 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:22.090
 piece of walnut we take to oven to 180 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.810
 degrees centigrade for 10 minutes 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.960
 approximately we can give different 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.320
 forms to the pills using the 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.080
 manga and duya I do not recommend doing more than 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.480
 the amount indicated by the recipe 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.020
 the little piles if they are not baked 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.190
 immediately they will be hard I hope that 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.190
 this recipe is to your liking
